                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2012), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

  Subpart A_National Environmental Policy Act_Regulations Implementing 
                             Section 102(2)


<R05>
Sec. 51.10  Purpose and scope of subpart; application of regulations
of Council on Environmental Quality.

    (a) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA) 
directs that, to the fullest extent possible: (1) The policies, 
regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted 
and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in NEPA, and 
(2) all agencies of the Federal Government shall comply with the 
procedures in section 102(2) of NEPA except where compliance would be 
inconsistent with other statutory requirements. The regulations in this 
subpart implement section 102(2) of NEPA in a manner which is consistent 
with the NRC's domestic licensing and related regulatory authority under 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act 
of 1974, as amended, and the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act 
of 1978, and which reflects the Commission's announced policy to take 
account of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality 
published November 29, 1978 (43 FR 55978-56007) voluntarily, subject to 
certain conditions. This subpart does not apply to export licensing 
matters within the scope of part 110 of this chapter nor does it apply 
to any environmental effects which NRC's domestic licensing and related 
regulatory functions may have upon the environment of foreign nations.
    (b) The Commission recognizes a continuing obligation to conduct its 
domestic licensing and related regulatory functions in a manner which is 
both receptive to environmental concerns and consistent with the 
Commission's responsibility as an independent regulatory agency for 
protecting the radiological health and safety of the public. 
Accordingly, the Commission will:
    (1) Examine any future interpretation or change to the Council's 
NEPA regulations;
    (2) Follow the provisions of 40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6 relating to 
lead agencies and cooperating agencies, except that the Commission 
reserves the right to prepare an independent environmental impact 
statement whenever the NRC has regulatory jurisdiction over an acitivity 
even though the NRC has not been designated as lead agency for 
preparation of the statement; and
    (3) Reserve the right to make a final decision on any matter within 
the NRC's regulatory authority even though another agency has made a 
predecisional referral of an NRC action to the Council under the 
procedures of 40 CFR part 1504.
    (c) The regulations in this subpart \1\ also address the limitations 
imposed on NRC's authority and responsibility under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, by the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92-500, 86 Stat. 816 
et seq. (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) In accordance with section 511(c)(2) of 
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (86 Stat. 893, 33 U.S.C 
1371(c)(2)) the NRC recognizes that responsibility for Federal 
regulation of nonradiological pollutant discharges \2\ into receiving 
waters rests by statute with the Environmental Protection Agency.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the regulations in 
this subpart shall apply to the fullest extent practicable to NRC's 
ongoing environmental work.
    (b) No environmental report or any supplement to an environmental 
report filed with the NRC and no environmental assessment, environmental 
impact statement or finding of no significant impact or any supplement 
to any of the foregoing issued by the NRC before June 7, 1984, need be 
redone and no notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact 
statement or notice of availability of these environmental documents 
need be republished solely by reason of the promulgation on March 12, 
1984, of this revision of part 51.

Sec. 51.13  Emergencies.

    Whenever emergency circumstances make it necessary and whenever, in 
other situations, the health and safety of the public may be adversely 
affected if mitigative or remedial actions are delayed, the Commission 
may take an action with significant environmental impact without 
observing the provisions of these regulations. In taking an action 
covered by this section, the Commission will consult with the Council as 
soon as feasible concerning appropriate alternative NEPA arrangements.


<R05>
Sec. 51.14  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this subpart:
    Categorical Exclusion means a category of actions which do not 
individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human 
environment and which the Commission has found to have no such effect in 
accordance with procedures set out in Sec. 51.22, and for which, 
therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental 
impact statement is required.
    Cooperating Agency means any Federal agency other than the NRC which 
has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any 
environmental impact involved in a proposal (or a reasonable 
alternative) for legislation or other major Federal action significantly 
affecting the quality of the human environment. By agreement with the 
Commission, a State or local agency of similar qualifications or, when 
the effects are on a reservation, an Indian Tribe, may become a 
cooperating agency.
    Council means the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) established 
by Title II of NEPA.
    DOE means the U.S. Department of Energy or its duly authorized 
representatives.
    Environmental Assessment means a concise public document for which 
the Commission is responsible that serves to:
    (1) Briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining 
whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no 
significant impact.
    (2) Aid the Commission's compliance with NEPA when no environmental 
impact statement is necessary.
    (3) Facilitate preparation of an environmental impact statement when 
one is necessary.
    Environmental document includes an environmental assessment, an 
environmental impact statement, a finding of no significant impact, an 
environmental report and any supplements to or comments upon those 
documents, and a notice of intent.
    Environmental Impact Statement means a detailed written statement as 
required by section 102(2)(C) of NEPA.
    Environmental report means a document submitted to the Commission by

[[Page 11]]

an applicant for a permit, license, or other form of permission, or an 
amendment to or renewal of a permit, license or other form of 
permission, or by a petitioner for rulemaking, in order to aid the 
Commission in complying with section 102(2) of NEPA.
    Finding of No Significant Impact means a concise public document for 
which the Commission is responsible that briefly states the reasons why 
an action, not otherwise excluded, will not have a significant effect on 
the human environment and for which therefore an environmental impact 
statement will not be prepared.
    NEPA means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended 
(Pub. L. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852, 856, as amended by Pub. L. 94-83, 89 
Stat. 424, 42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.).
    Notice of Intent means a notice that an environmental impact 
statement will be prepared and considered.
    Uranium enrichment facility means:
    (1) Any facility used for separating the isotopes for uranium or 
enriching uranium in the isotope 235, except laboratory scale facilities 
designed or used for experimental or analytical purposes only; or
    (2) Any equipment or device, or important component part especially 
designed for such equipment or device, capable of separating the 
isotopes of uranium or enriching uranium in the isotope 235.
    (b) The definitions in 40 CFR 1508.3, 1508.7, 1508.8, 1508.14, 
1508.15, 1508.16, 1508.17, 1508.18, 1508.20, 1508.23, 1508.25, 1508.26, 
and 1508.27, will also be used in implementing section 102(2) of NEPA.

Sec. 51.15  Time schedules.

    Consistent with the purposes of NEPA, the Administrative Procedure 
Act, the Commission's rules of practice in part 2 of this chapter, 
Sec. Sec. 51.100 and 51.101, and with other essential considerations of 
national policy:
    (a) The appropriate NRC staff director may, and upon the request of 
an applicant for a proposed action or a petitioner for rulemaking shall, 
establish a time schedule for all or any constituent part of the NRC 
staff NEPA process. To the maximum extent practicable, the NRC staff 
will conduct its NEPA review in accordance with any time schedule 
established under this section.
    (b) As specified in 10 CFR part 2, the presiding officer, the Atomic 
Safety and Licensing Board or the Commissioners acting as a collegial 
body may establish a time schedule for all or any part of an 
adjudicatory or rulemaking proceeding to the extent that each has 
jurisdiction.

<R05>
Sec. 51.23  Temporary storage of spent fuel after cessation of reactor
operation--generic determination of no significant environmental impact.

    (a) The Commission has made a generic determination that, if 
necessary, spent fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safely and 
without significant environmental impacts for at least 60 years beyond 
the licensed life for operation (which may include the term of a revised 
or renewed license) of that reactor in a combination of storage in its 
spent fuel storage basin and at either onsite or offsite independent 
spent fuel storage installations. Further, the Commission believes there 
is reasonable assurance that sufficient mined geologic repository 
capacity will be available to dispose of the commercial high-level 
radioactive waste and spent fuel generated in any reactor when 
necessary.
    (b) Accordingly, as provided in Sec. Sec. 51.30(b), 51.53, 51.61, 
51.80(b), 51.95, and 51.97(a), and within the scope of the generic 
determination in paragraph (a) of this section, no discussion of any 
environmental impact of spent fuel storage in reactor facility storage 
pools or independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSI) for the 
period following the term of the reactor operating license or amendment, 
reactor combined license or amendment, or initial ISFSI license or 
amendment for which application is made, is required in any 
environmental report, environmental impact statement, environmental 
assessment, or other analysis prepared in connection with the issuance 
or amendment of an operating license for a nuclear power reactor under 
parts 50 and 54 of this chapter, or issuance or amendment of a combined 
license for a nuclear power reactor under parts 52 and 54 of this 
chapter, or the issuance of an initial license for storage of spent fuel 
at an ISFSI, or any amendment thereto.
    (c) This section does not alter any requirements to consider the 
environmental impacts of spent fuel storage during the term of a reactor 
operating license or combined license, or a license for an ISFSI in a 
licensing proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 51.25  Determination to prepare environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment; eligibility for categorical exclusion.

    Before taking a proposed action subject to the provisions of this 
subpart, the appropriate NRC staff director will determine on the basis 
of the criteria and classifications of types of actions in Sec. Sec. 
51.20, 51.21 and 51.22 of this subpart whether the proposed action is of 
the type listed in Sec. 51.22(c) as a categorical exclusion or whether 
an environmental impact statement or an environmental

[[Page 17]]

assessment should be prepared. An environmental assessment is not 
necessary if it is determined that an environmental impact statement 
will be prepared.


<R05>
Sec. 51.26  Requirement to publish notice of intent and conduct
scoping process.

    (a) Whenever the appropriate NRC staff director determines that an 
environmental impact statement will be prepared by NRC in connection 
with a proposed action, a notice of intent will be prepared as provided 
in Sec. 51.27, and will be published in the Federal Register as 
provided in Sec. 51.116, and an appropriate scoping process (see 
Sec. Sec. 51.27, 51.28, and 51.29) will be conducted.
    (b) The scoping process may include a public scoping meeting.
    (c) Upon receipt of an application and accompanying environmental 
impact statement under Sec. 60.22 or Sec. 63.22 of this chapter 
(pertaining to geologic repositories for high-level radioactive waste), 
the appropriate NRC staff director will include in the notice of 
docketing required to be published by Sec. 2.101(f)(8) of this chapter 
a statement of Commission intention to adopt the environmental impact 
statement to the extent practicable. However, if the appropriate NRC 
staff director determines, at the time of such publication or at any 
time thereafter, that NRC should prepare a supplemental environmental 
impact statement in connection with the Commission's action on the 
license application, the NRC shall follow the procedures set out in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Whenever the appropriate NRC staff director determines that a 
supplement to an environmental impact statement will be prepared by the 
NRC, a notice of intent will be prepared as provided in Sec. 51.27, and 
will be published in the Federal Register as provided in Sec. 51.116. 
The NRC staff need not conduct a scoping process (see Sec. Sec. 51.27, 
51.28, and 51.29), provided, however, that if scoping is conducted, then 
the scoping must be directed at matters to be addressed in the 
supplement. If scoping is conducted in a proceeding for a combined 
license referencing an early site permit under part 52, then the scoping 
must be directed at matters to be addressed in the supplement as 
described in Sec. 51.92(e).

<R05>
Sec. 51.28  Scoping--participants.

    (a) The appropriate NRC staff director shall invite the following 
persons to participate in the scoping process:
    (1) The applicant or the petitioner for rulemaking;
    (2) Any person who has petitioned for leave to intervene in the 
proceeding or who has been admitted as a party to the proceeding;
    (3) Any other Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or 
special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved or 
which is authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental 
standards;
    (4) Affected State and local agencies, including those authorized to 
develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    (5) Any affected Indian tribe; and
    (6) Any person who has requested an opportunity to participate in

Sec. 51.29  Scoping-environmental impact statement and supplement to 
environmental impact statement.

    (a) The scoping process for an environmental impact statement shall 
begin as soon as practicable after publication of the notice of intent 
as provided in Sec. 51.116, and shall be used to:
    (1) Define the proposed action which is to be the subject of the 
statement or supplement. For environmental impact statements other than 
a supplement to an early site permit final environmental impact 
statement prepared for a combined license application, the provisions of 
40 CFR 1502.4 will be used for this purpose. For a supplement to an 
early site permit final environmental impact statement prepared for a 
combined license application, the proposed action shall be as set forth 
in the relevant provisions of Sec. 51.92(e).
    (2) Determine the scope of the statement and identify the 
significant issues to be analyzed in depth.
    (3) Identify and eliminate from detailed study issues which are 
peripheral or are not significant or which have been covered by prior 
environmental review. Discussion of these issues in the statement will 
be limited to a brief presentation of why they are peripheral or will 
not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment or 
a reference to their coverage elsewhere.
    (4) Identify any environmental assessments and other environmental 
impact statements which are being or will be prepared that are related 
to but are not part of the scope of the statement under consideration.
    (5) Identify other environmental review and consultation 
requirements related to the proposed action so that

[[Page 19]]

other required analyses and studies may be prepared concurrently and 
integrated with the environmental impact statement.
    (6) Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation 
of environmental analyses and the Commission's tentative planning and 
decision-making schedule.
    (7) Identify any cooperating agencies, and as appropriate, allocate 
assignments for preparation and schedules for completion of the 
statement to the NRC and any cooperating agencies.
    (8) Describe the means by which the environmental impact statement 
will be prepared, including any contractor assistance to be used.
    (b) At the conclusion of the scoping process, the appropriate NRC 
staff director will prepare a concise summary of the determinations and 
conclusions reached, including the significant issues identified, and 
will send a copy of the summary to each participant in the scoping 
process.
    (c) At any time prior to issuance of the draft environmental impact 
statement, the appropriate NRC staff director may revise the 
determinations made under paragraph (b) of this section, as appropriate, 
if substantial changes are made in the proposed action, or if 
significant new circumstances or information arise which bear on the 
proposed action or its impacts.

Sec. 51.30  Environmental assessment.

    (a) An environmental assessment for proposed actions, other than 
those for a standard design certification under 10 CFR part 52 or a 
manufacturing license under part 52, shall identify the proposed action 
and include:
    (1) A brief discussion of:
    (i) The need for the proposed action;
    (ii) Alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E) of NEPA;
    (iii) The environmental impacts of the proposed action and 
alternatives as appropriate; and
    (2) A list of agencies and persons consulted, and identification of 
sources used.
    (b) Unless otherwise determined by the Commission, an environmental 
assessment will not include discussion of any aspect of the storage of 
spent fuel within the scope of the generic determination in Sec. 
51.23(a) and in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 51.23(b).
    (c) An environmental assessment for a proposed action regarding a 
monitored retrievable storage installation (MRS) will not address the 
need for the MRS or any alternative to the design criteria for an MRS 
set forth in section 141(b)(1) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 
(96 Stat. 2242, 42 U.S.C. 10161(b)(1)).
    (d) An environmental assessment for a standard design certification 
under subpart B of part 52 of this chapter must identify the proposed 
action, and will be limited to the consideration of the costs and 
benefits of severe accident mitigation design alternatives and the bases 
for not incorporating severe accident mitigation design alternatives in 
the design certification. An environmental assessment for an amendment 
to a design certification will be limited to the consideration of 
whether the design change which is the subject of the proposed amendment 
renders a severe accident mitigation design alternative previously 
rejected in the earlier environmental assessment to become cost 
beneficial, or results in the identification of new severe accident 
mitigation design alternatives, in which case the costs and benefits of 
new severe accident mitigation design alternatives and the bases for not 
incorporating new severe accident mitigation design alternatives in the 
design certification must be addressed.
    (e) An environmental assessment for a manufacturing license under 
subpart F of part 52 of this chapter must identify the proposed action, 
and will be limited to the consideration of the costs and benefits of 
severe accident mitigation design alternatives and the bases for not 
incorporating severe accident mitigation design alternatives in the 
manufacturing license. An environmental assessment for an amendment to a 
manufacturing license will be limited to consideration of whether the 
design change which is the subject of the proposed amendment either 
renders a

[[Page 20]]

severe accident mitigation design alternative previously rejected in an 
environmental assessment to become cost beneficial, or results in the 
identification of new severe accident mitigation design alternatives, in 
which case the costs and benefits of new severe accident mitigation 
design alternatives and the bases for not incorporating new severe 
accident mitigation design alternatives in the manufacturing license 
must be addressed. In either case, the environmental assessment will not 
address the environmental impacts associated with manufacturing the 
reactor under the manufacturing license.

Sec. 51.31  Determinations based on environmental assessment.

    (a) General. Upon completion of an environmental assessment for 
proposed actions other than those involving a standard design 
certification or a manufacturing license under part 52 of this chapter, 
the appropriate NRC staff director will determine whether to prepare an 
environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact on 
the proposed action. As provided in Sec. 51.33, a determination to 
prepare a draft finding of no significant impact may be made.
    (b) Standard design certification. (1) For actions involving the 
issuance or amendment of a standard design certification, the Commission 
shall prepare a draft environmental assessment for public comment as 
part of the proposed rule. The proposed rule must state that:
    (i) The Commission has determined in Sec. 51.32 that there is no 
significant environmental impact associated with the issuance of the 
standard design certification or its amendment, as applicable; and
    (ii) Comments on the environmental assessment will be limited to the 
consideration of SAMDAs as required by Sec. 51.30(d).
    (2) The Commission will prepare a final environmental assessment 
following the close of the public comment period for the proposed 
standard design certification.
    (c) Manufacturing license. (1) Upon completion of the environmental 
assessment for actions involving issuance or amendment of a 
manufacturing license (manufacturing license environmental assessment), 
the appropriate NRC staff director will determine the costs and benefits 
of severe accident mitigation design alternatives and the bases for not 
incorporating severe accident mitigation design alternatives in the 
design of the reactor to be manufactured under the manufacturing 
license. The NRC staff director may determine to prepare a draft 
environmental assessment.
    (2) The manufacturing license environmental assessment must state 
that:
    (i) The Commission has determined in Sec. 51.32 that there is no 
significant environmental impact associated with the issuance of a 
manufacturing license or an amendment to a manufacturing license, as 
applicable;
    (ii) The environmental assessment will not address the environmental 
impacts associated with manufacturing the reactor under the 
manufacturing license; and
    (iii) Comments on the environmental assessment will be limited to 
the consideration of severe accident mitigation design alternatives as 
required by Sec. 51.30(e).
    (3) If the NRC staff director makes a determination to prepare and 
issue a draft environmental assessment for public review and comment 
before making a final determination on the manufacturing license 
application, the assessment will be marked, ``Draft.'' The NRC notice of 
availability on the draft environmental assessment will include a 
request for comments which specifies where comments should be submitted 
and when the comment period expires. The notice will state that copies 
of the environmental assessment and any related environmental documents 
are available for public inspection and where inspections can be made. A 
copy of the final environmental assessment will be sent to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, the applicant, any party to a 
proceeding, each commenter, and any other Federal, State, and local 
agencies, and Indian tribes, State, regional,

[[Page 21]]

and metropolitan clearinghouses expressing an interest in the action. 
Additional copies will be made available in accordance with Sec. 
51.123.
    (4) When a hearing is held under the regulations in part 2 of this 
chapter on the proposed issuance of the manufacturing license or 
amendment, the NRC staff director will prepare a final environmental 
assessment which may be subject to modification as a result of review 
and decision as appropriate to the nature and scope of the proceeding.
    (5) Only a party admitted into the proceeding with respect to a 
contention on the environmental assessment, or an entity participating 
in the proceeding pursuant to Sec. 2.315(c) of this chapter, may take a 
position and offer evidence on the matters within the scope of the 
environmental assessment.

                    finding of no significant impact


<R05>
Sec. 51.32  Finding of no significant impact.

    (a) A finding of no significant impact will:
    (1) Identify the proposed action;
    (2) State that the Commission has determined not to prepare an 
environmental impact statement for the proposed action;
    (3) Briefly present the reasons why the proposed action will not 
have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment;
    (4) Include the environmental assessment or a summary of the 
environmental assessment. If the assessment is included, the finding 
need not repeat any of the discussion in the assessment but may 
incorporate it by reference;
    (5) Note any other related environmental documents; and
    (6) State that the finding and any related environmental documents 
are available for public inspection and where the documents may be

<R05>
Sec. 51.33  Draft finding of no significant impact; distribution.

    (a) As provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the appropriate 
NRC staff director may make a determination to prepare and issue a draft 
finding of no significant impact for public review and comment before 
making a final determination whether to prepare an environmental impact 
statement or a final finding of no significant impact on the proposed 
action.
    (b) Circumstances in which a draft finding of no significant impact 
may be prepared will ordinarily include the following:
    (1) A finding of no significant impact appears warranted for the 
proposed action but the proposed action is (i) closely similar to one 
which normally requires the preparation of an environmental impact 
statement, or (ii) without precedent; and
    (2) The appropriate NRC staff director determines that preparation 
of a draft finding of no significant impact will further the purposes of 
NEPA.
    (c) A draft finding of no significant impact will (1) be marked 
``Draft'', (2) contain the information specified in Sec. 51.32, (3) be 
accompanied by or include a request for comments on the proposed action 
and on the draft finding within thirty (30) days, or such longer period 
as may be specified in the notice of the draft finding, and (4) be 
published in the Federal Register as required by Sec. Sec. 51.35 and 
51.119.
    (d) A draft finding will be distributed as provided in Sec. 
51.74(a). Additional copies will be made available in accordance with 
Sec. 51.123.
    (e) When a draft finding of no significant impact is issued for a 
proposed action, a final determination to prepare an environmental 
impact statement or a final finding of no significant impact for that 
action shall not be made until the last day of the public comment period 
has expired.

<R05>
Sec. 51.34  Preparation of finding of no significant impact.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the finding 
of no significant impact will be prepared by the NRC staff director 
authorized to take the action.
    (b) When a hearing is held on the proposed action under the 
regulations in subpart G of part 2 of this chapter or when the action 
can only be taken by the Commissioners acting as a collegial body, the 
appropriate NRC staff director will prepare a proposed finding of no 
significant impact which may be subject to modification as a result of 
review and decision as appropriate to the nature and scope of the 
proceeding. In such cases, the presiding officer, the Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Appeal Board, or the Commission acting as a collegial body, as 
appropriate, will issue the final finding of no significant impact.


<R05>
Sec. 51.35  Requirement to publish finding of no significant impact; 
limitation on Commission action.

    (a) Whenever the Commission makes a draft or final finding of no 
significant impact on a proposed action, the finding will be published 
in the Federal Register as provided in Sec. 51.119.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 51.13, the Commission shall not take 
the proposed action until after the final finding has been published in 
the Federal Register.

               environmental reports--general requirements


<R05>
Sec. 51.45  Environmental report.

    (a) General. As required by Sec. Sec. 51.50, 51.53, 51.54, 51.55, 
51.60, 51.61, 51.62, or 51.68, as appropriate, each applicant or 
petitioner for rulemaking shall submit with its application or petition 
for rulemaking one signed original of a separate document entitled 
``Applicant's'' or ``Petitioner's Environmental Report,'' as 
appropriate. An applicant or petitioner for rulemaking may submit a 
supplement to an environmental report at any time.
    (b) Environmental considerations. The environmental report shall 
contain a description of the proposed action, a statement of its 
purposes, a description of the environment affected, and discuss the 
following considerations:
    (1) The impact of the proposed action on the environment. Impacts 
shall be discussed in proportion to their significance;
    (2) Any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should 
the proposal be implemented;
    (3) Alternatives to the proposed action. The discussion of 
alternatives shall be sufficiently complete to aid the Commission in 
developing and exploring, pursuant to section 102(2)(E) of NEPA, 
``appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any 
proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses 
of available resources.'' To the extent practicable, the environmental 
impacts of the proposal and the alternatives should be presented in 
comparative form;
    (4) The relationship between local short-term uses of man's 
environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term 
productivity; and
    (5) Any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources 
which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.
    (c) Analysis. The environmental report must include an analysis that 
considers and balances the environmental effects of the proposed action, 
the environmental impacts of alternatives to the proposed action, and 
alternatives available for reducing or avoiding adverse environmental 
effects. An environmental report required for materials licenses under 
Sec. 51.60 must also include a description of those site preparation 
activities excluded from the definition of construction under Sec. 51.4 
which have been or will be undertaken at the proposed site (i.e., those 
activities listed in paragraphs (2)(i) and (2)(ii) in the definition of 
construction contained in Sec. 51.4); a description of the impacts of 
such excluded site preparation activities; and an analysis of the 
cumulative impacts of the proposed action when added to the impacts of 
such excluded site preparation activities on the human environment. An 
environmental report prepared at the early site permit stage under Sec. 
51.50(b), limited work authorization stage under Sec. 51.49, 
construction permit stage under Sec. 51.50(a), or combined license 
stage under Sec. 51.50(c) must include a description of impacts of the 
preconstruction activities performed by the applicant at the proposed 
site (i.e., those activities listed in paragraph (1)(ii) in the 
definition of ``construction'' contained in Sec. 51.4), necessary to 
support the construction and operation of the facility which is the 
subject of the early site permit, limited work authorization, 
construction permit, or combined license application. The environmental 
report must also contain an analysis of the cumulative impacts of the 
activities to be authorized by the limited

[[Page 24]]

work authorization, construction permit, or combined license in light of 
the preconstruction impacts described in the environmental report. 
Except for an environmental report prepared at the early site permit 
stage, or an environmental report prepared at the license renewal stage 
under Sec. 51.53(c), the analysis in the environmental report should 
also include consideration of the economic, technical, and other 
benefits and costs of the proposed action and its alternatives. 
Environmental reports prepared at the license renewal stage under Sec. 
51.53(c) need not discuss the economic or technical benefits and costs 
of either the proposed action or alternatives except if these benefits 
and costs are either essential for a determination regarding the 
inclusion of an alternative in the range of alternatives considered or 
relevant to mitigation. In addition, environmental reports prepared 
under Sec. 51.53(c) need not discuss issues not related to the 
environmental effects of the proposed action and its alternatives. The 
analyses for environmental reports shall, to the fullest extent 
practicable, quantify the various factors considered. To the extent that 
there are important qualitative considerations or factors that cannot be 
quantified, those considerations or factors shall be discussed in 
qualitative terms. The environmental report should contain sufficient 
data to aid the Commission in its development of an independent 
analysis.
    (d) Status of compliance. The environmental report shall list all 
Federal permits, licenses, approvals and other entitlements which must 
be obtained in connection with the proposed action and shall describe 
the status of compliance with these requirements. The environmental 
report shall also include a discussion of the status of compliance with 
applicable environmental quality standards and requirements including, 
but not limited to, applicable zoning and land-use regulations, and 
thermal and other water pollution limitations or requirements which have 
been imposed by Federal, State, regional, and local agencies having 
responsibility for environmental protection. The discussion of 
alternatives in the report shall include a discussion of whether the 
alternatives will comply with such applicable environmental quality 
standards and requirements.
    (e) Adverse information. The information submitted pursuant to 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section should not be confined to 
information supporting the proposed action but should also include 
adverse information.

<R05>
Sec. 51.49  Environmental report--limited work authorization.

    (a) Limited work authorization submitted as part of complete 
construction permit or combined license application. Each applicant for 
a construction permit or combined license applying for a limited work 
authorization under Sec. 50.10(d) of this chapter in a complete 
application under 10 CFR 2.101(a)(1) through (a)(4), shall submit with 
its application a separate document, entitled, ``Applicant's 
Environmental Report--Limited Work Authorization Stage,'' which is in 
addition to the environmental report required by Sec. 51.50 of this 
part. Each environmental report must also contain the following 
information:
    (1) A description of the activities proposed to be conducted under 
the limited work authorization;
    (2) A statement of the need for the activities; and
    (3) A description of the environmental impacts that may reasonably 
be expected to result from the activities, the mitigation measures that 
the applicant proposes to implement to achieve the level of 
environmental impacts described, and a discussion of the reasons for 
rejecting mitigation measures that could be employed by the applicant to 
further reduce environmental impacts.
    (b) Phased application for limited work authorization and 
construction permit or combined license. If the construction permit or 
combined license application is filed in accordance with Sec. 
2.101(a)(9) of this chapter, then the environmental report for part one 
of the application

[[Page 25]]

may be limited to a discussion of the activities proposed to be 
conducted under the limited work authorization. If the scope of the 
environmental report for part one is so limited, then part two of the 
application must include the information required by Sec. 51.50, as 
applicable.
    (c) Limited work authorization submitted as part of an early site 
permit application. Each applicant for an early site permit under 
subpart A of part 52 of this chapter requesting a limited work 
authorization shall submit with its application the environmental report 
required by Sec. 51.50(b). Each environmental report must contain the 
following information:
    (1) A description of the activities proposed to be conducted under 
the limited work authorization;
    (2) A statement of the need for the activities; and
    (3) A description of the environmental impacts that may reasonably 
be expected to result from the activities, the mitigation measures that 
the applicant proposes to implement to achieve the level of 
environmental impacts described, and a discussion of the reasons for 
rejecting mitigation measures that could be employed by the applicant to 
further reduce environmental impacts.
    (d) Limited work authorization request submitted by early site 
permit holder. Each holder of an early site permit requesting a limited 
work authorization shall submit with its application a document 
entitled, ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Limited Work Authorization 
under Early Site Permit,'' containing the following information:
    (1) A description of the activities proposed to be conducted under 
the limited work authorization;
    (2) A statement of the need for the activities;
    (3) A description of the environmental impacts that may reasonably 
be expected to result from the activities, the mitigation measures that 
the applicant proposes to implement to achieve the level of 
environmental impacts described, and a discussion of the reasons for 
rejecting mitigation measures that could be employed by the applicant to 
further reduce environmental impacts; and
    (4) Any new and significant information for issues related to the 
impacts of construction of the facility that were resolved in the early 
site permit proceeding with respect to the environmental impacts of the 
activities to be conducted under the limited work authorization.
    (5) A description of the process used to identify new and 
significant information regarding NRC's conclusions in the early site 
permit environmental impact statement. The process must be a reasonable 
methodology for identifying this new and significant information.
    (e) Limited work authorization for a site where an environmental 
impact statement was prepared, but the facility construction was not 
completed. If the limited work authorization is for activities to be 
conducted at a site for which the Commission has previously prepared an 
environmental impact statement for the construction and operation of a 
nuclear power plant, and a construction permit was issued but 
construction of the plant was never completed, then the applicant's 
environmental report may incorporate by reference the earlier 
environmental impact statement. In the event of such referencing, the 
environmental report must identify:
    (1) Any new and significant information material to issues related 
to the impacts of construction of the facility that were resolved in the 
construction permit proceeding for the matters required to be addressed 
in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (2) A description of the process used to identify new and 
significant information regarding the NRC's conclusions in the 
construction permit environmental impact statement. The process must use 
a reasonable methodology for identifying this new and significant 
information.
    (f) Environmental report. An environmental report submitted in 
accordance with this section must separately evaluate the environmental 
impacts and proposed alternatives attributable to the activities 
proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization. At the 
option of the applicant, the ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Limited 
Work Authorization Stage,'' may contain the information

[[Page 26]]

required to be submitted in the environmental report required under 
Sec. 51.50, which addresses the impacts of construction and operation 
for the proposed facility (including the environmental impacts 
attributable to the limited work authorization), and discusses the 
overall costs and benefits balancing for the proposed action.

reporting and keeping records of environmental data, and any conditions 
and monitoring requirements for protecting the non-aquatic environment, 
proposed for possible inclusion in the license as environmental 
conditions in accordance with Sec. 50.36b of this chapter. The combined 
license environmental report may reference information contained in a 
final environmental document previously prepared by the NRC staff.
    (1) Application referencing an early site permit. If the combined 
license application references an early site permit, then the 
``Applicant's Environmental Report--Combined License Stage'' need not 
contain information or analyses submitted to the Commission in 
``Applicant's Environmental Report--Early Site Permit Stage,'' or 
resolved in the Commission's early site permit environmental impact 
statement, but must

[[Page 27]]

contain, in addition to the environmental information and analyses 
otherwise required:
    (i) Information to demonstrate that the design of the facility falls 
within the site characteristics and design parameters specified in the 
early site permit;
    (ii) Information to resolve any significant environmental issue that 
was not resolved in the early site permit proceeding;
    (iii) Any new and significant information for issues related to the 
impacts of construction and operation of the facility that were resolved 
in the early site permit proceeding;
    (iv) A description of the process used to identify new and 
significant information regarding the NRC's conclusions in the early 
site permit environmental impact statement. The process must use a 
reasonable methodology for identifying such new and significant 
information; and
    (v) A demonstration that all environmental terms and conditions that 
have been included in the early site permit will be satisfied by the 
date of issuance of the combined license. Any terms or conditions of the 
early site permit that could not be met by the time of issuance of the 
combined license, must be set forth as terms or conditions of the 
combined license.
    (2) Application referencing standard design certification. If the 
combined license references a standard design certification, then the 
combined license environmental report may incorporate by reference the 
environmental assessment previously prepared by the NRC for the 
referenced design certification. If the design certification 
environmental assessment is referenced, then the combined license 
environmental report must contain information to demonstrate that the 
site characteristics for the combined license site fall within the site 
parameters in the design certification environmental assessment.
    (3) Application referencing a manufactured reactor. If the combined 
license application proposes to use a manufactured reactor, then the 
combined license environmental report may incorporate by reference the 
environmental assessment previously prepared by the NRC for the 
underlying manufacturing license. If the manufacturing license 
environmental assessment is referenced, then the combined license 
environmental report must contain information to demonstrate that the 
site characteristics for the combined license site fall within the site 
parameters in the manufacturing license environmental assessment. The 
environmental report need not address the environmental impacts 
associated with manufacturing the reactor under the manufacturing 
license.

Sec. 51.51  Uranium fuel cycle environmental data--Table S-3.

    (a) Under Sec. 51.50, every environmental report prepared for the 
construction permit stage or early site permit stage or combined license 
stage of a light-water-cooled nuclear power reactor, and submitted on or 
after September 4, 1979, shall take Table S-3, Table of Uranium Fuel 
Cycle Environmental Data, as the basis for evaluating the contribution 
of the environmental effects of uranium mining and milling, the 
production of uranium hexafluoride, isotopic enrichment, fuel 
fabrication, reprocessing of irradiated fuel, transportation of 
radioactive materials and management of low-level wastes and high-level 
wastes related to uranium fuel cycle activities to the environmental 
costs of licensing the nuclear power reactor. Table S-3 shall be 
included in the environmental report and may be supplemented by a 
discussion of the environmental significance of the data set forth in 
the table as weighed in the analysis for the proposed facility.

\1\ In some cases where no entry appears it is clear from the background
  documents that the matter was addressed and that, in effect, the Table
  should be read as if a specific zero entry had been made. However,
  there are other areas that are not addressed at all in the Table.
  Table S-3 does not include health effects from the effluents described
  in the Table, or estimates of releases of Radon-222 from the uranium
  fuel cycle or estimates of Technetium-99 released from waste
  management or reprocessing activities. These issues may be the subject
  of litigation in the individual licensing proceedings.
Data supporting this table are given in the ``Environmental Survey of
  the Uranium Fuel Cycle,'' WASH-1248, April 1974; the ``Environmental
  Survey of the Reprocessing and Waste Management Portion of the LWR
  Fuel Cycle,'' NUREG-0116 (Supp.1 to WASH-1248); the ``Public Comments
  and Task Force Responses Regarding the Environmental Survey of the
  Reprocessing and Waste Management Portions of the LWR Fuel Cycle,''
  NUREG-0216 (Supp. 2 to WASH-1248); and in the record of the final
  rulemaking pertaining to Uranium Fuel Cycle Impacts from Spent Fuel
  Reprocessing and Radioactive Waste Management, Docket RM-50-3. The
  contributions from reprocessing, waste management and transportation
  of wastes are maximized for either of the two fuel cycles (uranium
  only and no recycle). The contribution from transportation excludes
  transportation of cold fuel to a reactor and of irradiated fuel and
  radioactive wastes from a reactor which are considered in Table S-4 of
  Sec. 51.20(g). The contributions from the other steps of the fuel
  cycle are given in columns A-E of Table S-3A of WASH-1248.
\2\ The contributions to temporarily committed land from reprocessing
  are not prorated over 30 years, since the complete temporary impact
  accrues regardless of whether the plant services one reactor for one
  year or 57 reactors for 30 years.

Sec. 51.52  Environmental effects of transportation of fuel and
waste--Table S-4.

    Under Sec. 51.50, every environmental report prepared for the 
construction permit stage or early site permit stage or combined license 
stage of a light-water-cooled nuclear power reactor, and submitted after 
February 4, 1975, shall contain a statement concerning transportation of 
fuel and radioactive wastes to and from the reactor. That statement 
shall indicate that the reactor and this transportation either meet all 
of the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section or all of the 
conditions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a)(1) The reactor has a core thermal power level not exceeding 
3,800 megawatts;
    (2) The reactor fuel is in the form of sintered uranium dioxide 
pellets having a uranium-235 enrichment not exceeding 4% by weight, and 
the pellets are encapsulated in zircaloy rods;
    (3) The average level of irradiation of the irradiated fuel from the 
reactor does not exceed 33,000 megawatt-days per metric ton, and no 
irradiated fuel assembly is shipped until at least 90 days after it is 
discharged from the reactor;
    (4) With the exception of irradiated fuel, all radioactive waste 
shipped from the reactor is packaged and in a solid form;
    (5) Unirradiated fuel is shipped to the reactor by truck; irradiated 
fuel is shipped from the reactor by truck, rail, or barge; and 
radioactive waste other than irradiated fuel is shipped from the reactor 
by truck or rail; and
    (6) The environmental impacts of transportation of fuel and waste to 
and

[[Page 30]]

from the reactor, with respect to normal conditions of transport and 
possible accidents in transport, are as set forth in Summary Table S-4

\1\ Data supporting this table are given in the Commission's
  ``Environmental Survey of Transportation of Radioactive Materials to
  and from Nuclear Power Plants,'' WASH-1238, December 1972, and Supp. 1
  NUREG-75/038 April 1975. Both documents are available for inspection
  and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street
  NW., Washington, DC and may be obtained from National Technical
  Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161. WASH-1238 is available
  from NTIS at a cost of $5.45 (microfiche, $2.25) and NUREG-75/038 is
  available at a cost of $3.25 (microfiche, $2.25).
\2\ The Federal Radiation Council has recommended that the radiation
  doses from all sources of radiation other than natural background and
  medical exposures should be limited to 5,000 millirem per year for
  individuals as a result of occupational exposure and should be limited
  to 500 millirem per year for individuals in the general population.
  The dose to individuals due to average natural background radiation is
  about 130 millirem per year.
\3\ Man-rem is an expression for the summation of whole body doses to
  individuals in a group. Thus, if each member of a population group of
  1,000 people were to receive a dose of 0.001 rem (1 millirem), or if 2
  people were to receive a dose of 0.5 rem (500 millirem) each, the
  total man-rem dose in each case would be 1 man-rem.
\4\ Athough the environmental risk of radiological effects stemming from
  transportation accidents is currently incapable of being numerically
  quantified, the risk remains small regardless of whether it is being
  appiled to a single reactor or a multireactor site.

                     Environmental Impact Statements

       draft environmental impact statements--general requirements


<R05>
Sec. 51.70  Draft environmental impact statement--general.

    (a) The NRC staff will prepare a draft environmental impact 
statement as soon as practicable after publication of the notice of 
intent to prepare an environmental impact statement and completion of 
the scoping process. To the fullest extent practicable, environmental 
impact statements will be prepared concurrently or integrated with 
environmental impact analyses and related surveys and studies required 
by other Federal law.
    (b) The draft environmental impact statement will be concise, clear 
and analytic, will be written in plain language with appropriate 
graphics, will state how alternatives considered in it and decisions 
based on it will or will not achieve the requirements of sections 101 
and 102(1) of NEPA and of any other relevant and applicable 
environmental laws and policies, will identify any methodologies used 
and sources relied upon, and will be supported by evidence that the 
necessary environmental analyses have been made. The format provided in 
section 1(a) of appendix A of this subpart should be used. The NRC staff 
will independently evaluate and be responsible for the reliability of 
all information used in the draft environmental impact statement.
    (c) The Commission will cooperate with State and local agencies to 
the fullest extent possible to reduce duplication between NEPA and State 
and local requirements, in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.2 (b) and (c).


<R05>
Sec. 51.71  Draft environmental impact statement--contents.

    (a) Scope. The draft environmental impact statement will be prepared 
in accordance with the scope decided upon in the scoping process 
required by

[[Page 38]]

Sec. Sec. 51.26 and 51.29. As appropriate and to the extent required by 
the scope, the draft statement will address the topics in paragraphs 
(b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section and the matters specified in 
Sec. Sec. 51.45, 51.50, 51.51, 51.52, 51.53, 51.54, 51.61 and 51.62.
    (b) Analysis of major points of view. To the extent sufficient 
information is available, the draft environmental impact statement will 
include consideration of major points of view concerning the 
environmental impacts of the proposed action and the alternatives, and 
contain an analysis of significant problems and objections raised by 
other Federal, State, and local agencies, by any affected Indian tribes, 
and by other interested persons.
    (c) Status of compliance. The draft environmental impact statement 
will list all Federal permits, licenses, approvals, and other 
entitlements which must be obtained in implementing the proposed action 
and will describe the status of compliance with those requirements. If 
it is uncertain whether a Federal permit, license, approval, or other 
entitlement is necessary, the draft environmental impact statement will 
so indicate.
    (d) Analysis. Unless excepted in this paragraph or Sec. 51.75, the 
draft environmental impact statement will include a preliminary analysis 
that considers and weighs the environmental effects of the proposed 
action; the environmental impacts of alternatives to the proposed 
action; and alternatives available for reducing or avoiding adverse 
environmental effects and consideration of the economic, technical, and 
other benefits and costs of the proposed action and alternatives and 
indicate what other interests and considerations of Federal policy, 
including factors not related to environmental quality if applicable, 
are relevant to the consideration of environmental effects of the 
proposed action identified under paragraph (a) of this section. The 
draft supplemental environmental impact statement prepared at the 
license renewal stage under Sec. 51.95(c) need not discuss the economic 
or technical benefits and costs of either the proposed action or 
alternatives except if benefits and costs are either essential for a 
determination regarding the inclusion of an alternative in the range of 
alternatives considered or relevant to mitigation. In addition, the 
supplemental environmental impact statement prepared at the license 
renewal stage need not discuss other issues not related to the 
environmental effects of the proposed action and associated 
alternatives. The draft supplemental environmental impact statement for 
license renewal prepared under Sec. 51.95(c) will rely on conclusions 
as amplified by the supporting information in the GEIS for issues 
designated as Category 1 in appendix B to subpart A of this part. The 
draft supplemental environmental impact statement must contain an 
analysis of those issues identified as Category 2 in appendix B to 
subpart A of this part that are open for the proposed action. The 
analysis for all draft environmental impact statements will, to the 
fullest extent practicable, quantify the various factors considered. To 
the extent that there are important qualitative considerations or 
factors that cannot be quantified, these considerations or factors will 
be discussed in qualitative terms. Consideration will be given to 
compliance with environmental quality standards and requirements that 
have been imposed by Federal, State, regional, and local agencies having 
responsibility for environmental protection, including applicable zoning 
and land-use regulations and water pollution limitations or requirements 
issued or imposed under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The 
environmental impact of the proposed action will be considered in the 
analysis with respect to matters covered by environmental quality 
standards and requirements irrespective of whether a certification or 
license from the appropriate authority has been obtained. \3\ While 
satisfaction

[[Page 39]]

of Commission standards and criteria pertaining to radiological effects 
will be necessary to meet the licensing requirements of the Atomic 
Energy Act, the analysis will, for the purposes of NEPA, consider the 
radiological effects of the proposed action and alternatives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Compliance with the environmental quality standards and 
requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (imposed by EPA 
or designated permitting states) is not a substitute for, and does not 
negate the requirement for NRC to weigh all environmental effects of the 
proposed action, including the degradation, if any, of water quality, 
and to consider alternatives to the proposed action that are available 
for reducing adverse effects. Where an environmental assessment of 
aquatic impact from plant discharges is available from the permitting 
authority, the NRC will consider the assessment in its determination of 
the magnitude of environmental impacts for striking an overall cost-
benefit balance at the construction permit and operating license and 
early site permit and combined license stages, and in its determination 
of whether the adverse environmental impacts of license renewal are so 
great that preserving the option of license renewal for energy planning 
decision-makers would be unreasonable at the license renewal stage. When 
no such assessment of aquatic impacts is available from the permitting 
authority, NRC will establish on its own, or in conjunction with the 
permitting authority and other agencies having relevant expertise, the 
magnitude of potential impacts for striking an overall cost-benefit 
balance for the facility at the construction permit and operating 
license and early site permit and combined license stages, and in its 
determination of whether the adverse environmental impacts of license 
renewal are so great that preserving the option of license renewal for 
energy planning decision-makers would be unreasonable at the license 
renewal stage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Effect of limited work authorization. If a limited work 
authorization was issued either in connection with or subsequent to an 
early site permit, or in connection with a construction permit or 
combined license application, then the environmental impact statement 
for the construction permit or combined license application will not 
address or consider the sunk costs associated with the limited work 
authorization.
    (f) Preliminary recommendation. The draft environmental impact 
statement normally will include a preliminary recommendation by the NRC 
staff respecting the proposed action. This preliminary recommendation 
will be based on the information and analysis described in paragraphs 
(a) through (d) of this section and Sec. Sec. 51.75, 51.76, 51.80, 
51.85, and 51.95, as appropriate, and will be reached after considering 
the environmental effects of the proposed action and reasonable 
alternatives, \4\ and, except for supplemental environmental impact 
statements for the operating license renewal stage prepared pursuant to 
Sec. 51.95(c), after weighing the costs and benefits of the proposed 
action. In lieu of a recommendation, the NRC staff may indicate in the 
draft statement that two or more alternatives remain under 
consideration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The consideration of reasonable alternatives to a proposed 
action involving nuclear power reactors (e.g., alternative energy 
sources) is intended to assist the NRC in meeting its NEPA obligations 
and does not preclude any State authority from making separate 
determinations with respect to these alternatives and in no way 
preempts, displaces, or affects the authority of States or other Federal 
agencies to address these issues.

    (1) There are substantial changes in the proposed action that are 
relevant to environmental concerns; or
    (2) There are significant new circumstances or information relevant 
to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its 
impacts.
    (b) The NRC staff may prepare a supplement to a draft environmental 
impact statement when, in its opinion, preparation of a supplement will 
further the purposes of NEPA.
    (c) The supplement to a draft environmental impact statement will be 
prepared and noticed in the same manner as the draft environmental

<R05>
Sec. 51.75  Draft environmental impact statement--construction permit,
early site permit, or combined license.

    (a) Construction permit stage. A draft environmental impact 
statement relating to issuance of a construction permit for a production 
or utilization facility will be prepared in accordance with the 
procedures and measures described in Sec. Sec. 51.70, 51.71, 51.72, and 
51.73. The contribution of the environmental effects of the uranium fuel 
cycle activities specified in Sec. 51.51 shall be evaluated on the 
basis of impact values set forth in Table S-3, Table of Uranium Fuel 
Cycle Environmental Data, which shall be set out in the draft 
environmental impact statement. With the exception of radon-222 and 
technetium-99 releases, no further discussion of fuel cycle release 
values and other numerical data that appear explicitly in the table 
shall be required. \5\ The impact statement shall take account of dose 
commitments and health effects from fuel cycle effluents set forth in 
Table S-3 and shall in addition take account of economic, socioeconomic, 
and possible cumulative impacts and other fuel cycle impacts as may 
reasonably appear significant.
    (b) Early site permit stage. A draft environmental impact statement 
relating to issuance of an early site permit for a production or 
utilization facility will

[[Page 41]]

be prepared in accordance with the procedures and measures described in 
Sec. Sec. 51.70, 51.71, 51.72, 51.73, and this section. The 
contribution of the environmental effects of the uranium fuel cycle 
activities specified in Sec. 51.51 shall be evaluated on the basis of 
impact values set forth in Table S-3, Table of Uranium Fuel Cycle 
Environmental Data, which shall be set out in the draft environmental 
impact statement. With the exception of radon-222 and technetium-99 
releases, no further discussion of fuel cycle release values and other 
numerical data that appear explicitly in the table shall be required. 
\5\ The impact statement shall take account of dose commitments and 
health effects from fuel cycle effluents set forth in Table S-3 and 
shall in addition take account of economic, socioeconomic, and possible 
cumulative impacts and other fuel cycle impacts as may reasonably appear 
significant. The draft environmental impact statement must include an 
evaluation of alternative sites to determine whether there is any 
obviously superior alternative to the site proposed. The draft 
environmental impact statement must also include an evaluation of the 
environmental effects of construction and operation of a reactor, or 
reactors, which have design characteristics that fall within the site 
characteristics and design parameters for the early site permit 
application, but only to the extent addressed in the early site permit 
environmental report or otherwise necessary to determine whether there 
is any obviously superior alternative to the site proposed. The draft 
environmental impact statement must not include an assessment of the 
economic, technical, or other benefits (for example, need for power) and 
costs of the proposed action or an evaluation of alternative energy 
sources, unless these matters are addressed in the early site permit 
environmental report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Values for releases of Rn-222 and Tc-99 are not given in the 
table. The amount and significance of Rn-222 releases from the fuel 
cycle and Tc-99 releases from waste management or reprocessing 
activities shall be considered in the draft environmental impact 
statement and may be the subject of litigation in individual licensing 
proceedings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Combined license stage. A draft environmental impact statement 
relating to issuance of a combined license that does not reference an 
early site permit will be prepared in accordance with the procedures and 
measures described in Sec. Sec. 51.70, 51.71, 51.72, and 51.73. The 
contribution of the environmental effects of the uranium fuel cycle 
activities specified in Sec. 51.51 shall be evaluated on the basis of 
impact values set forth in Table S-3, Table of Uranium Fuel Cycle 
Environmental Data, which shall be set out in the draft environmental 
impact statement. With the exception of radon-222 and technetium-99 
releases, no further discussion of fuel cycle release values and other 
numerical data that appear explicitly in the table shall be required. 
\5\ The impact statement shall take account of dose commitments and 
health effects from fuel cycle effluents set forth in Table S-3 and 
shall in addition take account of economic, socioeconomic, and possible 
cumulative impacts and other fuel cycle impacts as may reasonably appear 
significant. The impact statement will include a discussion of the 
storage of spent fuel for the nuclear power plant within the scope of 
the generic determination in Sec. 51.23(a) and in accordance with Sec. 
51.23(b).
    (1) Combined license application referencing an early site permit. 
If the combined license application references an early site permit, 
then the NRC staff shall prepare a draft supplement to the early site 
permit environmental impact statement. The supplement must be prepared 
in accordance with Sec. 51.92(e).
    (2) Combined license application referencing a standard design 
certification. If the combined license application references a standard 
design certification and the site characteristics of the combined 
license's site fall within the site parameters specified in the design 
certification environmental assessment, then the draft combined license 
environmental impact statement shall incorporate by reference the design 
certification environmental assessment, and summarize the findings and 
conclusions of the environmental assessment with respect to severe 
accident mitigation design alternatives.

[[Page 42]]

    (3) Combined license application referencing a manufactured reactor. 
If the combined license application proposes to use a manufactured 
reactor and the site characteristics of the combined license's site fall 
within the site parameters specified in the manufacturing license 
environmental assessment, then the draft combined license environmental 
impact statement shall incorporate by reference the manufacturing 
license environmental assessment, and summarize the findings and 
conclusions of the environmental assessment with respect to severe 
accident mitigation design alternatives. The combined license 
environmental impact statement report will not address the environmental 
impacts associated with manufacturing the reactor under the 
manufacturing license.

<R05>
Sec. 51.76  Draft environmental impact statement--limited work 
authorization.

    The NRC will prepare a draft environmental impact statement relating 
to issuance of a limited work authorization in accordance with the 
procedures and measures described in Sec. Sec. 51.70, 51.71, and 51.73, 
as further supplemented or modified in the following paragraphs.
    (a) Limited work authorization submitted as part of complete 
construction permit or combined license application. If the application 
for a limited work authorization is submitted as part of a complete 
construction permit or combined license application, then the NRC may 
prepare a partial draft environmental impact statement. The analysis 
called for by Sec. 51.71(d) must be limited to the activities proposed 
to be conducted under the limited work authorization. Alternatively, the 
NRC may prepare a complete draft environmental impact statement prepared 
in accordance with Sec. 51.75(a) or (c), as applicable.
    (b) Phased application for limited work authorization under Sec. 
2.101(a)(9) of this chapter. If the application for a limited work 
authorization is submitted in accordance with Sec. 2.101(a)(9) of this 
chapter, then the draft environmental impact statement for part one of 
the application may be limited to consideration of the activities 
proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization, and the 
proposed redress plan. However, if the environmental report contains the 
full set of information required to be submitted under Sec. 51.50(a) or 
(c), then a draft environmental impact statement must be prepared in 
accordance with Sec. 51.75(a) or (c), as applicable. Siting issues, 
including whether there is an obviously superior alternative site, or 
issues related to operation of the proposed nuclear power plant at the 
site, including need for power, may not be considered. After part two of 
the application is docketed, the NRC will prepare a draft supplement to 
the final environmental impact statement for part two of the application 
under Sec. 51.72. No updating of the information contained in the final 
environmental impact statement prepared for part one is necessary in 
preparation of the supplemental environmental impact statement. The 
draft supplement must consider all environmental impacts associated with 
the prior issuance of the limited work authorization, but may not 
address or consider the sunk costs associated with the limited work 
authorization.
    (c) Limited work authorization submitted as part of an early site 
permit application. If the application for a limited work authorization 
is submitted as part of an application for an early site permit, then 
the NRC will prepare an environmental impact statement in accordance 
with Sec. 51.75(b). However, the analysis called for by Sec. 51.71(d) 
must also address the activities proposed to be conducted under the 
limited work authorization.
    (d) Limited work authorization request submitted by an early site 
permit holder. If the application for a limited work authorization is 
submitted by a holder of an early site permit, then the NRC will prepare 
a draft supplement to the environmental impact statement for the early 
site permit. The supplement is limited to consideration of the 
activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work 
authorization, the adequacy of the proposed redress plan, and whether 
there is new and significant information identified with respect to 
issues related to the impacts of construction of the facility that

[[Page 43]]

were resolved in the early site permit proceeding with respect to the 
environmental impacts of the activities to be conducted under the 
limited work authorization. No other updating of the information 
contained in the final environmental impact statement prepared for the 
early site permit is required.
    (e) Limited work authorization for a site where an environmental 
impact statement was prepared, but the facility construction was not 
completed. If the limited work authorization is for activities to be 
conducted at a site for which the Commission has previously prepared an 
environmental impact statement for the construction and operation of a 
nuclear power plant, and a construction permit was issued but 
construction of the plant was not completed, then the draft 
environmental impact statement shall incorporate by reference the 
earlier environmental impact statement. The draft environmental impact 
statement must be limited to a consideration of whether there is 
significant new information with respect to the environmental impacts of 
construction, relevant to the activities to be conducted under the 
limited work authority, so that the conclusion of the referenced 
environmental impact statement on the impacts of construction would, 
when analyzed in accordance with Sec. 51.71, lead to the conclusion 
that the limited work authorization should not be issued or should be 
issued with appropriate conditions.
    (f) Draft environmental impact statement. A draft environmental 
impact statement prepared under this section must separately evaluate 
the environmental impacts and proposed alternatives attributable to the 
activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work 
authorization. However, if the ``Applicant's Environmental Report--
Limited Work Authorization Stage,'' also contains the information 
required to be submitted in the environmental report required under 
Sec. 51.50, then the environmental impact statement must address the 
impacts of construction and operation for the proposed facility 
(including the environmental impacts attributable to the limited work 
authorization), and discuss the overall costs and benefits balancing for 
the underlying proposed action, in accordance with Sec. 51.71, and 
Sec. 51.75(a) or (c), as applicable.

resolved in the proceeding on the early site permit; and
    (7) Include an analysis of the issues related to the impacts of 
construction and operation of the facility that were resolved in the 
early site permit proceeding for which new and significant information 
has been identified, including, but not limited to, new and significant 
information demonstrating that the design of the facility falls outside 
the site characteristics and design parameters specified in the early 
site permit.
    (f)(1) A supplement to a final environmental impact statement will 
be accompanied by or will include a request for comments as provided in 
Sec. 51.73 and a notice of availability will be published in the

   final environmental impact statements--production and utilization 
                               facilities


<R05>
Sec. 51.95  Postconstruction environmental impact statements.

    (a) General. Any supplement to a final environmental impact 
statement or any environmental assessment prepared under the provisions 
of this section may incorporate by reference any information contained 
in a final environmental document previously prepared by the NRC staff 
that relates to the same production or utilization facility. Documents 
that may be referenced include, but are not limited to, the final 
environmental impact statement; supplements to the final environmental 
impact statement, including supplements prepared at the operating 
license stage; NRC staff-prepared final generic environmental impact 
statements; environmental assessments and records of decisions prepared 
in connection with the construction permit, the operating license, the 
early site permit, or the combined license and any license amendment for 
that facility. A supplement to a final environmental impact statement 
will include a request for comments as provided in Sec. 51.73.
    (b) Initial operating license stage. In connection with the issuance 
of an operating license for a production or utilization facility, the 
NRC staff will prepare a supplement to the final environmental impact 
statement on the construction permit for that facility, which will 
update the prior environmental review. The supplement will only cover 
matters that differ from the final environmental impact statement or 
that reflect significant new information concerning matters discussed in 
the final environmental impact statement. Unless otherwise determined by

[[Page 47]]

the Commission, a supplement on the operation of a nuclear power plant 
will not include a discussion of need for power, or of alternative 
energy sources, or of alternative sites, or of any aspect of the storage 
of spent fuel for the nuclear power plant within the scope of the 
generic determination in Sec. 51.23(a) and in accordance with Sec. 
51.23(b), and will only be prepared in connection with the first 
licensing action authorizing full-power operation.
    (c) Operating license renewal stage. In connection with the renewal 
of an operating license or combined license for a nuclear power plant 
under parts 52 or 54 of this chapter, the Commission shall prepare an 
environmental impact statement, which is a supplement to the 
Commission's NUREG-1437, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for 
License Renewal of Nuclear Plants'' (May 1996), which is available in 
the NRC Public Document Room, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland.
    (1) The supplemental environmental impact statement for the 
operating license renewal stage shall address those issues as required 
by Sec. 51.71. In addition, the NRC staff must comply with 40 CFR 
1506.6(b)(3) in conducting the additional scoping process as required by 
Sec. 51.71(a).
    (2) The supplemental environmental impact statement for license 
renewal is not required to include discussion of need for power or the 
economic costs and economic benefits of the proposed action or of 
alternatives to the proposed action except insofar as such benefits and 
costs are either essential for a determination regarding the inclusion 
of an alternative in the range of alternatives considered or relevant to 
mitigation. In addition, the supplemental environmental impact statement 
prepared at the license renewal stage need not discuss other issues not 
related to the environmental effects of the proposed action and the 
alternatives, or any aspect of the storage of spent fuel for the 
facility within the scope of the generic determination in Sec. 51.23(a) 
and in accordance with Sec. 51.23(b). The analysis of alternatives in 
the supplemental environmental impact statement should be limited to the 
environmental impacts of such alternatives and should otherwise be 
prepared in accordance with Sec. 51.71 and appendix A to subpart A of 
this part.
    (3) The supplemental environmental impact statement shall be issued 
as a final impact statement in accordance with Sec. Sec. 51.91 and 
51.93 after considering any significant new information relevant to the 
proposed action contained in the supplement or incorporated by 
reference.
    (4) The supplemental environmental impact statement must contain the 
NRC staff's recommendation regarding the environmental acceptability of 
the license renewal action. In order to make its recommendation and 
final conclusion on the proposed action, the NRC staff, adjudicatory 
officers, and Commission shall integrate the conclusions, as amplified 
by the supporting information in the generic environmental impact 
statement for issues designated Category 1 (with the exception of 
offsite radiological impacts for collective effects and the disposal of 
spent fuel and high level waste) or resolved Category 2,information 
developed for those open Category 2 issues applicable to the plant in 
accordance with Sec. 51.53(c)(3)(ii), and any significant new 
information. Given this information, the NRC staff, adjudicatory 
officers, and Commission shall determine whether or not the adverse 
environmental impacts of license renewal are so great that preserving 
the option of license renewal for energy planning decisionmakers would 
be unreasonable.
    (d) Postoperating license stage. In connection with the amendment of 
an operating or combined license authorizing decommissioning activities 
at a production or utilization facility covered by Sec. 51.20, either 
for unrestricted use or based on continuing use restrictions applicable 
to the site, or with the issuance, amendment or renewal of a license to 
store spent fuel at a nuclear power reactor after expiration of the 
operating or combined license for the nuclear power reactor, the NRC 
staff will prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement for the 
post operating or post combined license stage or an environmental 
assessment, as appropriate, which will update the prior environmental 
documentation prepared by the NRC for compliance

[[Page 48]]

with NEPA under the provisions of this part. The supplement or 
assessment may incorporate by reference any information contained in the 
final environmental impact statement--for the operating or combined 
license stage, as appropriate, or in the records of decision prepared in 
connection with the early site permit, construction permit, operating 
license, or combined license for that facility. The supplement will 
include a request for comments as provided in Sec. 51.73. Unless 
otherwise required by the Commission in accordance with the generic 
determination in Sec. 51.23(a) and the provisions of Sec. 51.23(b), a 
supplemental environmental impact statement for the postoperating or 
post combined license stage or an environmental assessment, as 
appropriate, will address the environmental impacts of spent fuel 
storage only for the term of the license, license amendment or license 
renewal applied for.

monitored retrievable storage installation (MRS) will not address the 
need for the MRS or any alternative to the design criteria for an MRS 
set forth in section 141(b)(1) of the NWPA (96 Stat. 2242, 42 U.S.C. 
10161(b)(1)) but may consider alternative facility designs which are 
consistent with these design criteria.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in Sec. 51.13 and paragraph (b) of this 
section, no decision on a proposed action, including the issuance of a 
permit, license, or other form of permission, or amendment to or renewal 
of a permit, license, or other form of permission, or the issuance of an 
effective regulation, for which an environmental impact statement is 
required, will be made and no record of decision will be issued until 
the later of the following dates:
    (i) Ninety (90) days after publication by the Environmental 
Protection Agency of a Federal Register notice stating that the draft 
environmental impact statement has been filed with EPA.
    (ii) Thirty (30) days after publication by the Environmental 
Protection Agency of a Federal Register notice stating that the final 
environmental impact statement has been filed with EPA.
    (2) If a notice of filing of a final environmental impact statement 
is published by the Environmental Protection Agency within ninety (90) 
days after a notice of filing of a draft environmental impact statement 
has been published by EPA, the minimum thirty

[[Page 49]]

(30) day period and the minimum ninety (90) day period may run 
concurrently to the extent they overlap.
    (b) In any rulemaking proceeding for the purpose of protecting the 
public health or safety or the common defense and security, the 
Commission may make and publish the decision on the final rule at the 
same time that the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the Federal 
Register notice of filing of the final environmental impact statement.

Sec. 51.101  Limitations on actions.

    (a) Until a record of decision is issued in connection with a 
proposed licensing or regulatory action for which an environmental 
impact statement is required under Sec. 51.20, or until a final finding 
of no significant impact is issued in connection with a proposed 
licensing or regulatory action for which an environmental assessment is 
required under Sec. 51.21:
    (1) No action concerning the proposal may be taken by the Commission 
which would (i) have an adverse environmental impact, or (ii) limit the 
choice of reasonable alternatives.
    (2) Any action concerning the proposal taken by an applicant which 
would (i) have an adverse environmental impact, or (ii) limit the choice 
of reasonable alternatives may be grounds for denial of the license. In 
the case of an application covered by Sec. Sec. 30.32(f), 40.31(f), 
50.10(c), 70.21(f), or Sec. Sec. 72.16 and 72.34 of this chapter, the 
provisions of this paragraph will be applied in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 30.33(a)(5), 40.32(e), 50.10 (c) and (e), 70.23(a)(7) or 
Sec. 72.40(b) of this chapter, as appropriate.
    (b) While work on a required program environmental impact statement 
is in progress, the Commission will not undertake in the interim any 
major Federal action covered by the program which may significantly 
affect the quality of the human environment unless such action:
    (1) Is justified independently of the program;
    (2) Is itself accompanied by an adequate environmental impact 
statement; and
    (3) Will not prejudice the ultimate decision on the program. Absent 
any satisfactory explanation to the contrary, interim action which tends 
to determine subsequent development or limit reasonable alternatives, 
will be considered prejudicial.
    (c) This section does not preclude any applicant for an NRC permit, 
license, or other form of permission, or amendment to or renewal of an 
NRC permit, license, or other form of permission, (1) from developing 
any plans or designs necessary to support an application; or (2) after 
prior notice and consultation with NRC staff, (i) from performing any 
physical work necessary to support an application, or (ii) from 
performing any other physical work relating to the proposed action if 
the adverse environmental impact of that work is de minimis.

    (2) Identify all alternatives considered by the Commission in 
reaching the decision, state that these alternatives were included in 
the range of

[[Page 50]]

alternatives discussed in the environmental impact statement, and 
specify the alternative or alternatives which were considered to be 
environmentally preferable.
    (3) Discuss preferences among alternatives based on relevant 
factors, including economic and technical considerations where 
appropriate, the NRC's statutory mission, and any essential 
considerations of national policy, which were balanced by the Commission 
in making the decision and state how these considerations entered into 
the decision.
    (4) State whether the Commission has taken all practicable measures 
within its jurisdiction to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the 
alternative selected, and if not, to explain why those measures were not 
adopted. Summarize any license conditions and monitoring programs 
adopted in connection with mitigation measures.
    (5) In making a final decision on a license renewal action pursuant 
to part 54 of this chapter, the Commission shall determine whether or 
not the adverse environmental impacts of license renewal are so great 
that preserving the option of license renewal for energy planning 
decisionmakers would be unreasonable.
    (6) In a construction permit or a combined license proceeding where 
a limited work authorization under 10 CFR 50.10 was issued, the 
Commission's decision on the construction permit or combined license 
application will not address or consider the sunk costs associated with 
the limited work authorization in determining the proposed action.
    (b) The record of decision may be integrated into any other record 
prepared by the Commission in connection with the action.
    (c) The record of decision may incorporate by reference material 
contained in a final environmental impact statement.

<R05>
Sec. 51.109  Public hearings in proceedings for issuance of materials
license with respect to a geologic repository.

    (a)(1) In a proceeding for issuance of a construction authorization 
for a high-level radioactive waste repository at a geologic repository 
operations area under parts 60 and 63 of this chapter, and in a 
proceeding for issuance of a license to receive and possess source, 
special nuclear, and byproduct material at a geologic repository 
operations area under parts 60 and 63 of this chapter, the NRC staff 
shall, upon the publication of the notice of hearing in the Federal 
Register, present its position on whether it is practicable to adopt, 
without further supplementation, the environmental impact statement 
(including any supplement thereto) prepared by the Secretary of Energy. 
If the position of the staff is that supplementation of the 
environmental impact statement by NRC is required, it shall file its 
final supplemental environmental impact statement with the Environmental 
Protection Agency, furnish that statement to commenting agencies, and 
make it available to the public, before presenting its position, or as 
soon thereafter as may be practicable. In discharging its 
responsibilities under this paragraph, the staff shall be guided by the 
principles set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (2) Any other party to the proceeding who contends that it is not 
practicable to adopt the DOE environmental impact statement, as it may 
have been supplemented, shall file a contention to that effect within 
thirty (30) days after the publication of the notice of hearing in the 
Federal Register. Such contention must be accompanied by one or more 
affidavits which set forth factual and/or technical bases for the claim 
that, under the principles set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, it is not practicable to adopt the DOE environmental impact 
statement, as it may have been supplemented. The presiding officer shall 
resolve disputes concerning adoption of the DOE environmental impact 
statement by using, to the extent possible, the criteria and procedures 
that are followed in ruling on motions to reopen under Sec. 2.326 of 
this chapter.
    (b) In any such proceeding, the presiding officer will determine 
those matters in controversy among the parties within the scope of NEPA 
and this subpart, specifically including whether, and to what extent, it 
is practicable to adopt the environmental impact statement prepared by 
the Secretary of Energy in connection with the issuance of a 
construction authorization and license for such repository.
    (c) The presiding officer will find that it is practicable to adopt 
any environmental impact statement prepared by the Secretary of Energy 
in connection with a geologic repository proposed to be constructed 
under Title I of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, 
unless:
    (1)(i) The action proposed to be taken by the Commission differs 
from the action proposed in the license application submitted by the 
Secretary of Energy; and
    (ii) The difference may significantly affect the quality of the 
human environment; or
    (2) Significant and substantial new information or new 
considerations render such environmental impact statement inadequate.
    (d) To the extent that the presiding officer determines it to be 
practicable, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, to adopt 
the environmental impact statement prepared by

[[Page 55]]

the Secretary of Energy, such adoption shall be deemed to satisfy all 
responsibilities of the Commission under NEPA and no further 
consideration under NEPA or this subpart shall be required.
    (e) To the extent that it is not practicable, in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section, to adopt the environmental impact 
statement prepared by the Secretary of Energy, the presiding officer 
will:
    (1) Determine whether the requirements of section 102(2) (A), (C), 
and (E) of NEPA and the regulations in this subpart have been met;
    (2) Independently consider the final balance among conflicting 
factors contained in the record of the proceeding with a view to 
determining the appropriate action to be taken;
    (3) Determine, after weighing the environmental, economic, technical 
and other benefits against environmental and other costs, whether the 
construction authorization or license should be issued, denied, or 
appropriately conditioned to protect environmental values;
    (4) Determine, in an uncontested proceeding, whether the NEPA review 
conducted by the NRC staff has been adequate; and
    (5) Determine, in a contested proceeding, whether in accordance with 
the regulations in this subpart, the construction authorization or 
license should be issued as proposed.
    (f) In making the determinations described in paragraph (e), the 
environmental impact statement will be deemed modified to the extent 
that findings and conclusions differ from those in the final statement 
prepared by the Secretary of Energy, as it may have been supplemented. 
The initial decision will be distributed to any persons not otherwise 
entitled to receive it who responded to the request in the notice of 
docketing, as described in Sec. 51.26(c). If the Commission or the 
Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board reaches conclusions different 
from those of the presiding officer with respect to such matters, the 
final environmental impact statement will be deemed modified to that 
extent and the decision will be similarly distributed.
    (g) The provisions of this section shall be followed, in place of 
those set out in Sec. 51.104, in any proceedings for the issuance of a 
license to receive and possess source, special nuclear, and byproduct 
material at a geologic repository operations area.

                             2. Cover sheet.

    The cover sheet will not exceed one page. It will include:
    (a) The name of the NRC office responsible for preparing the 
statement and a list of any cooperating agencies.
    (b) The title of the proposed action that is the subject of the 
statement with a list of the states, counties or municipalities where 
the facility or other subject of the action is located, as appropriate.
    (c) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual in NRC 
who can supply further information.
    (d) A designation of the statement as a draft or final statement, or 
a draft or final supplement.
    (e) A one paragraph abstract of the statement.
    (f) For draft environmental impact statements, the date by which 
comments must be received. This date may be specified in the form of the 
following or a substantially similar statement:
    ``Comments should be filed no later than \3\ days after the date on 
which the Environmental Protection Agency notice stating that the draft 
environmental impact statement has been filed with EPA is published in 
the Federal Register. Comments received after the expiration of the 
comment period will be considered if it is practical to do so but 
assurance of consideration of late comments cannot be given.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The number of days in the comment period should be inserted. The 
minimum comment period is 45 days (see Sec. 51.73.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               3. Summary.

    Each environmental impact statement will contain a summary which 
adequately and accurately summarizes the statement. The summary will 
stress the major issues considered. The summary will discuss the areas 
of controversy, will identify any remaining issues to be resolved, and 
will present the major conclusions and recommendations. The summary will 
normally not exceed 15 pages.

                   4. Purpose of and need for action.

    The statement will briefly describe and specify the need for the 
proposed action. The alternative of no action will be discussed. In the 
case of nuclear power plant construction or siting, consideration will 
be given to the potential impact of conservation measures in determining 
the demand for power and

[[Page 59]]

consequent need for additional generating capacity.

             5. Alternatives including the proposed action.

    This section is the heart of the environmental impact statement. It 
will present the environmental impacts of the proposal and the 
alternatives in comparative form. Where important to the comparative 
evaluation of alternatives, appropriate mitigating measures of the 
alternatives will be discussed. All reasonable alternatives will be 
identified. The range of alternatives discussed will encompass those 
proposed to be considered by the ultimate decisionmaker. An otherwise 
reasonable alternative will not be excluded from discussion solely on 
the ground that it is not within the jurisdiction of the NRC. \4\ The 
discussion of alternatives will take into accounts, without duplicating, 
the environmental information and analyses included in sections, 4., 6. 
and 7. of this appendix.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ With respect to limitations on NRC's NEPA authority and 
responsibility imposed by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
Amendments of 1972, see Sec. Sec. 51.10(c), 51.22(c)(17) and 51.71(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the draft environmental impact statement, this section will 
either include a preliminary recommendation on the action to be taken, 
or identify the alternatives under consideration.
    In the final environmental impact statement, this section will 
include a final recommendation on the action to be taken.

                        6. Affected environment.

    The environmental impact statement will succinctly describe the 
environment to be affected by the proposed action. Data and analyses in 
the statement will be commensurate with the importance of the impact, 
with less important material summarized, consolidated, or simply 
referenced. Effort and attention will be concentrated on important 
issues; useless bulk will be eliminated.

          7. Environmental consequences and mitigating actions.

    This section discusses the environmental consequences of 
alternatives, including the proposed actions and any mitigating actions 
which may be taken. Alternatives eliminated from detailed study will be 
identified and a discussion of those alternatives will be confined to a 
brief statement of the reasons why the alternatives were eliminated. The 
level of information for each alternative considered in detail will 
reflect the depth of analysis required for sound decisionmaking.
    The discussion will include any adverse environmental effects which 
cannot be avoided should the alternative be implemented, the 
relationship between short-term uses of man's environment and the 
maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and any 
irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources which would be 
involved in the alternative should it be implemented. This section will 
include discussions of:
    (a) Direct effects and their significance.
    (b) Indirect effects and their significance.
    (c) Possible conflicts between the alternative and the objectives of 
Federal, regional, State, and local (and in the case of a reservation, 
Indian tribe) land use plans, policies and controls for the area 
concerned.
    (d) Means to mitigate adverse environmental impacts.

                          8. List of preparers.

    The environmental impact statement will list the names and 
qualifications (expertise, experience, professional disciplines), of the 
persons who were primarily responsible for preparing the environmental 
impact statement or significant background papers. Persons responsible 
for making an independent evaluation of information submitted by the 
applicant or petitioner for rulemaking or others will be included in the 
list. Where possible, the persons who are responsible for a particular 
analysis, including analyses in background papers, will be identified.

                             9. Appendices.

    An appendix to an environmental impact statement will:
    (a) Consist of material prepared in connection with an environmental 
impact statement (as distinct from material which is not so prepared and 
which is incorporated by reference (40 CFR 1502.21)).
    (b) Normally consist of material which substantiates any analysis 
fundamental to the impact statement. Discussion of methodology used may 
be placed in an appendix.
    (c) Normally be analytic.
    (d) Be relevant to the decision to be made.
    (e) Be circulated with the environmental impact statement or be 
readily available on request.

                         Discussion of Footnotes

                               1. Tiering.

    40 CFR 1502.20 states:
    ``Agencies are encouraged to tier their environmental impact 
statements to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to 
focus on the actual issues ripe for decision at each level of 
environmental review (Sec. 1508.28). Whenever a broad environmental 
impact statement has been prepared (such as a program or policy 
statement) and a subsequent statement or environmental assessment is 
then prepared on an action included within the entire program or policy 
(such as a site specific action) the subsequent statement or 
environmental assessment need only

[[Page 60]]

summarize the issues discussed in the broader statement and incorporate 
discussions from the broader statement by reference and shall 
concentrate on the issues specific to the subsequent action. The 
subsequent document shall state where the earlier document is available. 
Tiering may also be appropriate for different stages of actions. (Sec. 
1508.28).''
    40 CFR 1508.28 states:
    `` `Tiering' refers to the coverage of general matters in broader 
environmental impact statements (such as national program or policy 
statements) with subsequent narrower statements or environmental 
analyses (such as regional or basinwide program statements or ultimately 
site-specific statements) incorporating by reference the general 
discussions and concentrating solely on the issues specific to the 
statement subsequently prepared. Tiering is appropriate when the 
sequence of statements or analyses is:
    ``(a) From a program, plan, or policy environmental impact statement 
to a program, plan, or policy statement or analysis of lesser scope or 
to a site-specific statement or analysis.
    ``(b) From an environmental impact statement on a specific action at 
an early stage (such as need and site selection) to a supplement (which 
is preferred) or a subsequent statement or analysis at a later stage 
(such as environmental mitigation). Tiering in such cases is appropriate 
when it helps the lead agency to focus on the issues which are ripe for 
decision and exclude from consideration issues already decided or not 
yet ripe.''
    Incorporation by reference. 40 CFR 1502.21 states:
    ``Agencies shall incorporate material into an environmental impact 
statement by reference when the effect will be to cut down on bulk 
without impeding agency and public review of the action. The 
incorporated material shall be cited in the statement and its content 
briefly described. No material may be incorporated by reference unless 
it is reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested 
persons within the time allowed for comment. Material based on 
proprietary data which is itself not available for review and comment 
shall not be incorporated by reference.''

                              2. Adoption.

    40 CFR 1506.3 states:
    ``(a) An agency may adopt a Federal draft or final environmental 
impact statement or portion thereof provided that the statement or 
portion thereof meets the standards for an adequate statement under 
these regulations.
    ``(b) If the actions covered by the original environmental impact 
statement and the proposed action are substantially the same, the agency 
adopting another agency's statement is not required to recirculate it 
except as a final statement. Otherwise the adopting agency shall treat 
the statement as a draft and recirculate it (except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section).
    ``(c) A cooperating agency may adopt without recirculating the 
environmental impact statement of a lead agency when, after an 
independent review of the statement, the cooperating agency concludes 
that its comments and suggestions have been satisfied.
    ``(d) When an agency adopts a statement which is not final within 
the agency that prepared it, or when the action it assesses is the 
subject of a referral under part 1504, or when the statement's adequacy 
is the subject of a judicial action which is not final, the agency shall 
so specify.''

    Sec. Appendix B to Subpart A of Part 51--Environmental Effect of 
         Renewing the Operating License of a Nuclear Power Plant

    The Commission has assessed the environmental impacts associated 
with granting a renewed operating license for a nuclear power plant to a 
licensee who holds either an operating license or construction permit as 
of June 30, 1995. Table B-1 summarizes the Commission's findings on the 
scope and magnitude of environmental impacts of renewing the operating 
license for a nuclear power plant as required by section 102(2) of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. Table B-1, 
subject to an evaluation of those issues identified in Category 2 as 
requiring further analysis and possible significant new information, 
represents the analysis of the environmental impacts associated with 
renewal of any operating license and is to be used in accordance with 
Sec. 51.95(c). On a 10-year cycle, the Commission intends to review the 
material in this appendix and update it if necessary. A scoping notice 
must be published in the Federal Register indicating the results of the 
NRC's review and inviting public comments and proposals for other areas 
that should be updated.

Design basis accidents.....................            1  SMALL. The NRC staff has concluded that the

                                                           of small significance for all plants.

                                                           economic impacts from severe accidents are small for
                                                           all plants. However, alternatives to mitigate severe
                                                           accidents must be considered for all plants that have

                                                           about 14,800 person rem, or 12 cancer fatalities, for

                                                           Much of this, especially the contribution of radon
                                                           releases from mines and tailing piles, consists of
                                                           tiny doses summed over large populations. This same
                                                           dose calculation can theoretically be extended to
                                                           include many tiny doses over additional thousands of
                                                           years as well as doses outside the U. S. The result
                                                           of such a calculation would be thousands of cancer
                                                           fatalities from the fuel cycle, but this result
                                                           assumes that even tiny doses have some statistical
                                                           adverse health effect which will not ever be
                                                           mitigated (for example no cancer cure in the next
                                                           thousand years), and that these doses projected over
                                                           thousands of years are meaningful. However, these
                                                           assumptions are questionable. In particular, science
                                                           cannot rule out the possibility that there will be no
                                                           cancer fatalities from these tiny doses. For
                                                           perspective, the doses are very small fractions of
                                                           regulatory limits, and even smaller fractions of
                                                           natural background exposure to the same populations.
                                                          Nevertheless, despite all the uncertainty, some
                                                           judgement as to the regulatory NEPA implications of
                                                           these matters should be made and it makes no sense to
                                                           repeat the same judgement in every case. Even taking
                                                           the uncertainties into account, the Commission
                                                           concludes that these impacts are acceptable in that
                                                           these impacts would not be sufficiently large to
                                                           require the NEPA conclusion, for any plant, that the
                                                           option of extended operation under 10 CFR Part 54
                                                           should be eliminated. Accordingly, while the
                                                           Commission has not assigned a single level of
                                                           significance for the collective effects of the fuel

                                                           the future as more is understood about the
                                                           performance of the proposed Yucca Mountain
                                                           repository. Such estimates would involve very great
                                                           uncertainty, especially with respect to cumulative
                                                           population doses over thousands of years. The

                                                           cumulative population impacts has not been
                                                           determined, although the report articulates the view
                                                           that protection of individuals will adequately
                                                           protect the population for a repository at Yucca
                                                           Mountain. However, EPA's generic repository standards
                                                           in 40 CFR part 191 generally provide an indication of
                                                           the order of magnitude of cumulative risk to
                                                           population that could result from the licensing of a
                                                           Yucca Mountain repository, assuming the ultimate
                                                           standards will be within the range of standards now
                                                           under consideration. The standards in 40 CFR part 191
                                                           protect the population by imposing ``containment
                                                           requirements'' that limit the cumulative amount of
                                                           radioactive material released over 10,000 years.
                                                           Reporting performance standards that will be required
                                                           by EPA are expected to result in releases and
                                                           associated health consequences in the range between
                                                           10 and 100 premature cancer deaths with an upper
                                                           limit of 1,000 premature cancer deaths world-wide for
                                                           a 100,000 metric tonne (MTHM) repository.
                                                          Nevertheless, despite all the uncertainty, some
                                                           judgement as to the regulatory NEPA implications of
                                                           these matters should be made and it makes no sense to
                                                           repeat the same judgement in every case. Even taking
                                                           the uncertainties into account, the Commission
                                                           concludes that these impacts are acceptable in that
                                                           these impacts would not be sufficiently large to
                                                           require the NEPA conclusion, for any plant, that the
                                                           option of extended operation under 10 CFR part 54
                                                           should be eliminated. Accordingly, while the
                                                           Commission has not assigned a single level of
                                                           significance for the impacts of spent fuel and high
                                                           level waste disposal, this issue is considered
                                                           Category 1.

Low-level waste storage and disposal.......            1  SMALL. The comprehensive regulatory controls that are
                                                           in place and the low public doses being achieved at
                                                           reactors ensure that the radiological impacts to the
                                                           environment will remain small during the term of a
                                                           renewed license. The maximum additional on-site land
                                                           that may be required for low-level waste storage
                                                           during the term of a renewed license and associated
                                                           impacts will be small. Nonradiological impacts on air
                                                           and water will be negligible. The radiological and
                                                           nonradiological environmental impacts of long-term
                                                           disposal of low-level waste from any individual plant
                                                           at licensed sites are small. In addition, the
                                                           Commission concludes that there is reasonable
                                                           assurance that sufficient low-level waste disposal
                                                           capacity will be made available when needed for
                                                           facilities to be decommissioned consistent with NRC
                                                           decommissioning requirements.
Mixed waste storage and disposal...........            1  SMALL. The comprehensive regulatory controls and the
                                                           facilities and procedures that are in place ensure
                                                           proper handling and storage, as well as negligible
                                                           doses and exposure to toxic materials for the public
                                                           and the environment at all plants. License renewal
                                                           will not increase the small, continuing risk to human
                                                           health and the environment posed by mixed waste at
                                                           all plants. The radiological and nonradiological
                                                           environmental impacts of long-term disposal of mixed
                                                           waste from any individual plant at licensed sites are
                                                           small. In addition, the Commission concludes that
                                                           there is reasonable assurance that sufficient mixed
                                                           waste disposal capacity will be made available when
                                                           needed for facilities to be decommissioned consistent
                                                           with NRC decommissioning requirements.
On-site spent fuel.........................            1  SMALL. The expected increase in the volume of spent
                                                           fuel from an additional 20 years of operation can be
                                                           safely accommodated on site with small environmental
                                                           effects through dry or pool storage at all plants if
                                                           a permanent repository or monitored retrievable

Nonradiological waste......................            1  SMALL. No changes to generating systems are
                                                           anticipated for license renewal. Facilities and
                                                           procedures are in place to ensure continued proper

Transportation.............................            1  SMALL. The impacts of transporting spent fuel enriched
                                                           up to 5 percent uranium-235 with average burnup for
                                                           the peak rod to current levels approved by NRC up to

Radiation doses............................            1  SMALL. Doses to the public will be well below
                                                           applicable regulatory standards regardless of which
                                                           decommissioning method is used. Occupational doses
                                                           would increase no more than 1 man-rem caused by
                                                           buildup of long-lived radionuclides during the

Waste management...........................            1  SMALL. Decommissioning at the end of a 20-year license
                                                           renewal period would generate no more solid wastes
                                                           than at the end of the current license term. No
                                                           increase in the quantities of Class C or greater than
                                                           Class C wastes would be expected.
Air quality................................            1  SMALL. Air quality impacts of decommissioning are
                                                           expected to be negligible either at the end of the
                                                           current operating term or at the end of the license

Water quality..............................            1  SMALL. The potential for significant water quality
                                                           impacts from erosion or spills is no greater whether

Environmental justice \6\..................       \4\ NA  NONE. The need for and the content of an analysis of
                                                           environmental justice will be addressed in plant-
                                                           specific reviews. \6\
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Data supporting this table are contained in NUREG-1437, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License
  Renewal of Nuclear Plants'' (May 1996) and NUREG-1437, Vol. 1, Addendum 1, ``Generic Environmental Impact
  Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants: Main Report Section 6.3--`Transportation,' Table 9.1 `Summary
  of findings on NEPA issues for license renewal of nuclear power plants,' Final Report'' (August 1999).
\2\ The numerical entries in this column are based on the following category definitions:
Category 1: For the issue, the analysis reported in the Generic Environmental Impact Statement has shown:
(1) The environmental impacts associated with the issue have been determined to apply either to all plants or,
  for some issues, to plants having a specific type of cooling system or other specified plant or site
  characteristic;
(2) A single significance level (i.e., small, moderate, or large) has been assigned to the impacts (except for
  collective off site radiological impacts from the fuel cycle and from high level waste and spent fuel
  disposal); and
(3) Mitigation of adverse impacts associated with the issue has been considered in the analysis, and it has been
  determined that additional plant-specific mitigation measures are likely not to be sufficiently beneficial to
  warrant implementation.
The generic analysis of the issue may be adopted in each plant-specific review.
Category 2: For the issue, the analysis reported in the Generic Environmental Impact Statement has shown that
  one or more of the criteria of Category 1 cannot be met, and therefore additional plant-specific review is
  required.
\3\ The impact findings in this column are based on the definitions of three significance levels. Unless the
  significance level is identified as beneficial, the impact is adverse, or in the case of ``small,'' may be
  negligible. The definitions of significance follow:
SMALL--For the issue, environmental effects are not detectable or are so minor that they will neither
  destabilize nor noticeably alter any important attribute of the resource. For the purposes of assessing
  radiological impacts, the Commission has concluded that those impacts that do not exceed permissible levels in
  the Commission's regulations are considered small as the term is used in this table.
MODERATE--For the issue, environmental effects are sufficient to alter noticeably, but not to destabilize,
  important attributes of the resource.
LARGE--For the issue, environmental effects are clearly noticeable and are sufficient to destabilize important
  attributes of the resource.
For issues where probability is a key consideration (i.e., accident consequences), probability was a factor in
  determining significance.
\4\ NA (not applicable). The categorization and impact finding definitions do not apply to these issues.
\5\ If, in the future, the Commission finds that, contrary to current indications, a consensus has been reached
  by appropriate Federal health agencies that there are adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields, the
  Commission will require applicants to submit plant-specific reviews of these health effects as part of their
  license renewal applications. Until such time, applicants for license renewal are not required to submit
  information on this issue.
\6\ Environmental Justice was not addressed in NUREG-1437, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License
  Renewal of Nuclear Plants,'' because guidance for implementing Executive Order 12898 issued on February 11,
  1994, was not available prior to completion of NUREG-1437. This issue will be addressed in individual license
  renewal reviews.

holder of or applicant for an approval, certification, permit, or 
license, or to a contractor, subcontractor, or consultant of any of 
them, components, equipment, materials, or other goods or services that 
relate to the activities of a holder of or applicant for an approval, 
certification, permit, or license, subject to this part, that they may 
be individually subject to NRC enforcement action for violation of the 
provisions in 10 CFR 52.4.
    (b) Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this part, the 
regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I apply to a holder of or applicant for an 
approval, certification, permit, or license. A holder of or applicant 
for an approval, certification, permit, or license issued under this 
part shall comply with all requirements in 10 CFR Chapter I that are 
applicable. A license, approval, certification, or permit issued under 
this part is subject to all requirements in 10 CFR Chapter I which, by 
their terms, are applicable to early site permits, design 
certifications, combined licenses, design approvals, or manufacturing 
licenses.


<R05>
Sec. 52.1  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this part--
    Combined license means a combined construction permit and operating 
license with conditions for a nuclear power facility issued under 
subpart C of this part.
    Decommission means to remove a facility or site safely from service 
and reduce residual radioactivity to a level that permits--
    (i) Release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of 
the license; or
    (ii) Release of the property under restricted conditions and 
termination of the license.
    Design characteristics are the actual features of a reactor or 
reactors. Design characteristics are specified in a standard design 
approval, a standard design certification, a combined license 
application, or a manufacturing license.
    Design parameters are the postulated features of a reactor or 
reactors that could be built at a proposed site. Design parameters are 
specified in an early site permit.
    Early site permit means a Commission approval, issued under subpart 
A of this part, for a site or sites for one or more nuclear power 
facilities. An early site permit is a partial construction permit.
    License means a license, including an early site permit, combined 
license or manufacturing license under this part or a renewed license 
issued by the Commission under this part or part 54 of this chapter.
    Licensee means a person who is authorized to conduct activities 
under a license issued by the Commission.
    Limited work authorization means the authorization provided by the 
Director of New Reactors or the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation 
under Sec. 50.10 of this chapter.
    Major feature of the emergency plans means an aspect of those plans 
necessary to:
    (i) Address in whole or part one or more of the 16 standards in 10 
CFR 50.47(b); or
    (ii) Describe the emergency planning zones as required in 10 CFR 
50.33(g).
    Manufacturing license means a license, issued under subpart F of 
this part, authorizing the manufacture of nuclear power reactors but not 
their construction, installation, or operation at the sites on which the 
reactors are to be operated.
    Modular design means a nuclear power station that consists of two or 
more essentially identical nuclear reactors (modules) and each module is 
a separate nuclear reactor capable of being operated independent of the 
state

[[Page 71]]

of completion or operating condition of any other module co-located on 
the same site, even though the nuclear power station may have some 
shared or common systems.
    Prototype plant means a nuclear power plant that is used to test new 
safety features, such as the testing required under 10 CFR 50.43(e). The 
prototype plant is similar to a first-of-a-kind or standard plant design 
in all features and size, but may include additional safety features to 
protect the public and the plant staff from the possible consequences of 
accidents during the testing period.
    Site characteristics are the actual physical, environmental and 
demographic features of a site. Site characteristics are specified in an 
early site permit or in a final safety analysis report for a combined 
license.
    Site parameters are the postulated physical, environmental and 
demographic features of an assumed site. Site parameters are specified 
in a standard design approval, standard design certification, or 
manufacturing license.
    Standard design means a design which is sufficiently detailed and 
complete to support certification or approval in accordance with subpart 
B or E of this part, and which is usable for a multiple number of units 
or at a multiple number of sites without reopening or repeating the 
review.
    Standard design approval or design approval means an NRC staff 
approval, issued under subpart E of this part, of a final standard 
design for a nuclear power reactor of the type described in 10 CFR 
50.22. The approval may be for either the final design for the entire 
reactor facility or the final design of major portions thereof.
    Standard design certification or design certification means a 
Commission approval, issued under subpart B of this part, of a final 
standard design for a nuclear power facility. This design may be 
referred to as a certified standard design.
    (b) All other terms in this part have the meaning set out in 10 CFR 
50.2, or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act, as applicable.

procedures in 10 CFR part 2, subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 52.5  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, holder of a standard 
design approval, an applicant for a license, standard design 
certification, or standard design approval, a contractor or 
subcontractor of a Commission licensee, holder of a standard design 
approval, applicant for a license, standard design certification, or 
standard design approval, against an employee for engaging in certain 
protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes discharge 
and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 
Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in 
general are related to the administration or enforcement of a 
requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy 
Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in the 
introductory text of paragraph (a) of this section or possible 
violations of requirements imposed under either of those statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in the introductory text of paragraph (a) of this 
section or under these requirements if the employee has identified the 
alleged illegality to the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in the introductory text of 
paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

[[Page 75]]

    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraph (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, a holder of a standard design approval, an 
applicant for a Commission license, standard design certification, or a 
standard design approval, or a contractor or subcontractor of a 
Commission licensee, holder of a standard design approval, or any 
applicant may be grounds for--
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license or standard 
design approval;
    (2) Withdrawal or revocation of a proposed or final standard design 
certification;
    (3) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee, holder of a 
standard design approval, or applicant (including an applicant for a 
standard design certification under this part following Commission 
adoption of final design certification rule) or a contractor or 
subcontractor of the licensee, holder of a standard design approval, or 
applicant.
    (4) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect 
an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.
    (e)(1) Each licensee, each holder of a standard design approval, and 
each applicant for a license, standard design certification, or standard 
design approval, shall prominently post the revision of NRC Form 3, 
``Notice to Employees,'' referenced in 10 CFR 19.11(e). This form must 
be posted at locations sufficient to permit employees protected by this 
section to observe a copy on the way to or from their place of work. 
Premises must be posted not later than thirty (30) days after an 
application is docketed and remain posted while the application is 
pending before the Commission, during the term of the license, standard 
design certification, or standard design approval under 10 CFR part 52, 
and for 30 days following license termination or the expiration or 
termination of the standard design certification or standard design 
approval under 10 CFR part 52.
    (2) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in appendix D to part 20 of this chapter, by 
calling (301) 415-7232, via e-mail to FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov, or by 
visiting the NRC's Web site at http://www.nrc.gov and selecting forms 
from the index found on the NRC's home page.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor under Section 211 of 
the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain any 
provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an 
employee from participating in protected activity as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section including, but not limited to, 
providing information to the NRC or to his or her employer on potential 
violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.
    (g) Part 19 of this chapter sets forth requirements and regulatory 
provisions applicable to licensees, holders of a standard design 
approval, applicants for a license, standard design certification, or 
standard design approval, and contractors or subcontractors of a 
Commission licensee, or holder of a

[[Page 76]]

standard design approval, and are in addition to the requirements in 
this section.

                      Subpart A_Early Site Permits


<R05>
Sec. 52.12  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets out the requirements and procedures applicable to 
Commission issuance of an early site permit for approval of a site for 
one or more nuclear power facilities separate from the filing of an 
application for a construction permit or combined license for the 
facility.


<R05>
Sec. 52.13  Relationship to other subparts.

    This subpart applies when any person who may apply for a 
construction permit under 10 CFR part 50, or for a combined license 
under this part seeks an early site permit from the Commission 
separately from an application for a construction permit or a combined 
license.


<R05>
Sec. 52.15  Filing of applications.

    (a) Any person who may apply for a construction permit under 10 CFR 
part 50, or for a combined license under this part, may file an 
application for an early site permit with the Director, Office of New 
Reactors, or the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, as 
appropriate. An application for an early site permit may be filed 
notwithstanding the fact that an application for a construction permit 
or a combined license has not been filed in connection with the site for 
which a permit is sought.
    (b) The application must comply with the applicable filing 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 52.3 and 50.30 of this chapter.
    (c) The fees associated with the filing and review of an application 
for the initial issuance or renewal of an early site permit are set 
forth in 10 CFR part 170.


<R05>
Sec. 52.16  Contents of applications; general information.

    The application must contain all of the information required by 10 
CFR 50.33(a) through (d) and (j) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 52.17  Contents of applications; technical information.

    (a) For applications submitted before September 27, 2007, the rule 
provisions in effect at the date of docketing apply unless otherwise 
requested by the applicant in writing. The application must contain:
    (1) A site safety analysis report. The site safety analysis report 
shall include the following:
    (i) The specific number, type, and thermal power level of the 
facilities, or range of possible facilities, for which the site may be 
used;
    (ii) The anticipated maximum levels of radiological and thermal 
effluents each facility will produce;
    (iii) The type of cooling systems, intakes, and outflows that may be 
associated with each facility;
    (iv) The boundaries of the site;

[[Page 78]]

    (v) The proposed general location of each facility on the site;
    (vi) The seismic, meteorological, hydrologic, and geologic 
characteristics of the proposed site with appropriate consideration of 
the most severe of the natural phenomena that have been historically 
reported for the site and surrounding area and with sufficient margin 
for the limited accuracy, quantity, and period of time in which the 
historical data have been accumulated;
    (vii) The location and description of any nearby industrial, 
military, or transportation facilities and routes;
    (viii) The existing and projected future population profile of the 
area surrounding the site;
    (ix) A description and safety assessment of the site on which a 
facility is to be located. The assessment must contain an analysis and 
evaluation of the major structures, systems, and components of the 
facility that bear significantly on the acceptability of the site under 
the radiological consequence evaluation factors identified in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(ix)(A) and (a)(1)(ix)(B) of this section. In performing this 
assessment, an applicant shall assume a fission product release \1\ from 
the core into the containment assuming that the facility is operated at 
the ultimate power level contemplated. The applicant shall perform an 
evaluation and analysis of the postulated fission product release, using 
the expected demonstrable containment leak rate and any fission product 
cleanup systems intended to mitigate the consequences of the accidents, 
together with applicable site characteristics, including site 
meteorology, to evaluate the offsite radiological consequences. Site 
characteristics must comply with part 100 of this chapter. The 
evaluation must determine that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should 
be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site 
analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental 
events. Such accidents have generally been assumed to result in 
substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the 
containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (A) An individual located at any point on the boundary of the 
exclusion area for any 2 hour period following the onset of the 
postulated fission product release, would not receive a radiation dose 
in excess of 25 rem \2\ total effective dose equivalent (TEDE).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ A whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond 
numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for 
radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations at the time 
could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure 
status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, its use is not 
intended to imply that this number constitutes an acceptable limit for 
an emergency dose to the public under accident conditions. Rather, this 
dose value has been set forth in this section as a reference value, 
which can be used in the evaluation of plant design features with 
respect to postulated reactor accidents, to assure that these designs 
provide assurance of low risk of public exposure to radiation, in the 
event of an accidents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) An individual located at any point on the outer boundary of the 
low population zone, who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting 
from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of 
its passage) would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem 
TEDE;
    (x) Information demonstrating that site characteristics are such 
that adequate security plans and measures can be developed;
    (xi) For applications submitted after September 27, 2007, a 
description of the quality assurance program applied to site-related 
activities for the future design, fabrication, construction, and testing 
of the structures, systems, and components of a facility or facilities 
that may be constructed on the site. Appendix B to 10 CFR part 50 sets 
forth the requirements for quality assurance programs for nuclear power 
plants. The description of the quality assurance program for a nuclear 
power plant site shall include a discussion of how the applicable 
requirements of appendix B to part 50 of this chapter will be satisfied; 
and
    (xii) An evaluation of the site against applicable sections of the 
Standard Review Plan (SRP) revision in effect 6 months before the docket 
date of the application. The evaluation required by this section shall 
include an identification and description of all differences

[[Page 79]]

in analytical techniques and procedural measures proposed for a site and 
those corresponding techniques and measures given in the SRP acceptance 
criteria. Where such a difference exists, the evaluation shall discuss 
how the proposed alternative provides an acceptable method of complying 
with the Commission's regulations, or portions thereof, that underlie 
the corresponding SRP acceptance criteria. The SRP is not a substitute 
for the regulations, and compliance is not a requirement.
    (2) A complete environmental report as required by 10 CFR 51.50(b).
    (b)(1) The site safety analysis report must identify physical 
characteristics of the proposed site, such as egress limitations from 
the area surrounding the site, that could pose a significant impediment 
to the development of emergency plans. If physical characteristics are 
identified that could pose a significant impediment to the development 
of emergency plans, the application must identify measures that would, 
when implemented, mitigate or eliminate the significant impediment.
    (2) The site safety analysis report may also:
    (i) Propose major features of the emergency plans, in accordance 
with the pertinent standards of 10 CFR 50.47, and the requirements of 
appendix E to 10 CFR part 50, such as the exact size and configuration 
of the emergency planning zones, for review and approval by NRC, in 
consultation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the 
absence of complete and integrated emergency plans; or
    (ii) Propose complete and integrated emergency plans for review and 
approval by the NRC, in consultation with DHS, in accordance with the 
applicable standards of 10 CFR 50.47, and the requirements of appendix E 
to 10 CFR part 50. To the extent approval of emergency plans is sought, 
the application must contain the information required by Sec. Sec. 
50.33(g) and (j) of this chapter.
    (3) Emergency plans submitted under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section must include the proposed inspections, tests, and analyses that 
the holder of a combined license referencing the early site permit shall 
perform, and the acceptance criteria that are necessary and sufficient 
to provide reasonable assurance that, if the inspections, tests, and 
analyses are performed and the acceptance criteria met, the facility has 
been constructed and will be operated in conformity with the emergency 
plans, the provisions of the Act, and the Commission's rules and 
regulations. Major features of an emergency plan submitted under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may include proposed inspections, 
tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria.
    (4) Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) of this section, the site 
safety analysis report must include a description of contacts and 
arrangements made with Federal, State, and local governmental agencies 
with emergency planning responsibilities. The site safety analysis 
report must contain any certifications that have been obtained. If these 
certifications cannot be obtained, the site safety analysis report must 
contain information, including a utility plan, sufficient to show that 
the proposed plans provide reasonable assurance that adequate protective 
measures can and will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency 
at the site. Under the option set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section, the applicant shall make good faith efforts to obtain from the 
same governmental agencies certifications that:
    (i) The proposed emergency plans are practicable;
    (ii) These agencies are committed to participating in any further 
development of the plans, including any required field demonstrations, 
and
    (iii) That these agencies are committed to executing their 
responsibilities under the plans in the event of an emergency.
    (c) An applicant may request that a limited work authorization under 
10 CFR 50.10 be issued in conjunction with the early site permit. The 
application must include the information otherwise required by 10 CFR 
50.10(d)(3). Applications submitted before, and pending as of November 
8, 2007, must include the information required by Sec. 52.17(c) 
effective on the date of docketing.
    (d) Each applicant for an early site permit under this part shall 
protect

Sec. 52.18  Standards for review of applications.

    Applications filed under this subpart will be reviewed according to 
the applicable standards set out in 10 CFR part 50 and its appendices 
and 10 CFR part 100. In addition, the Commission shall prepare an 
environmental impact statement during review of the application, in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of 10 CFR part 51. The 
Commission shall determine, after consultation with DHS, whether the 
information required of the applicant by Sec. 52.17(b)(1) shows that 
there is no significant impediment to the development of emergency plans 
that cannot be mitigated or eliminated by measures proposed by the 
applicant, whether any major features of emergency plans submitted by 
the applicant under Sec. 52.17(b)(2)(i) are acceptable in accordance 
with the applicable standards of 10 CFR 50.47 and the requirements of 
appendix E to 10 CFR part 50, and whether any emergency plans submitted 
by the applicant under Sec. 52.17(b)(2)(ii) provide reasonable 
assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the 
event of a radiological emergency.


<R05>
Sec. 52.21  Administrative review of applications; hearings.

    An early site permit is subject to all procedural requirements in 10 
CFR part 2, including the requirements for docketing in Sec.

issuance of a notice of hearing in Sec. Sec. 2.104(a) and (d) of this 
chapter, provided that the designated sections may not be construed to 
require that the environmental report, or draft or final environmental 
impact statement include an assessment of the benefits of construction 
and operation of the reactor or reactors, or an analysis of alternative 
energy sources. The presiding officer in an early site permit hearing 
shall not admit contentions proffered by any party concerning an 
assessment of the benefits of construction and operation of the reactor 
or reactors, or an analysis of alternative energy sources if those 
issues were not addressed by the applicant in the early site permit 
application. All hearings conducted on applications for early site 
permits filed under this part are governed by the procedures contained 
in subparts C, G, L, and N of 10 CFR part 2, as applicable.

report to be submitted by the ACRS under Sec. 52.23, the Commission may 
issue an early site permit, in the form the Commission deems 
appropriate, if the Commission finds that:
    (1) An application for an early site permit meets the applicable 
standards and requirements of the Act and the Commission's regulations;
    (2) Notifications, if any, to other agencies or bodies have been 
duly made;
    (3) There is reasonable assurance that the site is in conformity 
with the provisions of the Act, and the Commission's regulations;
    (4) The applicant is technically qualified to engage in any 
activities authorized;
    (5) The proposed inspections, tests, analyses and acceptance 
criteria, including any on emergency planning, are necessary and 
sufficient, within the scope of the early site permit, to provide 
reasonable assurance that the facility has been constructed and will be 
operated in conformity with the license, the provisions of the Act, and 
the Commission's regulations;
    (6) Issuance of the permit will not be inimical to the common 
defense and security or to the health and safety of the public;

[[Page 81]]

    (7) Any significant adverse environmental impact resulting from 
activities requested under Sec. 52.17(c) can be redressed; and
    (8) The findings required by subpart A of 10 CFR part 51 have been 
made.
    (b) The early site permit must specify the site characteristics, 
design parameters, and terms and conditions of the early site permit the 
Commission deems appropriate. Before issuance of either a construction 
permit or combined license referencing an early site permit, the 
Commission shall find that any relevant terms and conditions of the 
early site permit have been met. Any terms or conditions of the early 
site permit that could not be met by the time of issuance of the 
construction permit or combined license, must be set forth as terms or 
conditions of the construction permit or combined license.
    (c) The early site permit shall specify those 10 CFR 50.10 
activities requested under Sec. 52.17(c) that the permit holder is 
authorized to perform.

<R05>
Sec. 52.25  Extent of activities permitted.

    If the activities authorized by Sec. 52.24(c) are performed and the 
site is not referenced in an application for a construction permit or a 
combined license issued under subpart C of this part while the permit 
remains valid, then the early site permit remains in effect solely for 
the purpose of site redress, and the holder of the permit shall redress 
the site in accordance with the terms of the site redress plan required 
by Sec. 52.17(c). If, before redress is complete, a use not envisaged 
in the redress plan is found for the site or parts thereof, the holder 
of the permit shall carry out the redress plan to the greatest extent 
possible consistent with the alternate use.


<R05>
Sec. 52.26  Duration of permit.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an early 
site permit issued under this subpart may be valid for not less than 10, 
nor more than 20 years from the date of issuance.
    (b) An early site permit continues to be valid beyond the date of 
expiration in any proceeding on a construction permit application or a 
combined license application that references the early site permit and 
is docketed before the date of expiration of the early site permit, or, 
if a timely application for renewal of the permit has been docketed, 
before the Commission has determined whether to renew the permit.
    (c) An applicant for a construction permit or combined license may, 
at its own risk, reference in its application a site for which an early 
site permit application has been docketed but not granted.
    (d) Upon issuance of a construction permit or combined license, a 
referenced early site permit is subsumed, to the extent referenced, into 
the construction permit or combined license.

<R05>
Sec. 52.28  Transfer of early site permit.

    An application to transfer an early site permit will be processed 
under 10 CFR 50.80.


<R05>
Sec. 52.29  Application for renewal.

    (a) Not less than 12, nor more than 36 months before the expiration 
date stated in the early site permit, or any later renewal period, the 
permit holder may apply for a renewal of the permit. An application for 
renewal must contain all information necessary to bring up to date the 
information and data contained in the previous application.
    (b) Any person whose interests may be affected by renewal of the 
permit may request a hearing on the application for renewal. The request 
for a hearing must comply with 10 CFR 2.309. If a hearing is granted, 
notice of the hearing will be published in accordance with 10 CFR 2.309.
    (c) An early site permit, either original or renewed, for which a 
timely application for renewal has been filed, remains in effect until 
the Commission

[[Page 82]]

has determined whether to renew the permit. If the permit is not 
renewed, it continues to be valid in certain proceedings in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 52.27(b).
    (d) The Commission shall refer a copy of the application for renewal 
to the ACRS. The ACRS shall report on those portions of the application 
which concern safety and shall apply the criteria set forth in Sec. 
52.31.


<R05>
Sec. 52.31  Criteria for renewal.

    (a) The Commission shall grant the renewal if it determines that:
    (1) The site complies with the Act, the Commission's regulations, 
and orders applicable and in effect at the time the site permit was 
originally issued; and
    (2) Any new requirements the Commission may wish to impose are:
    (i) Necessary for adequate protection to public health and safety or 
common defense and security;
    (ii) Necessary for compliance with the Commission's regulations, and 
orders applicable and in effect at the time the site permit was 
originally issued; or
    (iii) A substantial increase in overall protection of the public 
health and safety or the common defense and security to be derived from 
the new requirements, and the direct and indirect costs of 
implementation of those requirements are justified in view of this 
increased protection.
    (b) A denial of renewal for failure to comply with the provisions of 
Sec. 52.31(a) does not bar the permit holder or another applicant from 
filing a new application for the site which proposes changes to the site 
or the way that it is used to correct the deficiencies cited in the 
denial of the renewal.


<R05>
Sec. 52.33  Duration of renewal.

    Each renewal of an early site permit may be for not less than 10, 
nor more than 20 years, plus any remaining years on the early site 
permit then in effect before renewal.


<R05>
Sec. 52.35  Use of site for other purposes.

    A site for which an early site permit has been issued under this 
subpart may be used for purposes other than those described in the 
permit, including the location of other types of energy facilities. The 
permit holder shall inform the Director, Office of New Reactors or 
Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, as appropriate, 
(Director) of any significant uses for the site which have not been 
approved in the early site permit. The information about the activities 
must be given to the Director at least 30 days in advance of any actual 
construction or site modification for the activities. The information 
provided could be the basis for imposing new requirements on the permit, 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 52.39. If the permit holder 
informs the Director that the holder no longer intends to use the site 
for a nuclear power plant, the Director may terminate the permit.

[73 FR 5724, Jan. 31, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 52.39  Finality of early site permit determinations.

    (a) Commission finality. (1) Notwithstanding any provision in 10 CFR 
50.109, while an early site permit is in effect under Sec. Sec. 52.27 
or 52.33, the Commission may not change or impose new site 
characteristics, design parameters, or terms and conditions, including 
emergency planning requirements, on the early site permit unless the 
Commission:
    (i) Determines that a modification is necessary to bring the permit 
or the site into compliance with the Commission's regulations and orders 
applicable and in effect at the time the permit was issued;
    (ii) Determines the modification is necessary to assure adequate 
protection of the public health and safety or the common defense and 
security;
    (iii) Determines that a modification is necessary based on an update 
under paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (iv) Issues a variance requested under paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) In making the findings required for issuance of a construction 
permit or combined license, or the findings required by Sec. 52.103, or 
in any enforcement hearing other than one initiated by the Commission 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the application for the 
construction permit or combined license references an early site permit, 
the Commission shall treat as

[[Page 83]]

resolved those matters resolved in the proceeding on the application for 
issuance or renewal of the early site permit, except as provided for in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
    (i) If the early site permit approved an emergency plan (or major 
features thereof) that is in use by a licensee of a nuclear power plant, 
the Commission shall treat as resolved changes to the early site permit 
emergency plan (or major features thereof) that are identical to changes 
made to the licensee's emergency plans in compliance with Sec. 50.54(q) 
of this chapter occurring after issuance of the early site permit.
    (ii) If the early site permit approved an emergency plan (or major 
features thereof) that is not in use by a licensee of a nuclear power 
plant, the Commission shall treat as resolved changes that are 
equivalent to those that could be made under Sec. 50.54(q) of this 
chapter without prior NRC approval had the emergency plan been in use by 
a licensee.
    (b) Updating of early site permit-emergency preparedness. An 
applicant for a construction permit, operating license, or combined 
license who has filed an application referencing an early site permit 
issued under this subpart shall update the emergency preparedness 
information that was provided under Sec. 52.17(b), and discuss whether 
the updated information materially changes the bases for compliance with 
applicable NRC requirements.
    (c) Hearings and petitions. (1) In any proceeding for the issuance 
of a construction permit, operating license, or combined license 
referencing an early site permit, contentions on the following matters 
may be litigated in the same manner as other issues material to the 
proceeding:
    (i) The nuclear power reactor proposed to be built does not fit 
within one or more of the site characteristics or design parameters 
included in the early site permit;
    (ii) One or more of the terms and conditions of the early site 
permit have not been met;
    (iii) A variance requested under paragraph (d) of this section is 
unwarranted or should be modified;
    (iv) New or additional information is provided in the application 
that substantially alters the bases for a previous NRC conclusion or 
constitutes a sufficient basis for the Commission to modify or impose 
new terms and conditions related to emergency preparedness; or
    (v) Any significant environmental issue that was not resolved in the 
early site permit proceeding, or any issue involving the impacts of 
construction and operation of the facility that was resolved in the 
early site permit proceeding for which significant new information has 
been identified.
    (2) Any person may file a petition requesting that the site 
characteristics, design parameters, or terms and conditions of the early 
site permit should be modified, or that the permit should be suspended 
or revoked. The petition will be considered in accordance with Sec. 
2.206 of this chapter. Before construction commences, the Commission 
shall consider the petition and determine whether any immediate action 
is required. If the petition is granted, an appropriate order will be 
issued. Construction under the construction permit or combined license 
will not be affected by the granting of the petition unless the order is 
made immediately effective. Any change required by the Commission in 
response to the petition must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section.
    (d) Variances. An applicant for a construction permit, operating 
license, or combined license referencing an early site permit may 
include in its application a request for a variance from one or more 
site characteristics, design parameters, or terms and conditions of the 
early site permit, or from the site safety analysis report. In 
determining whether to grant the variance, the Commission shall apply 
the same technically relevant criteria applicable to the application for 
the original or renewed early site permit. Once a construction permit or 
combined license referencing an early site permit is issued, variances 
from the early site permit will not be granted for that construction 
permit or combined license.
    (e) Early site permit amendment. The holder of an early site permit 
may not make changes to the early site permit,

[[Page 84]]

including the site safety analysis report, without prior Commission 
approval. The request for a change to the early site permit must be in 
the form of an application for a license amendment, and must meet the 
requirements of 10 CFR 50.90 and 50.92.
    (f) Information requests. Except for information requests seeking to 
verify compliance with the current licensing basis of the early site 
permit, information requests to the holder of an early site permit must 
be evaluated before issuance to ensure that the burden to be imposed on 
respondents is justified in view of the potential safety significance of 
the issue to be addressed in the requested information. Each evaluation 
performed by the NRC staff must be in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(f), 
and must be approved by the Executive Director for Operations or his or 
her designee before issuance of the request.


<R04>
                Subpart B_Standard Design Certifications


<R05>
Sec. 52.41  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the requirements and procedures 
applicable to Commission issuance of rules granting standard design 
certifications for nuclear power facilities separate from the filing of 
an application for a construction permit or combined license for such a 
facility.
    (b)(1) Any person may seek a standard design certification for an 
essentially complete nuclear power plant design which is an evolutionary 
change from light water reactor designs of plants which have been 
licensed and in commercial operation before April 18, 1989.
    (2) Any person may also seek a standard design certification for a 
nuclear power plant design which differs significantly from the light 
water reactor designs described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or 
uses simplified, inherent, passive, or other innovative means to 
accomplish its safety functions.


<R05>
Sec. 52.43  Relationship to other subparts.

    (a) This subpart applies to a person that requests a standard design 
certification from the NRC separately from an application for a combined 
license filed under subpart C of this part for a nuclear power facility. 
An applicant for a combined license may reference a standard design 
certification.
    (b) Subpart E of this part governs the NRC staff review and approval 
of a final standard design. Subpart E may be used independently of the 
provisions in this subpart.
    (c) Subpart F of this part governs the issuance of licenses to 
manufacture nuclear power reactors to be installed and operated at sites 
not identified in the manufacturing license application. Subpart F may 
be used independently of the provisions in this subpart. However, an 
applicant for a manufacturing license under subpart F may reference a 
design certification.


<R05>
Sec. 52.45  Filing of applications.

    (a) An application for design certification may be filed 
notwithstanding the fact that an application for a construction permit, 
combined license, or manufacturing license for such a facility has not 
been filed.
    (b) The application must comply with the applicable filing 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 52.3 and Sec. Sec. 2.811 through 2.819 of 
this chapter.
    (c) The fees associated with the review of an application for the 
initial issuance or renewal of a standard design certification are set 
forth in 10 CFR part 170.


<R05>
Sec. 52.46  Contents of applications; general information.

    The application must contain all of the information required by 10 
CFR 50.33(a) through (c) and (j).


<R05>
Sec. 52.47  Contents of applications; technical information.

    The application must contain a level of design information 
sufficient to enable the Commission to judge the applicant's proposed 
means of assuring that construction conforms to the design and to reach 
a final conclusion on all safety questions associated with the design 
before the certification is granted. The information submitted for a 
design certification must include performance requirements and design 
information sufficiently detailed to permit the preparation of 
acceptance and inspection requirements by the NRC,

[[Page 85]]

and procurement specifications and construction and installation 
specifications by an applicant. The Commission will require, before 
design certification, that information normally contained in certain 
procurement specifications and construction and installation 
specifications be completed and available for audit if the information 
is necessary for the Commission to make its safety determination.
    (a) The application must contain a final safety analysis report 
(FSAR) that describes the facility, presents the design bases and the 
limits on its operation, and presents a safety analysis of the 
structures, systems, and components and of the facility as a whole, and 
must include the following information:
    (1) The site parameters postulated for the design, and an analysis 
and evaluation of the design in terms of those site parameters;
    (2) A description and analysis of the structures, systems, and 
components (SSCs) of the facility, with emphasis upon performance 
requirements, the bases, with technical justification therefor, upon 
which these requirements have been established, and the evaluations 
required to show that safety functions will be accomplished. It is 
expected that the standard plant will reflect through its design, 
construction, and operation an extremely low probability for accidents 
that could result in the release of significant quantities of 
radioactive fission products. The description shall be sufficient to 
permit understanding of the system designs and their relationship to the 
safety evaluations. Such items as the reactor core, reactor coolant 
system, instrumentation and control systems, electrical systems, 
containment system, other engineered safety features, auxiliary and 
emergency systems, power conversion systems, radioactive waste handling 
systems, and fuel handling systems shall be discussed insofar as they 
are pertinent. The following power reactor design characteristics will 
be taken into consideration by the Commission:
    (i) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power 
level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials;
    (ii) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards 
are applied to the design of the reactor;
    (iii) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual 
or enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the 
probability or consequences of accidental release of radioactive 
materials; and
    (iv) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility 
and those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident 
before a release of radioactive material to the environment can occur. 
Special attention must be directed to plant design features intended to 
mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents. In performing this 
assessment, an applicant shall assume a fission product release \3\ from 
the core into the containment assuming that the facility is operated at 
the ultimate power level contemplated. The applicant shall perform an 
evaluation and analysis of the postulated fission product release, using 
the expected demonstrable containment leak rate and any fission product 
cleanup systems intended to mitigate the consequences of the accidents, 
together with applicable postulated site parameters, including site 
meteorology, to evaluate the offsite radiological consequences. The 
evaluation must determine that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should 
be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site 
analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental 
events. These accidents have generally been assumed to result in 
substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the 
containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (A) An individual located at any point on the boundary of the 
exclusion area for any 2-hour period following the onset of the 
postulated fission product release, would not receive a radiation dose 
in excess of 25 rem \4\ total effective dose equivalent (TEDE);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ A whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond 
numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for 
radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations at the time 
could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure 
status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, its use is not 
intended to imply that this number constitutes an acceptable limit for 
an emergency dose to the public under accident conditions. This dose 
value has been set forth in this section as a reference value, which can 
be used in the evaluation of plant design features with respect to 
postulated reactor accidents, to assure that these designs provide 
assurance of low risk of public exposure to radiation, in the event of 
an accident.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 86]]

    (B) An individual located at any point on the outer boundary of the 
low population zone, who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting 
from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of 
its passage) would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem 
TEDE;
    (3) The design of the facility including:
    (i) The principal design criteria for the facility. Appendix A to 10 
CFR part 50, general design criteria (GDC), establishes minimum 
requirements for the principal design criteria for water-cooled nuclear 
power plants similar in design and location to plants for which 
construction permits have previously been issued by the Commission and 
provides guidance to applicants in establishing principal design 
criteria for other types of nuclear power units;
    (ii) The design bases and the relation of the design bases to the 
principal design criteria;
    (iii) Information relative to materials of construction, general 
arrangement, and approximate dimensions, sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurance that the design will conform to the design bases 
with an adequate margin for safety;
    (4) An analysis and evaluation of the design and performance of 
structures, systems, and components with the objective of assessing the 
risk to public health and safety resulting from operation of the 
facility and including determination of the margins of safety during 
normal operations and transient conditions anticipated during the life 
of the facility, and the adequacy of structures, systems, and components 
provided for the prevention of accidents and the mitigation of the 
consequences of accidents. Analysis and evaluation of emergency core 
cooling system (ECCS) cooling performance and the need for high-point 
vents following postulated loss-of-coolant accidents shall be performed 
in accordance with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 50.46 and 50.46a of 
this chapter;
    (5) The kinds and quantities of radioactive materials expected to be 
produced in the operation and the means for controlling and limiting 
radioactive effluents and radiation exposures within the limits set 
forth in part 20 of this chapter;
    (6) The information required by Sec. 20.1406 of this chapter;
    (7) The technical qualifications of the applicant to engage in the 
proposed activities in accordance with the regulations in this chapter;
    (8) The information necessary to demonstrate compliance with any 
technically relevant portions of the Three Mile Island requirements set 
forth in 10 CFR 50.34(f), except paragraphs (f)(1)(xii), (f)(2)(ix), and 
(f)(3)(v);
    (9) For applications for light-water-cooled nuclear power plants, an 
evaluation of the standard plant design against the Standard Review Plan 
(SRP) revision in effect 6 months before the docket date of the 
application. The evaluation required by this section shall include an 
identification and description of all differences in design features, 
analytical techniques, and procedural measures proposed for the design 
and those corresponding features, techniques, and measures given in the 
SRP acceptance criteria. Where a difference exists, the evaluation shall 
discuss how the proposed alternative provides an acceptable method of 
complying with the Commission's regulations, or portions thereof, that 
underlie the corresponding SRP acceptance criteria. The SRP is not a 
substitute for the regulations, and compliance is not a requirement.
    (10) The information with respect to the design of equipment to 
maintain control over radioactive materials in gaseous and liquid 
effluents produced during normal reactor operations described in 10 CFR 
50.34a(e);
    (11) Proposed technical specifications prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of Sec. Sec. 50.36 and 50.36a of this chapter;

[[Page 87]]

    (12) An analysis and description of the equipment and systems for 
combustible gas control as required by 10 CFR 50.44;
    (13) The list of electric equipment important to safety that is 
required by 10 CFR 50.49(d);
    (14) A description of protection provided against pressurized 
thermal shock events, including projected values of the reference 
temperature for reactor vessel beltline materials as defined in 10 CFR 
50.60 and 50.61;
    (15) Information demonstrating how the applicant will comply with 
requirements for reduction of risk from anticipated transients without 
scram events in Sec. 50.62;
    (16) A coping analysis, and any design features necessary to address 
station blackout, as required by 10 CFR 50.63;
    (17) Information demonstrating how the applicant will comply with 
requirements for criticality accidents in Sec. 50.68(b)(2)-(b)(4);
    (18) A description and analysis of the fire protection design 
features for the standard plant necessary to comply with 10 CFR part 50, 
appendix A, GDC 3, and Sec. 50.48 of this chapter;
    (19) A description of the quality assurance program applied to the 
design of the structures, systems, and components of the facility. 
Appendix B to 10 CFR part 50, ``Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear 
Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants,'' sets forth the requirements 
for quality assurance programs for nuclear power plants. The description 
of the quality assurance program for a nuclear power plant shall include 
a discussion of how the applicable requirements of appendix B to 10 CFR 
part 50 were satisfied;
    (20) The information necessary to demonstrate that the standard 
plant complies with the earthquake engineering criteria in 10 CFR part 
50, appendix S;
    (21) Proposed technical resolutions of those Unresolved Safety 
Issues and medium- and high-priority generic safety issues which are 
identified in the version of NUREG-0933 current on the date up to 6 
months before the docket date of the application and which are 
technically relevant to the design;
    (22) The information necessary to demonstrate how operating 
experience insights have been incorporated into the plant design;
    (23) For light-water reactor designs, a description and analysis of 
design features for the prevention and mitigation of severe accidents, 
e.g., challenges to containment integrity caused by core-concrete 
interaction, steam explosion, high-pressure core melt ejection, hydrogen 
combustion, and containment bypass;
    (24) A representative conceptual design for those portions of the 
plant for which the application does not seek certification, to aid the 
NRC in its review of the FSAR and to permit assessment of the adequacy 
of the interface requirements in paragraph (a)(25) of this section;
    (25) The interface requirements to be met by those portions of the 
plant for which the application does not seek certification. These 
requirements must be sufficiently detailed to allow completion of the 
FSAR;
    (26) Justification that compliance with the interface requirements 
of paragraph (a)(25) of this section is verifiable through inspections, 
tests, or analyses. The method to be used for verification of interface 
requirements must be included as part of the proposed ITAAC required by 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (27) A description of the design-specific probabilistic risk 
assessment (PRA) and its results.
    (28) For applications for standard design certifications which are 
subject to 10 CFR 50.150(a), the information required by 10 CFR 
50.150(b).
    (b) The application must also contain:
    (1) The proposed inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance 
criteria that are necessary and sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurance that, if the inspections, tests, and analyses are performed 
and the acceptance criteria met, a facility that incorporates the design 
certification has been constructed and will be operated in conformity 
with the design certification, the provisions of the Act, and the 
Commission's rules and regulations; and
    (2) An environmental report as required by 10 CFR 51.55.

[[Page 88]]

    (c) This paragraph applies, according to its provisions, to 
particular applications:
    (1) An application for certification of a nuclear power reactor 
design that is an evolutionary change from light-water reactor designs 
of plants that have been licensed and in commercial operation before 
April 18, 1989, must provide an essentially complete nuclear power plant 
design except for site-specific elements such as the service water 
intake structure and the ultimate heat sink;
    (2) An application for certification of a nuclear power reactor 
design that differs significantly from the light-water reactor designs 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or uses simplified, 
inherent, passive, or other innovative means to accomplish its safety 
functions must provide an essentially complete nuclear power reactor 
design except for site-specific elements such as the service water 
intake structure and the ultimate heat sink, and must meet the 
requirements of 10 CFR 50.43(e); and
    (3) An application for certification of a modular nuclear power 
reactor design must describe and analyze the possible operating 
configurations of the reactor modules with common systems, interface 
requirements, and system interactions. The final safety analysis must 
also account for differences among the configurations, including any 
restrictions that will be necessary during the construction and startup 
of a given module to ensure the safe operation of any module already 
operating.
    (d) Each applicant for a standard design certification under this 
part shall protect Safeguards Information against unauthorized

Sec. 52.48  Standards for review of applications.

    Applications filed under this subpart will be reviewed for 
compliance with the standards set out in 10 CFR parts 20, 50 and its 
appendices, 51, 73, and 100.


<R05>
Sec. 52.51  Administrative review of applications.

    (a) A standard design certification is a rule that will be issued in 
accordance with the provisions of subpart H of 10 CFR part 2, as 
supplemented by the provisions of this section. The Commission shall 
initiate the rulemaking after an application has been filed under Sec. 
52.45 and shall specify the procedures to be used for the rulemaking. 
The notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register must 
provide an opportunity for the submission of comments on the proposed 
design certification rule. If, at the time a proposed design 
certification rule is published in the Federal Register under this 
paragraph (a), the Commission decides that a legislative hearing should 
be held, the information required by 10 CFR 2.1502(c) must be included 
in the Federal Register document for the proposed design certification.
    (b) Following the submission of comments on the proposed design 
certification rule, the Commission may, at its discretion, hold a 
legislative hearing under the procedures in subpart O of part 2 of this 
chapter. The Commission shall publish a document in the Federal Register 
of its decision to hold a legislative hearing. The document shall 
contain the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and 
specify whether the Commission or a presiding officer will conduct the 
legislative hearing.
    (c) Notwithstanding anything in 10 CFR 2.390 to the contrary, 
proprietary information will be protected in the same manner and to the 
same extent as proprietary information submitted in connection with 
applications for licenses, provided that the design certification shall 
be published in Chapter I of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 52.53  Referral to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards 
(ACRS).

    The Commission shall refer a copy of the application to the ACRS. 
The ACRS shall report on those portions of the application which concern 
safety.

<R05>
Sec. 52.54  Issuance of standard design certification.

    (a) After conducting a rulemaking proceeding under Sec. 52.51 on an 
application for a standard design certification and receiving the report 
to be submitted by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards under 
Sec. 52.53, the Commission may issue a standard design certification in 
the form of a rule for the design which is the subject of the 
application, if the Commission determines that:
    (1) The application meets the applicable standards and requirements 
of the Atomic Energy Act and the Commission's regulations;
    (2) Notifications, if any, to other agencies or bodies have been 
duly made;
    (3) There is reasonable assurance that the standard design conforms 
with the provisions of the Act, and the Commission's regulations;
    (4) The applicant is technically qualified;
    (5) The proposed inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance 
criteria are necessary and sufficient, within the scope of the standard 
design, to provide reasonable assurance that, if the inspections, tests, 
and analyses are performed and the acceptance criteria met, the facility 
has been constructed and will be operated in accordance with the design 
certification, the provisions of the Act, and the Commission's 
regulations;
    (6) Issuance of the standard design certification will not be 
inimical to the common defense and security or to the health and safety 
of the public;
    (7) The findings required by subpart A of part 51 of this chapter 
have been made; and
    (8) The applicant has implemented the quality assurance program 
described or referenced in the safety analysis report.
    (b) The design certification rule must specify the site parameters, 
design characteristics, and any additional requirements and restrictions 
of the design certification rule.
    (c) After the Commission has adopted a final design certification 
rule, the applicant shall not permit any individual to have access to or 
any facility to possess restricted data or classified National Security 
Information until the individual and/or facility has been approved for 
access under the provisions of 10 CFR parts 25 and/or 95, as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 52.55  Duration of certification.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a standard 
design certification issued under this subpart is valid for 15 years 
from the date of issuance.
    (b) A standard design certification continues to be valid beyond the 
date of expiration in any proceeding on an application for a combined 
license or an operating license that references the standard design 
certification and is docketed either before the date of expiration of 
the certification, or, if a timely application for renewal of the 
certification has been filed, before the Commission has determined 
whether to renew the certification. A design certification also 
continues to be valid beyond the date of expiration in any hearing held 
under Sec. 52.103 before operation begins under a combined license that 
references the design certification.
    (c) An applicant for a construction permit or a combined license 
may, at its own risk, reference in its application a design for which a 
design certification application has been docketed but not granted.


<R05>
Sec. 52.57  Application for renewal.

    (a) Not less than 12 nor more than 36 months before the expiration 
of the initial 15-year period, or any later renewal period, any person 
may apply for renewal of the certification. An application for renewal 
must contain all information necessary to bring up to date the 
information and data contained in the previous application. The 
Commission will require, before renewal of certification, that 
information normally contained in certain procurement specifications and 
construction and installation specifications be completed and available 
for audit if this information is necessary for the Commission to make 
its safety determination. Notice and comment procedures must be used for 
a rulemaking

[[Page 90]]

proceeding on the application for renewal. The Commission, in its 
discretion, may require the use of additional procedures in individual 
renewal proceedings.
    (b) A design certification, either original or renewed, for which a 
timely application for renewal has been filed remains in effect until 
the Commission has determined whether to renew the certification. If the 
certification is not renewed, it continues to be valid in certain 
proceedings, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 52.55.
    (c) The Commission shall refer a copy of the application for renewal 
to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS). The ACRS shall 
report on those portions of the application which concern safety and 
shall apply the criteria set forth in Sec. 52.59.


<R05>
Sec. 52.59  Criteria for renewal.

    (a) The Commission shall issue a rule granting the renewal if the 
design, either as originally certified or as modified during the 
rulemaking on the renewal, complies with the Atomic Energy Act and the 
Commission's regulations applicable and in effect at the time the 
certification was issued, provided, however, that the first time the 
Commission issues a rule granting the renewal for a standard design 
certification in effect on July 13, 2009, the Commission shall, in 
addition, find that the renewed design complies with the applicable 
requirements of 10 CFR 50.150.
    (b) The Commission may impose other requirements if it determines 
that:
    (1) They are necessary for adequate protection to public health and 
safety or common defense and security;
    (2) They are necessary for compliance with the Commission's 
regulations and orders applicable and in effect at the time the design 
certification was issued; or
    (3) There is a substantial increase in overall protection of the 
public health and safety or the common defense and security to be 
derived from the new requirements, and the direct and indirect costs of 
implementing those requirements are justified in view of this increased 
protection.
    (c) In addition, the applicant for renewal may request an amendment 
to the design certification. The Commission shall grant the amendment 
request if it determines that the amendment will comply with the Atomic 
Energy Act and the Commission's regulations in effect at the time of 
renewal. If the amendment request entails such an extensive change to 
the design certification that an essentially new standard design is 
being proposed, an application for a design certification must be filed 
in accordance with this subpart.
    (d) Denial of renewal does not bar the applicant, or another 
applicant, from filing a new application for certification of the 
design, which proposes design changes that correct the deficiencies 
cited in the denial of the renewal.

[72 FR 49517, Aug. 28, 2007, as amended at 74 FR 28147, June 12, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 52.61  Duration of renewal.

    Each renewal of certification for a standard design will be for not 
less than 10, nor more than 15 years.


<R05>
Sec. 52.63  Finality of standard design certifications.

    (a)(1) Notwithstanding any provision in 10 CFR 50.109, while a 
standard design certification rule is in effect under Sec. Sec. 52.55 
or 52.61, the Commission may not modify, rescind, or impose new 
requirements on the certification information, whether on its own 
motion, or in response to a petition from any person, unless the 
Commission determines in a rulemaking that the change:
    (i) Is necessary either to bring the certification information or 
the referencing plants into compliance with the Commission's regulations 
applicable and in effect at the time the certification was issued;
    (ii) Is necessary to provide adequate protection of the public 
health and safety or the common defense and security;
    (iii) Reduces unnecessary regulatory burden and maintains protection 
to public health and safety and the common defense and security;

[[Page 91]]

    (iv) Provides the detailed design information to be verified under 
those inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC) 
which are directed at certification information (i.e., design acceptance 
criteria);
    (v) Is necessary to correct material errors in the certification 
information;
    (vi) Substantially increases overall safety, reliability, or 
security of facility design, construction, or operation, and the direct 
and indirect costs of implementation of the rule change are justified in 
view of this increased safety, reliability, or security; or
    (vii) Contributes to increased standardization of the certification 
information.
    (2)(i) In a rulemaking under Sec. 52.63(a)(1), except for Sec. 
52.63(a)(1)(ii), the Commission will give consideration to whether the 
benefits justify the costs for plants that are already licensed or for 
which an application for a permit or license is under consideration.
    (ii) The rulemaking procedures for changes under Sec. 52.63(a)(1) 
must provide for notice and opportunity for public comment.
    (3) Any modification the NRC imposes on a design certification rule 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be applied to all plants 
referencing the certified design, except those to which the modification 
has been rendered technically irrelevant by action taken under 
paragraphs (a)(4) or (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) The Commission may not impose new requirements by plant-specific 
order on any part of the design of a specific plant referencing the 
design certification rule if that part was approved in the design 
certification while a design certification rule is in effect under Sec. 
52.55 or Sec. 52.61, unless:
    (i) A modification is necessary to secure compliance with the 
Commission's regulations applicable and in effect at the time the 
certification was issued, or to assure adequate protection of the public 
health and safety or the common defense and security; and
    (ii) Special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 52.7 are present. In 
addition to the factors listed in Sec. 52.7, the Commission shall 
consider whether the special circumstances which Sec. 52.7 requires to 
be present outweigh any decrease in safety that may result from the 
reduction in standardization caused by the plant-specific order.
    (5) Except as provided in 10 CFR 2.335, in making the findings 
required for issuance of a combined license, construction permit, 
operating license, or manufacturing license, or for any hearing under 
Sec. 52.103, the Commission shall treat as resolved those matters 
resolved in connection with the issuance or renewal of a design 
certification rule.
    (b)(1) An applicant or licensee who references a design 
certification rule may request an exemption from one or more elements of 
the certification information. The Commission may grant such a request 
only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the 
requirements of Sec. 52.7. In addition to the factors listed in Sec. 
52.7, the Commission shall consider whether the special circumstances 
that Sec. 52.7 requires to be present outweigh any decrease in safety 
that may result from the reduction in standardization caused by the 
exemption. The granting of an exemption on request of an applicant is 
subject to litigation in the same manner as other issues in the 
operating license or combined license hearing.
    (2) Subject to Sec. 50.59 of this chapter, a licensee who 
references a design certification rule may make departures from the 
design of the nuclear power facility, without prior Commission approval, 
unless the proposed departure involves a change to the design as 
described in the rule certifying the design. The licensee shall maintain 
records of all departures from the facility and these records must be 
maintained and available for audit until the date of termination of the 
license.
    (c) The Commission will require, before granting a construction 
permit, combined license, operating license, or manufacturing license 
which references a design certification rule, that information normally 
contained in certain procurement specifications and construction and 
installation specifications be completed and available for audit if the 
information is necessary for the Commission to make its safety

[[Page 92]]

determinations, including the determination that the application is 
consistent with the certification information. This information may be 
acquired by appropriate arrangements with the design certification 
applicant.

                       Subpart C_Combined Licenses


<R05>
Sec. 52.71  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets out the requirements and procedures applicable to 
Commission issuance of combined licenses for nuclear power facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 52.73  Relationship to other subparts.

    (a) An application for a combined license under this subpart may, 
but need not, reference a standard design certification, standard design 
approval, or manufacturing license issued under subparts B, E, or F of 
this part, respectively, or an early site permit issued under subpart A 
of this part. In the absence of a demonstration that an entity other 
than the one originally sponsoring and obtaining a design certification 
is qualified to supply a design, the Commission will entertain an 
application for a combined license that references a standard design 
certification issued under subpart B of this part only if the entity 
that sponsored and obtained the certification supplies the design for 
the applicant's use.
    (b) The Commission will require, before granting a combined license 
that references a standard design certification, that information 
normally contained in certain procurement specifications and 
construction and installation specifications be completed and available 
for audit if the information is necessary for the Commission to make its 
safety determinations, including the determination that the application 
is consistent with the certification information.


<R05>
Sec. 52.75  Filing of applications.

    (a) Any person except one excluded by Sec. 50.38 of this chapter 
may file an application for a combined license for a nuclear power 
facility with the Director, Office of New Reactors or Director, Office 
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, as appropriate.
    (b) The application must comply with the applicable filing 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 52.3 and 50.30 of this chapter.
    (c) The fees associated with the filing and review of the 
application are set forth in 10 CFR part 170.

[72 FR 49517, Aug. 28, 2007, as amended at 73 FR 5724, Jan. 31, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 52.77  Contents of applications; general information.

    The application must contain all of the information required by 10 
CFR 50.33.


<R05>
Sec. 52.79  Contents of applications; technical information in final
safety analysis report.

    (a) The application must contain a final safety analysis report that 
describes the facility, presents the design bases and the limits on its 
operation, and presents a safety analysis of the structures, systems, 
and components of the facility as a whole. The final safety analysis 
report shall include the following information, at a level of 
information sufficient to enable the Commission to reach a final 
conclusion on all safety matters that must be resolved by the Commission 
before issuance of a combined license:
    (1)(i) The boundaries of the site;
    (ii) The proposed general location of each facility on the site;
    (iii) The seismic, meteorological, hydrologic, and geologic 
characteristics of the proposed site with appropriate consideration of 
the most severe of the natural phenomena that have been historically 
reported for the site and surrounding area and with sufficient margin 
for the limited accuracy, quantity, and time in which the historical 
data have been accumulated;
    (iv) The location and description of any nearby industrial, 
military, or transportation facilities and routes;
    (v) The existing and projected future population profile of the area 
surrounding the site;
    (vi) A description and safety assessment of the site on which the 
facility is to be located. The assessment must contain an analysis and 
evaluation of the major structures, systems, and components of the 
facility that bear significantly on the acceptability of

[[Page 93]]

the site under the radiological consequence evaluation factors 
identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(vi)(A) and (a)(1)(vi)(B) of this 
section. In performing this assessment, an applicant shall assume a 
fission product release \5\ from the core into the containment assuming 
that the facility is operated at the ultimate power level contemplated. 
The applicant shall perform an evaluation and analysis of the postulated 
fission product release, using the expected demonstrable containment 
leak rate and any fission product cleanup systems intended to mitigate 
the consequences of the accidents, together with applicable site 
characteristics, including site meteorology, to evaluate the offsite 
radiological consequences. Site characteristics must comply with part 
100 of this chapter. The evaluation must determine that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should 
be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site 
analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental 
events. These accidents have generally been assumed to result in 
substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the 
containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (A) An individual located at any point on the boundary of the 
exclusion area for any 2-hour period following the onset of the 
postulated fission product release, would not receive a radiation dose 
in excess of 25 rem \6\ total effective dose equivalent (TEDE).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ A whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond 
numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for 
radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations at the time 
could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure 
status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, its use is not 
intended to imply that this number constitutes an acceptable limit for 
an emergency dose to the public under accident conditions. Rather, this 
dose value has been set forth in this section as a reference value, 
which can be used in the evaluation of plant design features with 
respect to postulated reactor accidents, to assure that these designs 
provide assurance of low risk of public exposure to radiation, in the 
event of an accident.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) An individual located at any point on the outer boundary of the 
low population zone, who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting 
from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of 
its passage) would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem 
TEDE; and
    (2) A description and analysis of the structures, systems, and 
components of the facility with emphasis upon performance requirements, 
the bases, with technical justification therefor, upon which these 
requirements have been established, and the evaluations required to show 
that safety functions will be accomplished. It is expected that reactors 
will reflect through their design, construction, and operation an 
extremely low probability for accidents that could result in the release 
of significant quantities of radioactive fission products. The 
descriptions shall be sufficient to permit understanding of the system 
designs and their relationship to safety evaluations. Items such as the 
reactor core, reactor coolant system, instrumentation and control 
systems, electrical systems, containment system, other engineered safety 
features, auxiliary and emergency systems, power conversion systems, 
radioactive waste handling systems, and fuel handling systems shall be 
discussed insofar as they are pertinent. The following power reactor 
design characteristics and proposed operation will be taken into 
consideration by the Commission:
    (i) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power 
level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials;
    (ii) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards 
are applied to the design of the reactor;
    (iii) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual 
or enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the 
probability or consequences of accidental release of radioactive 
materials;
    (iv) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility 
and those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident 
before a release of radioactive material to the environment can occur. 
Special attention must be directed to plant design features intended to 
mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents. In

[[Page 94]]

performing this assessment, an applicant shall assume a fission product 
release \7\ from the core into the containment assuming that the 
facility is operated at the ultimate power level contemplated;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should 
be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site 
analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental 
events. These accidents have generally been assumed to result in 
substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the 
containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The kinds and quantities of radioactive materials expected to be 
produced in the operation and the means for controlling and limiting 
radioactive effluents and radiation exposures within the limits set 
forth in part 20 of this chapter;
    (4) The design of the facility including:
    (i) The principal design criteria for the facility. Appendix A to 
part 50 of this chapter, ``General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power 
Plants,'' establishes minimum requirements for the principal design 
criteria for water-cooled nuclear power plants similar in design and 
location to plants for which construction permits have previously been 
issued by the Commission and provides guidance to applicants in 
establishing principal design criteria for other types of nuclear power 
units;
    (ii) The design bases and the relation of the design bases to the 
principal design criteria;
    (iii) Information relative to materials of construction, 
arrangement, and dimensions, sufficient to provide reasonable assurance 
that the design will conform to the design bases with adequate margin 
for safety.
    (5) An analysis and evaluation of the design and performance of 
structures, systems, and components with the objective of assessing the 
risk to public health and safety resulting from operation of the 
facility and including determination of the margins of safety during 
normal operations and transient conditions anticipated during the life 
of the facility, and the adequacy of structures, systems, and components 
provided for the prevention of accidents and the mitigation of the 
consequences of accidents. Analysis and evaluation of ECCS cooling 
performance and the need for high-point vents following postulated loss-
of-coolant accidents shall be performed in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 50.46 and 50.46a of this chapter;
    (6) A description and analysis of the fire protection design 
features for the reactor necessary to comply with 10 CFR part 50, 
appendix A, GDC 3, and Sec. 50.48 of this chapter;
    (7) A description of protection provided against pressurized thermal 
shock events, including projected values of the reference temperature 
for reactor vessel beltline materials as defined in Sec. Sec. 50.60 and 
50.61(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this chapter;
    (8) An analysis and description of the equipment and systems for 
combustible gas control as required by Sec. 50.44 of this chapter;

proposed plans provide reasonable assurance that adequate protective 
measures can and will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency 
at the site.
    (23) [Reserved]
    (24) If the application is for a nuclear power reactor design which 
differs significantly from light-water reactor designs that were 
licensed before 1997 or use simplified, inherent, passive, or other 
innovative means to accomplish their safety functions, the application 
must describe how the design meets the requirements in Sec. 50.43(e) of 
this chapter;
    (25) A description of the quality assurance program, applied to the

plant-specific PRA information must use the PRA information for the 
design certification and must be updated to account for site-specific 
design information and any design changes or departures.
    (2) The final safety analysis report must demonstrate that the 
interface requirements established for the design under Sec. 52.47 have 
been met.
    (3) The final safety analysis report must demonstrate that all 
requirements and restrictions set forth in the referenced design 
certification rule, other than those imposed under Sec. 50.36b, must be 
satisfied by the date of issuance of the combined license. Any 
requirements and restrictions set forth in the referenced design 
certification rule that could not be satisfied by the time of issuance 
of the combined license, must be set forth as terms or conditions of the 
combined license.
    (e) If the combined license application references the use of one or 
more manufactured nuclear power reactors licensed under subpart F of 
this part, then the following requirements apply:
    (1) The final safety analysis report need not contain information or 
analyses submitted to the Commission in connection with the 
manufacturing license, provided, however, that the final safety analysis 
report must either include or incorporate by reference the manufacturing 
license final safety analysis report and must contain, in addition to 
the information and analyses otherwise required, information sufficient 
to demonstrate that the site characteristics fall within the site 
parameters specified in the manufacturing license. In addition, the 
plant-specific PRA information must use the PRA information for the 
manufactured reactor and must be updated to account for site-specific 
design information and any design changes or departures.
    (2) The final safety analysis report must demonstrate that the 
interface requirements established for the design have been met.
    (3) The final safety analysis report must demonstrate that all terms 
and conditions that have been included in the manufacturing license, 
other than those imposed under Sec. 50.36b, will be satisfied by the

<R05>
Sec. 52.89  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.91  Authorization to conduct limited work authorization 
activities.

    (a) If the application does not reference an early site permit which 
authorizes the holder to perform the activities under 10 CFR 50.10(d), 
the applicant may not perform those activities without obtaining the 
separate authorization required by 10 CFR 50.10(d). Authorization may be 
granted only after the presiding officer in the proceeding on the

<R05>
Sec. 52.93  Exemptions and variances.

    (a) Applicants for a combined license under this subpart, or any 
amendment to a combined license, may include in the application a 
request for an exemption from one or more of the Commission's 
regulations.
    (1) If the request is for an exemption from any part of a referenced 
design certification rule, the Commission may grant the request if it 
determines that the exemption complies with any exemption provisions of 
the referenced design certification rule, or with Sec. 52.63 if there 
are no applicable exemption provisions in the referenced design 
certification rule.
    (2) For all other requests for exemptions, the Commission may grant 
a request if it determines that the exemption complies with Sec. 52.7.
    (b) An applicant for a combined license who has filed an application 
referencing an early site permit issued under subpart A of this part may 
include in the application a request for a variance from one or more 
site characteristics, design parameters, or terms and conditions of the 
permit, or from the site safety analysis report. In determining whether 
to grant the variance, the Commission shall apply the same technically 
relevant criteria as were applicable to the application for the original 
or renewed site permit. Once a construction permit or combined license 
referencing an early site permit is issued, variances from the early 
site permit will not be granted for that construction permit or combined 
license.
    (c) An applicant for a combined license who has filed an application 
referencing a nuclear power reactor manufactured under a manufacturing 
license issued under subpart F of this part may include in the 
application a request for a departure from one or more design 
characteristics, site parameters, terms and conditions, or approved 
design of the manufactured reactor. The Commission may grant a request 
only if it determines that the departure will comply with the 
requirements of 10 CFR 52.7, and that the special circumstances outweigh 
any decrease in safety that may result from the reduction in 
standardization caused by the departure.
    (d) Issuance of a variance under paragraph (b) or a departure under 
paragraph (c) of this section is subject to litigation during the 
combined license proceeding in the same manner as other issues material 
to that proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 52.97  Issuance of combined licenses.

    (a)(1) After conducting a hearing in accordance with Sec. 52.85 and 
receiving the report submitted by the ACRS, the Commission may issue a 
combined license if the Commission finds that:
    (i) The applicable standards and requirements of the Act and the 
Commission's regulations have been met;
    (ii) Any required notifications to other agencies or bodies have 
been duly made;
    (iii) There is reasonable assurance that the facility will be 
constructed and will operate in conformity with the license, the 
provisions of the Act, and the Commission's regulations.
    (iv) The applicant is technically and financially qualified to 
engage in the activities authorized; and

[[Page 101]]

    (v) Issuance of the license will not be inimical to the common 
defense and security or to the health and safety of the public; and
    (vi) The findings required by subpart A of part 51 of this chapter 
have been made.
    (2) The Commission may also find, at the time it issues the combined 
license, that certain acceptance criteria in one or more of the 
inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC) in a 
referenced early site permit or standard design certification have been 
met. This finding will finally resolve that those acceptance criteria 
have been met, those acceptance criteria will be deemed to be excluded 
from the combined license, and findings under Sec. 52.103(g) with 
respect to those acceptance criteria are unnecessary.
    (b) The Commission shall identify within the combined license the 
inspections, tests, and analyses, including those applicable to 
emergency planning, that the licensee shall perform, and the acceptance 
criteria that, if met, are necessary and sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurance that the facility has been constructed and will be 
operated in conformity with the license, the provisions of the Act, and 
the Commission's rules and regulations.
    (c) A combined license shall contain the terms and conditions, 
including technical specifications, as the Commission deems necessary 
and appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 52.98  Finality of combined licenses; information requests.

    (a) After issuance of a combined license, the Commission may not 
modify, add, or delete any term or condition of the combined license, 
the design of the facility, the inspections, tests, analyses, and 
acceptance criteria contained in the license which are not derived from 
a referenced standard design certification or manufacturing license, 
except in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 52.103 or Sec. 50.109 
of this chapter, as applicable.
    (b) If the combined license does not reference a design 
certification or a reactor manufactured under a subpart F of this part 
manufacturing license, then a licensee may make changes in the facility 
as described in the final safety analysis report (as updated), make 
changes in the procedures as described in the final safety analysis 
report (as updated), and conduct tests or experiments not described in 
the final safety analysis report (as updated) under the applicable 
change processes in 10 CFR part 50 (e.g., Sec. Sec. 50.54, 50.59, or 
50.90 of this chapter).
    (c) If the combined license references a certified design, then--
    (1) Changes to or departures from information within the scope of 
the referenced design certification rule are subject to the applicable 
change processes in that rule; and
    (2) Changes that are not within the scope of the referenced design 
certification rule are subject to the applicable change processes in 10 
CFR part 50, unless they also involve changes to or noncompliance with 
information within the scope of the referenced design certification 
rule. In these cases, the applicable provisions of this section and the 
design certification rule apply.
    (d) If the combined license references a reactor manufactured under 
a subpart F of this part manufacturing license, then--
    (1) Changes to or departures from information within the scope of 
the manufactured reactor's design are subject to the change processes in 
Sec. 52.171; and
    (2) Changes that are not within the scope of the manufactured 
reactor's design are subject to the applicable change processes in 10 
CFR part 50.
    (e) The Commission may issue and make immediately effective any 
amendment to a combined license upon a determination by the Commission 
that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, 
notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a 
hearing from any person. The amendment may be issued and made 
immediately effective in advance of the holding and completion of any 
required hearing. The amendment will be processed in accordance with the 
procedures specified in 10 CFR 50.91.
    (f) Any modification to, addition to, or deletion from the terms and 
conditions of a combined license, including

[[Page 102]]

any modification to, addition to, or deletion from the inspections, 
tests, analyses, or related acceptance criteria contained in the license 
is a proposed amendment to the license. There must be an opportunity for 
a hearing on the amendment.
    (g) Except for information sought to verify licensee compliance with 
the current licensing basis for that facility, information requests to 
the holder of a combined license must be evaluated before issuance to 
ensure that the burden to be imposed on the licensee is justified in 
view of the potential safety significance of the issue to be addressed 
in the requested information. Each evaluation performed by the NRC staff 
must be in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(f) and must be approved by the 
Executive Director for Operations or his or her designee before issuance 
of the request.


<R05>
Sec. 52.99  Inspection during construction.

    (a) The licensee shall submit to the NRC, no later that 1 year after 
issuance of the combined license or at the start of construction as 
defined in 10 CFR 50.10(a), whichever is later, its schedule for 
completing the inspections, tests, or analyses in the ITAAC. The 
licensee shall submit updates to the ITAAC schedules every 6 months 
thereafter and, within 1 year of its scheduled date for initial loading 
of fuel, the licensee shall submit updates to the ITAAC schedule every 
30 days until the final notification is provided to the NRC under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (b) With respect to activities subject to an ITAAC, an applicant for 
a combined license may proceed at its own risk with design and 
procurement activities, and a licensee may proceed at its own risk with 
design, procurement, construction, and pre-operational activities, even 
though the NRC may not have found that any one of the prescribed 
acceptance criteria have been met.
    (c)(1) The licensee shall notify the NRC that the prescribed 
inspections, tests, and analyses have been performed and that the 
prescribed acceptance criteria have been met. The notification must 
contain sufficient information to demonstrate that the prescribed 
inspections, tests, and analyses have been performed and that the 
prescribed acceptance criteria have been met.
    (2) If the licensee has not provided, by the date 225 days before 
the scheduled date for initial loading of fuel, the notification 
required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section for all ITAAC, then the 
licensee shall notify the NRC that the prescribed inspections, tests, or 
analyses for all uncompleted ITAAC will be performed and that the 
prescribed acceptance criteria will be met prior to operation. The 
notification must be provided no later than the date 225 days before the 
scheduled date for initial loading of fuel, and must provide sufficient 
information to demonstrate that the prescribed inspections, tests, or 
analyses will be performed and the prescribed acceptance criteria for 
the uncompleted ITAAC will be met, including, but not limited to, a 
description of the specific procedures and analytical methods to be used 
for performing the prescribed inspections, tests, and analyses and 
determining that the prescribed acceptance criteria have been met.
    (d)(1) In the event that an activity is subject to an ITAAC derived 
from a referenced standard design certification and the licensee has not 
demonstrated that the ITAAC has been met, the licensee may take 
corrective actions to successfully complete that ITAAC or request an 
exemption from the standard design certification ITAAC, as applicable. A 
request for an exemption must also be accompanied by a request for a 
license amendment under Sec. 52.98(f).
    (2) In the event that an activity is subject to an ITAAC not derived 
from a referenced standard design certification and the licensee has not 
demonstrated that the ITAAC has been met, the licensee may take 
corrective actions to successfully complete that ITAAC or request a 
license amendment under Sec. 52.98(f).
    (e) The NRC shall ensure that the prescribed inspections, tests, and 
analyses in the ITAAC are performed.
    (1) At appropriate intervals until the last date for submission of 
requests for hearing under Sec. 52.103(a), the NRC shall

[[Page 103]]

publish notices in the Federal Register of the NRC staff's determination 
of the successful completion of inspections, tests, and analyses.
    (2) The NRC shall make publicly available the licensee notifications 
under paragraph (c)(1), and, no later than the date of publication of 
the notice of intended operation required by Sec. 52.103(a), make 
available all licensee notifications under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) 
of this section.

Sec. 52.103  Operation under a combined license.

    (a) The licensee shall notify the NRC of its scheduled date for 
initial loading of fuel no later than 270 days before the scheduled date 
and shall notify the NRC of updates to its schedule every 30 days 
thereafter. Not less than 180 days before the date scheduled for initial 
loading of fuel into a plant by a licensee that has been issued a 
combined license under this part, the Commission shall publish notice of 
intended operation in the Federal Register. The notice must provide that 
any person whose interest may be affected by operation of the plant may, 
within 60 days, request that the Commission hold a hearing on whether 
the facility as constructed complies, or on completion will comply, with 
the acceptance criteria in the combined license, except that a hearing 
shall not be granted for those ITAAC which the Commission found were met 
under Sec. 52.97(a)(2).
    (b) A request for hearing under paragraph (a) of this section must 
show, prima facie, that--
    (1) One or more of the acceptance criteria of the ITAAC in the 
combined license have not been, or will not be, met; and
    (2) The specific operational consequences of nonconformance that 
would be contrary to providing reasonable assurance of adequate 
protection of the public health and safety.
    (c) The Commission, acting as the presiding officer, shall determine 
whether to grant or deny the request for hearing in accordance with the 
applicable requirements of 10 CFR 2.309. If the Commission grants the 
request, the Commission, acting as the presiding officer, shall 
determine whether during a period of interim operation there will be 
reasonable assurance of adequate protection to the public health and 
safety. The Commission's determination must consider the petitioner's 
prima facie showing and any answers thereto. If the Commission 
determines there is such reasonable assurance, it shall allow operation 
during an interim period under the combined license.
    (d) The Commission, in its discretion, shall determine appropriate 
hearing procedures, whether informal or formal adjudicatory, for any 
hearing under paragraph (a) of this section, and shall state its reasons 
therefore.
    (e) The Commission shall, to the maximum possible extent, render a 
decision on issues raised by the hearing request within 180 days of the 
publication of the notice provided by paragraph (a) of this section or 
by the anticipated date for initial loading of fuel into the reactor, 
whichever is later.
    (f) A petition to modify the terms and conditions of the combined 
license will be processed as a request for action in accordance with 10 
CFR 2.206. The petitioner shall file the petition with the Secretary of 
the Commission. Before the licensed activity allegedly affected by the 
petition (fuel loading, low power testing, etc.) commences, the 
Commission shall determine whether any immediate action is required. If 
the petition is granted, then an appropriate order will be issued. Fuel 
loading and operation under the combined license will not be affected by 
the granting of the petition unless the order is made immediately 
effective.
    (g) The licensee shall not operate the facility until the Commission 
makes a finding that the acceptance criteria in the combined license are 
met, except for those acceptance criteria that the Commission found were 
met under Sec. 52.97(a)(2). If the combined license is for a modular 
design, each reactor module may require a separate finding as 
construction proceeds.
    (h) After the Commission has made the finding in paragraph (g) of 
this section, the ITAAC do not, by virtue of their inclusion in the 
combined license,

[[Page 104]]

constitute regulatory requirements either for licensees or for renewal 
of the license; except for the specific ITAAC for which the Commission 
has granted a hearing under paragraph (a) of this section, all ITAAC 
expire upon final Commission action in the proceeding. However, 
subsequent changes to the facility or procedures described in the final 
safety analysis report (as updated) must comply with the requirements in 
Sec. Sec. 52.98(e) or (f), as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 52.104  Duration of combined license.

    A combined license is issued for a specified period not to exceed 40 
years from the date on which the Commission makes a finding that 
acceptance criteria are met under Sec. 52.103(g) or allowing operation 
during an interim period under the combined license under Sec. 
52.103(c).


<R05>
Sec. 52.105  Transfer of combined license.

    A combined license may be transferred in accordance with Sec. 50.80 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 52.107  Application for renewal.

    The filing of an application for a renewed license must be in 
accordance with 10 CFR part 54.


<R05>
Sec. 52.109  Continuation of combined license.

    Each combined license for a facility that has permanently ceased 
operations, continues in effect beyond the expiration date to authorize 
ownership and possession of the production or utilization facility, 
until the Commission notifies the licensee in writing that the license 
is terminated. During this period of continued effectiveness the 
licensee shall--
    (1) Take actions necessary to decommission and decontaminate the 
facility and continue to maintain the facility, including, where 
applicable, the storage, control and maintenance of the spent fuel, in a 
safe condition; and
    (2) Conduct activities in accordance with all other restrictions 
applicable to the facility in accordance with the NRC's regulations and 
the provisions of the combined license for the facility.


<R05>
Sec. 52.110  Termination of license.

    (a)(1) When a licensee has determined to permanently cease 
operations the licensee shall, within 30 days, submit a written 
certification to the NRC, consistent with the requirements of Sec. 
52.3(b)(8);
    (2) Once fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel, 
the licensee shall submit a written certification to the NRC that meets 
the requirements of Sec. 52.3(b)(9); and
    (3) For licensees whose licenses have been permanently modified to 
allow possession but not operation of the facility, before September 27, 
2007, the certification required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
shall be deemed to have been submitted.
    (b) Upon docketing of the certifications for permanent cessation of 
operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel, or 
when a final legally effective order to permanently cease operations has 
come into effect, the 10 CFR part 52 license no longer authorizes 
operation of the reactor or emplacement or retention of fuel into the 
reactor vessel.
    (c) Decommissioning will be completed within 60 years of permanent 
cessation of operations. Completion of decommissioning beyond 60 years 
will be approved by the Commission only when necessary to protect public 
health and safety. Factors that will be considered by the Commission in 
evaluating an alternative that provides for completion of 
decommissioning beyond 60 years of permanent cessation of operations 
include unavailability of waste disposal capacity and other site-
specific factors affecting the licensee's capability to carry out 
decommissioning, including presence of other nuclear facilities at the 
site.
    (d)(1) Before or within 2 years following permanent cessation of 
operations, the licensee shall submit a post-shutdown decommissioning 
activities report (PSDAR) to the NRC, and a copy to the affected 
State(s). The report must include a description of the planned 
decommissioning activities along with a schedule for their 
accomplishment, an estimate of expected costs, and a discussion that 
provides the reasons for concluding that the environmental impacts 
associated with

[[Page 105]]

site-specific decommissioning activities will be bounded by appropriate 
previously issued environmental impact statements.
    (2) The NRC shall notice receipt of the PSDAR and make the PSDAR 
available for public comment. The NRC shall also schedule a public 
meeting in the vicinity of the licensee's facility upon receipt of the 
PSDAR. The NRC shall publish a document in the Federal Register and in a 
forum, such as local newspapers, that is readily accessible to 
individuals in the vicinity of the site, announcing the date, time and 
location of the meeting, along with a brief description of the purpose 
of the meeting.
    (e) Licensees shall not perform any major decommissioning 
activities, as defined in Sec. 50.2 of this chapter, until 90 days 
after the NRC has received the licensee's PSDAR submittal and until 
certifications of permanent cessation of operations and permanent 
removal of fuel from the reactor vessel, as required under Sec. 
52.110(a)(1), have been submitted.
    (f) Licensees shall not perform any decommissioning activities, as 
defined in Sec. 52.1, that--
    (1) Foreclose release of the site for possible unrestricted use;
    (2) Result in significant environmental impacts not previously 
reviewed; or
    (3) Result in there no longer being reasonable assurance that 
adequate funds will be available for decommissioning.
    (g) In taking actions permitted under Sec. 50.59 of this chapter 
following submittal of the PSDAR, the licensee shall notify the NRC in 
writing and send a copy to the affected State(s), before performing any 
decommissioning activity inconsistent with, or making any significant 
schedule change from, those actions and schedules described in the 
PSDAR, including changes that significantly increase the decommissioning 
cost.
    (h)(1) Decommissioning trust funds may be used by licensees if--
    (i) The withdrawals are for expenses for legitimate decommissioning 
activities consistent with the definition of decommissioning in Sec. 
52.1;
    (ii) The expenditure would not reduce the value of the 
decommissioning trust below an amount necessary to place and maintain 
the reactor in a safe storage condition if unforeseen conditions or 
expenses arise and;
    (iii) The withdrawals would not inhibit the ability of the licensee 
to complete funding of any shortfalls in the decommissioning trust 
needed to ensure the availability of funds to ultimately release the 
site and terminate the license.
    (2) Initially, 3 percent of the generic amount specified in Sec. 
50.75 of this chapter may be used for decommissioning planning. For 
licensees that have submitted the certifications required under Sec. 
52.110(a) and commencing 90 days after the NRC has received the PSDAR, 
an additional 20 percent may be used. A site-specific decommissioning 
cost estimate must be submitted to the NRC before the licensee may use 
any funding in excess of these amounts.
    (3) Within 2 years following permanent cessation of operations, if 
not already submitted, the licensee shall submit a site-specific 
decommissioning cost estimate.
    (4) For decommissioning activities that delay completion of 
decommissioning by including a period of storage or surveillance, the 
licensee shall provide a means of adjusting cost estimates and 
associated funding levels over the storage or surveillance period.
    (i) All power reactor licensees must submit an application for 
termination of license. The application for termination of license must 
be accompanied or preceded by a license termination plan to be submitted 
for NRC approval.
    (1) The license termination plan must be a supplement to the FSAR or 
equivalent and must be submitted at least 2 years before termination of 
the license date.
    (2) The license termination plan must include--
    (i) A site characterization;
    (ii) Identification of remaining dismantlement activities;
    (iii) Plans for site remediation;
    (iv) Detailed plans for the final radiation survey;
    (v) A description of the end use of the site, if restricted;

[[Page 106]]

    (vi) An updated site-specific estimate of remaining decommissioning 
costs;
    (vii) A supplement to the environmental report, under Sec. 51.53 of 
this chapter, describing any new information or significant 
environmental change associated with the licensee's proposed termination 
activities; and
    (viii) Identification of parts, if any, of the facility or site that 
were released for use before approval of the license termination plan.
    (3) The NRC shall notice receipt of the license termination plan and 
make the license termination plan available for public comment. The NRC 
shall also schedule a public meeting in the vicinity of the licensee's 
facility upon receipt of the license termination plan. The NRC shall 
publish a document in the Federal Register and in a forum, such as local 
newspapers, which is readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity 
of the site, announcing the date, time and location of the meeting, 
along with a brief description of the purpose of the meeting.
    (j) If the license termination plan demonstrates that the remainder 
of decommissioning activities will be performed in accordance with the 
regulations in this chapter, will not be inimical to the common defense 
and security or to the health and safety of the public, and will not 
have a significant effect on the quality of the environment and after 
notice to interested persons, the Commission shall approve the plan, by 
license amendment, subject to terms and conditions as it deems 
appropriate and necessary and authorize implementation of the license 
termination plan.
    (k) The Commission shall terminate the license if it determines 
that--
    (1) The remaining dismantlement has been performed in accordance 
with the approved license termination plan; and
    (2) The final radiation survey and associated documentation, 
including an assessment of dose contributions associated with parts 
released for use before approval of the license termination plan, 
demonstrate that the facility and site have met the criteria for 
decommissioning in subpart E to 10 CFR part 20.
    (l) For a facility that has permanently ceased operation before the 
expiration of its license, the collection period for any shortfall of 
funds will be determined, upon application by the licensee, on a case-
by-case basis taking into account the specific financial situation of 
each licensee.

Subpart D [Reserved]


<R04>
                   Subpart E_Standard Design Approvals


<R05>
Sec. 52.131  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets out procedures for the filing, NRC staff review, 
and referral to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards of standard 
designs for a nuclear power reactor of the type described in Sec. 50.22 
of this chapter or major portions thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 52.133  Relationship to other subparts.

    (a) This subpart applies to a person that requests a standard design 
approval from the NRC staff separately from an application for a 
construction permit filed under 10 CFR part 50 or a combined license 
filed under subpart C of this part. An applicant for a construction 
permit or combined license may reference a standard design approval.
    (b) Subpart B of this part governs the certification by rulemaking 
of the design of a nuclear power plant. Subpart B may be used 
independently of the provisions in this subpart.
    (c) Subpart F of this part governs the issuance of licenses to 
manufacture nuclear power reactors to be installed and operated at sites 
not identified in the manufacturing license application. Subpart F of 
this part may be used independently of the provisions in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 52.135  Filing of applications.

    (a) Any person may submit a proposed standard design for a nuclear 
power reactor of the type described in 10 CFR 50.22 to the NRC staff for 
its review. The submittal may consist of either the final design for the 
entire facility or the final design of major portions thereof.
    (b) The submittal for review of the proposed standard design must be 
made

[[Page 107]]

in the same manner and in the same number of copies as provided in 10 
CFR 50.30 and 52.3 for license applications.
    (c) The fees associated with the filing and review of the 
application are set forth in 10 CFR part 170.


<R05>
Sec. 52.136  Contents of applications; general information.

    The application must contain all of the information required by 10 
CFR 50.33(a) through (d) and (j).


<R05>
Sec. 52.137  Contents of applications; technical information.

    If the applicant seeks review of a major portion of a standard 
design, the application need only contain the information required by 
this section to the extent the requirements are applicable to the major 
portion of the standard design for which NRC staff approval is sought.
    (a) The application must contain a final safety analysis report that 
describes the facility, presents the design bases and the limits on its 
operation, and presents a safety analysis of the structures, systems, 
and components and of the facility, or major portion thereof, and must 
include the following information:
    (1) The site parameters postulated for the design, and an analysis 
and evaluation of the design in terms of those site parameters;
    (2) A description and analysis of the SSCs of the facility, with 
emphasis upon performance requirements, the bases, with technical 
justification, upon which the requirements have been established, and 
the evaluations required to show that safety functions will be 
accomplished. It is expected that the standard plant will reflect 
through its design, construction, and operation an extremely low 
probability for accidents that could result in the release of 
significant quantities of radioactive fission products. The description 
shall be sufficient to permit understanding of the system designs and 
their relationship to the safety evaluations. Items such as the reactor 
core, reactor coolant system, instrumentation and control systems, 
electrical systems, containment system, other engineered safety 
features, auxiliary and emergency systems, power conversion systems, 
radioactive waste handling systems, and fuel handling systems shall be 
discussed insofar as they are pertinent. The following power reactor 
design characteristics will be taken into consideration by the 
Commission:
    (i) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power 
level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials;
    (ii) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards 
are applied to the design of the reactor;
    (iii) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual 
or enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the 
probability or consequences of accidental release of radioactive 
materials; and
    (iv) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility 
and those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident 
before a release of radioactive material to the environment can occur. 
Special attention must be directed to plant design features intended to 
mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents. In performing this 
assessment, an applicant shall assume a fission product release \9\ from 
the core into the containment assuming that the facility is operated at 
the ultimate power level contemplated. The applicant shall perform an 
evaluation and analysis of the postulated fission product release, using 
the expected demonstrable containment leak rate and any fission product 
cleanup systems intended to mitigate the consequences of the accidents, 
together with applicable postulated site parameters, including site 
meteorology, to evaluate the offsite radiological consequences. The 
evaluation must determine that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should 
be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site 
analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental 
events. These accidents have generally been assumed to result in 
substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the 
containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (A) An individual located at any point on the boundary of the 
exclusion area for any 2-hour period following the onset of the 
postulated fission

[[Page 108]]

product release, would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem 
\10\ total effective dose equivalent (TEDE); and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ A whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond 
numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for 
radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations at the time 
could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure 
status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, its use is not 
intended to imply that this number constitutes an acceptable limit for 
an emergency dose to the public under accident conditions. Rather, this 
dose value has been set forth in this section as a reference value, 
which can be used in the evaluation of plant design features with 
respect to postulated reactor accidents, to assure that these designs 
provide assurance of low risk of public exposure to radiation, in the 
event of an accident.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) An individual located at any point on the outer boundary of the 
low population zone, who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting 
from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of 
its passage) would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem 
TEDE;
    (3) The design of the facility including:
    (i) The principal design criteria for the facility. Appendix A to 10 
CFR part 50, general design criteria (GDC), establishes minimum 
requirements for the principal design criteria for water-cooled nuclear 
power plants similar in design and location to plants for which 
construction permits have previously been issued by the Commission and 
provides guidance to applicants in establishing principal design 
criteria for other types of nuclear power units;
    (ii) The design bases and the relation of the design bases to the 
principal design criteria; and
    (iii) Information relative to materials of construction, general 
arrangement, and approximate dimensions, sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurance that the design will conform to the design bases 
with adequate margin for safety;
    (4) An analysis and evaluation of the design and performance of SSC 
with the objective of assessing the risk to public health and safety 
resulting from operation of the facility and including determination of 
the margins of safety during normal operations and transient conditions 
anticipated during the life of the facility, and the adequacy of SSCs 
provided for the prevention of accidents and the mitigation of the 
consequences of accidents. Analysis and evaluation of ECCS cooling 
performance and the need for high-point vents following postulated loss-
of-coolant accidents shall be performed in accordance with the 
requirements of 10 CFR 50.46 and 50.46a;
    (5) The kinds and quantities of radioactive materials expected to be 
produced in the operation and the means for controlling and limiting 
radioactive effluents and radiation exposures within the limits set 
forth in part 20 of this chapter;
    (6) The information required by Sec. 20.1406 of this chapter;
    (7) The technical qualifications of the applicant to engage in the 
proposed activities in accordance with the regulations in this chapter;
    (8) The information necessary to demonstrate compliance with any 
technically relevant portions of the Three Mile Island requirements set 
forth in 10 CFR 50.34(f), except paragraphs (f)(1)(xii), (f)(2)(ix), and 
(f)(3)(v) of 10 CFR 50.34(f);
    (9) For applications for light-water-cooled nuclear power plants, an 
evaluation of the standard plant design against the Standard Review Plan 
(SRP) revision in effect 6 months before the docket date of the 
application. The evaluation required by this section shall include an 
identification and description of all differences in design features, 
analytical techniques, and procedural measures proposed for the design 
and those corresponding features, techniques, and measures given in the 
SRP acceptance criteria. Where a difference exists, the evaluation shall 
discuss how the proposed alternative provides an acceptable method of 
complying with the Commission's regulations, or portions thereof, that 
underlie the corresponding SRP acceptance criteria. The SRP is not a 
substitute for the regulations, and compliance is not a requirement;
    (10) The information with respect to the design of equipment to 
maintain control over radioactive materials in gaseous and liquid 
effluents produced

[[Page 109]]

during normal reactor operations described in 10 CFR 50.34a(e);
    (11) The information pertaining to design features that affect plans 
for coping with emergencies in the operation of the reactor facility or 
a major portion thereof;
    (12) An analysis and description of the equipment and systems for 
combustible gas control as required by Sec. 50.44 of this chapter;
    (13) The list of electric equipment important to safety that is 
required by 10 CFR 50.49(d);
    (14) A description of protection provided against pressurized 
thermal shock events, including projected values of the reference 
temperature for reactor vessel beltline materials as defined in 10 CFR 
50.60 and 50.61;
    (15) Information demonstrating how the applicant will comply with 
requirements for reduction of risk from anticipated transients without 
scram (ATWS) events in Sec. 50.62;
    (16) The coping analysis, and any design features necessary to 
address station blackout, as described in Sec. 50.63 of this chapter;
    (17) Information demonstrating how the applicant will comply with 
requirements for criticality accidents in Sec. 50.68(b)(2)-(b)(4);
    (18) A description and analysis of the fire protection design 
features for the standard plant necessary to comply with part 50, 
appendix A, GDC 3, and Sec. 50.48 of this chapter;
    (19) A description of the quality assurance program applied to the 
design of the SSCs of the facility. Appendix B to 10 CFR part 50, 
``Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel 
Reprocessing Plants,'' sets forth the requirements for quality assurance 
programs for nuclear power plants. The description of the quality 
assurance program for a nuclear power plant shall include a discussion 
of how the applicable requirements of appendix B to 10 CFR part 50 were 
satisfied;
    (20) The information necessary to demonstrate that the standard 
plant complies with the earthquake engineering criteria in 10 CFR part 
50, appendix S;
    (21) Proposed technical resolutions of those Unresolved Safety 
Issues and medium- and high-priority generic safety issues which are 
identified in the version of NUREG-0933 current on the date up to 6 
months before the docket date of the application and which are 
technically relevant to the design;
    (22) The information necessary to demonstrate how operating 
experience insights have been incorporated into the plant design;
    (23) For light-water reactor designs, a description and analysis of 
design features for the prevention and mitigation of severe accidents, 
e.g., challenges to containment integrity caused by core-concrete 
interaction, steam explosion, high-pressure core melt ejection, hydrogen 
combustion, and containment bypass;
    (24) A description, analysis, and evaluation of the interfaces 
between the standard design and the balance of the nuclear power plant; 
and
    (25) A description of the design-specific probabilistic risk 
assessment and its results.
    (26) For applications for standard design approvals which are 
subject to 10 CFR 50.150(a), the information required by 10 CFR 
50.150(b).
    (b) An application for approval of a standard design, which differs 
significantly from the light-water reactor designs of plants that have 
been licensed and in commercial operation before April 18, 1989, or uses 
simplified, inherent, passive, or other innovative means to accomplish 
its safety functions, must meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.43(e).

<R05>
Sec. 52.156  Contents of applications; general information.

    The application must contain all of the information required by 10 
CFR 50.33(a) through (d), and (j).


<R05>
Sec. 52.157  Contents of applications; technical information in final
safety analysis report.

    The application must contain a final safety analysis report 
containing the information set forth below, with a level of design 
information sufficient to enable the Commission to judge the applicant's 
proposed means of assuring that the manufacturing conforms to the design 
and to reach a final conclusion on all safety questions associated with 
the design, permit the preparation of construction and installation 
specifications by an applicant who seeks to use the manufactured 
reactor, and permit the preparation of acceptance and inspection 
requirements by the NRC:
    (a) The principal design criteria for the reactor to be 
manufactured. Appendix A of 10 CFR part 50, ``General Design Criteria 
for Nuclear Power Plants,'' establishes minimum requirements for the 
principal design criteria for water-cooled nuclear power plants similar 
in design and location to plants for which construction permits have 
previously been issued by the Commission and provides guidance to 
applicants in establishing principal design criteria for other types of 
nuclear power units;
    (b) The design bases and the relation of the design bases to the 
principal design criteria;
    (c) A description and analysis of the structures, systems, and 
components of the reactor to be manufactured, with emphasis upon the 
materials of manufacture, performance requirements, the bases, with 
technical justification therefor, upon which the performance 
requirements have been established, and the evaluations required to show 
that safety functions will be accomplished. The description shall be 
sufficient to permit understanding of the system designs and their 
relationship to safety evaluations. Items such as the reactor core, 
reactor coolant system, instrumentation and control systems, electrical 
systems, containment system, other engineered safety features, auxiliary 
and emergency systems, power conversion systems, radioactive waste 
handling systems, and fuel handling systems shall be discussed insofar 
as they are pertinent. The following power reactor design 
characteristics will be taken into consideration by the Commission:
    (1) Intended use of the manufactured reactor including the proposed 
maximum power level and the nature and inventory of contained 
radioactive materials;
    (2) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are 
applied to the design of the reactor; and
    (3) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual or 
enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the probability 
or consequences of accidental release of radioactive materials;
    (d) The safety features that are engineered into the reactor and 
those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident before a 
release of radioactive material to the environment can occur. Special 
attention must be directed to reactor design features intended to 
mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents. In performing this 
assessment, an applicant shall assume a fission product release \11\ 
from the core into the containment assuming that the facility is 
operated at the ultimate power level contemplated. The applicant shall 
perform an evaluation and analysis of the postulated fission product 
release, using the expected demonstrable containment leak rate and any 
fission product cleanup systems intended to mitigate the consequences of 
the accidents, together with applicable postulated site parameters, 
including site meteorology, to evaluate the offsite radiological 
consequences. The evaluation must determine that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should 
be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site 
analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental 
events. These accidents have generally been assumed to result in 
substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the 
containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) An individual located at any point on the boundary of the 
exclusion area

[[Page 112]]

for any 2 hour period following the onset of the postulated fission 
product release, would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem 
\12\ total effective dose equivalent (TEDE);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ A whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond 
numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for 
radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations at the time 
could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure 
status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, its use is not 
intended to imply that this number constitutes an acceptable limit for 
an emergency dose to the public under accident conditions. Rather, this 
dose value has been set forth in this section as a reference value, 
which can be used in the evaluation of plant design features with 
respect to postulated reactor accidents, to assure that these designs 
provide assurance of low risk of public exposure to radiation, in the 
event of an accident.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) An individual located at any point on the outer boundary of the 
low population zone, who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting 
from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of 
its passage) would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem 
TEDE; and
    (e) The kinds and quantities of radioactive materials expected to be 
produced in the operation and the means for controlling and limiting 
radioactive effluents and radiation exposures within the limits set 
forth in part 20 of this chapter.
    (f) Information necessary to establish that the design of the 
reactor to be manufactured complies with the technical requirements in 
10 CFR Chapter I, including:
    (1) An analysis and evaluation of the design and performance of 
structures, systems, and components with the objective of assessing the 
risk to public health and safety resulting from operation of the 
facility and including determination of the margins of safety during 
normal operations and transient conditions anticipated during the life 
of the facility, and the adequacy of structures, systems, and components 
provided for the prevention of accidents and the mitigation of the 
consequences of accidents. Analysis and evaluation of ECCS cooling 
performance and the need for high-point vents following postulated loss-
of-coolant accidents shall be performed in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 50.46 and 50.46a of this chapter;
    (2) A description and analysis of the fire protection design 
features for the reactor necessary to comply with 10 CFR part 50, 
appendix A, GDC 3 and Sec. 50.48 of this chapter;
    (3) A description of protection provided against pressurized thermal 
shock events, including projected values of the reference temperature 
for reactor vessel beltline materials as defined in Sec. Sec. 50.60 and 
50.61 of this chapter;
    (4) An analysis and description of the equipment and systems for 
combustible gas control as required by Sec. 50.44 of this chapter;
    (5) The coping analysis, and any design features necessary to 
address station blackout, as described in Sec. 50.63 of this chapter;
    (6) The list of electric equipment important to safety that is 
required by 10 CFR 50.49(d);
    (7) Information demonstrating how the applicant will comply with 
requirements for reduction of risk from anticipated transients without 
scram (ATWS) events in Sec. 50.62;
    (8) Information demonstrating how the applicant will comply with 
requirements for criticality accidents in Sec. 50.68(b)(2)-(b)(4);
    (9) The information required by Sec. 20.1406 of this chapter;
    (10) [Reserved]
    (11) The information with respect to the design of equipment to 
maintain control over radioactive materials in gaseous and liquid 
effluents produced during normal reactor operations, as described in 
Sec. 50.34a(e) of this chapter;
    (12) The information necessary to demonstrate compliance with any 
technically relevant portions of the Three Mile Island requirements set 
forth in Sec. 50.34(f) of this chapter, except paragraphs (f)(1)(xii), 
(f)(2)(ix), and (f)(3)(v);
    (13) If the applicant seeks to use risk-informed treatment of SSCs 
in accordance with Sec. 50.69 of this chapter, the information required 
by Sec. 50.69(b)(2) of this chapter;

[[Page 113]]

systems, and components of the reactor. Appendix B to 10 CFR part 50, 
``Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel 
Reprocessing Plants,'' sets forth the requirements for quality assurance 
programs for nuclear power plants. The description of the quality 
assurance program must include a discussion of how the applicable 
requirements of appendix B to 10 CFR part 50 have been and will be 
satisfied; and
    (18) Proposed technical specifications applicable to the reactor 
being manufactured, prepared in accordance with the requirements of

plant, and operated in conformity with the manufacturing license, the 
provision of the Act, and the Commission's regulations;
    (3) The proposed reactor(s) can be incorporated into a nuclear power 
plant and operated at sites having characteristics that fall within the 
site parameters postulated for the design of the manufactured reactor(s) 
without undue risk to the health and safety of the public;
    (4) The applicant is technically qualified to design and manufacture 
the proposed nuclear power reactor(s);
    (5) The proposed inspections, tests, analyses and acceptance 
criteria are necessary and sufficient, within the scope of the 
manufacturing license, to provide reasonable assurance that the 
manufactured reactor has been manufactured and will be operated in 
conformity with the license, the provisions of the Act, and the 
Commission's regulations;
    (6) The issuance of a license to the applicant will not be inimical 
to the common defense and security or to the health and safety of the 
public; and
    (7) The findings required by subpart A of part 51 of this chapter 
have been made.
    (b) Each manufacturing license issued under this subpart shall 
specify:
    (1) Terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary and 
appropriate;
    (2) Technical specifications for operation of the manufactured 
reactor, as the Commission deems necessary and appropriate;
    (3) Site parameters and design characteristics for the manufactured 
reactor; and

the ultimate heat sink, not within the scope of the manufactured 
reactor.
    (c)(1) A holder of a manufacturing license may not transport or 
allow to be removed from the place of manufacture the manufactured 
reactor except to the site of a licensee with either a construction 
permit under part 50 of this chapter or a combined license under subpart 
C of this part. The construction permit or combined license must 
authorize the construction of a nuclear power facility using the 
manufactured reactor(s).
    (2) A holder of a manufacturing license shall include, in any 
contract governing the transport of a manufactured reactor from the 
place of manufacture to any other location, a provision requiring that 
the person or entity transporting the manufactured reactor to comply 
with all NRC-approved shipping requirements in the manufacturing 
license.


<R05>
Sec. 52.169  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.171  Finality of manufacturing licenses; information requests.

    (a)(1) Notwithstanding any provision in 10 CFR 50.109, during the 
term of a manufacturing license the Commission may not modify, rescind, 
or impose new requirements on the design of the nuclear power reactor 
being manufactured, or the requirements for the manufacture of the 
nuclear power reactor, unless the Commission determines that

[[Page 116]]

a modification is necessary to bring the design of the reactor or its 
manufacture into compliance with the Commission's requirements 
applicable and in effect at the time the manufacturing license was 
issued, or to provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection to 
public health and safety or common defense and security.
    (2) Any modification to the design of a manufactured nuclear power 
reactor which is imposed by the Commission under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section will be applied to all reactors manufactured under the 
license, including those that have already been transported and sited, 
except those reactors to which the modification has been rendered 
technically irrelevant by action taken under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (3) In making the findings required for issuance of a construction 
permit, operating license, combined license, in any hearing under Sec. 
52.103, or in any enforcement hearing other than one initiated by the 
Commission under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for which a nuclear 
power reactor manufactured under this subpart is referenced or used, the 
Commission shall treat as resolved those matters resolved in the 
proceeding on the application for issuance or renewal of the 
manufacturing license, including the adequacy of design of the 
manufactured reactor, the costs and benefits of severe accident 
mitigation design alternatives, and the bases for not incorporating 
severe accident mitigation design alternatives into the design of the 
reactor to be manufactured.
    (b)(1) The holder of a manufacturing license may not make changes to 
the design of the nuclear power reactor authorized to be manufactured 
without prior Commission approval. The request for a change to the 
design must be in the form of an application for a license amendment, 
and must meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.90 and 50.92.
    (2) An applicant or licensee who references or uses a nuclear power 
reactor manufactured under a manufacturing license under this subpart 
may request a departure from the design characteristics, site 
parameters, terms and conditions, or approved design of the manufactured 
reactor. The Commission may grant a request only if it determines that 
the departure will comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.7, and that 
the special circumstances outweigh any decrease in safety that may 
result from the reduction in standardization caused by the departure. 
The granting of a departure on request of an applicant is subject to 
litigation in the same manner as other issues in the construction permit 
or combined license hearing.
    (c) Except for information requests seeking to verify compliance 
with the current licensing basis of either the manufacturing license or 
the manufactured reactor, information requests to the holder of a 
manufacturing license or an applicant or licensee using a manufactured 
reactor must be evaluated before issuance to ensure that the burden to 
be imposed on respondents is justified in view of the potential safety 
significance of the issue to be addressed in the requested information. 
Each evaluation performed by the NRC staff must be in accordance with 10 
CFR 50.54(f) and must be approved by the Executive Director for 
Operations or his or her designee before issuance of the request.

   Sec. Appendix A to Part 52--Design Certification Rule for the U.S. 
                     Advanced Boiling Water Reactor

                             I. Introduction

    Appendix A constitutes the standard design certification for the 
U.S. Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) design, in accordance with 10 
CFR part 52, subpart B. The applicant for certification of the U.S. ABWR 
design was GE Nuclear Energy.

                             II. Definitions

    A. Generic design control document (generic DCD) means the document 
containing the Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and generic technical 
specifications that is incorporated by reference into this appendix.
    B. Generic technical specifications means the information, required 
by 10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a, for the portion of the plant that is within 
the scope of this appendix.
    C. Plant-specific DCD means the document, maintained by an applicant 
or licensee who references this appendix, consisting of the information 
in the generic DCD, as modified and supplemented by the plant-specific 
departures and exemptions made under Section VIII of this appendix.
    D. Tier 1 means the portion of the design-related information 
contained in the generic DCD that is approved and certified by this 
appendix (hereinafter Tier 1 information). The design descriptions, 
interface requirements, and site parameters are derived from Tier 2 
information. Tier 1 information includes:
    1. Definitions and general provisions;
    2. Design descriptions;
    3. Inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC);
    4. Significant site parameters; and
    5. Significant interface requirements.
    E. Tier 2 means the portion of the design-related information 
contained in the generic DCD that is approved but not certified by this 
appendix (Tier 2 information). Compliance with Tier 2 is required, but 
generic changes to and plant-specific departures from Tier 2 are 
governed by Section VIII of this appendix. Compliance with Tier 2 
provides a sufficient, but not the only acceptable, method for complying 
with Tier 1. Compliance methods differing from Tier 2 must satisfy the 
change process in Section VIII of this appendix. Regardless of these 
differences, an applicant or licensee must meet the requirement in 
Section III.B of this appendix to reference Tier 2 when referencing Tier 
1. Tier 2 information includes:
    1. Information required by Sec. Sec. 52.47(a) and 52.47(c), with 
the exception of generic technical specifications and conceptual design 
information;
    2. Supporting information on the inspections, tests, and analyses 
that will be performed to demonstrate that the acceptance criteria in 
the ITAAC have been met; and
    3. Combined license (COL) action items (COL license information), 
which identify certain matters that must be addressed in the site-
specific portion of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) by an 
applicant who references this appendix. These items constitute 
information requirements but are not the only acceptable set of 
information in the FSAR. An applicant may depart from or omit these 
items, provided that the departure or omission is identified and 
justified in the FSAR. After issuance of a construction permit or COL, 
these items are not requirements for the licensee unless such items are 
restated in the FSAR.
    F. Tier 2* means the portion of the Tier 2 information, designated 
as such in the generic DCD, which is subject to the change process in 
Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix. This designation expires for some 
Tier 2* information under Section VIII.B.6.
    G. Departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-
specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety 
analyses means:
    (1) Changing any of the elements of the method described in the 
plant-specific DCD unless the results of the analysis are conservative 
or essentially the same; or
    (2) Changing from a method described in the plant-specific DCD to 
another method unless that method has been approved by NRC for the 
intended application.
    H. All other terms in this appendix have the meaning set out in 10 
CFR 50.2 or 52.1, or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, as applicable.

[[Page 119]]

                         III. Scope and Contents

    A. Tier 1, Tier 2, and the generic technical specifications in the 
U.S. ABWR Design Control Document, GE Nuclear Energy, Revision 4 dated 
March 1997, are approved for incorporation by reference by the Director 
of the Office of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) 
and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of the generic DCD may be obtained from the 
National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, 
Springfield, Virginia 22161. A copy is available for examination and 
copying at the NRC Public Document Room located at One White Flint 
North, 11555 Rockville Pike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland 20852. 
Copies are also available for examination at the NRC Library located at 
Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852 
and the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., 
Suite 700, Washington, DC.
    B. An applicant or licensee referencing this appendix, in accordance 
with Section IV of this appendix, shall incorporate by reference and 
comply with the requirements of this appendix, including Tier 1, Tier 2, 
and the generic technical specifications except as otherwise provided in 
this appendix. Conceptual design information, as set forth in the 
generic DCD, and the ``Technical Support Document for the ABWR'' are not 
part of this appendix. Tier 2 references to the probabilistic risk 
assessment (PRA) in the ABWR standard safety analysis report do not 
incorporate the PRA into Tier 2.
    C. If there is a conflict between Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the DCD, then 
Tier 1 controls.
    D. If there is a conflict between the generic DCD and either the 
application for design certification of the U.S. ABWR design or NUREG-
1503, ``Final Safety Evaluation Report related to the Certification of 
the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor Design'' (FSER), and Supplement No. 
1, then the generic DCD controls.
    E. Design activities for structures, systems, and components that 
are wholly outside the scope of this appendix may be performed using 
site characteristics, provided the design activities do not affect the 
DCD or conflict with the interface requirements.

              IV. Additional Requirements and Restrictions

    A. An applicant for a combined license that wishes to reference this 
appendix shall, in addition to complying with the requirements of 10 CFR 
52.77, 52.79, and 52.80, comply with the following requirements:
    1. Incorporate by reference, as part of its application, this 
appendix;
    2. Include, as part of its application:
    a. A plant-specific DCD containing the same type of information and 
using the same organization and numbering as the generic DCD for the 
U.S. ABWR design, as modified and supplemented by the applicant's 
exemptions and departures;
    b. The reports on departures from and updates to the plant-specific 
DCD required by paragraph X.B of this appendix;
    c. Plant-specific technical specifications, consisting of the 
generic and site-specific technical specifications, that are required by 
10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a;
    d. Information demonstrating compliance with the site parameters and 
interface requirements;
    e. Information that addresses the COL action items; and
    f. Information required by 10 CFR 52.47 that is not within the scope 
of this appendix.
    3. Include, in the plant-specific DCD, the proprietary information 
and safeguards information referenced in the U.S. ABWR DCD.
    B. The Commission reserves the right to determine in what manner 
this appendix may be referenced by an applicant for a construction 
permit or operating license under 10 CFR part 50.

                        V. Applicable Regulations

    A. Except as indicated in paragraph B of this section, the 
regulations that apply to the U.S. ABWR design are in 10 CFR parts 20,

               VIII. Processes for Changes and Departures

    A. Tier 1 information.
    1. Generic changes to Tier 1 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(1).
    2. Generic changes to Tier 1 information are applicable to all 
applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for 
which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action 
taken under paragraphs A.3 or A.4 of this section.
    3. Departures from Tier 1 information that are required by the 
Commission through plant-specific orders are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(4).
    4. Exemptions from Tier 1 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(b)(1) and 52.98(f). The Commission will 
deny a request for an exemption from Tier 1, if it finds that the design 
change will result in a significant decrease in the level of safety 
otherwise provided by the design.
    B. Tier 2 information.
    1. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(1).
    2. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are applicable to all 
applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for 
which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action 
taken under paragraphs B.3, B.4, B.5, or B.6 of this section.
    3. The Commission may not require new requirements on Tier 2 
information by plant-specific order while this appendix is in effect 
under Sec. Sec. 52.55 or 52.61, unless:
    a. A modification is necessary to secure compliance with the 
Commission's regulations applicable and in effect at the time this 
appendix was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix, or to 
assure adequate protection of the public health and safety or the common 
defense and security; and
    b. Special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 52.7 are present.
    4. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may request 
an exemption from Tier 2 information. The Commission may grant such a 
request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the 
requirements of 10 CFR 52.7. The Commission will deny a request for an 
exemption from Tier 2, if it finds that the design change will result in 
a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by the 
design. The grant of an exemption to an applicant must be subject to 
litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license 
hearing. The grant of an exemption to a licensee must be subject to an 
opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as license amendments.
    5.a. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may 
depart from Tier 2 information, without prior NRC approval, unless the 
proposed departure involves a change to or departure from Tier 1 
information, Tier 2* information, or the technical specifications, or 
requires a license amendment under paragraphs B.5.b or B.5.c of this 
section. When evaluating the proposed departure, an applicant or 
licensee shall consider all matters described in the plant-specific DCD.
    b. A proposed departure from Tier 2, other than one affecting 
resolution of a severe accident issue identified in the plant-specific 
DCD, requires a license amendment if it would:
    (1) Result in more than a minimal increase in the frequency of 
occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific 
DCD;
    (2) Result in more than a minimal increase in the likelihood of 
occurrence of a malfunction of a structure, system, or component (SSC) 
important to safety previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;
    (3) Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;
    (4) Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of a 
malfunction of a SSC important to safety previously evaluated in the 
plant-specific DCD;
    (5) Create a possibility for an accident of a different type than 
any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;
    (6) Create a possibility for a malfunction of an SSC important to 
safety with a different result than any evaluated previously in the 
plant-specific DCD;
    (7) Result in a design basis limit for a fission product barrier as 
described in the plant-specific DCD being exceeded or altered; or
    (8) Result in a departure from a method of evaluation described in 
the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the 
safety analyses.
    c. A proposed departure from Tier 2 affecting resolution of an ex-
vessel severe accident design feature identified in the plant-specific 
DCD, requires a license amendment if:
    (1) There is a substantial increase in the probability of an ex-
vessel severe accident such that a particular ex-vessel severe accident 
previously reviewed and determined to be not credible could become 
credible; or
    (2) There is a substantial increase in the consequences to the 
public of a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed.
    d. If a departure requires a license amendment pursuant to 
paragraphs B.5.b or B.5.c of this section, it is governed by 10 CFR 
50.90.
    e. A departure from Tier 2 information that is made under paragraph 
B.5 of this section does not require an exemption from this appendix.

[[Page 122]]

    f. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, 
amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10 CFR 
52.103(a), who believes that an applicant or licensee who references 
this appendix has not complied with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix 
when departing from Tier 2 information, may petition the NRC to admit 
into the proceeding such a contention. In addition to compliance with 
the general requirements of 10 CFR 2.309, the petition must demonstrate 
that the departure does not comply with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this 
appendix. Further, the petition must demonstrate that the change bears 
on an asserted noncompliance with an ITAAC acceptance criterion in the 
case of a 10 CFR 52.103 preoperational hearing, or that the change bears 
directly on the amendment request in the case of a hearing on a license 
amendment. Any other party may file a response. If, on the basis of the 
petition and any response, the presiding officer determines that a 
sufficient showing has been made, the presiding officer shall certify 
the matter directly to the Commission for determination of the 
admissibility of the contention. The Commission may admit such a 
contention if it determines the petition raises a genuine issue of 
material fact regarding compliance with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this 
appendix.
    6.a. An applicant who references this appendix may not depart from 
Tier 2* information, which is designated with italicized text or 
brackets and an asterisk in the generic DCD, without NRC approval. The 
departure will not be considered a resolved issue, within the meaning of 
Section VI of this appendix and 10 CFR 52.63(a)(5).
    b. A licensee who references this appendix may not depart from the 
following Tier 2* matters without prior NRC approval. A request for a 
departure will be treated as a request for a license amendment under 10 
CFR 50.90.
    (1) Fuel burnup limit (4.2).
    (2) Fuel design evaluation (4.2.3).
    (3) Fuel licensing acceptance criteria (appendix 4B).
    c. A licensee who references this appendix may not, before the plant 
first achieves full power following the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), depart from the following Tier 2* matters except in 
accordance with paragraph B.6.b of this section. After the plant first 
achieves full power, the following Tier 2* matters revert to Tier 2 
status and are thereafter subject to the departure provisions in 
paragraph B.5 of this section.
    (1) ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code, Section III.
    (2) ACI 349 and ANSI/AISC-690.
    (3) Motor-operated valves.
    (4) Equipment seismic qualification methods.
    (5) Piping design acceptance criteria.
    (6) Fuel system and assembly design (4.2), except burnup limit.
    (7) Nuclear design (4.3).
    (8) Equilibrium cycle and control rod patterns (App. 4A).
    (9) Control rod licensing acceptance criteria (App. 4C).
    (10) Instrument setpoint methodology.
    (11) EMS performance specifications and architecture.
    (12) SSLC hardware and software qualification.
    (13) Self-test system design testing features and commitments.
    (14) Human factors engineering design and implementation process.
    d. Departures from Tier 2* information that are made under paragraph 
B.6 of this section do not require an exemption from this appendix.
    C. Operational requirements.
    1. Generic changes to generic technical specifications and other 
operational requirements that were completely reviewed and approved in 
the design certification rulemaking and do not require a change to a 
design feature in the generic DCD are governed by the requirements in 10 
CFR 50.109. Generic changes that do require a change to a design feature 
in the generic DCD are governed by the requirements in paragraphs A or B 
of this section.
    2. Generic changes to generic TS and other operational requirements 
are applicable to all applicants who reference this appendix, except 
those for which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by 
action taken under paragraphs C.3 or C.4 of this section.
    3. The Commission may require plant-specific departures on generic 
technical specifications and other operational requirements that were 
completely reviewed and approved, provided a change to a design feature 
in the generic DCD is not required and special circumstances as defined 
in 10 CFR 2.335 are present. The Commission may modify or supplement 
generic technical specifications and other operational requirements that 
were not completely reviewed and approved or require additional 
technical specifications and other operational requirements on a plant-
specific basis, provided a change to a design feature in the generic DCD 
is not required.
    4. An applicant who references this appendix may request an 
exemption from the generic technical specifications or other operational 
requirements. The Commission may grant such a request only if it 
determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 
CFR 52.7. The grant of an exemption must be subject to litigation in the 
same manner as other issues material to the license hearing.
    5. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, 
amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10

[[Page 123]]

CFR 52.103(a), who believes that an operational requirement approved in 
the DCD or a technical specification derived from the generic technical 
specifications must be changed may petition to admit into the proceeding 
such a contention. Such petition must comply with the general 
requirements of 10 CFR 2.309 and must demonstrate why special 
circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 2.335 are present, or for compliance 
with the Commission's regulations in effect at the time this appendix 
was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix. Any other 
party may file a response thereto. If, on the basis of the petition and 
any response, the presiding officer determines that a sufficient showing 
has been made, the presiding officer shall certify the matter directly 
to the Commission for determination of the admissibility of the 
contention. All other issues with respect to the plant-specific 
technical specifications or other operational requirements are subject 
to a hearing as part of the license proceeding.
    6. After issuance of a license, the generic technical specifications 
have no further effect on the plant-specific technical specifications 
and changes to the plant-specific technical specifications will be 
treated as license amendments under 10 CFR 50.90.

    IX. Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC)

    A.1. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
perform and demonstrate conformance with the ITAAC before fuel load. 
With respect to activities subject to an ITAAC, an applicant for a 
license may proceed at its own risk with design and procurement 
activities, and a licensee may proceed at its own risk with design, 
procurement, construction, and preoperational activities, even though 
the NRC may not have found that any particular ITAAC has been met.
    2. The licensee who references this appendix shall notify the NRC 
that the required inspections, tests, and analyses in the ITAAC have 
been successfully completed and that the corresponding acceptance 
criteria have been met.
    3. In the event that an activity is subject to an ITAAC, and the 
applicant or licensee who references this appendix has not demonstrated 
that the ITAAC has been met, the applicant or licensee may either take 
corrective actions to successfully complete that ITAAC, request an 
exemption from the ITAAC in accordance with Section VIII of this 
appendix and 10 CFR 52.97(b), or petition for rulemaking to amend this 
appendix by changing the requirements of the ITAAC, under 10 CFR 2.802 
and 52.97(b). Such rulemaking changes to the ITAAC must meet the 
requirements of paragraph VIII.A.1 of this appendix.
    B.1. The NRC shall ensure that the required inspections, tests, and 
analyses in the ITAAC are performed. The NRC shall verify that the 
inspections, tests, and analyses referenced by the licensee have been 
successfully completed and, based solely thereon, find the prescribed 
acceptance criteria have been met. At appropriate intervals during 
construction, the NRC shall publish notices of the successful completion 
of ITAAC in the Federal Register.
    2. In accordance with 10 CFR 52.103(g), the Commission shall find 
that the acceptance criteria in the ITAAC for the license are met before 
fuel load.
    3. After the Commission has made the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), the ITAAC do not, by virtue of their inclusion within the 
DCD, constitute regulatory requirements either for licensees or for 
renewal of the license; except for specific ITAAC, which are the subject 
of a Sec. 52.103(a) hearing, their expiration will occur upon final 
Commission action in such proceeding. However, subsequent modifications 
must comply with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 design descriptions in the plant-
specific DCD unless the licensee has complied with the applicable 
requirements of 10 CFR 52.98 and Section VIII of this appendix.

Sec. Appendix B to Part 52--Design Certification Rule for the System 80+ 
                                 Design

                             I. Introduction

    Appendix B constitutes design certification for the System 80+ \1\ 
standard plant design, in accordance with 10 CFR part 52, subpart B. The 
applicant for certification of the System 80+ design was Combustion 
Engineering, Inc. (ABB-CE), which is now Westinghouse Electric Company 
LLC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ ``System 80+'' is a trademark of Westinghouse Electric Company 
LLC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             II. Definitions

    A. Generic design control document (generic DCD) means the document 
containing the Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and generic technical 
specifications that is incorporated by reference into this appendix.
    B. Generic technical specifications means the information, required 
by 10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a, for the portion of the plant that is within 
the scope of this appendix.
    C. Plant-specific DCD means the document, maintained by an applicant 
or licensee who references this appendix, consisting of the information 
in the generic DCD, as modified and supplemented by the plant-specific 
departures and exemptions made under Section VIII of this appendix.
    D. Tier 1 means the portion of the design-related information 
contained in the generic DCD that is approved and certified by this 
appendix (hereinafter Tier 1 information). The design descriptions, 
interface requirements, and site parameters are derived from Tier 2 
information. Tier 1 information includes:
    1. Definitions and general provisions;
    2. Design descriptions;
    3. Inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC);
    4. Significant site parameters; and
    5. Significant interface requirements.
    E. Tier 2 means the portion of the design-related information 
contained in the generic DCD that is approved but not certified by this 
appendix (Tier 2 information). Compliance with Tier 2 is required, but 
generic changes to and plant-specific departures from Tier 2 are 
governed by Section VIII of this appendix. Compliance with Tier 2 
provides a sufficient, but not the only acceptable, method for complying 
with Tier 1. Compliance methods differing from Tier 2 must satisfy the 
change process in Section VIII of this appendix. Regardless of these 
differences, an applicant or licensee must meet the requirement in 
Section III.B of this appendix to reference Tier 2 when referencing Tier 
1. Tier 2 information includes:
    1. Information required by Sec. Sec. 52.47(a) and 52.47(c), with 
the exception of generic technical specifications and conceptual design 
information;
    2. Supporting information on the inspections, tests, and analyses 
that will be performed to demonstrate that the acceptance criteria in 
the ITAAC have been met; and
    3. Combined license (COL) action items (COL license information), 
which identify certain matters that must be addressed in the site-
specific portion of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) by an 
applicant who references this appendix. These items constitute 
information requirements but are not the only acceptable set of 
information in the

[[Page 128]]

FSAR. An applicant may depart from or omit these items, provided that 
the departure or omission is identified and justified in the FSAR. After 
issuance of a construction permit or COL, these items are not 
requirements for the licensee unless such items are restated in the 
FSAR.
    F. Tier 2* means the portion of the Tier 2 information, designated 
as such in the generic DCD, which is subject to the change process in 
Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix. This designation expires for some 
Tier 2* information under Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix.
    G. Departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-
specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety 
analyses means:
    (1) Changing any of the elements of the method described in the 
plant-specific DCD unless the results of the analysis are conservative 
or essentially the same; or
    (2) Changing from a method described in the plant-specific DCD to 
another method unless that method has been approved by NRC for the 
intended application.
    H. All other terms in this appendix have the meaning set out in 10 
CFR 50.2 or 52.1, or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, as applicable.

                         III. Scope and Contents

    A. Tier 1, Tier 2, and the generic technical specifications in the 
System 80+ Design Control Document, ABB-CE, with revisions dated January 
1997, are approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of the 
Office of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 
CFR part 51. Copies of the generic DCD may be obtained from the National 
Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, 
Virginia 22161. A copy is available for examination and copying at the 
NRC Public Document Room located at One White Flint North, 11555 
Rockville Pike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland 20852. Copies are also 
available for examination at the NRC Library located at Two White Flint 
North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852 and the Office of 
the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, 
Washington, DC.
    B. An applicant or licensee referencing this appendix, in accordance 
with Section IV of this appendix, shall incorporate by reference and 
comply with the requirements of this appendix, including Tier 1, Tier 2, 
and the generic technical specifications except as otherwise provided in 
this appendix. Conceptual design information, as set forth in the 
generic DCD, and the Technical Support Document for the System 80+ 
design are not part of this appendix.
    C. If there is a conflict between Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the DCD, then 
Tier 1 controls.
    D. If there is a conflict between the generic DCD and either the 
application for design certification of the System 80+ design or NUREG-
1462, ``Final Safety Evaluation Report Related to the Certification of 
the System 80+ Design,'' (FSER) and Supplement No. 1, then the generic 
DCD controls.
    E. Design activities for structures, systems, and components that 
are wholly outside the scope of this appendix may be performed using

Westinghouse), and Westinghouse's response. The Commission and presiding 
officer may order Westinghouse to provide access to some or all of the 
requested information, subject to an appropriate non-disclosure 
agreement.

                     VII. Duration of This Appendix

    This appendix may be referenced for a period of 15 years from June 
20, 1997, except as provided for in 10 CFR 52.55(b) and 52.57(b). This 
appendix remains valid for an applicant or licensee who references this 
appendix until the application is withdrawn or the license expires, 
including any period of extended operation under a renewed license.

               VIII. Processes for Changes and Departures

    A. Tier 1 information.
    1. Generic changes to Tier 1 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(1).
    2. Generic changes to Tier 1 information are applicable to all 
applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for 
which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action 
taken under paragraphs A.3 or A.4 of this section.
    3. Departures from Tier 1 information that are required by the 
Commission through plant-specific orders are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(4).
    4. Exemptions from Tier 1 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(b)(1) and 52.98(f). The Commission will 
deny a request for an exemption from Tier 1, if it finds that the design 
change will result in a significant decrease in the level of safety 
otherwise provided by the design.

                          B. Tier 2 Information

    1. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(1).
    2. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are applicable to all 
applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for 
which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action 
taken under paragraphs B.3, B.4, B.5, or B.6 of this section.
    3. The Commission may not require new requirements on Tier 2 
information by plant-specific order while this appendix is in effect 
under Sec. Sec. 52.55 or 52.61, unless:
    a. A modification is necessary to secure compliance with the 
Commission's regulations applicable and in effect at the time this 
appendix was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix, or to 
assure adequate protection of the public health and safety or the common 
defense and security; and
    b. Special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 52.7 are present.
    4. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may request 
an exemption from Tier 2 information. The Commission may grant such a 
request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the 
requirements of 10 CFR 52.7. The Commission will deny a request for an 
exemption from Tier 2, if it finds that the design change will result in 
a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by the 
design. The grant of an exemption to an applicant must be subject to 
litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license 
hearing. The grant of an exemption to a licensee must be subject to an 
opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as license amendments.
    5.a. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may 
depart from Tier 2 information, without prior NRC approval, unless the 
proposed departure involves a change to or departure from Tier 1 
information, Tier 2* information, or the technical specifications, or 
requires a license amendment under paragraphs B.5.b or B.5.c of this 
section. When evaluating the proposed departure, an applicant or 
licensee shall consider all matters described in the plant-specific DCD.
    b. A proposed departure from Tier 2, other than one affecting 
resolution of a severe accident issue identified in the plant-specific 
DCD, requires a license amendment if it would--
    (1) Result in more than a minimal increase in the frequency of 
occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific 
DCD;
    (2) Result in more than a minimal increase in the likelihood of 
occurrence of a malfunction of a structure, system, or component (SSC) 
important to safety previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;
    (3) Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;
    (4) Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of a 
malfunction of an SSC important to safety previously evaluated in the 
plant-specific DCD;

[[Page 131]]

    (5) Create a possibility for an accident of a different type than 
any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;
    (6) Create a possibility for a malfunction of an SSC important to 
safety with a different result than any evaluated previously in the 
plant-specific DCD;
    (7) Result in a design basis limit for a fission product barrier as 
described in the plant-specific DCD being exceeded or altered; or
    (8) Result in a departure from a method of evaluation described in 
the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the 
safety analyses.
    c. A proposed departure from Tier 2 affecting resolution of an ex-
vessel severe accident design feature identified in the plant-specific 
DCD, requires a license amendment if:
    (1) There is a substantial increase in the probability of an ex-
vessel severe accident such that a particular ex-vessel severe accident 
previously reviewed and determined to be not credible could become 
credible; or
    (2) There is a substantial increase in the consequences to the 
public of a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed.
    d. If a departure requires a license amendment under paragraph B.5.b 
or B.5.c of this section, it is governed by 10 CFR 50.90.
    e. A departure from Tier 2 information that is made under paragraph 
B.5 of this section does not require an exemption from this appendix.
    f. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, 
amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10 CFR 
52.103(a), who believes that an applicant or licensee who references 
this appendix has not complied with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix 
when departing from Tier 2 information, may petition the NRC to admit 
into the proceeding such a contention. In addition to compliance with 
the general requirements of 10 CFR 2.309, the petition must demonstrate 
that the departure does not comply with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this 
appendix. Further, the petition must demonstrate that the change bears 
on an asserted noncompliance with an ITAAC acceptance criterion in the 
case of a 10 CFR 52.103 preoperational hearing, or that the change bears 
directly on the amendment request in the case of a hearing on a license 
amendment. Any other party may file a response. If, on the basis of the 
petition and any response, the presiding officer determines that a 
sufficient showing has been made, the presiding officer shall certify 
the matter directly to the Commission for determination of the 
admissibility of the contention. The Commission may admit such a 
contention if it determines the petition raises a genuine issue of 
material fact regarding compliance with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this 
appendix.
    6.a. An applicant who references this appendix may not depart from 
Tier 2* information, which is designated with italicized text or 
brackets and an asterisk in the generic DCD, without NRC approval. The 
departure will not be considered a resolved issue, within the meaning of 
Section VI of this appendix and 10 CFR 52.63(a)(5).
    b. A licensee who references this appendix may not depart from the 
following Tier 2* matters without prior NRC approval. A request for a 
departure will be treated as a request for a license amendment under 10 
CFR 50.90.
    (1) Maximum fuel rod average burnup.
    (2) Control room human factors engineering.
    c. A licensee who references this appendix may not, before the plant 
first achieves full power following the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), depart from the following Tier 2* matters except in 
accordance with paragraph B.6.b of this section. After the plant first 
achieves full power, the following Tier 2* matters revert to Tier 2 
status and are thereafter subject to the departure provisions in 
paragraph B.5 of this section.
    (1) ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code, Section III.
    (2) ACI 349 and ANSI/AISC-690.
    (3) Motor-operated valves.
    (4) Equipment seismic qualification methods.
    (5) Piping design acceptance criteria.
    (6) Fuel and control rod design, except burnup limit.
    (7) Instrumentation and controls setpoint methodology.
    (8) Instrumentation and controls hardware and software changes.
    (9) Instrumentation and controls environmental qualification.
    (10) Seismic design criteria for non-seismic Category I structures.
    d. Departures from Tier 2* information that are made under paragraph 
B.6 of this section do not require an exemption from this appendix.
    C. Operational requirements.
    1. Generic changes to generic technical specifications and other 
operational requirements that were completely reviewed and approved in 
the design certification rulemaking and do not require a change to a 
design feature in the generic DCD are governed by the requirements in 10 
CFR 50.109. Generic changes that do require a change to a design feature 
in the generic DCD are governed by the requirements in paragraphs A or B 
of this section.
    2. Generic changes to generic TS and other operational requirements 
are applicable to all applicants who reference this appendix, except 
those for which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by 
action taken under paragraphs C.3 or C.4 of this section.

[[Page 132]]

    3. The Commission may require plant-specific departures on generic 
technical specifications and other operational requirements that were 
completely reviewed and approved, provided a change to a design feature 
in the generic DCD is not required and special circumstances as defined 
in 10 CFR 2.335 are present. The Commission may modify or supplement 
generic technical specifications and other operational requirements that 
were not completely reviewed and approved or require additional 
technical specifications and other operational requirements on a plant-
specific basis, provided a change to a design feature in the generic DCD 
is not required.
    4. An applicant who references this appendix may request an 
exemption from the generic technical specifications or other operational 
requirements. The Commission may grant such a request only if it 
determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 
CFR 52.7. The grant of an exemption must be subject to litigation in the 
same manner as other issues material to the license hearing.
    5. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, 
amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10 CFR 
52.103(a), who believes that an operational requirement approved in the 
DCD or a technical specification derived from the generic technical 
specifications must be changed may petition to admit into the proceeding 
such a contention. Such a petition must comply with the general 
requirements of 10 CFR 2.309 and must demonstrate why special 
circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 2.335 are present, or for compliance 
with the Commission's regulations in effect at the time this appendix 
was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix. Any other 
party may file a response thereto. If, on the basis of the petition and 
any response, the presiding officer determines that a sufficient showing 
has been made, the presiding officer shall certify the matter directly 
to the Commission for determination of the admissibility of the 
contention. All other issues with respect to the plant-specific 
technical specifications or other operational requirements are subject 
to a hearing as part of the license proceeding.
    6. After issuance of a license, the generic technical specifications 
have no further effect on the plant-specific technical specifications 
and changes to the plant-specific technical specifications will be 
treated as license amendments under 10 CFR 50.90.

    IX. Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC)

    A.1 An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
perform and demonstrate conformance with the ITAAC before fuel load. 
With respect to activities subject to an ITAAC, an applicant for a 
license may proceed at its own risk with design and procurement 
activities, and a licensee may proceed at its own risk with design, 
procurement, construction, and preoperational activities, even though 
the NRC may not have found that any particular ITAAC has been met.
    2. The licensee who references this appendix shall notify the NRC 
that the required inspections, tests, and analyses in the ITAAC have 
been successfully completed and that the corresponding acceptance 
criteria have been met.
    3. In the event that an activity is subject to an ITAAC, and the 
applicant or licensee who references this appendix has not demonstrated 
that the ITAAC has been met, the applicant or licensee may either take 
corrective actions to successfully complete that ITAAC, request an 
exemption from the ITAAC in accordance with Section VIII of this 
appendix and 10 CFR 52.97(b), or petition for rulemaking to amend this 
appendix by changing the requirements of the ITAAC, under 10 CFR 2.802 
and 52.97(b). Such rulemaking changes to the ITAAC must meet the 
requirements of Section VIII.A.1 of this appendix.
    B.1 The NRC shall ensure that the required inspections, tests, and 
analyses in the ITAAC are performed. The NRC shall verify that the 
inspections, tests, and analyses referenced by the licensee have been 
successfully completed and, based solely thereon, find the prescribed 
acceptance criteria have been met. At appropriate intervals during 
construction, the NRC shall publish notices of the successful completion 
of ITAAC in the Federal Register.
    2. In accordance with 10 CFR 52.103(g), the Commission shall find 
that the acceptance criteria in the ITAAC for the license are met before 
fuel load.
    3. After the Commission has made the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), the ITAAC do not, by virtue of their inclusion within the 
DCD, constitute regulatory requirements either for licensees or for 
renewal of the license; except for specific ITAAC, which are the subject 
of a Sec. 52.103(a) hearing, their expiration will occur upon final 
Commission action in such proceeding. However, subsequent modifications 
must comply with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 design descriptions in the plant-
specific DCD unless the licensee has complied with the applicable 
requirements of 10 CFR 52.98 and Section VIII of this appendix.

                        X. Records and Reporting

    A. Records.
    1. The applicant for this appendix shall maintain a copy of the 
generic DCD that includes all generic changes to Tier 1, Tier 2, and the 
generic TS and other operational requirements. The applicant shall 
maintain the proprietary and safeguards information referenced in the 
generic DCD for the period

[[Page 133]]

that this appendix may be referenced, as specified in Section VII of 
this appendix.
    2. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
maintain the plant-specific DCD to accurately reflect both generic 
changes to the generic DCD and plant-specific departures made under 
Section VIII of this appendix throughout the period of application and 
for the term of the license (including any period of renewal).
    3. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
prepare and maintain written evaluations which provide the bases for the 
determinations required by Section VIII of this appendix. These 
evaluations must be retained throughout the period of application and 
for the term of the license (including any period of renewal).
    B. Reporting.
    1. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
submit a report to the NRC containing a brief description of any plant-
specific departures from the DCD, including a summary of the evaluation 
of each. This report must be filed in accordance with the filing 
requirements applicable to reports in 10 CFR 52.3.
    2. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
submit updates to its DCD, which reflect the generic changes to and 
plant-specific departures from the generic DCD made under Section VIII 
of this appendix. These updates must be filed under the filing 
requirements applicable to final safety analysis report updates in 10 
CFR 52.3 and 50.71(e).
    3. The reports and updates required by paragraphs X.B.1 and X.B.2 
must be submitted as follows:
    a. On the date that an application for a license referencing this 
appendix is submitted, the application must include the report and any 
updates to the generic DCD.
    b. During the interval from the date of application for a license to 
the date the Commission makes the finding required by 10 CFR 52.103(g), 
the report must be submitted semi-annually. Updates to the plant-
specific DCD must be submitted annually and may be submitted along with 
amendments to the application.
    c. After the Commission makes the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), the reports and updates to the plant-specific DCD must be 
submitted, along with updates to the site-specific portion of the final 
safety analysis report for the facility, at the intervals required by 10 
CFR 50.59(d)(2) and 50.71(e)(4), respectively, or at shorter intervals 
as specified in the license.

  Sec. Appendix C to Part 52--Design Certification Rule for the AP600 
                                 Design

                             I. Introduction

    Appendix C constitutes the standard design certification for the 
AP600 \1\ design, in accordance with 10 CFR part 52, subpart B. The 
applicant for certification of the AP600 design is Westinghouse Electric 
Company LLC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ AP600 is a trademark of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             II. Definitions

    A. Generic design control document (generic DCD) means the document 
containing the Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and generic technical 
specifications that is incorporated by reference into this appendix.
    B. Generic technical specifications means the information, required 
by 10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a, for the portion of the plant that is within 
the scope of this appendix.
    C. Plant-specific DCD means the document, maintained by an applicant 
or licensee who references this appendix, consisting of the information 
in the generic DCD, as modified and supplemented by the plant-specific 
departures and exemptions made under Section VIII of this appendix.
    D. Tier 1 means the portion of the design-related information 
contained in the generic DCD that is approved and certified by this 
appendix (hereinafter Tier 1 information). The design descriptions, 
interface requirements, and site parameters are derived from Tier 2 
information. Tier 1 information includes:
    1. Definitions and general provisions;
    2. Design descriptions;
    3. Inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC);
    4. Significant site parameters; and
    5. Significant interface requirements.
    E. Tier 2 means the portion of the design-related information 
contained in the generic DCD that is approved but not certified by this 
appendix (Tier 2 information). Compliance with Tier 2 is required, but 
generic changes to and plant-specific departures from Tier 2 are 
governed by Section VIII of this appendix. Compliance with Tier 2 
provides a sufficient, but not the only acceptable, method for complying 
with Tier 1. Compliance methods differing from Tier 2 must satisfy the 
change process in Section VIII of this appendix. Regardless of these 
differences, an applicant or licensee must meet the requirement in 
Section III.B of this appendix to reference Tier 2 when referencing Tier 
1. Tier 2 information includes:
    1. Information required by Sec. Sec. 52.47(a) and 52.47(c), with 
the exception of generic technical specifications and conceptual design 
information;

[[Page 134]]

    2. Supporting information on the inspections, tests, and analyses 
that will be performed to demonstrate that the acceptance criteria in 
the ITAAC have been met; and
    3. Combined license (COL) action items (COL license information), 
which identify certain matters that must be addressed in the site-
specific portion of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) by an 
applicant who references this appendix. These items constitute 
information requirements but are not the only acceptable set of 
information in the FSAR. An applicant may depart from or omit these 
items, provided that the departure or omission is identified and 
justified in the FSAR. After issuance of a construction permit or COL, 
these items are not requirements for the licensee unless such items are 
restated in the FSAR.
    4. The investment protection short-term availability controls in 
Section 16.3 of the DCD.
    F. Tier 2* means the portion of the Tier 2 information, designated 
as such in the generic DCD, which is subject to the change process in 
Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix. This designation expires for some 
Tier 2* information under Section VIII.B.6.
    G. Departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-
specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety 
analyses means:
    (1) Changing any of the elements of the method described in the 
plant-specific DCD unless the results of the analysis are conservative 
or essentially the same; or
    (2) Changing from a method described in the plant-specific DCD to 
another method unless that method has been approved by NRC for the 
intended application.
    H. All other terms in this appendix have the meaning set out in 10 
CFR 50.2 or 52.1, or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, as applicable.

                         III. Scope and Contents

    A. Tier 1, Tier 2 (including the investment protection short-term 
availability controls in Section 16.3), and the generic technical 
specifications in the AP600 DCD (12/99 revision) are approved for 
incorporation by reference by the Director of the Office of the Federal 
Register on January 24, 2000, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1

information or other secondary references in the AP600 DCD, in order to 
request or participate in the hearing required by 10 CFR 52.85 or the 
hearing provided under 10 CFR 52.103, or to request or participate in 
any other hearing relating to this appendix in which interested persons 
have adjudicatory hearing rights, shall first request access to such 
information from Westinghouse. The request must state with 
particularity:

[[Page 136]]

    a. The nature of the proprietary or other information sought;
    b. The reason why the information currently available to the public 
at the NRC Web site, http://www.nrc.gov, and/or at the NRC Public 
Document Room, is insufficient;
    c. The relevance of the requested information to the hearing 
issue(s) which the person proposes to raise; and
    d. A showing that the requesting person has the capability to 
understand and utilize the requested information.
    2. If a person claims that the information is necessary to prepare a 
request for hearing, the request must be filed no later than 15 days 
after publication in the Federal Register of the notice required either 
by 10 CFR 52.85 or 10 CFR 52.103. If Westinghouse declines to provide 
the information sought, Westinghouse shall send a written response 
within 10 days of receiving the request to the requesting person setting 
forth with particularity the reasons for its refusal. The person may 
then request the Commission (or presiding officer, if a proceeding has 
been established) to order disclosure. The person shall include copies 
of the original request (and any subsequent clarifying information 
provided by the requesting party to the applicant) and the applicant's 
response. The Commission and presiding officer shall base their

clarifying information provided by the requesting person to 
Westinghouse), and Westinghouse's response. The Commission and presiding 
officer may order Westinghouse to provide access to some or all of the 
requested information, subject to an appropriate non-disclosure 
agreement.

                     VII. Duration of This Appendix

    This appendix may be referenced for a period of 15 years from 
January 24, 2000, except as provided for in 10 CFR 52.55(b) and 
52.57(b). This appendix remains valid for an applicant or licensee who 
references this appendix until the application is withdrawn or the 
license expires, including any period of extended operation under a 
renewed license.

               VIII. Processes for Changes and Departures

    A. Tier 1 information.
    1. Generic changes to Tier 1 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(1).
    2. Generic changes to Tier 1 information are applicable to all 
applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for 
which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action 
taken under paragraphs A.3 or A.4 of this section.
    3. Departures from Tier 1 information that are required by the 
Commission through plant-specific orders are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(4).
    4. Exemptions from Tier 1 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(b)(1) and 52.98(f). The Commission will 
deny a request for an exemption from Tier 1, if it finds that the design 
change will result in a significant decrease in the level of safety 
otherwise provided by the design.
    B. Tier 2 information.
    1. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(1).
    2. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are applicable to all 
applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for 
which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action 
taken under paragraphs B.3, B.4, B.5, or B.6 of this section.
    3. The Commission may not require new requirements on Tier 2 
information by plant-specific order while this appendix is in effect 
under Sec. Sec. 52.55 or 52.61, unless:
    a. A modification is necessary to secure compliance with the 
Commission's regulations applicable and in effect at the time this 
appendix was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix, or to 
assure adequate protection of the public health and safety or the common 
defense and security; and
    b. Special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 52.7 are present.
    4. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may request 
an exemption from Tier 2 information. The Commission may grant such a 
request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the 
requirements of 10 CFR 52.7. The Commission will deny a request for an 
exemption from Tier 2, if it finds that the design change will result in 
a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by the 
design. The grant of an exemption to an applicant must be subject to 
litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license 
hearing. The grant of an exemption to a licensee must be subject to an 
opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as license amendments.
    5.a. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may 
depart from Tier 2 information, without prior NRC approval, unless the 
proposed departure involves a change to or departure from Tier 1 
information, Tier 2* information, or the technical specifications, or 
requires a license amendment under paragraphs B.5.b or B.5.c of this 
section. When evaluating the proposed departure, an applicant or 
licensee shall consider all matters described in the plant-specific DCD.
    b. A proposed departure from Tier 2, other than one affecting 
resolution of a severe accident issue identified in the plant-specific

[[Page 137]]

DCD, requires a license amendment if it would:
    (1) Result in more than a minimal increase in the frequency of 
occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific 
DCD;
    (2) Result in more than a minimal increase in the likelihood of 
occurrence of a malfunction of a structure, system, or component (SSC) 
important to safety previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;
    (3) Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;
    (4) Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of a 
malfunction of an SSC important to safety previously evaluated in the 
plant-specific DCD;
    (5) Create a possibility for an accident of a different type than 
any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;
    (6) Create a possibility for a malfunction of an SSC important to 
safety with a different result than any evaluated previously in the 
plant-specific DCD;
    (7) Result in a design basis limit for a fission product barrier as 
described in the plant-specific DCD being exceeded or altered; or
    (8) Result in a departure from a method of evaluation described in 
the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the 
safety analyses.
    c. A proposed departure from Tier 2 affecting resolution of an ex-
vessel severe accident design feature identified in the plant-specific 
DCD, requires a license amendment if:
    (1) There is a substantial increase in the probability of an ex-
vessel severe accident such that a particular ex-vessel severe accident 
previously reviewed and determined to be not credible could become 
credible; or
    (2) There is a substantial increase in the consequences to the 
public of a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed.
    d. If a departure requires a license amendment under paragraphs 
B.5.b or B.5.c of this section, it is governed by 10 CFR 50.90.
    e. A departure from Tier 2 information that is made under paragraph 
B.5 of this section does not require an exemption from this appendix.
    f. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, 
amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10 CFR 
52.103(a), who believes that an applicant or licensee who references 
this appendix has not complied with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix 
when departing from Tier 2 information, may petition the NRC to admit 
into the proceeding such a contention. In addition to compliance with 
the general requirements of 10 CFR 2.309, the petition must demonstrate 
that the departure does not comply with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this 
appendix. Further, the petition must demonstrate that the change bears 
on an asserted noncompliance with an ITAAC acceptance criterion in the 
case of a 10 CFR 52.103 preoperational hearing, or that the change bears 
directly on the amendment request in the case of a hearing on a license 
amendment. Any other party may file a response. If, on the basis of the 
petition and any response, the presiding officer determines that a 
sufficient showing has been made, the presiding officer shall certify 
the matter directly to the Commission for determination of the 
admissibility of the contention. The Commission may admit such a 
contention if it determines the petition raises a genuine issue of 
material fact regarding compliance with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this 
appendix.
    6a. An applicant who references this appendix may not depart from 
Tier 2* information, which is designated with italicized text or 
brackets and an asterisk in the generic DCD, without NRC approval. The 
departure will not be considered a resolved issue, within the meaning of 
Section VI of this appendix and 10 CFR 52.63(a)(5).
    b. A licensee who references this appendix may not depart from the 
following Tier 2* matters without prior NRC approval. A request for a 
departure will be treated as a request for a license amendment under 10 
CFR 50.90.
    (1) Maximum fuel rod average burn-up.
    (2) Fuel principal design requirements.
    (3) Fuel criteria evaluation process.
    (4) Fire areas.
    (5) Human factors engineering.
    c. A licensee who references this appendix may not, before the plant 
first achieves full power following the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), depart from the following Tier 2* matters except in 
accordance with paragraph B.6.b of this section. After the plant first 
achieves full power, the following Tier 2* matters revert to Tier 2 
status and are thereafter subject to the departure provisions in 
paragraph B.5 of this section.
    (1) Nuclear Island structural dimensions.
    (2) ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, and Code 
Case--284.
    (3) Design Summary of Critical Sections.
    (4) ACI 318, ACI 349, and ANSI/AISC--690.
    (5) Definition of critical locations and thicknesses.
    (6) Seismic qualification methods and standards.
    (7) Nuclear design of fuel and reactivity control system, except 
burn-up limit.
    (8) Motor-operated and power-operated valves.
    (9) Instrumentation and control system design processes, methods, 
and standards.
    (10) PRHR natural circulation test (first plant only).
    (11) ADS and CMT verification tests (first three plants only).
    d. Departures from Tier 2* information that are made under paragraph 
B.6 of this

[[Page 138]]

section do not require an exemption from this appendix.
    C. Operational requirements.
    1. Generic changes to generic technical specifications and other 
operational requirements that were completely reviewed and approved in 
the design certification rulemaking and do not require a change to a 
design feature in the generic DCD are governed by the requirements in 10 
CFR 50.109. Generic changes that do require a change to a design feature 
in the generic DCD are governed by the requirements in paragraphs A or B 
of this section.
    2. Generic changes to generic TS and other operational requirements 
are applicable to all applicants who reference this appendix, except 
those for which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by 
action taken under paragraphs C.3 or C.4 of this section.
    3. The Commission may require plant-specific departures on generic 
technical specifications and other operational requirements that were 
completely reviewed and approved, provided a change to a design feature 
in the generic DCD is not required and special circumstances as defined 
in 10 CFR 2.335 are present. The Commission may modify or supplement 
generic technical specifications and other operational requirements that 
were not completely reviewed and approved or require additional 
technical specifications and other operational requirements on a plant-
specific basis, provided a change to a design feature in the generic DCD 
is not required.
    4. An applicant who references this appendix may request an 
exemption from the generic technical specifications or other operational 
requirements. The Commission may grant such a request only if it 
determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 
CFR 52.7. The grant of an exemption must be subject to litigation in the 
same manner as other issues material to the license hearing.
    5. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, 
amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10 CFR 
52.103(a), who believes that an operational requirement approved in the 
DCD or a technical specification derived from the generic technical 
specifications must be changed may petition to admit into the proceeding 
such a contention. Such petition must comply with the general 
requirements of 10 CFR 2.309 and must demonstrate why special 
circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 2.335 are present, or for compliance 
with the Commission's regulations in effect at the time this appendix 
was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix. Any other 
party may file a response thereto. If, on the basis of the petition and 
any response, the presiding officer determines that a sufficient showing 
has been made, the presiding officer shall certify the matter directly 
to the Commission for determination of the admissibility of the 
contention. All other issues with respect to the plant-specific 
technical specifications or other operational requirements are subject 
to a hearing as part of the license proceeding.
    6. After issuance of a license, the generic technical specifications 
have no further effect on the plant-specific technical specifications 
and changes to the plant-specific technical specifications will be 
treated as license amendments under 10 CFR 50.90.

    IX. Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC)

    A.1 An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
perform and demonstrate conformance with the ITAAC before fuel load. 
With respect to activities subject to an ITAAC, an applicant for a 
license may proceed at its own risk with design and procurement 
activities, and a licensee may proceed at its own risk with design, 
procurement, construction, and preoperational activities, even though 
the NRC may not have found that any particular ITAAC has been met.
    2. The licensee who references this appendix shall notify the NRC 
that the required inspections, tests, and analyses in the ITAAC have 
been successfully completed and that the corresponding acceptance 
criteria have been met.
    3. In the event that an activity is subject to an ITAAC, and the 
applicant or licensee who references this appendix has not demonstrated 
that the ITAAC has been met, the applicant or licensee may either take 
corrective actions to successfully complete that ITAAC, request an 
exemption from the ITAAC in accordance with Section VIII of this 
appendix and 10 CFR 52.97(b), or petition for rulemaking to amend this 
appendix by changing the requirements of the ITAAC, under 10 CFR 2.802 
and 52.97(b). Such rulemaking changes to the ITAAC must meet the 
requirements of paragraph VIII.A.1 of this appendix.
    B.1. The NRC shall ensure that the required inspections, tests, and 
analyses in the ITAAC are performed. The NRC shall verify that the 
inspections, tests, and analyses referenced by the licensee have been 
successfully completed and, based solely thereon, find the prescribed 
acceptance criteria have been met. At appropriate intervals during 
construction, the NRC shall publish notices of the successful completion 
of ITAAC in the Federal Register.
    2. In accordance with 10 CFR 52.103(g), the Commission shall find 
that the acceptance criteria in the ITAAC for the license are met before 
fuel load.
    3. After the Commission has made the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), the ITAAC do not, by virtue of their inclusion within the 
DCD, constitute regulatory requirements

[[Page 139]]

either for licensees or for renewal of the license; except for specific 
ITAAC, which are the subject of a Sec. 52.103(a) hearing, their 
expiration will occur upon final Commission action in such proceeding. 
However, subsequent modifications must comply with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 
design descriptions in the plant-specific DCD unless the licensee has 
complied with the applicable requirements of 10 CFR 52.98 and Section 
VIII of this appendix.

                        X. Records and Reporting

    A. Records.
    1. The applicant for this appendix shall maintain a copy of the 
generic DCD that includes all generic changes to Tier 1, Tier 2, and the 
generic TS and other operational requirements. The applicant shall 
maintain the proprietary and safeguards information referenced in the 
generic DCD for the period that this appendix may be referenced, as 
specified in Section VII of this appendix.
    2. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
maintain the plant-specific DCD to accurately reflect both generic 
changes to the generic DCD and plant-specific departures made under 
Section VIII of this appendix throughout the period of application and 
for the term of the license (including any period of renewal).
    3. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
prepare and maintain written evaluations which provide the bases for the 
determinations required by Section VIII of this appendix. These 
evaluations must be retained throughout the period of application and 
for the term of the license (including any period of renewal).
    B. Reporting.
    1. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
submit a report to the NRC containing a brief description of any plant-
specific departures from the DCD, including a summary of the evaluation 
of each. This report must be filed in accordance with the filing 
requirements applicable to reports in 10 CFR 52.3.
    2. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
submit updates to its DCD, which reflect the generic changes to and 
plant-specific departures from the generic DCD made under Section VIII 
of this appendix. These updates must be filed under the filing 
requirements applicable to final safety analysis report updates in 10 
CFR 52.3 and 50.71(e).
    3. The reports and updates required by paragraphs X.B.1 and X.B.2 
must be submitted as follows:
    a. On the date that an application for a license referencing this 
appendix is submitted, the application must include the report and any 
updates to the generic DCD.
    b. During the interval from the date of application for a license to 
the date the Commission makes the finding required by 10 CFR 52.103(g), 
the report must be submitted semi-annually. Updates to the plant-
specific DCD must be submitted annually and may be submitted along with 
amendments to the application.
    c. After the Commission makes the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), the reports and updates to the plant-specific DCD must be 
submitted, along with updates to the site-specific portion of the final 
safety analysis report for the facility, at the intervals required by 10 
CFR 50.59(d)(2) and 50.71(e), respectively, or at shorter intervals as 
specified in the license.

                             I. Introduction

    Appendix D constitutes the standard design certification for the 
AP1000 \1\ design, in accordance with 10 CFR part 52, subpart B. The 
applicant for certification of the AP1000 design is Westinghouse 
Electric Company LLC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ AP1000 is a trademark of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             II. Definitions

    A. Generic design control document (generic DCD) means the document 
containing the Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and generic technical 
specifications that is incorporated by reference into this appendix.
    B. Generic technical specifications means the information required 
by 10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a for the portion of the plant that is within 
the scope of this appendix.
    C. Plant-specific DCD means the document maintained by an applicant 
or licensee who references this appendix consisting of the information 
in the generic DCD as modified and supplemented by the plant-specific 
departures and exemptions made under Section VIII of this appendix.
    D. Tier 1 means the portion of the design-related information 
contained in the generic DCD that is approved and certified by this 
appendix (Tier 1 information). The design descriptions, interface 
requirements, and site parameters are derived from Tier 2 information. 
Tier 1 information includes:
    1. Definitions and general provisions;
    2. Design descriptions;
    3. Inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC);
    4. Significant site parameters; and
    5. Significant interface requirements.
    E. Tier 2 means the portion of the design-related information 
contained in the generic DCD that is approved but not certified by

[[Page 140]]

this appendix (Tier 2 information). Compliance with Tier 2 is required, 
but generic changes to and plant-specific departures from Tier 2 are 
governed by Section VIII of this appendix. Compliance with Tier 2 
provides a sufficient, but not the only acceptable, method for complying 
with Tier 1. Compliance methods differing from Tier 2 must satisfy the 
change process in Section VIII of this appendix. Regardless of these 
differences, an applicant or licensee must meet the requirement in 
Section III.B of this appendix to reference Tier 2 when referencing Tier 
1. Tier 2 information includes:
    1. Information required by Sec. Sec. 52.47(a) and 52.47(c), with 
the exception of generic technical specifications and conceptual design 
information;
    2. Supporting information on the inspections, tests, and analyses 
that will be performed to demonstrate that the acceptance criteria in 
the ITAAC have been met; and
    3. Combined license (COL) action items (COL license information), 
which identify certain matters that must be addressed in the site-
specific portion of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) by an 
applicant who references this appendix. These items constitute 
information requirements but are not the only acceptable set of 
information in the FSAR. An applicant may depart from or omit these 
items, provided that the departure or omission is identified and 
justified in the FSAR. After issuance of a construction permit or COL, 
these items are not requirements for the licensee unless such items are 
restated in the FSAR.
    4. The investment protection short-term availability controls in 
Section 16.3 of the DCD.
    F. Tier 2* means the portion of the Tier 2 information, designated 
as such in the generic DCD, which is subject to the change process in 
Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix. This designation expires for some 
Tier 2* information under paragraph VIII.B.6.
    G. Departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-
specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety 
analyses means:
    1. Changing any of the elements of the method described in the 
plant-specific DCD unless the results of the analysis are conservative 
or essentially the same; or
    2. Changing from a method described in the plant-specific DCD to 
another method unless that method has been approved by the NRC for the 
intended application.
    H. All other terms in this appendix have the meaning set out in 10 
CFR 50.2, or 52.1, or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, as applicable.

                         III. Scope and Contents

    A. Tier 1, Tier 2 (including the investment protection short-term 
availability controls in Section 16.3), and the generic TSs in the

    B. An applicant or licensee referencing this appendix, in accordance 
with Section IV of this appendix, shall incorporate by reference and 
comply with the requirements of this appendix, including Tier 1, Tier 2 
(including the investment protection short-term availability controls in 
Section 16.3 of the DCD), and the generic TS except as otherwise 
provided in this appendix. Conceptual design information in the generic 
DCD and the evaluation of severe accident mitigation design alternatives 
in appendix 1B of the generic DCD are not part of this appendix.
    C. If there is a conflict between Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the DCD, then 
Tier 1 controls.
    D.1. If there is a conflict between the generic DCD and either the 
application for the initial design certification of the AP1000 design or 
NUREG-1793, ``Final Safety Evaluation Report Related to Certification of 
the Westinghouse Standard Design,'' and Supplement No. 1, then the 
generic DCD controls.
    2. If there is a conflict between the generic DCD and either the 
application for Amendment 1 to the design certification of the AP1000 
design or NUREG-1793, ``Final Safety Evaluation Report Related to 
Certification of the Westinghouse Standard Design,'' Supplement No. 2, 
then the generic DCD controls.
    E. Design activities for structures, systems, and components that 
are wholly outside the scope of this appendix may be performed using 
site characteristics, provided the design activities do not affect the 
DCD or conflict with the interface requirements.

certification or references containing safeguards information or 
sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (including proprietary 
information, such as trade secrets or financial information obtained 
from a person that are privileged or confidential (10 CFR 2.390 and 10 
CFR part 9)), for the purpose of participating in the hearing required 
by 10 CFR 52.85, the hearing provided under 10 CFR 52.103, or in any 
other proceeding relating to this appendix in which interested persons 
have a right to request an adjudicatory hearing.

                     VII. Duration of This Appendix

    This appendix may be referenced for a period of 15 years from 
February 27, 2006, except as provided for in 10 CFR 52.55(b) and 
52.57(b). This appendix remains valid for an applicant or licensee who 
references this appendix until the application is withdrawn or the 
license expires, including any period of extended operation under a 
renewed license.

               VIII. Processes for Changes and Departures

    A. Tier 1 information.
    1. Generic changes to Tier 1 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(1).
    2. Generic changes to Tier 1 information are applicable to all 
applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for 
which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action 
taken under paragraphs A.3 or A.4 of this section.
    3. Departures from Tier 1 information that are required by the 
Commission through plant-specific orders are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(4).
    4. Exemptions from Tier 1 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(b)(1) and 52.98(f). The Commission will 
deny a request for an exemption from Tier 1, if it finds that the design 
change will result in a significant decrease in the level of safety 
otherwise provided by the design.
    B. Tier 2 information.
    1. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are governed by the 
requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(1).
    2. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are applicable to all 
applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for 
which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action 
taken under paragraphs B.3, B.4, B.5, or B.6 of this section.
    3. The Commission may not require new requirements on Tier 2 
information by plant-specific order while this appendix is in effect 
under 10 CFR 52.55 or 52.61, unless:
    a. A modification is necessary to secure compliance with the 
Commission's regulations applicable and in effect at the time this 
appendix was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix, or to 
ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety or the common 
defense and security; and
    b. Special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 50.12(a) are present.
    4. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may request 
an exemption from Tier 2 information. The Commission may grant such a 
request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the 
requirements of 10 CFR 50.12(a). The Commission will deny a request for 
an exemption from Tier 2, if it finds that the design change will result 
in a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by 
the design. The grant of an exemption to an applicant must be subject to 
litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license 
hearing. The grant of an exemption to a licensee must be subject to an 
opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as license amendments.
    5.a. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may 
depart from Tier 2 information, without prior NRC approval, unless the 
proposed departure involves a change to or departure from Tier 1 
information, Tier 2* information, or the TS, or requires a license 
amendment under paragraphs B.5.b or B.5.c of this section. When 
evaluating the proposed departure, an applicant or licensee shall 
consider all matters described in the plant-specific DCD.

[[Page 143]]

    b. A proposed departure from Tier 2, other than one affecting 
resolution of a severe accident issue identified in the plant-specific 
DCD or one affecting information required by 10 CFR52.47(a)(28) to 
address 10 CFR 50.150, requires a license amendment if it would:
    (1) Result in more than a minimal increase in the frequency of 
occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific 
DCD;
    (2) Result in more than a minimal increase in the likelihood of 
occurrence of a malfunction of a structure, system, or component (SSC) 
important to safety and previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;
    (3) Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;
    (4) Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of a 
malfunction of an SSC important to safety previously evaluated in the 
plant-specific DCD;
    (5) Create a possibility for an accident of a different type than 
any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;
    (6) Create a possibility for a malfunction of an SSC important to 
safety with a different result than any evaluated previously in the 
plant-specific DCD;
    (7) Result in a design basis limit for a fission product barrier as 
described in the plant-specific DCD being exceeded or altered; or
    (8) Result in a departure from a method of evaluation described in 
the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the 
safety analyses.
    c. A proposed departure from Tier 2 affecting resolution of an ex-
vessel severe accident design feature identified in the plant-specific 
DCD, requires a license amendment if:
    (1) There is a substantial increase in the probability of an ex-
vessel severe accident such that a particular ex-vessel severe accident 
previously reviewed and determined to be not credible could become 
credible; or
    (2) There is a substantial increase in the consequences to the 
public of a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed.
    d. If an applicant or licensee proposes to depart from the 
information required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(28) to be included in the FSAR 
for the standard design certification, then the applicant or licensee 
shall consider the effect of the changed feature or capability on the 
original assessment required by 10 CFR 50.150(a). The applicant or 
licensee must also document how the modified design features and 
functional capabilities continue to meet the assessment requirements in 
10 CFR 50.150(a)(1) in accordance with Section X of this appendix.
    e. If a departure requires a license amendment under paragraph B.5.b 
or B.5.c of this section, it is governed by 10 CFR 50.90.
    f. A departure from Tier 2 information that is made under paragraph 
B.5 of this section does not require an exemption from this appendix.
    g. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, 
amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10 CFR 
52.103(a), who believes that an applicant or licensee who references 
this appendix has not complied with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix 
when departing from Tier 2 information, may petition to admit into the 
proceeding such a contention. In addition to compliance with the general 
requirements of 10 CFR 2.309, the petition must demonstrate that the 
departure does not comply with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix. 
Further, the petition must demonstrate that the change bears on an 
asserted noncompliance with an ITAAC acceptance criterion in the case of 
a 10 CFR 52.103 preoperational hearing, or that the change bears 
directly on the amendment request in the case of a hearing on a license 
amendment. Any other party may file a response. If, on the basis of the 
petition and any response, the presiding officer determines that a 
sufficient showing has been made, the presiding officer shall certify 
the matter directly to the Commission for determination of the 
admissibility of the contention. The Commission may admit such a 
contention if it determines the petition raises a genuine issue of 
material fact regarding compliance with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this 
appendix.
    6.a. An applicant who references this appendix may not depart from 
Tier 2* information, which is designated with italicized text or 
brackets and an asterisk in the generic DCD, without NRC approval. The 
departure will not be considered a resolved issue, within the meaning of 
Section VI of this appendix and 10 CFR 52.63(a)(5).
    b. A licensee who references this appendix may not depart from the 
following Tier 2* matters without prior NRC approval. A request for a 
departure will be treated as a request for a license amendment under 10 
CFR 50.90.
    (1) Maximum fuel rod average burn-up.
    (2) Fuel principal design requirements.
    (3) Fuel criteria evaluation process.
    (4) Fire areas.
    (5) Reactor coolant pump type.
    (6) Small-break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) analysis 
methodology.
    (7) Screen design criteria.
    (8) Heat sink data for containment pressure analysis.
    c. A licensee who references this appendix may not, before the plant 
first achieves full power following the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), depart from the following Tier 2* matters except under 
paragraph B.6.b of this section. After the plant first achieves full 
power, the following Tier 2* matters revert to Tier 2 status and are 
subject to the departure provisions in paragraph B.5 of this section.

    d. Departures from Tier 2* information that are made under paragraph 
B.6 of this section do not require an exemption from this appendix.
    C. Operational requirements.
    1. Generic changes to generic TS and other operational requirements 
that were completely reviewed and approved in the design certification 
rulemaking and do not require a change to a design feature in the 
generic DCD are governed by the requirements in 10 CFR 50.109. Generic 
changes that require a change to a design feature in the generic DCD are 
governed by the requirements in paragraphs A or B of this section.
    2. Generic changes to generic TS and other operational requirements 
are applicable to all applicants who reference this appendix, except 
those for which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by 
action taken under paragraphs C.3 or C.4 of this section.
    3. The Commission may require plant-specific departures on generic 
TS and other operational requirements that were completely reviewed and 
approved, provided a change to a design feature in the generic DCD is 
not required and special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 2.335 are 
present. The Commission may modify or supplement generic TS and other 
operational requirements that were not completely reviewed and approved 
or require additional TS and other operational requirements on a plant-
specific basis, provided a change to a design feature in the generic DCD 
is not required.
    4. An applicant who references this appendix may request an 
exemption from the generic technical specifications or other operational 
requirements. The Commission may grant such a request only if it 
determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 
CFR 52.7. The grant of an exemption must be subject to litigation in the 
same manner as other issues material to the license hearing.
    5. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, 
amendment, or renewal of a license, or for operation under 10 CFR 
52.103(a), who believes that an operational requirement approved in the 
DCD or a TS derived from the generic TS must be changed may petition to 
admit such a contention into the proceeding. The petition must comply 
with the general requirements of 10 CFR 2.309 and must demonstrate why 
special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 2.335 are present, or 
demonstrate compliance with the Commission's regulations in effect at 
the time this appendix was approved, as set forth in Section V of this 
appendix. Any other party may file a response to the petition. If, on 
the basis of the petition and any response, the presiding officer 
determines that a sufficient showing has been made, the presiding 
officer shall certify the matter directly to the Commission for 
determination of the admissibility of the contention. All other issues 
with respect to the plant-specific TS or other operational requirements 
are subject to a hearing as part of the license proceeding.
    6. After issuance of a license, the generic TS have no further 
effect on the plant-specific TS. Changes to the plant-specific TS will 
be treated as license amendments under 10 CFR 50.90.

    IX. Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC)

    A.1. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall 
perform and demonstrate conformance with the ITAAC before fuel load. 
With respect to activities subject to an ITAAC, an applicant for a 
license may proceed at its own risk with design and procurement 
activities. A licensee may also proceed at its own risk with design, 
procurement, construction, and preoperational activities, even though 
the NRC may not have found that any particular ITAAC has been met.
    2. The licensee who references this appendix shall notify the NRC 
that the required inspections, tests, and analyses in the ITAAC have 
been successfully completed and

that the corresponding acceptance criteria have been met.
    3. If an activity is subject to an ITAAC and the applicant or 
licensee who references this appendix has not demonstrated that the 
ITAAC has been met, the applicant or licensee may either take corrective 
actions to successfully complete that ITAAC, request an exemption from 
the ITAAC under Section VIII of this appendix and 10 CFR 52.97(b), or 
petition for rulemaking to amend this appendix by changing the 
requirements of the ITAAC, under 10 CFR 2.802 and 52.97(b). Such 
rulemaking changes to the ITAAC must meet the requirements of paragraph 
VIII.A.1 of this appendix.
    B.1. The NRC shall ensure that the required inspections, tests, and 
analyses in the ITAAC are performed. The NRC shall verify that the 
inspections, tests, and analyses referenced by the licensee have been 
successfully completed and, based solely thereon, find that the 
prescribed acceptance criteria have been met. At appropriate intervals 
during construction, the NRC shall publish notices of the successful 
completion of ITAAC in the Federal Register.
    2. In accordance with 10 CFR 52.103(g), the Commission shall find 
that the acceptance criteria in the ITAAC for the license are met before 
fuel load.
    3. After the Commission has made the finding required by 10 CFR 
52.103(g), the ITAAC do not, by virtue of their inclusion within the 
DCD, constitute regulatory requirements either for licensees or for 
renewal of the license; except for specific ITAAC, which are the subject 
of a Sec. 52.103(a) hearing, their expiration will occur upon final 
Commission action in such a proceeding. However, subsequent 
modifications must comply with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 design descriptions 
in the plant-specific DCD unless the licensee has complied with the 
applicable requirements of 10 CFR 52.98 and Section VIII of this 
appendix.

                Sec. Appendixes E-M to Part 52 [Reserved]


<R05>
   Sec. Appendix N to Part 52--Standardization of Nuclear Power Plant 
   Designs: Combined Licenses To Construct and Operate Nuclear Power 
             Reactors of Identical Design at Multiple Sites

    The Commission's regulations in part 2 of this chapter specifically 
provide for the holding of hearings on particular issues separately from 
other issues involved in hearings in licensing proceedings, and for the 
consolidation of adjudicatory proceedings and of the presentations of 
parties in adjudicatory proceedings such as licensing proceedings 
(Sec. Sec. 2.316 and 2.317 of this chapter).
    This appendix sets out the particular requirements and provisions 
applicable to situations in which applications for combined licenses 
under subpart C of this part are filed by one or more applicants for 
licenses to construct and operate nuclear power reactors of identical 
design (``common design'') to be located at multiple sites. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ If the design for the power reactor(s) proposed in a particular 
application is not identical to the others, that application may not be 
processed under this appendix and subpart D of part 2 of this chapter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Except as otherwise specified in this appendix or as the context 
otherwise indicates, the provisions of subpart C of this part and 
subpart D of part 2 of this chapter apply to combined license 
applications subject to this appendix.
    2. Each combined license application submitted pursuant to this 
appendix must be submitted as specified in Sec. 52.75 and 10 CFR 2.101. 
Each application must state that the applicant wishes to have the 
application considered under 10 CFR part 52, appendix N, and must list 
each of the applications to be treated together under this appendix.
    3. Each application must include the information required by 
Sec. Sec. 52.77, 52.79, and 52.80(a), provided however, that the 
application must identify the common design, and, if applicable, 
reference a standard design certification under subpart B of this part, 
or the use of a reactor manufactured under subpart F of this part. The 
final safety analysis report for each application must either 
incorporate by reference or include the final safety analysis of the 
common design, including, if applicable, the final safety analysis 
report for the referenced design certification or the manufactured 
reactor. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ As used in this appendix, the design of a nuclear power reactor 
included in a single referenced safety analysis report means the design 
of those structures, systems, and components important to radiological 
health and safety and the common defense and security.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Each combined license application submitted pursuant to this 
appendix must contain an environmental report as required by Sec. 
52.80(b), and which complies with the applicable provisions of 10 CFR 
part 51, provided, however, that the application may incorporate by 
reference a single environmental report on the environmental impacts of 
the common design.
    5. Upon a determination that each application is acceptable for 
docketing under 10 CFR 2.101, each application will be docketed and a 
notice of docketing for each application will be published in the 
Federal Register, in accordance with 10 CFR 2.104, provided, however, 
that the notice must state that the application will be processed under 
the provisions of 10 CFR part 52, appendix N, and subpart D of part 2 of 
this chapter. As the discretion of the Commission, a single notice of 
docketing for multiple applications may be published in the Federal 
Register.
    6. The NRC staff shall prepare draft and final environmental impact 
statements for each of the applications under part 51 of this chapter. 
Scoping under 10 CFR 51.28 and 51.29 for each of the combined license 
applications may be conducted simultaneously and joint scoping may be 
conducted with respect to the environmental issues relevant to the 
common design.
    If the applications reference a standard design certification, then 
the environmental impact statement for each of the applications must 
incorporate by reference the design certification environmental 
assessment. If the applications do not reference a standard design 
certification, then the NRC staff shall prepare draft and final 
supplemental environmental impact statements which address severe 
accident mitigation design alternatives for the common design, which 
must be incorporated by reference into the environmental impact 
statement prepared for each application. Scoping under 10 CFR 51.28 and 
51.29 for the supplemental environmental impact statement may be 
conducted simultaneously, and may be part of the scoping for each of the 
combined license applications.
    7. The ACRS shall report on each of the applications as required by 
Sec. 52.87. Each report must be limited to those safety matters for 
each application which are not relevant to the common design. In 
addition, the ACRS shall separately report on the safety of the common 
design, provided, however, that the report need not address the safety 
of a referenced standard design certification or reactor manufactured 
under subpart F of this part.
    8. The Commission shall designate a presiding officer to conduct the 
proceeding with

[[Page 147]]

respect to the health and safety, common defense and security, and 
environmental matters relating to the common design. The hearing will be 
governed by the applicable provisions of subparts A, C, G, L, N, and O 
of part 2 of this chapter relating to applications for combined 
licenses. The presiding officer shall issue a partial initial decision 
on the common design.

    (a) As used in this part,
    Current licensing basis (CLB) is the set of NRC requirements 
applicable to a specific plant and a licensee's written commitments for 
ensuring compliance with and operation within applicable NRC 
requirements and the plant-specific design basis (including all 
modifications and additions to such commitments over the life of the 
license) that are docketed and in effect. The CLB includes the NRC 
regulations contained in 10 CFR parts 2, 19, 20, 21, 26, 30, 40, 50, 51, 
52, 54, 55, 70, 72, 73, 100 and appendices thereto; orders; license 
conditions; exemptions; and technical specifications. It also includes 
the plant-specific design-basis information defined in 10 CFR 50.2 as 
documented in the most recent final safety analysis report (FSAR) as 
required by 10 CFR 50.71 and the licensee's commitments remaining in 
effect that were made in docketed licensing correspondence such as 
licensee responses to NRC bulletins, generic letters, and enforcement 
actions, as well as licensee commitments documented in NRC safety 
evaluations or licensee event reports.
    Integrated plant assessment (IPA) is a licensee assessment that 
demonstrates that a nuclear power plant facility's structures and 
components requiring aging management review in accordance with Sec. 
54.21(a) for license renewal have been identified and that the effects 
of aging on the functionality of such structures and components will be 
managed to maintain the CLB such that there is an acceptable level of

[[Page 148]]

safety during the period of extended operation.
    Nuclear power plant means a nuclear power facility of a type 
described in 10 CFR 50.21(b) or 50.22.
    Renewed combined license means a combined license originally issued 
under part 52 of this chapter for which an application for renewal is 
filed in accordance with 10 CFR 52.107 and issued under this part.
    Time-limited aging analyses, for the purposes of this part, are 
those licensee calculations and analyses that:
    (1) Involve systems, structures, and components within the scope of 
license renewal, as delineated in Sec. 54.4(a);
    (2) Consider the effects of aging;
    (3) Involve time-limited assumptions defined by the current 
operating term, for example, 40 years;
    (4) Were determined to be relevant by the licensee in making a 
safety determination;
    (5) Involve conclusions or provide the basis for conclusions related 
to the capability of the system, structure, and component to perform its 
intended functions, as delineated in Sec. 54.4(b); and
    (6) Are contained or incorporated by reference in the CLB.
    (b) All other terms in this part have the same meanings as set out 
in 10 CFR 50.2 or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act, as applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 54.4  Scope.

    (a) Plant systems, structures, and components within the scope of 
this part are--
    (1) Safety-related systems, structures, and components which are 
those relied upon to remain functional during and following design-basis 
events (as defined in 10 CFR 50.49 (b)(1)) to ensure the following 
functions--
    (i) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary;
    (ii) The capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a 
safe shutdown condition; or
    (iii) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of 
accidents which could result in potential offsite exposures comparable 
to those referred to in Sec. 50.34(a)(1), Sec. 50.67(b)(2), or Sec. 
100.11 of this chapter, as applicable.
    (2) All nonsafety-related systems, structures, and components whose 
failure could prevent satisfactory accomplishment of any of the 
functions identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section.
    (3) All systems, structures, and components relied on in safety 
analyses or plant evaluations to perform a function that demonstrates 
compliance with the Commission's regulations for fire protection (10 CFR 
50.48), environmental qualification (10 CFR 50.49), pressurized thermal 
shock (10 CFR 50.61), anticipated transients without scram (10 CFR

<R05>
Sec. 54.29  Standards for issuance of a renewed license.

    A renewed license may be issued by the Commission up to the full 
term authorized by Sec. 54.31 if the Commission finds that:
    (a) Actions have been identified and have been or will be taken with 
respect to the matters identified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section, such that there is reasonable assurance that the 
activities authorized by the renewed license will continue to be 
conducted in accordance with the CLB, and that any changes made to the 
plant's CLB in order to comply with this paragraph are in accord with 
the Act and the Commission's regulations. These matters are:
    (1) managing the effects of aging during the period of extended 
operation on the functionality of structures and components that have 
been identified to require review under Sec. 54.21(a)(1); and
    (2) time-limited aging analyses that have been identified to require 
review under Sec. 54.21(c).
    (b) Any applicable requirements of subpart A of 10 CFR part 51 have 
been satisfied.
    (c) Any matters raised under Sec. 2.335 have been addressed.

[60 FR 22491, May 8, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 2279, Jan. 14, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 54.30  Matters not subject to a renewal review.

    (a) If the reviews required by Sec. 54.21 (a) or (c) show that 
there is not reasonable assurance during the current license term that 
licensed activities will be conducted in accordance with the CLB, then 
the licensee shall take measures under its current license, as 
appropriate, to ensure that the intended function of those systems, 
structures or components will be maintained in accordance with the CLB 
throughout the term of its current license.
    (b) The licensee's compliance with the obligation under Paragraph 
(a) of this section to take measures under its current license is not 
within the scope of the license renewal review.


<R05>
Sec. 54.31  Issuance of a renewed license.

    (a) A renewed license will be of the class for which the operating 
license or combined license currently in effect was issued.
    (b) A renewed license will be issued for a fixed period of time, 
which is the sum of the additional amount of time beyond the expiration 
of the operating license or combined license (not to exceed 20 years) 
that is requested in a renewal application plus the remaining number of 
years on the operating license or combined license currently in effect. 
The term of any renewed license may not exceed 40 years.
    (c) A renewed license will become effective immediately upon its 
issuance,

[[Page 152]]

thereby superseding the operating license or combined license previously 
in effect. If a renewed license is subsequently set aside upon further 
administrative or judicial appeal, the operating license or combined 
license previously in effect will be reinstated unless its term has 
expired and the renewal application was not filed in a timely manner.
    (d) A renewed license may be subsequently renewed in accordance with 
all applicable requirements.

[60 FR 22491, May 8, 1995, as amended at 72 FR 49560, Aug. 28, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 54.33  Continuation of CLB and conditions of renewed license.

    (a) Whether stated therein or not, each renewed license will contain 
and otherwise be subject to the conditions set forth in 10 CFR 50.54.
    (b) Each renewed license will be issued in such form and contain 
such conditions and limitations, including technical specifications, as 
the Commission deems appropriate and necessary to help ensure that 
systems, structures, and components subject to review in accordance with 
Sec. 54.21 will continue to perform their intended functions for the 
period of extended operation. In addition, the renewed license will be 
issued in such form and contain such conditions and limitations as the 
Commission deems appropriate and necessary to help ensure that systems, 
structures, and components associated with any time-limited aging 
analyses will continue to perform their intended functions for the 
period of extended operation.
    (c) Each renewed license will include those conditions to protect 
the environment that were imposed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36b and that are 
part of the CLB for the facility at the time of issuance of the renewed 
license. These conditions may be supplemented or amended as necessary to 
protect the environment during the term of the renewed license and will 
be derived from information contained in the supplement to the 
environmental report submitted pursuant to 10 CFR part 51, as analyzed 
and evaluated in the NRC record of decision. The conditions will 
identify the obligations of the licensee in the environmental area, 
including, as appropriate, requirements for reporting and recordkeeping 
of environmental data and any conditions and monitoring requirements for 
the protection of the nonaquatic environment.
    (d) The licensing basis for the renewed license includes the CLB, as 
defined in Sec. 54.3(a); the inclusion in the licensing basis of 
matters such as licensee commitments does not change the legal status of 
those matters unless specifically so ordered pursuant to paragraphs (b) 
or (c) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 54.35  Requirements during term of renewed license.

    During the term of a renewed license, licensees shall be subject to 
and shall continue to comply with all Commission regulations contained 
in 10 CFR parts 2, 19, 20, 21, 26, 30, 40, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 70, 72, 
73, and 100, and the appendices to these parts that are applicable to 
holders of operating licenses or combined licenses, respectively.

[72 FR 49560, Aug. 28, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 54.37  Additional records and recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) The licensee shall retain in an auditable and retrievable form 
for the term of the renewed operating license or renewed combined 
license all information and documentation required by, or otherwise 
necessary to document compliance with, the provisions of this part.
    (b) After the renewed license is issued, the FSAR update required by 
10 CFR 50.71(e) must include any systems, structures, and components 
newly identified that would have been subject to an aging management 
review or evaluation of time-limited aging analyses in accordance with 
Sec. 54.21. This FSAR update must describe how the effects of aging 
will be managed such that the intended function(s) in Sec. 54.4(b) will 
be effectively maintained during the period of extended operation.

on-the-job training so that--
    (i) Each licensed operator of a utilization facility manipulates the 
plant controls and each licensed senior operator either manipulates the 
controls or directs the activities of individuals during plant control 
manipulations during the term of the licensed operator's or senior 
operator's license. For reactor operators and senior operators, these 
manipulations must consist of the following control manipulations and 
plant evolutions if they are applicable to the plant design. Items 
described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) (A) through (L) of this section must 
be performed annually; all other items must be performed on a two-year 
cycle. However, the requalification programs must contain a commitment 
that each individual shall perform or participate in a combination of 
reactivity control manipulations based on the availability of plant 
equipment and systems. Those control manipulations which are not 
performed at the plant may be performed on a simulator. The use of the 
Technical Specifications should be maximized during the simulator 
control manipulations. Senior operator licensees are credited with these 
activities if they direct control manipulations as they are performed.
    (A) Plant or reactor startups to include a range that reactivity 
feedback from nuclear heat addition is noticeable and heatup rate is 
established.
    (B) Plant shutdown.

area for which the operator or senior operator is licensed.
    (iii) Each licensed operator and senior operator is cognizant of 
facility design changes, procedure changes, and facility license 
changes.
    (iv) Each licensed operator and senior operator reviews the contents 
of all abnormal and emergency procedures on a regularly scheduled basis.
    (v) A simulator may be used in meeting the requirements of 
paragraphs (c) (3)(i) and (3)(ii) of this section, if it reproduces the 
general operating characteristics of the facility involved and the 
arrangement of the instrumentation and controls of the simulator is 
similar to that of the facility involved. If the simulator or simulation 
device is used to administer operating tests for a facility, as provided 
in Sec. 55.45(b)(1), the device approved to meet the requirements of 
Sec. 55.45(b)(1) must be used for credit to be given for meeting the 
requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(i) (G through AA) of this section.
    (4) Evaluation. The requalification program must include--
    (i) Comprehensive requalification written examinations and annual 
operating tests which determine areas in which retraining is needed to 
upgrade licensed operator and senior operator knowledge.
    (ii) Written examinations which determine licensed operators' and 
senior operators' knowledge of subjects covered in the requalification 
program and provide a basis for evaluating their knowledge of abnormal 
and emergency procedures.
    (iii) Systematic observation and evaluation of the performance and 
competency of licensed operators and senior operators by supervisors 
and/or training staff members, including evaluation of actions taken or 
to be taken during actual or simulated abnormal and emergency 
procedures.
    (iv) Simulation of emergency or abnormal conditions that may be 
accomplished by using the control panel of the facility involved or by 
using a simulator. When the control panel of the facility is used for 
simulation, the actions taken or to be taken for the emergency or 
abnormal condition shall be discussed; actual manipulation of the plant 
controls is not required. If a simulator is used in meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, it must 
accurately reproduce the operating characteristics of the facility 
involved and the arrangement of the instrumentation and controls of the 
simulator must closely parallel that of the facility involved. After the 
provisions of Sec. 55.46 have been implemented at a facility, the 
Commission approved or plant-referenced simulator must be used to comply 
with this paragraph.
    (v) Provisions for each licensed operator and senior operator to 
participate in an accelerated requalification program where performance 
evaluations conducted pursuant to paragraphs (c)(4) (i) through (iv) of 
this section clearly indicated the need.

[[Page 168]]

    (5) Records. The requalification program documentation must include 
the following:
    (i) The facility licensee shall maintain records documenting the 
participation of each licensed operator and senior operator in the 
requalification program. The records must contain copies of written 
examinations administered, the answers given by the licensee, and the 
results of evaluations and documentation of operating tests and of any 
additional training administered in areas in which an operator or senior 
operator has exhibited deficiencies. The facility licensee shall retain 
these records until the operator's or senior operator's license is 
renewed.
    (ii) Each record required by this part must be legible throughout 
the retention period specified by each Commission regulation. The record 
may be the original or a reproduced copy or a microform provided that 
the copy or microform is authenticated by authorized personnel and that 
the microform is capable of producing a clear copy throughout the 
required retention period.
    (iii) If there is a conflict between the Commission's regulations in 
this part, and any license condition, or other written Commission 
approval or authorization pertaining to the retention period for the 
same type of record, the retention period specified for these records by 
the regulations in this part apply unless the Commission, pursuant to 
Sec. 55.11, grants a specific exemption from this record retention 
requirement.
    (6) Alternative training programs. The requirements of this section 
may be met by requalification programs conducted by persons other than 
the facility licensee if the requalification programs are similar to the 
program described in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this section and 
the alternative program has been approved by the Commission.
    (7) Applicability to research and test reactor facilities. To 
accommodate specialized modes of operation and differences in control, 
equipment, and operator skills and knowledge, the requalification 
program for each licensed operator and senior operator of a research 
reactor or test reactor facility must conform generally but need not be 
identical to the requalification program outlined in paragraphs (c) (1) 
through (6) of this section. Significant deviations from the 
requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) through (6) of this section will be 
permitted only if supported by written justification and approved by the 
Commission.

Sec. 60.9  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a 
Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission 
licensee or applicant against an employee for engaging in certain 
protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes discharge 
and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or

[[Page 176]]

privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 
section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in 
general are related to the administration or enforcement of a 
requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy 
Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph 
(a) introductory text of this section or possible violations of 
requirements imposed under either of those statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text or under these 
requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory 
text.
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraph (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant may be 
grounds for--
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license.
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee, applicant, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of the licensee or applicant.
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect 
an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.
    (e)(1) Each licensee and each applicant for a license shall 
prominently post the revision of NRC Form 3, ``Notice to Employees,'' 
referenced in 10 CFR 19.11(c). This form must be posted at locations 
sufficient to permit employees protected by this section to observe a 
copy on the way to or from their place of work. Premises must be posted 
not later than 30 days after an application is docketed and remain 
posted while the application is pending before the Commission, during 
the term of the license, and for 30 days following license termination.
    (2) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in appendix D to part 20 of this chapter, by 
calling (301) 415-7232, via e-mail to FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov, or by 
visiting the NRC's Web site at

[[Page 177]]

http://www.nrc.gov and selecting forms from the index found on the home 
page.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain 
any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an 
employee from participating in protected activity as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section including, but not limited to, 
providing information to the NRC or to his or her employer on potential 
violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

Sec. 60.18  Review of site characterization activities. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ In addition to the review of site characterization activities 
specified in this section, the Commission contemplates an ongoing review 
of other information on site investigation and site characterization, in 
order to allow early identification of potential licensing issues for 
timely resolution. This activity will include, for example, a review of 
the environmental assessments prepared by DOE at the time of site 
nomination, and review of issues related to long lead time exploratory 
shaft planning and procurement actions by DOE prior to issuance of site 
characterization plans.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) The Director shall cause to be published in the Federal Register 
a notice that a site characterization plan has been received from DOE 
and that a staff review of such plan has begun. The notice shall 
identify the area to be characterized and the NRC staff members to be 
consulted for further information.
    (b) The Director shall make a copy of the site characterization plan 
available at the Public Document Room. The Director shall also transmit 
copies of the published notice of receipt to the Governor and 
legislature of the State in which the area to be characterized is 
located and to the governing body of any affected Indian Tribe. The 
Director shall provide an opportunity, with respect to any area to be 
characterized, for the State in which such area is located and for 
affected Indian Tribes to present their views on the site 
characterization plan and their suggestions with respect to comments 
thereon which may be made by NRC. In addition, the Director shall make 
NRC staff available to consult with States and affected Indian Tribes as 
provided in Subpart C of this part.
    (c) The Director shall review the site characterization plan and 
prepare a site characterization analysis with respect to such plan. In 
the preparation of such site characterization analysis, the Director may 
invite and consider the views of interested persons on DOE's site 
characterization plan and may review and consider comments made in 
connection with public hearings held by DOE.
    (d) The Director shall provide to DOE the site characterization 
analysis together with such additional comments as may be warranted. 
These comments shall include either a statement that the Director has no 
objection to the DOE's site characterization program, if such a 
statement is appropriate, or specific objections with respect to DOE's 
program for characterization of the area concerned. In addition, the 
Director may make specific recommendations pertinent to DOE's site 
characterization program.
    (e) If DOE's planned site characterization activities include onsite 
testing with radioactive material, including radioactive tracers, the 
Director's comments shall include a determination regarding whether or 
not the Commission concurs that the proposed use of such radioactive 
material is necessary to provide data for the preparation of the 
environmental reports required by law and for an application to be 
submitted under Sec. 60.22 of this part.
    (f) The Director shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of 
availability of the site characterization analysis and a request for 
public comment within a reasonable period, as specified (not less than 
90 days). The notice along with copies of the site characterization 
analysis shall be available at the NRC Web site, http://www.nrc.gov, and 
copies of any comments received will also be made available there.
    (g) During the conduct of site characterization activities, DOE 
shall report not less than once every six months to the Commission on 
the nature and extent of such activities and the information that has 
been developed, and on the progress of waste form and waste package 
research and development. The semiannual reports shall include the 
results of site characterization studies, the identification of new 
issues, plans for additional studies to resolve new issues, elimination 
of planned studies no longer necessary,

[[Page 180]]

identification of decision points reached and modifications to schedules 
where appropriate. DOE shall also report its progress in developing the 
design of a geologic repository operations area appropriate for the area 
being characterized, noting when key design parameters or features which 
depend upon the results of site characterization will be established. 
Other topics related to site characterization shall also be covered if 
requested by the Director.
    (h) During the conduct of site characterization activities, NRC 
staff shall be permitted to visit and inspect the locations at which 
such activities are carried out and to observe excavations, borings, and 
in situ tests as they are done.
    (i) The Director may comment at any time in writing to DOE, 
expressing current views on any aspect of site characterization. In 
particular, such comments shall be made whenever the Director, upon 
review of comments invited on the site characterization analysis or upon 
review of DOE's semiannual reports, determines that there are 
substantial new grounds for making recommendations or stating objections 
to DOE's site characterization program. The Director shall invite public 
comment on any comments which the Director makes to DOE upon review of 
the DOE semiannual reports or on any other comments which the Director 
makes to DOE on site characterization.
    (j) The Director shall transmit copies of the site characterization 
analysis and all comments to DOE made by the Director under this section 
to the Governor and legislature of the State in which the area to be 
characterized is located and to the governing body of any affected 
Indian Tribe. When transmitting the site characterization analysis under 
this paragraph, the Director shall invite the addressees to review and 
comment thereon.
    (k) All correspondence between DOE and the NRC under this section, 
including the reports described in paragraph (g), shall be placed in the 
Public Document Room.
    (l) The activities described in paragraphs (a) through (k) of this 
section constitute informal conference between a prospective applicant 
and the staff, as described in Sec. 2.101(a)(1) of this chapter, and 
are not part of a proceeding under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended. Accordingly, neither the issuance of a site characterization 
analysis nor any other comments of the Director made under this section 
constitutes a commitment to issue any authorization or license or in any 
way affect the authority of the Commission, the Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Appeal Board, Atomic Safety and Licensing Boards, other 
presiding officers, or the Director, in any such proceeding.

including:
    (1) A description of the program for post-permanent closure 
monitoring of the geologic repository.
    (2) A detailed description of the measures to be employed--such as 
land use controls, construction of monuments, and preservation of 
records--to regulate or prevent activities that could impair the long-
term isolation of emplaced waste within the geologic repository and to 
assure that relevant information will be preserved for the use of future 
generations. As a minimum, such measures shall include:
    (i) Identification of the postclosure controlled area and geologic 
repository operations area by monuments that have been designed, 
fabricated, and emplaced to be as permanent as is practicable; and
    (ii) Placement of records in the archives and land record systems of 
local State, and Federal government agencies, and archives elsewhere in 
the world, that would be likely to be consulted by potential human 
intruders--such records to identify the location of the geologic 
repository operations area, including the underground facility, 
boreholes and shafts, and the boundaries of the postclosure controlled 
area, and the nature and hazard of the waste.
    (3) Geologic, geophysical, geochemical, hydrologic, and other site 
data that are obtained during the operational period pertinent to the 
long-term isolation of emplaced radioactive wastes.
    (4) The results of tests, experiments, and any other analyses 
relating to backfill of excavated areas, shaft sealing, waste 
interaction with the host rock, and any other tests, experiments, or 
analyses pertinent to the long-term isolation of emplaced wastes within 
the geologic repository.
    (5) Any substantial revision of plans for permanent closure.
    (6) Other information bearing upon permanent closure that was not 
available at the time a license was issued.
    (b) If necessary, so as to take into account the environmental 
impact of any substantial changes in the permanent closure activities 
proposed to be carried out or any significant new information regarding 
the environmental impacts of such closure, DOE shall also supplement its 
environmental impact statement and submit such statement,

[[Page 189]]

as supplemented, with the application for license amendment.

accordance with the provisions of Sec. 60.45 and this section.
    (c) A license shall be terminated only when the Commission finds 
with respect to the geologic repository:
    (1) That the final disposition of radioactive wastes has been made 
in conformance with the DOE's plan, as amended and approved as part of 
the license.
    (2) That the final state of the geologic repository operations area 
conforms to DOE's plans for permanent closure and DOE's plans for the 
decontamination or dismantlement of surface facilities, as amended and

<R05>
Sec. 60.101  Purpose and nature of findings.

    (a)(1) Subpart B of this part prescribes the standards for issuance 
of a license to receive and possess source, special nuclear, or 
byproduct material at a geologic repository operations area. In 
particular, Sec. 60.41(c) requires a finding that the issuance of a 
license will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the health and 
safety of the public. The purpose of this subpart is to set out 
performance objectives and site and design criteria which, if satisfied, 
will support such a finding of no unreasonable risk.
    (2) While these performance objectives and criteria are generally 
stated in unqualified terms, it is not expected that complete assurance 
that they will be met can be presented. A reasonable assurance, on the 
basis of the record before the Commission, that the objectives and 
criteria will be met is the general standard that is required. For Sec. 
60.112, and other portions of this subpart that impose objectives and 
criteria for repository performance over long times into the future, 
there will inevitably be greater uncertainties. Proof of the future 
performance of engineered barrier systems and the geologic setting over 
time periods of many hundreds or many thousands of years is not to be 
had in the ordinary sense of the word. For such long-term objectives and 
criteria, what is required is reasonable assurance, making allowance for 
the time period, hazards, and uncertainties involved, that the outcome 
will be in conformance with those objectives and criteria. Demonstration 
of compliance with such objectives and criteria will involve the use of 
data from accelerated tests and predictive models that are supported by 
such measures as field and laboratory tests, monitoring data and natural 
analog studies.
    (b) Subpart B of this part also lists findings that must be made in 
support of an authorization to construct a geologic repository 
operations area. In particular, Sec. 60.31(a) requires a finding that 
there is reasonable assurance that the types and amounts of radioactive 
materials described in the application can be received, possessed, and 
disposed of in a geologic repository operations area of the design 
proposed without unreasonable risk to the health and safety of the 
public. As stated in that paragraph, in arriving at this determination, 
the Commission will consider whether the site and design comply with the 
criteria contained in this subpart. Once again, while the criteria may 
be written in unqualified terms, the demonstration of compliance may 
take uncertainties and gaps in knowledge into account, provided that the 
Commission can make the specified finding of reasonable assurance as 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 60.102  Concepts.

    This section provides a functional overview of subpart E. In the 
event of any inconsistency with definitions

[[Page 193]]

found in Sec. 60.2, those definitions shall prevail.
    (a) The HLW facility. NRC exercises licensing and related regulatory 
authority over those facilities described in section 202 (3) and (4) of 
the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. Any of these facilities is 
designated a HLW facility.
    (b) The geologic repository operations area. (1) This part deals 
with the exercise of authority with respect to a particular class of HLW 
facility--namely a geologic repository operations area.
    (2) A geologic repository operations area consists of those surface 
and subsurface areas that are part of a geologic repository where 
radioactive waste handling activities are conducted. The underground 
structure, including openings and backfill materials, but excluding 
shafts, boreholes, and their seals, is designated the underground 
facility.
    (3) The exercise of Commission authority requires that the geologic 
repository operations area be used for storage (which includes disposal) 
of high-level radioactive wastes (HLW).
    (4) HLW includes irradiated reactor fuel as well as reprocessing 
wastes. However, if DOE proposes to use the geologic repository 
operations area for storage of radioactive waste other than HLW, the 
storage of this radioactive waste is subject to the requirements of this 
part.
    (c) Areas related to isolation. Although the activities subject to 
regulation under this part are those to be carried out at the geologic 
repository operations area, the licensing process also considers 
characteristics of adjacent areas that are defined in other ways. There 
is to be an area surrounding the underground facility referred to above, 
which is designated the postclosure controlled area, within which DOE is 
to exercise specified controls to prevent adverse human actions 
following permanent closure. The location of the controlled area is the 
site. The accessible environment is the atmosphere, land surface, 
surface water, oceans, and the portion of the lithosphere that is 
outside the controlled area. There is an area, designated the geologic 
setting, which includes the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical 
systems of the region in which a geologic repository operations area is 
or may be located. The geologic repository operations area plus the 
portion of the geologic setting that provides isolation of the 
radioactive waste make up the geologic repository.
    (d) Stages in the licensing process. There are several stages in the 
licensing process. The site characterization stage, though begun before 
submission of a license application, may result in consequences 
requiring evaluation in the license review. The construction stage would 
follow, after issuance of a construction authorization. A period of 
operations follows the issuance of a license by the Commission. The 
period of operations includes the time during which emplacement of 
wastes occurs; any subsequent period before permanent closure during 
which the emplaced wastes are retrievable; and permanent closure, which 
includes sealing of shafts. Permanent closure represents the end of 
active human intervention with respect to the engineered barrier system.
    (e) Isolation of waste. (1) During the first several hundred years 
following permanent closure of a geologic repository, when radiation and 
thermal levels are high and the uncertainties in assessing repository 
performance are large, special emphasis is placed upon the ability to 
contain the wastes by waste packages within an engineered barrier 
system. This is known as the containment period. The engineered barrier 
system includes the waste packages and the underground facility. A waste 
package is composed of the waste form and any containers, shielding, 
packing, and absorbent materials immediately surrounding an individual 
waste container. The underground facility means the underground 
structure, including openings and backfill materials, but excluding, 
shafts, boreholes, and their seals.
    (2) Following the containment period special emphasis is placed upon 
the ability to achieve isolation of the wastes by virtue of the 
characteristics of the geologic repository. The engineered barrier 
system works to control the release of radioactive material to the 
geologic setting and the geologic setting works to control the release 
of

[[Page 194]]

radioactive material to the accessible environment. Isolation means 
inhibiting the transport of radioactive material so that amounts and 
concentrations of the materials entering the accessible environment will 
be kept within prescribed limits.

                         Performance Objectives


<R05>
Sec. 60.111  Performance of the geologic repository operations area
through permanent closure.

    (a) Protection against radiation exposures and releases of 
radioactive material. The geologic repository operations area shall be 
designed so that until permanent closure has been completed, radiation 
exposures and radiation levels, and releases of radioactive materials to 
unrestricted areas, will be maintained within the limits specified in 
part 20 of this chapter and such generally applicable environmental 
standards for radioactivity as may have been established by the 
Environmental Protection Agency.
    (b) Retrievability of waste. (1) The geologic repository operations 
area shall be designed to preserve the option of waste retrieval 
throughout the period during which wastes are being emplaced and, 
thereafter, until the completion of a preformance confirmation program 
and Commission review of the information obtained from such a program. 
To satisfy this objective, the geologic repository operations area shall 
be designed so that any or all of the emplaced waste could be retrieved 
on a reasonable schedule starting at any time up to 50 years after waste 
emplacement operations are initiated, unless a different time period is 
approved or specified by the Commission. This different time period may 
be established on a case-by-case basis consistent with the emplacement 
schedule and the planned performance confirmation program.
    (2) This requirement shall not preclude decisions by the Commission 
to allow backfilling part or all of, or permanent closure of, the 
geologic repository operations area prior to the end of the period of 
design for retrievability.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph, a reasonable schedule for 
retrieval is one that would permit retrieval in about the same time as 
that devoted to construction of the geologic repository operations area 
and the emplacement of wastes.

FR 59276, Nov. 3, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 60.112  Overall system performance objective for the geologic 
repository after permanent closure.

    The geologic setting shall be selected and the engineered barrier 
system and the shafts, boreholes and their seals shall be designed to 
assure that releases of radioactive materials to the accessible 
environment following permanent closure conform to such generally 
applicable environmental standards for radioactivity as may have been 
established by the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to both 
anticipated processes and events and unanticipated processes and events.


<R05>
Sec. 60.113  Performance of particular barriers after permanent closure.

    (a) General provisions--(1) Engineered barrier system. (i) The 
engineered barrier system shall be designed so that assuming anticipated 
processes and events: (A) Containment of HLW will be substantially 
complete during the period when radiation and thermal conditions in the 
engineered barrier system are dominated by fission product decay; and 
(B) any release of radionuclides from the engineered barrier system 
shall be a gradual process which results in small fractional releases to 
the geologic setting over long times. For disposal in the saturated 
zone, both the partial and complete filling with groundwater of 
available void spaces in the underground facility shall be appropriately 
considered and analysed among the anticipated processes and events in 
designing the engineered barrier system.
    (ii) In satisfying the preceding requirement, the engineered barrier 
system shall be designed, assuming anticipated processes and events, so 
that:
    (A) Containment of HLW within the waste packages will be 
substantially complete for a period to be determined

[[Page 195]]

by the Commission taking into account the factors specified in Sec. 
60.113(b) provided, that such period shall be not less than 300 years 
nor more than 1,000 years after permanent closure of the geologic 
repository; and
    (B) The release rate of any radionuclide from the engineered barrier 
system following the containment period shall not exceed one part in 
100,000 per year of the inventory of that radionuclide calculated to be 
present at 1,000 years following permanent closure, or such other 
fraction of the inventory as may be approved or specified by the 
Commission; provided, that this requirement does not apply to any 
radionuclide which is released at a rate less than 0.1% of the 
calculated total release rate limit. The calculated total release rate 
limit shall be taken to be one part in 100,000 per year of the inventory 
of radioactive waste, originally emplaced in the underground facility, 
that remains after 1,000 years of radioactive decay.
    (2) Geologic setting. The geologic repository shall be located so 
that pre-waste-emplacement groundwater travel time along the fastest 
path of likely radionuclide travel from the disturbed zone to the 
accessible environment shall be at least 1,000 years or such other 
travel time as may be approved or specified by the Commission.
    (b) On a case-by-case basis, the Commission may approve or specify 
some other radionuclide release rate, designed containment period or 
pre-waste-emplacement groundwater travel time, provided that the overall 
system performance objective, as it relates to anticipated processes and 
events, is satisfied. Among the factors that the Commission may take 
into account are:
    (1) Any generally applicable environmental standard for 
radioactivity established by the Environmental Protection Agency;
    (2) The age and nature of the waste, and the design of the 
underground facility, particularly as these factors bear upon the time 
during which the thermal pulse is dominated by the decay heat from the 
fission products;
    (3) The geochemical characteristics of the host rock, surrounding 
strata and groundwater; and
    (4) Particular sources of uncertainty in predicting the performance 
of the geologic repository.
    (c) Additional requirements may be found to be necessary to satisfy 
the overall system performance objective as it relates to unanticipated 
processes and events.

                       Land Ownership and Control


<R05>
Sec. 60.121  Requirements for ownership and control of interests in land.

    (a) Ownership of land. (1) Both the geologic repository operations 
area and the postclosure controlled area shall be located in and on 
lands that are either acquired lands under the jurisdiction and control 
of DOE, or lands permanently withdrawn and reserved for its use.
    (2) These lands shall be held free and clear of all encumbrances, if 
significant, such as: (i) Rights arising under the general mining laws; 
(ii) easements for right-of-way; and (iii) all other rights arising 
under lease, rights of entry, deed, patent, mortgage, appropriation, 
prescription, or otherwise.
    (b) Additional controls. Appropriate controls shall be established 
outside of the postclosure controlled area. DOE shall exercise any 
jurisdiction and control over surface and subsurface estates necessary 
to prevent adverse human actions that could significantly reduce the 
geologic repository's ability to achieve isolation. The rights of DOE 
may take the form of appropriate possessory interests, servitudes, or 
withdrawals from location or patent under the general mining laws.
    (c) Water rights. (1) DOE shall also have obtained such water rights 
as may be needed to accomplish the purpose of the geologic repository 
operations area.
    (2) Water rights are included in the additional controls to be 
established under paragraph (b) of this section.

                             Siting Criteria


<R05>
Sec. 60.122  Siting criteria.

    (a)(1) A geologic setting shall exhibit an appropriate combination 
of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of

[[Page 196]]

this section so that, together with the engineered barriers system, the 
favorable conditions present are sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurance that the performance objectives relating to isolation of the 
waste will be met.
    (2) If any of the potentially adverse conditions specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section is present, it may compromise the ability 
of the geologic repository to meet the performance objectives relating 
to isolation of the waste. In order to show that a potentially adverse 
condition does not so compromise the performance of the geologic 
repository the following must be demonstrated:
    (i) The potentially adverse human activity or natural condition has 
been adequately investigated, including the extent to which the 
condition may be present and still be undetected taking into account the 
degree of resolution achieved by the investigations; and
    (ii) The effect of the potentially adverse human activity or natural 
condition on the site has been adequately evaluated using analyses which 
are sensitive to the potentially adverse human activity or natural 
condition and assumptions which are not likely to underestimate its 
effect; and
    (iii)(A) The potentially adverse human activity or natural condition 
is shown by analysis pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section 
not to affect significantly the ability of the geologic repository to 
meet the performance objectives relating to isolation of the waste, or
    (B) The effect of the potentially adverse human activity or natural 
condition is compensated by the presence of a combination of the 
favorable characteristics so that the performance objectives relating to 
isolation of the waste are met, or
    (C) The potentially adverse human activity or natural condition can 
be remedied.
    (b) Favorable conditions. (1) The nature and rates of tectonic, 
hydrogeologic, geochemical, and geomorphic processes (or any of such 
processes) operating within the geologic setting during the Quaternary 
Period, when projected, would not affect or would favorably affect the 
ability of the geologic repository to isolate the waste.
    (2) For disposal in the saturated zone, hydrogeologic conditions 
that provide:
    (i) A host rock with low horizontal and vertical permeability;
    (ii) Downward or dominantly horizontal hydraulic gradient in the 
host rock and immediately surrounding hydrogeologic units; and
    (iii) Low vertical permeability and low hydraulic gradient between 
the host rock and the surrounding hydrogeologic units.
    (3) Geochemical conditions that:
    (i) Promote precipitation or sorption of radionuclides;
    (ii) Inhibit the formation of particulates, colloids, and inorganic 
and organic complexes that increase the mobility of radionuclides; or
    (iii) Inhibit the transport of radionuclides by particulates, 
colloids, and complexes.
    (4) Mineral assemblages that, when subjected to anticipated thermal 
loading, will remain unaltered or alter to mineral assemblages having 
equal or increased capacity to inhibit radionuclide migration.
    (5) Conditions that permit the emplacement of waste at a minimum 
depth of 300 meters from the ground surface. (The ground surface shall 
be deemed to be the elevation of the lowest point on the surface above 
the disturbed zone.)
    (6) A low population density within the geologic setting and a 
postclosure controlled area that is remote from population centers.
    (7) Pre-waste-emplacement groundwater travel time along the fastest 
path of likely radionuclide travel from the disturbed zone to the 
accessible environment that substantially exceeds 1,000 years.
    (8) For disposal in the unsaturated zone, hydrogeologic conditions 
that provide--
    (i) Low moisture flux in the host rock and in the overlying and 
underlying hydrogeologic units;
    (ii) A water table sufficiently below the underground facility such 
that fully saturated voids contiguous with the water table do not 
encounter the underground facility;

[[Page 197]]

    (iii) A laterally extensive low-permeability hydrogeologic unit 
above the host rock that would inhibit the downward movement of water or 
divert downward moving water to a location beyond the limits of the 
underground facility;
    (iv) A host rock that provides for free drainage; or
    (v) A climatic regime in which the average annual historic 
precipitation is a small percentage of the average annual potential 
evapotranspiration.
    (c) Potentially adverse conditions. The following conditions are 
potentially adverse conditions if they are characteristic of the 
postclosure controlled area or may affect isolation within the 
controlled area.
    (1) Potential for flooding of the underground facility, whether 
resulting from the occupancy and modification of floodplains or from the 
failure of existing or planned man-made surface water impoundments.
    (2) Potential for foreseeable human activity to adversely affect the 
groundwater flow system, such as groundwater withdrawal, extensive 
irrigation, subsurface injection of fluids, underground pumped storage, 
military activity or construction of large scale surface water 
impoundments.
    (3) Potential for natural phenomena such as landslides, subsidence, 
or volcanic activity of such a magnitude that large-scale surface water 
impoundments could be created that could change the regional groundwater 
flow system and thereby adversely affect the performance of the geologic 
repository.
    (4) Structural deformation, such as uplift, subsidence, folding, or 
faulting that may adversely affect the regional groundwater flow system.
    (5) Potential for changes in hydrologic conditions that would affect 
the migration of radionuclides to the accessible environment, such as 
changes in hydraulic gradient, average interstitial velocity, storage 
coefficient, hydraulic conductivity, natural recharge, potentiometric 
levels, and discharge points.
    (6) Potential for changes in hydrologic conditions resulting from 
reasonably foreseeable climatic changes.
    (7) Groundwater conditions in the host rock, including chemical 
composition, high ionic strength or ranges of Eh-pH, that could increase 
the solubility or chemical reactivity of the engineered barrier system.
    (8) Geochemical processes that would reduce sorption of 
radionuclides, result in degradation of the rock strength, or adversely 
affect the performance of the engineered barrier system.
    (9) Groundwater conditions in the host rock that are not reducing.
    (10) Evidence of dissolutioning such as breccia pipes, dissolution 
cavities, or brine pockets.
    (11) Structural deformation such as uplift, subsidence, folding, and 
faulting during the Quaternary Period.
    (12) Earthquakes which have occurred historically that if they were 
to be repeated could affect the site significantly.
    (13) Indications, based on correlations of earthquakes with tectonic 
processes and features, that either the frequency of occurrence or 
magnitude of earthquakes may increase.
    (14) More frequent occurrence of earthquakes or earthquakes of 
higher magnitude than is typical of the area in which the geologic 
setting is located.
    (15) Evidence of igneous activity since the start of the Quaternary 
Period.
    (16) Evidence of extreme erosion during the Quaternary Period.
    (17) The presence of naturally occurring materials, whether 
identified or undiscovered, within the site, in such form that:
    (i) Economic extraction is currently feasible or potentially 
feasible during the foreseeable future; or
    (ii) Such materials have greater gross value or net value than the 
average for other areas of similar size that are representative of and 
located within the geologic setting.
    (18) Evidence of subsurface mining for resources within the site.
    (19) Evidence of drilling for any purpose within the site.
    (20) Rock or groundwater conditions that would require complex 
engineering measures in the design and construction of the underground 
facility

[[Page 198]]

or in the sealing of boreholes and shafts.
    (21) Geomechanical properties that do not permit design of 
underground opening that will remain stable through permanent closure.
    (22) Potential for the water table to rise sufficiently so as to 
cause saturation of an underground facility located in the unsaturated 
zone.
    (23) Potential for existing or future perched water bodies that may 
saturate portions of the underground facility or provide a faster flow 
path from an underground facility located in the unsaturated zone to the 
accessible environment.
    (24) Potential for the movement of radionuclides in a gaseous state 
through air-filled pore spaces of an unsaturated geologic medium to the 
accessible environment.

       Design Criteria for the Geologic Repository Operations Area


<R05>
Sec. 60.130  General considerations.

    (a) Pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 60.21(c)(2)(i), an 
application for construction authorization for a high-level radioactive 
waste repository at a geologic repository operations area, and an 
application for a license to receive, possess, store, and dispose of 
high-level radioactive waste in the geologic repository operations area, 
must include the principal design criteria for a proposed facility. The 
principal design criteria establish the necessary design, fabrication, 
construction, testing, maintenance, and performance requirements for 
structures, systems, and components important to safety and/or important 
to waste isolation. Sections 60.131 through 60.134 specify minimum 
requirements for the principal design criteria for the geologic 
repository operations area.
    (b) These design criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. 
However, omissions in Sec. Sec. 60.131 through 60.134 do not relieve 
DOE from any obligation to provide such features in a specific facility 
needed to achieve the performance objectives.

[69 FR 2280, Jan. 14, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 60.131  General design criteria for the geologic repository 
operations area.

    (a) Radiological protection. The geologic repository operations area 
shall be designed to maintain radiation doses, levels, and 
concentrations of radioactive material in air in restricted areas within 
the limits specified in part 20 of this chapter. Design shall include:
    (1) Means to limit concentrations of radioactive material in air;
    (2) Means to limit the time required to perform work in the vicinity 
of radioactive materials, including, as appropriate, designing equipment 
for ease of repair and replacement and providing adequate space for ease 
of operation;
    (3) Suitable shielding;
    (4) Means to monitor and control the dispersal of radioactive 
contamination;
    (5) Means to control access to high radiation areas or airborne 
radioactivity areas; and
    (6) A radiation alarm system to warn of significant increases in 
radiation levels, concentrations of radioactive material in air, and of 
increased radioactivity released in effluents. The alarm system shall be 
designed with provisions for calibration and for testing its 
operability.
    (b) Protection against design basis events. The structures, systems, 
and components important to safety shall be designed so that they will 
perform their necessary safety functions, assuming occurrence of design 
basis events.
    (c) Protection against dynamic effects of equipment failure and 
similar events. The structures, systems, and components important to 
safety shall be designed to withstand dynamic effects such as missile 
impacts, that could result from equipment failure, and similar events 
and conditions that could lead to loss of their safety functions.
    (d) Protection against fires and explosions. (1) The structures, 
systems, and components important to safety shall be designed to perform 
their safety functions during and after credible fires or explosions in 
the geologic repository operations area.
    (2) To the extent practicable, the geologic repository operations 
area shall be designed to incorporate the use of

[[Page 199]]

noncombustible and heat resistant materials.
    (3) The geologic repository operations area shall be designed to 
include explosion and fire detection alarm systems and appropriate 
suppression systems with sufficient capacity and capability to reduce 
the adverse effects of fires and explosions on structures, systems, and 
components important to safety.
    (4) The geologic repository operations area shall be designed to 
include means to protect systems, structures, and components important 
to safety against the adverse effects of either the operation or failure 
of the fire suppression systems.
    (e) Emergency capability. (1) The structures, systems, and 
components important to safety shall be designed to maintain control of 
radioactive waste and radioactive effluents, and permit prompt 
termination of operations and evacuation of personnel during an 
emergency.
    (2) The geologic repository operations area shall be designed to 
include onsite facilities and services that ensure a safe and timely 
response to emergency conditions and that facilitate the use of 
available offsite services (such as fire, police, medical, and ambulance 
service) that may aid in recovery from emergencies.
    (f) Utility services. (1) Each utility service system that is 
important to safety shall be designed so that essential safety functions 
can be performed, assuming occurrence of the design basis events.
    (2) The utility services important to safety shall include redundant 
systems to the extent necessary to maintain, with adequate capacity, the 
ability to perform their safety functions.
    (3) Provisions shall be made so that, if there is a loss of the 
primary electric power source or circuit, reliable and timely emergency 
power can be provided to instruments, utility service systems, and 
operating systems, including alarm systems, important to safety.
    (g) Inspection, testing, and maintenance. The structures, systems, 
and components important to safety shall be designed to permit periodic 
inspection, testing, and maintenance, as necessary, to ensure their 
continued functioning and readiness.
    (h) Criticality control. All systems for processing, transporting, 
handling, storage, retrieval, emplacement, and isolation of radioactive 
waste shall be designed to ensure that nuclear criticality is not 
possible unless at least two unlikely, independent, and concurrent or 
sequential changes have occurred in the conditions essential to nuclear 
criticality safety. Each system must be designed for criticality safety 
assuming occurrence of design basis events. The calculated effective 
multiplication factor (k<INF>eff</INF>) must be sufficiently below unity 
to show at least a 5 percent margin, after allowance for the bias in the 
method of calculation and the uncertainty in the experiments used to 
validate the method of calculation.
    (i) Instrumentation and control systems. The design shall include 
provisions for instrumentation and control systems to monitor and 
control the behavior of systems important to safety, assuming occurrence 
of design basis events.
    (j) Compliance with mining regulations. To the extent that DOE is 
not subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as to the 
construction and operation of the geologic repository operations area, 
the design of the geologic repository operations area shall nevertheless 
include provisions for worker protection necessary to provide reasonable 
assurance that all structures, systems, and components important to 
safety can perform their intended functions. Any deviation from relevant 
design requirements in 30 CFR, chapter I, subchapters D, E, and N will 
give rise to a rebuttable presumption that this requirement has not been 
met.
    (k) Shaft conveyances used in radioactive waste handling. (1) Hoists 
important to safety shall be designed to preclude cage free fall.
    (2) Hoists important to safety shall be designed with a reliable 
cage location system.
    (3) Loading and unloading systems for hoists important to safety 
shall be designed with a reliable system of interlocks that will fail 
safely upon malfunction.

[[Page 200]]

    (4) Hoists important to safety shall be designed to include two 
independent indicators to indicate when waste packages are in place and 
ready for transfer.

Sec. 60.132  Additional design criteria for surface facilities in the
geologic repository operations area.

    (a) Facilities for receipt and retrieval of waste. Surface 
facilities in the geologic repository operations area shall be designed 
to allow safe handling and storage of wastes at the geologic repository 
operations area, whether these wastes are on the surface before 
emplacement or as a result of retrieval from the underground facility.
    (b) Surface facility ventilation. Surface facility ventilation 
systems supporting waste transfer, inspection, decontamination, 
processing, or packaging shall be designed to provide protection against 
radiation exposures and offsite releases as provided in Sec. 60.111(a).
    (c) Radiation control and monitoring--(1) Effluent control. The 
surface facilities shall be designed to control the release of 
radioactive materials in effluents during Category 1 design basis events 
so as to meet the performance objectives of Sec. 60.111(a).
    (2) Effluent monitoring. The effluent monitoring systems shall be 
designed to measure the amount and concentration of radionuclides in any 
effluent with sufficient precision to determine whether releases conform 
to the design requirement for effluent control. The monitoring systems 
shall be designed to include alarms that can be periodically tested.
    (d) Waste treatment. Radioactive waste treatment facilities shall be 
designed to process any radioactive wastes generated at the geologic 
repository operations area into a form suitable to permit safe disposal 
at the geologic repository operations area or to permit safe 
transportation and conversion to a form suitable for disposal at an 
alternative site in accordance with any regulations that are applicable.
    (e) Consideration of decommissioning. The surface facility shall be 
designed to facilitate decontamination or dismantlement to the same 
extent as would be required, under other parts of this chapter, with 
respect to equivalent activities licensed thereunder.

<R05>
Sec. 60.133  Additional design criteria for the underground facility.

    (a) General criteria for the underground facility. (1) The 
orientation, geometry, layout, and depth of the underground facility, 
and the design of any engineered barriers that are part of the 
underground facility shall contribute to the containment and isolation 
of radionuclides.
    (2) The underground facility shall be designed so that the effects 
of credible disruptive events during the period of operations, such as 
flooding, fires and explosions, will not spread through the facility.
    (b) Flexibility of design. The underground facility shall be 
designed with sufficient flexibility to allow adjustments where 
necessary to accommodate specific site conditions identified through in 
situ monitoring, testing, or excavation.
    (c) Retrieval of waste. The underground facility shall be designed 
to permit retrieval of waste in accordance with the performance 
objectives of Sec. 60.111.
    (d) Control of water and gas. The design of the underground facility

    (2) Openings in the underground facility shall be designed to reduce 
the potential for deleterious rock movement or fracturing of overlying 
or surrounding rock.
    (f) Rock excavation. The design of the underground facility shall 
incorporate excavation methods that will limit the potential for 
creating a preferential pathway for groundwater to contact the waste 
packages or radionuclide migration to the accessible environment.
    (g) Underground facility ventilation. The ventilation system shall 
be designed to:

[[Page 201]]

    (1) Control the transport of radioactive particulates and gases 
within and releases from the underground facility in accordance with the 
performance objectives of Sec. 60.111(a),
    (2) Assure the ability to perform essential safety functions 
assuming occurrence of design basis events.
    (3) Separate the ventilation of excavation and waste emplacement 
areas.

<R05>
Sec. 60.134  Design of seals for shafts and boreholes.

    (a) General design criterion. Seals for shafts and boreholes shall 
be designed so that following permanent closure they do not become 
pathways that compromise the geologic repository's ability to meet the 
performance objectives or the period following permanent closure.
    (b) Selection of materials and placement methods. Materials and 
placement methods for seals shall be selected to reduce, to the extent 
practicable:
    (1) The potential for creating a preferential pathway for 
groundwater to contact the waste packages or
    (2) For radionuclide migration through existing pathways.

<R05>
Sec. 60.135  Criteria for the waste package and its components.

    (a) High-level-waste package design in general. (1) Packages for HLW 
shall be designed so that the in situ chemical, physical, and nuclear 
properties of the waste package and its interactions with the 
emplacement environment do not compromise the function of the waste 
packages or the performance of the underground facility or the geologic 
setting.
    (2) The design shall include but not be limited to consideration of 
the following factors: solubility, oxidation/reduction reactions, 
corrosion, hydriding, gas generation, thermal effects, mechanical 
strength, mechanical stress, radiolysis, radiation damage, radionuclide 
retardation, leaching, fire and explosion hazards, thermal loads, and 
synergistic interactions.
    (b) Specific criteria for HLW package design--(1) Explosive, 
pyrophoric, and chemically reactive materials. The waste package shall 
not contain explosive or pyrophoric materials or chemically reactive 
materials in an amount that could compromise the ability of the 
underground facility to contribute to waste isolation or the ability of 
the geologic repository to satisfy the performance objectives.
    (2) Free liquids. The waste package shall not contain free liquids 
in an amount that could compromise the ability of the waste packages to 
achieve the performance objectives relating to containment of HLW 
(because of chemical interactions or formation of pressurized vapor) or 
result in spillage and spread of contamination in the event of waste 
package perforation during the period through permanent closure.
    (3) Handling. Waste packages shall be designed to maintain waste 
containment during transportation, emplacement, and retrieval.
    (4) Unique identification. A label or other means of identification 
shall be provided for each waste package. The identification shall not 
impair the integrity of the waste package and shall be applied in such a 
way that the information shall be legible at least to the end of the 
period of retrievability. Each waste package identification shall be 
consistent with the waste package's permanent written records.
    (c) Waste form criteria for HLW. High-level radioactive waste that 
is emplaced in the underground facility shall be designed to meet the 
following criteria:

[[Page 202]]

    (1) Solidification. All such radioactive wastes shall be in solid 
form and placed in sealed containers.
    (2) Consolidation. Particulate waste forms shall be consolidated 
(for example, by incorporation into an encapsulating matrix) to limit 
the availability and generation of particulates.
    (3) Combustibles. All combustible radioactive wastes shall be 
reduced to a noncombustible form unless it can be demonstrated that a 
fire involving the waste packages containing combustibles will not 
compromise the integrity of other waste packages, adversely affect any 
structures, systems, or components important to safety, or compromise 
the ability of the underground facility to contribute to waste 
isolation.
    (d) Design criteria for other radioactive wastes. Design criteria 
for waste types other than HLW will be addressed on an individual basis 
if and when they are proposed for disposal in a geologic repository.

                       Preclosure Controlled Area


<R05>
Sec. 60.136  Preclosure controlled area.

    (a) A preclosure controlled area must be established for the 
geologic repository operations area.
    (b) The geologic repository operations area shall be designed so 
that, for Category 2 design basis events, no individual located on or 
beyond any point on the boundary of the preclosure controlled area will 
receive the more limiting of a total effective dose equivalent of 0.05 
Sv (5 rem), or the sum of the deep-dose equivalent and the committed 
dose equivalent to any individual organ or tissue (other than the lens 
of the eye) of 0.5 Sv (50 rem). The eye dose equivalent shall not exceed 
0.15 Sv (15 rem), and the shallow dose equivalent to skin shall not 
exceed 0.5 Sv (50 rem). The minimum distance from the surface facilities 
in the geologic repository operations area to the boundary of the 
preclosure controlled area must be at least 100 meters.
    (c) The preclosure controlled area may be traversed by a highway, 
railroad, or waterway, so long as appropriate and effective arrangements 
are made to control traffic and to protect public health and safety.

<R05>
Sec. 61.7  Concepts.

    (a) The disposal facility. (1) Part 61 is intended to apply to land 
disposal of radioactive waste and not to other methods such as sea or 
extraterrestrial disposal. Part 61 contains procedural requirements and 
performance objectives applicable to any method of land disposal. It 
contains specific technical requirements for near-surface disposal of 
radioactive waste, a subset of land disposal, which involves disposal in 
the uppermost portion of the earth, approximately 30 meters. Near-
surface disposal includes disposal in engineered facilities which may be 
built totally or partially above-grade provided that such facilities 
have protective earthen covers. Near-surface disposal does not include 
disposal facilities which are partially or fully above-grade with no 
protective earthen cover, which are referred to as ``above-ground 
disposal.'' Burial deeper than 30 meters may also be satisfactory. 
Technical requirements for alternative methods may be added in the 
future.
    (2) Near-surface disposal of radioactive waste takes place at a 
near-surface disposal facility, which includes all of the land and 
buildings necessary to carry out the disposal. The disposal site is that 
portion of the facility which is used for disposal of waste and consists 
of disposal units and a buffer zone. A disposal unit is a discrete 
portion of the disposal site into which waste is placed for disposal. 
For near-surface disposal, the disposal unit is usually a trench. A 
buffer zone is a portion of the disposal site that is controlled by the 
licensee and that lies under the site and between the boundary of the 
disposal site and any disposal unit. It provides controlled space to 
establish monitoring locations which are intended to provide an early 
warning of radionuclide movement, and to take mitigative measures if 
needed. In choosing a disposal site, site characteristics should be 
considered in terms of the indefinite future and evaluated for at least 
a 500-year timeframe.
    (b) Waste classification and near-surface disposal. (1) Disposal of 
radioactive waste in near-surface disposal facilities has the following 
safety objectives: protection of the general population from releases of 
radioactivity, protection of individuals from inadvertent intrusion, and 
protection of individuals during operations. A fourth objective is to 
ensure stability of the site after closure.
    (2) A cornerstone of the system is stability--stability of the waste 
and the disposal site so that once emplaced and covered, the access of 
water to the waste can be minimized. Migration of radionuclides is thus 
minimized, long-term active maintenance can be avoided, and potential 
exposures to intruders reduced. While stability is a desirable 
characteristic for all waste much radioactive waste does not contain 
sufficient amounts of radionuclides to be of great concern from these 
standpoints; this waste, however, tends to be unstable, such as ordinary 
trash type wastes. If mixed with the higher activity waste, their 
deterioration could lead to failure of the system and permit water to 
penetrate the disposal unit and cause problems with the higher activity 
waste. Therefore, in order to avoid placing requirements for a stable 
waste form on relatively innocuous waste, these wastes have been classed 
as Class A waste. The Class A waste will be disposed of in separate 
disposal units at the disposal site. However,

[[Page 210]]

Class A waste that is stable may be mixed with other classes of waste. 
Those higher activity wastes that should be stable for proper disposal 
are classed as Class B and C waste. To the extent that it is 
practicable, Class B and C waste forms or containers should be designed 
to be stable, i.e., maintain gross physical properties and identity, 
over 300 years. For certain radionuclides prone to migration, a maximum 
disposal site inventory based on the characteristics of the disposal 
site may be established to limit potential exposure.
    (3) It is possible but unlikely that persons might occupy the site 
in the future and engage in normal pursuits without knowing that they 
were receiving radiation exposure. These persons are referred to as 
inadvertent intruders. Protection of such intruders can involve two 
principal controls: institutional control over the site after operations 
by the site owner to ensure that no such occupation or improper use of 
the site occurs; or, designating which waste could present an 
unacceptable risk to an intruder, and disposing of this waste in a 
manner that provides some form of intruder barrier that is intended to 
prevent contact with the waste. This regulation incorporates both types 
of protective controls.
    (4) Institutional control of access to the site is required for up 
to 100 years. This permits the disposal of Class A and Class B waste 
without special provisions for intrusion protection, since these classes 
of waste contain types and quantities of radioisotopes that will decay 
during the 100-year period and will present an acceptable hazard to an 
intruder. The government landowner administering the active 
institutional control program has flexibility in controlling site access 
which may include allowing productive uses of the land provided the 
integrity and long-term performance of the site are not affected.
    (5) Waste that will not decay to levels which present an acceptable 
hazard to an intruder within 100 years is designated as Class C waste. 
This waste is disposed of at a greater depth than the other classes of 
waste so that subsequent surface activities by an intruder will not 
disturb the waste. Where site conditions prevent deeper disposal, 
intruder barriers such as concrete covers may be used. The effective 
life of these intruder barriers should be 500 years. A maximum 
concentration of radionuclides is specified for all wastes so that at 
the end of the 500 year period, remaining radioactivity will be at a 
level that does not pose an unacceptable hazard to an intruder or public 
health and safety. Waste with concentrations above these limits is 
generally unacceptable for near-surface disposal. There may be some 
instances where waste with concentrations greater than permitted for 
Class C would be acceptable for near-surface disposal with special 
processing or design. These will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
Class C waste must also be stable.
    (c) The licensing process. (1) During the preoperational phase, the 
potential applicant goes through a process of disposal site selection by 
selecting a region of interest, examining a number of possible disposal 
sites within the area of interest and narrowing the choice to the 
proposed site. Through a detailed investigation of the disposal site 
characteristics the potential applicant obtains data on which to base an 
analysis of the disposal site's suitability. Along with these data and 
analyses, the applicant submits other more general information to the 
Commission in the form of an application for a license for land 
disposal. The Commission's review of the application is in accordance 
with administrative procedures established by rule and may involve 
participation by affected State governments or Indian tribes. While the 
proposed disposal site must be owned by a State or the Federal 
government before the Commission will issue a license, it may be 
privately owned during the preoperational phase if suitable arrangements 
have been made with a State or the Federal government to take ownership 
in fee of the land before the license is issued.
    (2) During the operational phase, the licensee carries out disposal 
activities in accordance with the requirements of this regulation and 
any conditions on the license. Periodically, the authority to conduct 
the above ground operations and dispose of waste will be subject to

[[Page 211]]

a license renewal, at which time the operating history will be reviewed 
and a decision made to permit or deny continued operation. When disposal 
operations are to cease, the licensee applies for an amendment to his 
license to permit site closure. After final review of the licensee's 
site closure and stabilization plan, the Commission may approve the 
final activities necessary to prepare the disposal site so that ongoing 
active maintenance of the site is not required during the period of 
institutional control.
    (3) During the period when the final site closure and stabilization 
activities are being carried out, the licensee is in a disposal site 
closure phase. Following that, for a period of 5 years, the licensee 
must remain at the disposal site for a period of post-closure 
observation and maintenance to assure that the disposal site is stable 
and ready for institutional control. The Commission may approve shorter 
or require longer periods if conditions warrant. At the end of this 
period, the licensee applies for a license transfer to the disposal site 
owner.
    (4) After a finding of satisfactory disposal site closure, the 
Commission will transfer the license to the State or Federal government 
that owns the disposal site. If the Department of Energy is the Federal 
agency administering the land on bahalf of the Federal government the 
license will be terminated because the Commission lacks regulatory 
authority over the Department for this activity. Under the conditions of 
the transferred license, the owner will carry out a program of 
monitoring to assure continued satisfactory disposal site performance, 
physical surveillance to restrict access to the site and carry out minor 
custodial activities. During this period, productive uses of the land 
might be permitted if those uses do not affect the stability of the site 
and its ability to meet the performance objectives. At the end of the 
prescribed period of institutional control, the license will be 
terminated by the Commission.

Sec. 61.9  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a 
Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission 
licensee or applicant against an employee for engaging in certain 
protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes discharge 
and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 
section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in 
general are related to the administration or enforcement of a 
requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy 
Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:

[[Page 212]]

    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph 
(a) introductory text of the section or possible violations of 
requirements imposed under either of those statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text or under these 
requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory 
text.
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraph (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant may be 
grounds for--
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license.
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee, applicant, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of the licensee or applicant.
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect 
an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.
    (e)(1) Each licensee and each applicant for a license shall 
prominently post the revision of NRC Form 3, ``Notice to Employees,'' 
referenced in 10 CFR 19.11(c). This form must be posted at locations 
sufficient to permit employees protected by this section to observe a 
copy on the way to or from their place of work. Premises must be posted 
not later than 30 days after an application is docketed and remain 
posted while the application is pending before the Commission, during 
the term of the license, and for 30 days following license termination.
    (2) Copies of NRC Form 3 can be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in appendix D to part 20 of this chapter, by 
calling (301) 415-7232, via e-mail to FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov, or by 
visiting the NRC's Web site at http://www.nrc.gov and selecting forms 
from the index found on the home page.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain 
any provision

[[Page 213]]

which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an employee from 
participating in protected activity as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section including, but not limited to, providing information to the 
NRC or to his or her employer on potential violations or other matters 
within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

                    Subpart C_Performance Objectives


<R05>
Sec. 61.40  General requirement.

    Land disposal facilities must be sited, designed, operated, closed, 
and controlled after closure so that reasonable assurance exists that 
exposures to humans are within the limits established in the performance 
objectives in Sec. Sec. 61.41 through 61.44.


<R05>
Sec. 61.41  Protection of the general population from releases of 
radioactivity.

    Concentrations of radioactive material which may be released to the 
general environment in ground water, surface water, air, soil, plants, 
or animals must not result in an annual dose exceeding an equivalent of 
25 millirems to the whole body, 75 millirems to the thyroid, and 25 
millirems to any other organ of any member of the public. Reasonable 
effort should be made to maintain releases of radioactivity in effluents 
to the general environment as low as is reasonably achievable.


<R05>
Sec. 61.42  Protection of individuals from inadvertent intrusion.

    Design, operation, and closure of the land disposal facility must 
ensure protection of any individual inadvertently intruding into the 
disposal site and occupying the site or contacting the waste at any time 
after active institutional controls over the disposal site are removed.


<R05>
Sec. 61.43  Protection of individuals during operations.

    Operations at the land disposal facility must be conducted in 
compliance with the standards for radiation protection set out in part 
20 of this chapter, except for releases of radioactivity in effluents 
from the land disposal facility, which shall be governed by Sec. 61.41 
of this part. Every reasonable effort shall be made to maintain 
radiation exposures as low as is reasonably achievable.


<R05>
Sec. 61.44  Stability of the disposal site after closure.

    The disposal facility must be sited, designed, used, operated, and 
closed to achieve long-term stability of the disposal site and to 
eliminate to the extent practicable the need for ongoing active 
maintenance of the disposal site following closure so that only 
surveillance, monitoring, or minor custodial care are required.


<R04>
      Subpart D_Technical Requirements for Land Disposal Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 61.50  Disposal site suitability requirements for land disposal.

    (a) Disposal site suitability for near-surface disposal. (1) The 
purpose of this section is to specify the minimum characteristics a 
disposal site must have to be acceptable for use as a near-surface 
disposal facility. The primary emphasis in disposal site suitability is 
given to isolation of wastes, a matter having long-term impacts, and to 
disposal site features that ensure that the long-term performance 
objectives of subpart C of this part are met, as opposed to short-term 
convenience or benefits.
    (2) The disposal site shall be capable of being characterized, 
modeled, analyzed and monitored.
    (3) Within the region or state where the facility is to be located, 
a disposal site should be selected so that projected population growth 
and future developments are not likely to affect the ability of the 
disposal facility to meet the performance objectives of subpart C of 
this part.

[[Page 222]]

    (4) Areas must be avoided having known natural resources which, if 
exploited, would result in failure to meet the performance objectives of 
subpart C of this part.
    (5) The disposal site must be generally well drained and free of 
areas of flooding or frequent ponding. Waste disposal shall not take 
place in a 100-year flood plain, coastal high-hazard area or wetland, as 
defined in Executive Order 11988, ``Floodplain Management Guidelines.''
    (6) Upstream drainage areas must be minimized to decrease the amount 
of runoff which could erode or inundate waste disposal units.
    (7) The disposal site must provide sufficient depth to the water 
table that ground water intrusion, perennial or otherwise, into the 
waste will not occur. The Commission will consider an exception to this 
requirement to allow disposal below the water table if it can be 
conclusively shown that disposal site characteristics will result in 
molecular diffusion being the predominant means of radionuclide movement 
and the rate of movement will result in the performance objectives of 
subpart C of this part being met. In no case will waste disposal be 
permitted in the zone of fluctuation of the water table.
    (8) The hydrogeologic unit used for disposal shall not discharge 
ground water to the surface within the disposal site.
    (9) Areas must be avoided where tectonic processes such as faulting, 
folding, seismic activity, or vulcanism may occur with such frequency 
and extent to significantly affect the ability of the disposal site to 
meet the performance objectives of subpart C of this part, or may 
preclude defensible modeling and prediction of long-term impacts.
    (10) Areas must be avoided where surface geologic processes such as 
mass wasting, erosion, slumping, landsliding, or weathering occur with 
such frequency and extent to significantly affect the ability of the 
disposal site to meet the performance objectives of subpart C of this 
part, or may preclude defensible modeling and prediction of long-term 
impacts.
    (11) The disposal site must not be located where nearby facilities 
or activities could adversely impact the ability of the site to meet the 
performance objectives of subpart C of this part or significantly mask 
the environmental monitoring program.
    (b) Disposal site suitability requirements for land disposal other 
than near-surface. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 61.51  Disposal site design for land disposal.

    (a) Disposal site design for near-surface disposal. (1) Site design 
features must be directed toward long-term isolation and avoidance of 
the need for continuing active maintenance after site closure.
    (2) The disposal site design and operation must be compatible with 
the disposal site closure and stabilization plan and lead to disposal 
site closure that provides reasonable assurance that the performance 
objectives of subpart C of this part will be met.
    (3) The disposal site must be designed to complement and improve, 
where appropriate, the ability of the disposal site's natural 
characteristics to assure that the performance objectives of subpart C 
of this part will be met.
    (4) Covers must be designed to minimize to the extent practicable 
water infiltration, to direct percolating or surface water away from the 
disposed waste, and to resist degradation by surface geologic processes 
and biotic activity.
    (5) Surface features must direct surface water drainage away from 
disposal units at velocities and gradients which will not result in 
erosion that will require ongoing active maintenance in the future.
    (6) The disposal site must be designed to minimize to the extent 
practicable the contact of water with waste during storage, the contact 
of standing water with waste during disposal, and the contact of 
percolating or standing water with wastes after disposal.
    (b) Disposal site design for other than near-surface disposal. 
[Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 61.52  Land disposal facility operation and disposal site closure.

    (a) Near-surface disposal facility operation and disposal site 
closure. (1) Wastes designated as Class A pursuant to Sec. 61.55, must 
be segregated from other

[[Page 223]]

wastes by placing in disposal units which are sufficiently separated 
from disposal units for the other waste classes so that any interaction 
between Class A wastes and other wastes will not result in the failure 
to meet the performance objectives in subpart C of this Part. This 
segregation is not necessary for Class A wastes if they meet the 
stability requirements in Sec. 61.56(b) of this part.
    (2) Wastes designated as Class C pursuant to Sec. 61.55, must be 
disposed of so that the top of the waste is a minimum of 5 meters below 
the top surface of the cover or must be disposed of with intruder 
barriers that are designed to protect against an inadvertent intrusion 
for a least 500 years.
    (3) All wastes shall be disposed of in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraphs (a) (4) through (11) of this section.
    (4) Wastes must be emplaced in a manner that maintains the package 
integrity during emplacement, minimizes the void spaces between 
packages, and permits the void spaces to be filled.
    (5) Void spaces between waste packages must be filled with earth or 
other material to reduce future subsidence within the fill.
    (6) Waste must be placed and covered in a manner that limits the 
radiation dose rate at the surface of the cover to levels that at a 
minimum will permit the licensee to comply with all provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 20.1301 and 20.1302 of this chapter at the time the license 
is transferred pursuant to Sec. 61.30 of this part.
    (7) The boundaries and locations of each disposal unit (e.g., 
trenches) must be accurately located and mapped by means of a land 
survey. Near-surface disposal units must be marked in such a way that 
the boundaries of each unit can be easily defined. Three permanent 
survey marker control points, referenced to United States Geological 
Survey (USGS) or National Geodetic Survey (NGS) survey control stations, 
must be established on the site to facilitate surveys. The USGS or NGS 
control stations must provide horizontal and vertical controls as 
checked against USGS or NGS record files.
    (8) A buffer zone of land must be maintained between any buried 
waste and the disposal site boundary and beneath the disposed waste. The 
buffer zone shall be of adequate dimensions to carry out environmental 
monitoring activities specified in Sec. 61.53(d) of this part and take 
mitigative measures if needed.
    (9) Closure and stabilization measures as set forth in the approved 
site closure plan must be carried out as each disposal unit (e.g., each 
trench) is filled and covered.
    (10) Active waste disposal operations must not have an adverse 
effect on completed closure and stabilization measures.
    (11) Only wastes containing or contaminated with radioactive 
materials shall be disposed of at the disposal site.
    (b) Facility operation and disposal site closure for land disposal 
facilities other than near-surface. [Reserved]

Sec. 61.53  Environmental monitoring.

    (a) At the time a license application is submitted, the applicant 
shall have conducted a preoperational monitoring program to provide 
basic environmental data on the disposal site characteristics. The 
applicant shall obtain information about the ecology, meteorology, 
climate, hydrology, geology, geochemistry, and seismology of the 
disposal site. For those characteristics that are subject to seasonal 
variation, data must cover at least a twelve month period.
    (b) The licensee must have plans for taking corrective measures if 
migration of radionuclides would indicate that the performance 
objectives of subpart C may not be met.
    (c) During the land disposal facility site construction and 
operation, the licensee shall maintain a monitoring program. 
Measurements and observations must be made and recorded to provide data 
to evaluate the potential health and environmental impacts during both 
the construction and the operation of the facility and to enable the 
evaluation of long-term effects and the need for mitigative measures. 
The monitoring system must be capable of

[[Page 224]]

providing early warning of releases of radionuclides from the disposal 
site before they leave the site boundary.
    (d) After the disposal site is closed, the licensee responsible for 
post-operational surveillance of the disposal site shall maintain a 
monitoring system based on the operating history and the closure and 
stabilization of the disposal site. The monitoring system must be 
capable of providing early warning of releases of radionuclides from the 
disposal site before they leave the site boundary.


<R05>
Sec. 61.54  Alternative requirements for design and operations.

    The Commission may, upon request or on its own initiative, authorize 
provisions other than those set forth in Sec. Sec. 61.51 through 61.53 
for the segregation and disposal of waste and for the design and 
operation of a land disposal facility on a specific basis, if it finds 
reasonable assurance of compliance with the performance objectives of 
subpart C of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 61.55  Waste classification.

    (a) Classification of waste for near surface disposal--(1) 
Considerations. Determination of the classification of radioactive waste 
involves two considerations. First, consideration must be given to the 
concentration of long-lived radionuclides (and their shorter-lived 
precursors) whose potential hazard will persist long after such 
precautions as institutional controls, improved waste form, and deeper 
disposal have ceased to be effective. These precautions delay the time 
when long-lived radionuclides could cause exposures. In addition, the 
magnitude of the potential dose is limited by the concentration and 
availability of the radionuclide at the time of exposure. Second, 
consideration must be given to the concentration of shorter-lived 
radionuclides for which requirements on institutional controls, waste 
form, and disposal methods are effective.
    (2) Classes of waste. (i) Class A waste is waste that is usually 
segregated from other waste classes at the disposal site. The physical 
form and characteristics of Class A waste must meet the minimum 
requirements set forth in Sec. 61.56(a). If Class A waste also meets 
the stability requirements set forth in Sec. 61.56(b), it is not 
necessary to segregate the waste for disposal.
    (ii) Class B waste is waste that must meet more rigorous 
requirements on waste form to ensure stability after disposal. The 
physical form and characteristics of Class B waste must meet both the 
minimum and stability requirements set forth in Sec. 61.56.
    (iii) Class C waste is waste that not only must meet more rigorous 
requirements on waste form to ensure stability but also requires 
additional measures at the disposal facility to protect against 
inadvertent intrusion. The physical form and characteristics of Class C 
waste must meet both the minimum and stability requirements set forth in 
Sec. 61.56.
    (iv) Waste that is not generally acceptable for near-surface 
disposal is waste for which form and disposal methods must be different, 
and in general more stringent, than those specified for Class C waste. 
In the absence of specific requirements in this part, such waste must be 
disposed of in a geologic repository as defined in part 60 or 63 of this 
chapter unless proposals for disposal of such waste in a disposal site 
licensed pursuant to this part are approved by the Commission.
    (3) Classification determined by long-lived radionuclides. If 
radioactive waste contains only radionuclides listed in Table 1, 
classification shall be determined as follows:
    (i) If the concentration does not exceed 0.1 times the value in 
Table 1, the waste is Class A.
    (ii) If the concentration exceeds 0.1 times the value in Table 1 but 
does not exceed the value in Table 1, the waste is Class C.
    (iii) If the concentration exceeds the value in Table 1, the waste 
is not generally acceptable for near-surface disposal.
    (iv) For wastes containing mixtures of radionuclides listed in Table 
1, the total concentration shall be determined by the sum of fractions 
rule described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.

    (4) Classification determined by short-lived radionuclides. If 
radioactive waste does not contain any of the radionuclides listed in 
Table 1, classification shall be determined based on the concentrations 
shown in Table 2. However, as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this 
section, if radioactive waste does not contain any nuclides listed in 
either Table 1 or 2, it is Class A.
    (i) If the concentration does not exceed the value in Column 1, the 
waste is Class A.
    (ii) If the concentration exceeds the value in Column 1, but does 
not exceed the value in Column 2, the waste is Class B.
    (iii) If the concentration exceeds the value in Column 2, but does 
not exceed the value in Column 3, the waste is Class C.
    (iv) If the concentration exceeds the value in Column 3, the waste 
is not generally acceptable for near-surface disposal.
    (v) For wastes containing mixtures of the nuclides listed in Table 
2, the total concentration shall be determined by the sum of fractions 
rule described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ There are no limits established for these radionuclides in Class B
  or C wastes. Practical considerations such as the effects of external
  radiation and internal heat generation on transportation, handling,
  and disposal will limit the concentrations for these wastes. These
  wastes shall be Class B unless the concentrations of other nuclides in
  Table 2 determine the waste to be Class C independent of these
  nuclides.

    (5) Classification determined by both long- and short-lived 
radionuclides. If radioactive waste contains a mixture of radionuclides, 
some of which are listed in Table 1, and some of which are listed in 
Table 2, classification shall be determined as follows:
    (i) If the concentration of a nuclide listed in Table 1 does not 
exceed 0.1 times the value listed in Table 1, the class shall be that 
determined by the concentration of nuclides listed in Table 2.
    (ii) If the concentration of a nuclide listed in Table 1 exceeds 0.1 
times the value listed in Table 1 but does not exceed the value in Table 
1, the waste shall be Class C, provided the concentration of nuclides 
listed in Table 2 does not exceed the value shown in Column 3 of Table 
2.
    (6) Classification of wastes with radionuclides other than those 
listed in Tables 1 and 2. If radioactive waste does not contain any 
nuclides listed in either Table 1 or 2, it is Class A.
    (7) The sum of the fractions rule for mixtures of radionuclides. For 
determining classification for waste that contains a mixture of 
radionuclides, it is necessary to determine the sum of fractions by 
dividing each nuclide's concentration by the appropriate limit and 
adding the resulting values. The appropriate limits must all be taken 
from the same column of the same table. The sum of the fractions for the 
column must be less than 1.0 if the waste class is to be determined by 
that column. Example: A waste contains Sr-90 in a concentration of 50 
Ci/m\3\ and Cs-137 in a concentration of 22 Ci/m\3\. Since the 
concentrations both exceed the values in Column 1, Table 2, they must be 
compared to Column 2 values. For Sr-90 fraction 50/150=0.33; for Cs-137 
fraction, 22/44=0.5; the sum of the

[[Page 226]]

fractions=0.83. Since the sum is less than 1.0, the waste is Class B.
    (8) Determination of concentrations in wastes. The concentration of 
a radionuclide may be determined by indirect methods such as use of 
scaling factors which relate the inferred concentration of one 
radionuclide to another that is measured, or radionuclide material 
accountability, if there is reasonable assurance that the indirect 
methods can be correlated with actual measurements. The concentration of 
a radionuclide may be averaged over the volume of the waste, or weight 
of the waste if the units are expressed as nanocuries per gram.

<R05>
Sec. 61.56  Waste characteristics.

    (a) The following requirements are minimum requirements for all 
classes of waste and are intended to facilitate handling at the disposal 
site and provide protection of health and safety of personnel at the 
disposal site.
    (1) Waste must not be packaged for disposal in cardboard or 
fiberboard boxes.
    (2) Liquid waste must be solidified or packaged in sufficient 
absorbent material to absorb twice the volume of the liquid.
    (3) Solid waste containing liquid shall contain as little free 
standing and noncorrosive liquid as is reasonably achievable, but in no 
case shall the liquid exceed 1% of the volume.
    (4) Waste must not be readily capable of detonation or of explosive 
decomposition or reaction at normal pressures and temperatures, or of 
explosive reaction with water.
    (5) Waste must not contain, or be capable of generating, quantities 
of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes harmful to persons transporting, 
handling, or disposing of the waste. This does not apply to radioactive 
gaseous waste packaged in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this 
section.
    (6) Waste must not be pyrophoric. Pyrophoric materials contained in 
waste shall be treated, prepared, and packaged to be nonflammable.
    (7) Waste in a gaseous form must be packaged at a pressure that does 
not exceed 1.5 atmospheres at 20 [deg]C. Total activity must not exceed 
100 curies per container.
    (8) Waste containing hazardous, biological, pathogenic, or 
infectious material must be treated to reduce to the maximum extent 
practicable the potential hazard from the non-radiological materials.
    (b) The requirements in this section are intended to provide 
stability of the waste. Stability is intended to ensure that the waste 
does not structurally degrade and affect overall stability of the site 
through slumping, collapse, or other failure of the disposal unit and 
thereby lead to water infiltration. Stability is also a factor in 
limiting exposure to an inadvertent intruder, since it provides a 
recognizable and nondispersible waste.
    (1) Waste must have structural stability. A structurally stable 
waste form will generally maintain its physical dimensions and its form, 
under the expected disposal conditions such as weight of overburden and 
compaction equipment, the presence of moisture, and microbial activity, 
and internal factors such as radiation effects and chemical changes. 
Structural stability can be provided by the waste form itself, 
processing the waste to a stable form, or placing the waste in a 
disposal container or structure that provides stability after disposal.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions in Sec. 61.56(a) (2) and (3), 
liquid wastes, or wastes containing liquid, must be converted into a 
form that contains as little free standing and noncorrosive liquid as is 
reasonably achievable, but in no case shall the liquid exceed 1% of the 
volume of the waste when the waste is in a disposal container designed 
to ensure stability, or 0.5% of the volume of the waste for waste 
processed to a stable form.
    (3) Void spaces within the waste and between the waste and its 
package must be reduced to the extent practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 61.57  Labeling.

    Each package of waste must be clearly labeled to identify whether it 
is Class A waste, Class B waste, or Class C waste, in accordance with 
Sec. 61.55.

[[Page 227]]


<R05>
Sec. 61.58  Alternative requirements for waste classification and
characteristics.

    The Commission may, upon request or on its own initiative, authorize 
other provisions for the classification and characteristics of waste on 
a specific basis, if, after evaluation, of the specific characteristics 
of the waste, disposal site, and method of disposal, it finds reasonable 
assurance of compliance with the performance objectives in subpart C of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 61.59  Institutional requirements.

    (a) Land ownership. Disposal of radioactive waste received from 
other persons may be permitted only on land owned in fee by the Federal 
or a State government.
    (b) Institutional control. The land owner or custodial agency shall 
carry out an institutional control program to physically control access 
to the disposal site following transfer of control of the disposal site 
from the disposal site operator. The institutional control program must 
also include, but not be limited to, carrying out an environmental 
monitoring program at the disposal site, periodic surveillance, minor 
custodial care, and other requirements as determined by the Commission; 
and administration of funds to cover the costs for these activities. The 
period of institutional controls will be determined by the Commission, 
but institutional controls may not be relied upon for more than 100 
years following transfer of control of the disposal site to the owner.


<R04>
                     Subpart E_Financial Assurances


<R05>
Sec. 61.61  Applicant qualifications and assurances.

    Each applicant shall show that it either possesses the necessary 
funds or has reasonable assurance of obtaining the necessary funds, or 
by a combination of the two, to cover the estimated costs of conducting 
all licensed activities over the planned operating life of the project, 
including costs of construction and disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 61.62  Funding for disposal site closure and stabilization.

    (a) The applicant shall provide assurance that sufficient funds will 
be available to carry out disposal site closure and stabilization, 
including: (1) Decontamination or dismantlement of land disposal 
facility structures; and (2) closure and stabilization of the disposal 
site so that following transfer of the disposal site to the site owner, 
the need for ongoing active maintenance is eliminated to the extent 
practicable and only minor custodial care, surveillance, and monitoring 
are required. These assurances shall be based on Commission-approved 
cost estimates reflecting the Commission-approved plan for disposal site 
closure and stabilization. The applicant's cost estimates must take into 
account total capital costs that would be incurred if an independent 
contractor were hired to perform the closure and stabilization work.
    (b) In order to avoid unnecessary duplication and expense, the 
Commission will accept financial sureties that have been consolidated 
with earmarked financial or surety arrangements established to meet 
requirements of other Federal or State agencies and/or local governing 
bodies for such decontamination, closure and stabilization. The 
Commission will accept this arrangement only if they are considered 
adequate to satisfy these requirements and that the portion of the 
surety which covers the closure of the disposal site is clearly 
identified and committed for use in accomplishing these activities.
    (c) The licensee's surety mechanism will be annually reviewed by the 
Commission to assure that sufficient funds are available for completion 
of the closure plan, assuming that the work has to be performed by an 
independent contractor.
    (d) The amount of surety liability should change in accordance with 
the predicted cost of future closure and stabilization. Factors 
affecting closure and stabilization cost estimates include: inflation; 
increases in the amount of disturbed land; changes in

[[Page 228]]

engineering plans; closure and stabilization that has already been 
accomplished and any other conditions affecting costs. This will yield a 
surety that is at least sufficient at all times to cover the costs of 
closure of the disposal units that are expected to be used before the 
next license renewal.
    (e) The term of the surety mechanism must be open ended unless it 
can be demonstrated that another arrangement would provide an equivalent 
level of assurance. This assurance could be provided with a surety 
mechanism which is written for a specified period of time (e.g., five 
years) yet which must be automatically renewed unless the party who 
issues the surety notifies the Commission and the beneficiary (the site 
owner) and the principal (the licensee) not less than 90 days prior to 
the renewal date of its intention not to renew. In such a situation the 
licensee must submit a replacement surety within 30 days after 
notification of cancellation. If the licensee fails to provide a 
replacement surety acceptable to the Commission, the site owner may 
collect on the original surety.
    (f) Proof of forfeiture must not be necessary to collect the surety 
so that in the event that the licensee could not provide an acceptable 
replacement surety within the required time, the surety shall be 
automatically collected prior to its expiration. The conditions 
described above would have to be clearly stated on any surety instrument 
which is not open-ended, and must be agreed to by all parties. Liability 
under the surety mechanism must remain in effect until the closure and 
stabilization program has been completed and approved by the Commission 
and the license has been transferred to the site owner.
    (g) Financial surety arrangements generally acceptable to the 
Commission include: surety bonds, cash deposits, certificates of 
deposits, deposits of government securities, escrow accounts, 
irrevocable letters or lines of credit, trust funds, and combinations of 
the above or such other types of arrangements as may be approved by the 
Commission. However, self-insurance, or any arrangement which 
essentially constitutes pledging the assets of the licensee, will not 
satisfy the surety requirement for private sector applicants since this 
provides no additional assurance other than that which already exists 
through license requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 61.63  Financial assurances for institutional controls.

    (a) Prior to the issuance of the license, the applicant shall 
provide for Commission review and approval a copy of a binding 
arrangement, such as a lease, between the applicant and the disposal 
site owner that ensures that sufficient funds will be available to cover 
the costs of monitoring and any required maintenance during the 
institutional control period. The binding arrangement will be reviewed 
periodically by the Commission to ensure that changes in inflation, 
technology and disposal facility operations are reflected in the 
arrangements.
    (b) Subsequent changes to the binding arrangement specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section relevant to institutional control shall be 
submitted to the Commission for approval.


<R04>
     Subpart F_Participation by State Governments and Indian Tribes


<R05>
Sec. 61.70  Scope.

    This subpart describes mechanisms through which the Commission will 
implement a formal request from a State or tribal government to 
participate in the review of a license application for a land disposal 
facility. Nothing in this subpart may be construed to bar the State or 
tribal governing body from participating in subsequent Commission 
proceedings concerning the license application as provided under Federal 
law and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 61.71  State and Tribal government consultation.

    Upon request of a State or tribal governing body, the Director shall 
make available Commission staff to discuss with representatives of the

of an application submitted under Sec. 61.20.
    (2) For any other State, or for a tribal governing body, no later 
than 120 days following publication in the Federal Register of the 
notice of tendering of an application submitted under Sec. 61.20.
    (b) Proposals for participation in the licensing process must be 
made in writing and must be signed by the Governor of the State or the 
official otherwise provided for by State or tribal law.
    (c) At a minimum, proposals must contain each of the following items 
of information:
    (1) A general description of how the State or tribe wishes to 
participate in the licensing process specifically identifying those 
issues it wishes to review.
    (2) A description of material and information which the State or 
tribe plans to submit to the Commission for consideration in the 
licensing process. A tentative schedule referencing steps in the review 
and calendar dates for planned submittals should be included.
    (3) A description of any work that the State or tribe proposes to 
perform for the Commission in support of the licensing process.
    (4) A description of State or tribal plans to facilitate local 
government and citizen participation.
    (5) A preliminary estimate of the types and extent of impacts which 
the State expects, should a disposal facility be located as proposed.
    (6) If desired, any requests for educational or information services

establishment of additional Public Document Rooms or exchange of State 
personnel under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act.


<R05>
Sec. 61.73  Commission approval of proposals.

    (a) Upon receipt of a proposal submitted in accordance with Sec. 
61.72, the Director shall arrange for a meeting between the 
representatives of the State or tribal governing body and the Commission 
staff to discuss the proposal and to ensure full and effective 
participation by the State or tribe in the Commission's license review.
    (b) If requested by a State or tribal governing body, the Director 
may approve all or any part of a proposal if the Director determines 
that:
    (1) The proposed activities are within the scope of Commission 
statutory responsibility and the type and magnitude of impacts which the 
State or tribe may bear are sufficient to justify their participation; 
and
    (2) The proposed activities will contribute productively to the 
licensing review.
    (c) The decision of the Director will be transmitted in writing to 
the governor or the designated official of the tribal governing body.
    (d) Participation by a State or Indian tribe shall not affect their 
rights to participate in an adjudicatory hearing as provided by part 2 
of this chapter.


<R04>
           Subpart G_Records, Reports, Tests, and Inspections


<R05>
Sec. 61.80  Maintenance of records, reports, and transfers.

    (a) Each licensee shall maintain any records and make any reports in 
connection with the licensed activities as may be required by the 
conditions of the license or by the rules, regulations, and orders of 
the Commission.
    (b) Records which are required by the regulations in this part or by 
license conditions must be maintained for a

[[Page 230]]

period specified by the appropriate regulations in this chapter or by 
license condition. If a retention period is not otherwise specified, 
these records must be maintained and transferred to the officials 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section as a condition of license 
termination unless the Commission otherwise authorizes their 
disposition.
    (c) Records which must be maintained pursuant to this part may be 
the original or a reproduced copy or a microform if this reproduced copy 
or microform is capable of producing copy that is clear and legible at 
the end of the required retention period. The record may also be stored

            Subpart C_Issuance of a Commission Determination


<R05>
Sec. 62.21  Determination for granting emergency access.

    (a) Not later than (45) days after the receipt of a request for a 
Commission determination under this part from any generator of low-level 
radioactive waste, or any Governor on behalf of any generator or 
generators located in his or her State, the Commission shall determine 
whether--
    (1) Emergency access to a regional disposal facility or a non-
Federal disposal facility within a State that is not a member of a 
Compact for specific low-level radioactive waste is necessary because of 
an immediate and serious threat--
    (i) To the public health and safety or
    (ii) The common defense and security; and
    (2) The threat cannot be mitigated by any alternative consistent 
with the public health and safety, including those identified in Sec. 
62.13.
    (b) In making a determination under this section, the Commission 
shall be guided by the criteria set forth in Sec. 62.25 of this part.
    (c) A determination under this section must be in writing and 
contain a full explanation of the facts upon which the determination is 
based and the reasons for granting or denying the request. An 
affirmative determination must designate an appropriate non-Federal or 
regional LLW disposal facility or facilities for the disposal of wastes, 
specifically describe the low-level radioactive waste as to source,

[[Page 238]]

physical and radiological characteristics, and the minimum volume and

<R05>
Sec. 62.23  Determination for granting temporary emergency access.

    (a) The Commission may grant temporary emergency access to an 
appropriate non-Federal or regional disposal facility or facilities 
provided that the determination required under Sec. 62.21(a)(1) of this 
part is made;
    (b) The notification procedures under Sec. 62.22 of this part are 
complied with; and
    (c) The temporary emergency access duration will not exceed forty-
five (45) days.


<R05>
Sec. 62.24  Extension of emergency access.

    (a) After the receipt of a request from any generator of low-level 
waste, or any Governor on behalf of any generator or generators in his 
or her State, for an extension of emergency access that was initially 
granted under Sec. 62.21, the Commission shall make an initial 
determination of whether--
    (1) Emergency access continues to be necessary because of an 
immediate and serious threat to the public health and safety or the 
common defense and security;
    (2) The threat cannot be mitigated by any alternative that is 
consistent with public health and safety; and
    (3) The generator of low-level waste and the State have diligently 
though unsuccessfully acted during the period of the initial grant to 
eliminate the need for emergency access.
    (b) After making a determination pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, the requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 62.21(c) and 62.22 of 
this part, must be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 62.25  Criteria for a Commission determination.

    (a) In making the determination required by Sec. 62.21(a) of this 
part, the Commission will determine whether the circumstances described 
in the request for emergency access create a serious and immediate 
threat to the public health and safety or the common defense and 
security.
    (b) In making the determination that a serious and immediate threat 
exists to the public health and safety, the Commission will consider, 
notwithstanding the availability of any alternative identified in Sec. 
62.13 of this part:

[[Page 239]]

    (1) The nature and extent of the radiation hazard that would result 
from the denial of emergency access, including consideration of--
    (i) The standards for radiation protection contained in part 20 of 
this chapter;
    (ii) Any standards governing the release of radioactive materials to 
the general environment that are applicable to the facility that 
generated the low level waste; and
    (iii) Any other Commission requirements specifically applicable to 
the facility or activity that is the subject of the emergency access 
request; and
    (2) The extent to which essential services affecting the public 
health and safety (such as medical, therapeutic, diagnostic, or research 
activities) will be disrupted by the denial of emergency access.
    (c) For purposes of granting temporary emergency access under Sec. 
62.23 of this part, the Commission will consider the criteria contained 
in the Commission's Policy Statement (45 FR 10950, February 24, 1977) 
for determining whether an event at a facility or activity licensed or 
otherwise regulated by the Commission is an abnormal occurrence within 
the purview of section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974.
    (d) In making the determination that a serious and immediate threat 
to the common defense and security exists, the Commission will consider, 
notwithstanding the availability of any alternative identified in Sec. 
62.13 of this part:
    (1) Whether the activity generating the wastes is necessary to the 
protection of the common defense and security, and
    (2) Whether the lack of access to a disposal site would result in a 
significant disruption in that activity that would seriously threaten 
the common defense and security.

The Commission will consider the views of the Department of Defense 
(DOD) and or the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding the importance of 
the activities responsible for generating the LLW to the common defense 
and security, when evaluating requests based all, or in part, on a 
serious and immediate threat to the common defense and security.
    (e) In making the determination required by Sec. 62.21(a)(2) of 
this part, the Commission will consider whether the person submitting 
the request--
    (1) Has identified and evaluated any alternative that could mitigate 
the need for emergency access; and
    (2) Has considered all pertinent factors in its evaluation of 
alternatives including state-of-the-art technology and impacts on public 
health and safety.
    (f) In making the determination required by Sec. 62.21(a)(2) of 
this part, the Commission will consider implementation of an alternative 
to be unreasonable if:
    (1) It adversely affects public health and safety, the environment, 
or the common defense and security; or
    (2) It results in a significant curtailment or cessation of 
essential services, affecting public health and safety or the common 
defense and security; or
    (3) It is beyond the technical and economic capabilities of the 
person requesting emergency access; or
    (4) Implementation of the alternative would conflict with applicable 
State or local or Federal laws and regulations; or
    (5) It cannot be implemented in a timely manner.
    (g) The Commission shall make an affirmative determination under 
Sec. 62.21(a) of this part only if all of the alternatives that were 
considered are found to be unreasonable.
    (h) As part of its mandated evaluation of the alternatives that were 
considered by the generator, the Commission shall consider the 
characteristics of the wastes (including: physical properties, chemical 
properties, radioactivity, pathogenicity, infectiousness, and toxicity, 
pyrophoricity, and explosive potential); condition of current container; 
potential for contaminating the disposal site; the technologies or 
combination of technologies available for treatment of the waste 
(including incinerators; evaporators-crystallizers; fluidized bed 
dryers; thin film evaporators; extruders, evaporators; and Compactors); 
the suitability of volume reduction equipment to the circumstances 
(specific activity considerations, actual volume reduction factors, 
generation of secondary wastes,

[[Page 240]]

equipment contamination, effluent releases, worker exposure, and 
equipment availability); and the administrative controls which could be 
applied, in making a determination whether waste to be delivered for 
disposal under this part has been reduced in volume to the maximum 
extent practicable using available technology.


<R05>
Sec. 62.26  Criteria for designating a disposal facility.

    (a) The Commission shall designate an appropriate non-Federal or 
regional disposal facility if an affirmative determination is made 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 62.21, 62.23, or 62.24 of this part.
    (b) The Commission will exclude a disposal facility from 
consideration if:
    (1) The low-level radioactive wastes of the generator do not meet 
the criteria established by the license agreement or the license 
agreement of the facility; or
    (2) The disposal facility is in excess of its approved capacity; or
    (3) Granting emergency access would delay the closing of the 
disposal facility pursuant to plans established before the receipt of 
the request for emergency access; or
    (4) The volume of waste requiring emergency access exceeds 20 
percent of the total volume of low-level radioactive waste accepted for 
disposal at the facility during the previous calendar year.
    (c) If, after applying the exclusionary criteria in paragraph (b) of 
this section, more than one disposal facility is identified as 
appropriate for designation, the Commission will then consider 
additional factors in designating a facility or facilities including--
    (1) Type of waste and its characteristics,
    (2) Previous disposal practices,
    (3) Transportation
    (4) Radiological effects,
    (5) Site capability for handling waste,
    (6) The volume of emergency access waste previously accepted by each 
site both for the particular year and overall, and
    (7) Any other considerations deemed appropriate by the Commission.
    (d) The Commission, in making its designation, will also consider 
any information submitted by the operating non-Federal or regional LLW 
disposal sites, or any information submitted by the public in response 
to a Federal Register notice requesting comment, as provided in 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 62.11 of this part.


<R04>
                Subpart D_Termination of Emergency Access


<R05>
Sec. 62.31  Termination of emergency access.

    (a) The Commission may terminate a grant of emergency access when 
emergency access is no longer necessary to eliminate an immediate threat 
to public health and safety or the common defense and security.
    (b) The Commission may terminate a grant of emergency access if an 
applicant has provided inaccurate information in its application for 
emergency access or if the applicant has failed to comply with this part 
or any conditions set by the Commission pursuant to this part.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 63.1  Purpose and scope.

    This part prescribes rules governing the licensing (including 
issuance of a construction authorization) of the U.S. Department of 
Energy to receive and possess source, special nuclear, and byproduct 
material at a geologic repository operations area sited, constructed, or 
operated at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, in accordance with the Nuclear Waste 
Policy Act of 1982, as amended, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. As 
provided in 10 CFR 60.1, the regulations in part 60 of this chapter do 
not apply to any activity licensed under another part of this chapter. 
This part also gives notice to all persons who knowingly provide to any 
licensee, applicant, contractor, or subcontractor, components, 
equipment, materials, or other goods or services, that relate to a 
licensee's or applicant's activities subject to this part, that they may 
be individually subject to NRC enforcement action for violation of Sec. 
63.11.

[69 FR 2280, Jan. 14, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 63.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Affected Indian Tribe means any Indian Tribe within whose 
reservation boundaries a repository for high-level radioactive waste or 
spent fuel is proposed to be located; or whose Federally-defined 
possessory or usage rights to other lands outside of the reservation's 
boundaries arising out of Congressionally-ratified treaties or other 
Federal law may be substantially and adversely affected by the location 
of the facility if the Secretary of the Interior finds, on the petition 
of the appropriate governmental officials of the Tribe, that the effects 
are both substantial and adverse to the Tribe.
    Barrier means any material, structure, or feature that, for a period 
to be determined by NRC, prevents or substantially reduces the rate of 
movement of water or radionuclides from the Yucca Mountain repository to 
the accessible environment, or prevents the release or substantially 
reduces the release rate of radionuclides from the waste. For example, a 
barrier may be a geologic feature, an engineered structure, a canister, 
a waste form with physical and chemical characteristics that 
significantly decrease the mobility of radionuclides, or a material 
placed over and around the waste, provided that the material 
substantially delays movement of water or radionuclides.
    Commencement of construction means clearing of land, surface or 
subsurface excavation, or other substantial action that would adversely 
affect the environment of a site. It does not include changes desirable 
for the temporary use of the land for public recreational uses, site 
characterization activities, other preconstruction monitoring and 
investigation necessary to establish background information related to 
the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site or to the protection of 
environmental values, or procurement or manufacture of components of the 
geologic repository operations area.

[[Page 243]]

    Commission means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its duly 
authorized representatives.
    Containment means the confinement of radioactive waste within a 
designated boundary.
    Design bases means that information that identifies the specific 
functions to be performed by a structure, system, or component of a 
facility and the specific values or ranges of values chosen for 
controlling parameters as reference bounds for design. These values may 
be constraints derived from generally accepted ``state-of-the-art'' 
practices for achieving functional goals or requirements derived from 
analysis (based on calculation or experiments) of the effects of a 
postulated event under which a structure, system, or component must meet 
its functional goals. The values for controlling parameters for external 
events include:
    (1) Estimates of severe natural events to be used for deriving 
design bases that will be based on consideration of historical data on 
the associated parameters, physical data, or analysis of upper limits of 
the physical processes involved; and
    (2) Estimates of severe external human-induced events to be used for 
deriving design bases, that will be based on analysis of human activity 
in the region, taking into account the site characteristics and the 
risks associated with the event.
    Director means the Director of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's 
Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.
    Disposal means the emplacement of radioactive waste in a geologic 
repository with the intent of leaving it there permanently.
    DOE means the U.S. Department of Energy or its duly authorized 
representatives.
    Engineered barrier system means the waste packages, including 
engineered components and systems other than the waste package (e.g., 
drip shields), and the underground facility.
    Event sequence means a series of actions and/or occurrences within 
the natural and engineered components of a geologic repository 
operations area that could potentially lead to exposure of individuals 
to radiation. An event sequence includes one or more initiating events 
and associated combinations of repository system component failures, 
including those produced by the action or inaction of operating 
personnel. Those event sequences that are expected to occur one or more 
times before permanent closure of the geologic repository operations 
area are referred to as Category 1 event sequences. Other event 
sequences that have at least one chance in 10,000 of occurring before 
permanent closure are referred to as Category 2 event sequences.
    Geologic repository means a system that is intended to be used for, 
or may be used for, the disposal of radioactive wastes in excavated 
geologic media. A geologic repository includes the engineered barrier 
system and the portion of the geologic setting that provides isolation 
of the radioactive waste.
    Geologic repository operations area means a high-level radioactive 
waste facility that is part of a geologic repository, including both 
surface and subsurface areas, where waste handling activities are

Sec. 63.9  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a 
Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission 
licensee or applicant, against an employee, for engaging in certain 
protected activities, is prohibited. Discrimination includes discharge 
and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 
section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in 
general are related to the administration or enforcement of a 
requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy 
Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission, or his or her employer, information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph 
(a) of this section or possible violations of requirements imposed under 
either of those aforementioned statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in paragraph (a) of this section, or under these 
requirements, if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section does not apply to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraph (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant may be 
grounds for--
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license;
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee, applicant, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of the licensee or applicant; or
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, that adversely affect 
an employee, may be predicated on nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.

[[Page 248]]

    (e)(1) Each licensee and each applicant for a license shall 
prominently post the revision of NRC Form 3, ``Notice to Employees,'' 
referenced in Sec. 19.11(c) of this chapter. This form must be posted 
at locations sufficient to permit employees protected by this section to 
observe a copy on the way to or from their place of work. Premises must 
be posted not later than 30 days after an application is docketed and 
remain posted while the application is pending before the Commission, 
during the term of the license, and for 30 days following license 
termination.
    (2) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in appendix D to part 20 of this chapter, by 
calling (301) 415-7232, via e-mail to FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov, or by 
accessing the NRC Web site at http://www.nrc.gov and selecting forms 
from the index found on the home page.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain 
any provision that would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an 
employee from participating in a protected activity as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including, but not limited to, 
providing information to NRC or to his or her employer on potential 
violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

testing with radioactive material, including radioactive tracers, the 
Commission shall determine whether the proposed use of such radioactive 
material is necessary to provide data for the preparation of the 
environmental reports required by law and for an application to be 
submitted under Sec. 63.22.
    (b) During the conduct of site characterization activities at the 
Yucca Mountain site, DOE shall report the nature and extent of the 
activities, the information that has been developed, and the progress of 
waste form and waste package research and development to the Commission 
not less than once every 6 months. The semiannual reports must include 
the results of site characterization studies, the identification of new 
issues, plans for additional studies to resolve new issues, elimination 
of planned studies no longer necessary, identification of decision 
points reached, and modifications to schedules, where appropriate. DOE 
shall also report its progress in developing the design of a geologic 
repository operations area appropriate for the area being characterized, 
noting when key design parameters or features that depend on the results 
of site characterization will be established. Other topics related to 
site characterization must also be covered if requested by the Director.
    (c) During the conduct of site characterization activities at the 
Yucca Mountain site, NRC staff shall be permitted to visit and inspect 
the locations at which such activities are carried out and to observe 
excavations, borings, and in situ tests, as they are done.

expressing current views on any aspect of site characterization or 
performance assessment at the Yucca Mountain site. In particular, the 
Director shall comment whenever he or she determines that there are 
substantial grounds for making recommendations or stating objections to 
DOE's site characterization program. The Director shall invite public 
comment on any comments that the Director makes to DOE on review of the 
DOE semiannual reports or on any other comments that the Director makes 
to DOE on site characterization and performance assessment by placing 
the comments in a public forum to allow the public to comment on them 
after the Director's comments are sent to DOE.
    (e) The Director shall transmit copies of all comments to DOE made 
by the Director under this section to the Governor and legislature of 
the State of Nevada and to the governing body of any affected Indian 
Tribe.
    (f) The NRC shall place all correspondence between DOE and NRC 
resulting from the requirements of this section, including the reports 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, in the Publicly Available 
Records System (PARS) Library.
    (g) The activities described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this 
section

    (3) A detailed description of the measures to be employed--such as 
land use controls, construction of monuments, and preservation of 
records--to regulate or prevent activities that could impair the long-
term isolation of emplaced waste within the geologic repository and to 
assure that relevant information will be preserved for the use of future 
generations. As a minimum, these measures must include:
    (i) Identification of the site and geologic repository operations 
area by monuments that have been designed, fabricated, and emplaced to 
be as permanent as is practicable;
    (ii) Placement of records in the archives and land record systems of 
local, State, and Federal government agencies, and archives elsewhere in 
the world, that would be likely to be consulted by potential human 
intruders--such records to identify the location of the geologic 
repository operations area, including the underground facility, 
boreholes, shafts and ramps, and the boundaries of the site, and the 
nature and hazard of the waste; and
    (iii) A program for continued oversight, to prevent any activity at 
the site that poses an unreasonable risk of

[[Page 259]]

breaching the geologic repository's engineered barriers; or increasing 
the exposure of individual members of the public to radiation beyond 
allowable limits.
    (4) Geologic, geophysical, geochemical, hydrologic, and other site 
data that are obtained during the operational period, pertinent to 
compliance with Sec. 63.113.
    (5) The results of tests, experiments, and any other analyses 
relating to backfill of excavated areas, shaft, borehole, or ramp 
sealing, drip shields, waste packages, interactions between natural and 
engineered systems, and any other tests, experiments, or analyses 
pertinent to compliance with Sec. 63.113.
    (6) Any substantial revision of plans for permanent closure.
    (7) Other information bearing on permanent closure that was not 
available at the time a license was issued.
    (b) If necessary, to take into account the environmental impact of 
any substantial changes in the permanent closure activities proposed to 
be carried out or any significant new information regarding the 
environmental impacts of permanent closure, DOE shall also supplement 
its environmental impact statement and submit this statement, as 
supplemented, with the application for license amendment.


<R05>
Sec. 63.52  Termination of license.

    (a) Following permanent closure and the decontamination or 
decontamination and dismantlement of surface facilities at the Yucca 
Mountain site, DOE may apply for an amendment to terminate the license.
    (b) The application must be filed and will be reviewed in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 63.45 and this section.
    (c) A license may be terminated only when the Commission finds with 
respect to the geologic repository:
    (1) That the final disposition of radioactive wastes has been made 
in conformance with DOE's plan, as amended and approved as part of the 
license.
    (2) That the final state of the geologic repository operations area 
conforms to DOE's plans for permanent closure and DOE's plans for the 
decontamination or decontamination and dismantlement of surface 
facilities, as amended and approved as part of the license.
    (3) That the termination of the license is authorized by law, 
including sections 57, 62, and 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended.

<R04>
                      Subpart E_Technical Criteria


<R05>
Sec. 63.101  Purpose and nature of findings.

    (a)(1) Subpart B prescribes the standards for issuance of a license 
to receive and possess source, special nuclear, or byproduct material at 
a geologic repository operations area at the Yucca Mountain site. In 
particular, Sec. 63.41(c) requires a finding that the issuance of a 
license will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the health and 
safety of the public. The purpose of this subpart is to set out the 
performance objectives for postclosure performance of the geologic 
repository and other criteria that, if satisfied, support a finding of 
no unreasonable risk. Postclosure performance objectives for the 
geologic repository include a requirement to limit radiological 
exposures to the reasonably maximally exposed individual, a requirement 
to limit releases of radionuclides to the accessible environment to 
protect ground water, and a requirement to limit radiological exposures 
to the reasonably maximally exposed individual in the event of human 
intrusion (see Sec. 63.113(b), (c), and (d), respectively).
    (2) Although the postclosure performance objectives specified at 
Sec. 63.113 are generally stated in unqualified terms,

[[Page 263]]

it is not expected that complete assurance that the requirements will be 
met can be presented. A reasonable expectation, on the basis of the 
record before the Commission, that the postclosure performance 
objectives will be met, is the general standard required. Proof that the 
geologic repository will conform with the objectives for postclosure 
performance is not to be had in the ordinary sense of the word because 
of the uncertainties inherent in the understanding of the evolution of 
the geologic setting, biosphere, and engineered barrier system. For such 
long-term performance, what is required is reasonable expectation, 
making allowance for the time period, hazards, and uncertainties 
involved, that the outcome will conform with the objectives for 
postclosure performance for the geologic repository. Demonstrating 
compliance will involve the use of complex predictive models that are 
supported by limited data from field and laboratory tests, site-specific 
monitoring, and natural analog studies that may be supplemented with 
prevalent expert judgment. Compliance demonstrations should not exclude 
important parameters from assessments and analyses simply because they 
are difficult to precisely quantify to a high degree of confidence. The 
performance assessments and analyses should focus upon the full range of 
defensible and reasonable parameter distributions rather than only upon 
extreme physical situations and parameter values. Further, in reaching a 
determination of reasonable expectation, the Commission may supplement 
numerical analyses with qualitative judgments including, for example, 
consideration of the degree of diversity among the multiple barriers as 
a measure of the resiliency of the geologic repository.
    (b) Subpart B lists findings that must be made in support of an 
authorization to construct a geologic repository operations area at the 
Yucca Mountain site. Prior to closure, Sec. 63.31(a)(1) requires a 
finding that there is reasonable assurance that the types and amounts of 
radioactive materials described in the application can be received, 
possessed, and stored in a geologic repository operations area of the 
design proposed without unreasonable risk to the health and safety of 
the public. After permanent closure, Sec. 63.31(a)(2) requires the 
Commission to consider whether there is a reasonable expectation the 
site and design comply with the postclosure performance objectives. Once 
again, although the criteria may be written in unqualified terms, the 
demonstration of compliance must take uncertainties and gaps in 
knowledge into account so that the Commission can make the specified 
finding with respect to paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 63.31.


<R05>
Sec. 63.102  Concepts.

    This section provides a functional overview of this Subpart E. In 
the event of any inconsistency, the definitions in Sec. 63.2 prevail.
    (a) The HLW facility at the Yucca Mountain site. NRC exercises 
licensing and related regulatory authority over those facilities 
described in section 202 (3) and (4) of the Energy Reorganization Act of 
1974, including the site at Yucca Mountain, as designated by the Energy 
Policy Act of 1992.
    (b) The geologic repository operations area. (1) These regulations 
deal with the exercise of authority with respect to a particular class 
of HLW facility--namely, a geologic repository operations area at Yucca 
Mountain.
    (2) A geologic repository operations area consists of those surface 
and subsurface areas of the site that are part of a geologic repository 
where radioactive waste handling activities are conducted. The 
underground structure, backfill materials, if any, and openings that 
penetrate the underground structure (e.g., ramps, shafts and boreholes, 
including their seals), are designated the underground facility.
    (3) The exercise of Commission authority requires that the geologic 
repository operations area be used for storage (which includes disposal) 
of high-level radioactive wastes (HLW).
    (4) HLW includes irradiated reactor fuel as well as reprocessing 
wastes. However, if DOE proposes to use the geologic repository 
operations area for storage of radioactive waste other than HLW, the 
storage of this radioactive waste is subject to the requirements of this 
part.

[[Page 264]]

    (c) Stages in the licensing process. There are several stages in the 
licensing process. The site characterization stage, when the performance 
confirmation program is started, begins before submission of a license 
application, and may result in consequences requiring evaluation in the 
license review. The construction stage would follow after the issuance 
of a construction authorization. A period of operations follows the 
Commission's issuance of a license. The period of operations includes 
the time during which emplacement of wastes occurs; any subsequent 
period before permanent closure during which the emplaced wastes are 
retrievable; and permanent closure, which includes sealing openings to 
the repository. Permanent closure represents the end of the performance 
confirmation program; final backfilling of the underground facility, if 
appropriate; and the sealing of shafts, ramps, and boreholes.
    (d) Areas related to isolation. Although the activities subject to 
regulation under this part are those to be carried out at the geologic 
repository operations area, the licensing process also considers 
characteristics of adjacent areas that are defined in other ways. There 
must be an area surrounding the geologic repository operations area, 
that could include either a portion or all of the site, within which DOE 
shall exercise specified controls to prevent adverse human actions after 
permanent closure. There is an area, designated the geologic setting, 
which includes the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical systems of the 
region in which the site and geologic repository operations area are 
located. The geologic repository operations area, plus the portion of 
the geologic setting that provides isolation of the radioactive waste, 
make up the geologic repository.
    (e) Performance objectives through permanent closure. Before 
permanent closure, the geologic repository operations area is required 
to limit radiation levels and radiological exposures, in both restricted 
and unrestricted areas, and releases of radioactive materials to 
unrestricted areas, as specified at Sec. 63.111(a).
    (f) Preclosure safety analysis. Section 63.111 includes performance 
objectives for the geologic repository operations area for the period 
before permanent closure and decontamination or permanent closure, 
decontamination, and dismantlement of surface facilities. The preclosure 
safety analysis is a systematic examination of the site; the design; and 
the potential hazards, initiating events and their resulting event 
sequences and potential radiological exposures to workers and the 
public. Initiating events are to be considered for inclusion in the 
preclosure safety analysis for determining event sequences only if they 
are reasonable (i.e., based on the characteristics of the geologic 
setting and the human environment, and consistent with precedents 
adopted for nuclear facilities with comparable or higher risks to 
workers and the public). The analysis identifies structures, systems, 
and components important to safety.
    (g) Performance objectives after permanent closure. After permanent 
closure, the geologic repository is required to:
    (1) Limit radiological exposures to the reasonably maximally exposed 
individual, as specified at Sec. 63.113(b);
    (2) Limit releases of radionuclides to the accessible environment to 
protect ground water, as specified at Sec. 63.113(c); and
    (3) Limit radiological exposures to the reasonably maximally exposed 
individual in the event of human intrusion, as specified at Sec. 
63.113(d).
    (h) Multiple barriers. Section 63.113(a) requires that the geologic 
repository include multiple barriers, both natural and engineered. 
Geologic disposal of HLW is predicated on the expectation that one or 
more aspects of the geologic setting will be capable of contributing to 
the isolation of radioactive waste and thus be a barrier important to 
waste isolation. Although there is an extensive geologic record ranging 
from thousands to millions of years, this record is subject to 
interpretation and includes many uncertainties. In addition, there are 
uncertainties in the isolation capability and performance of engineered 
barriers. Although the composition and configuration of engineered 
structures (barriers) can be defined with a degree of precision not 
possible for natural barriers, it is recognized that except for a few

[[Page 265]]

archaeologic and natural analogs, there is a limited experience base for 
the performance of complex, engineered structures over periods longer 
than a few hundred years, considering the uncertainty in characterizing 
and modeling individual barriers. These uncertainties are addressed by 
requiring the use of a multiple barrier approach; specifically, an 
engineered barrier system is required in addition to the natural 
barriers provided by the geologic setting. The performance assessment 
provides an evaluation of the repository performance based on credible 
models and parameters including the consideration of uncertainty in the 
behavior of the repository system. Thus the performance assessment 
results reflect the capability of each of the barriers to cope with a 
variety of challenges (e.g., combinations of parameters leading to less 
favorable performance for individual barriers and combinations of 
barriers). A description of each barrier's capability (e.g., retardation 
of radionuclides in the saturated zone, waste package lifetime, matrix 
diffusion in the unsaturated zone), as reflected in the performance 
assessment, provides an understanding of how the natural barriers and 
the engineered barrier system work in combination to enhance the 
resiliency of the geologic repository. The Commission believes that this 
understanding can increase confidence that the postclosure performance 
objectives specified at Sec. 63.113(b) and (c) will be achieved and 
that DOE's design includes a system of multiple barriers.
    (i) Reference biosphere and reasonably maximally exposed individual. 
The performance assessment will estimate the amount of radioactive 
material released to water or air at various locations and times in the 
future. To estimate the potential for future human exposures resulting 
from release of radioactive material from a geologic repository at Yucca 
Mountain, it is necessary to make certain assumptions about the location 
and characteristics of the reasonably maximally exposed individual. The 
environment inhabited by the reasonably maximally exposed individual, 
along with associated human exposure pathways and parameters, make up 
the reference biosphere, as described in Sec. 63.305. The reasonably 
maximally exposed individual, as a hypothetical person living in a 
community with characteristics of the Town of Amargosa Valley, is a 
representative person using water with average concentrations of 
radionuclides as described at Sec. 63.312. The reasonably maximally 
exposed individual is selected to represent those persons in the 
vicinity of Yucca Mountain who are reasonably expected to receive the 
greatest exposure to radioactive material released from a geologic 
repository at Yucca Mountain. Characteristics of the reference biosphere 
and the reasonably maximally exposed individual are to be based on 
current human behavior and biospheric conditions in the region, as 
described in Sec. 63.305 and Sec. 63.312.
    (j) Performance assessment. Demonstrating compliance with the 
postclosure performance objective specified at Sec. 63.113(b) requires 
a performance assessment to quantitatively estimate radiological 
exposures to the reasonably maximally exposed individual at any time 
during the compliance period. The performance assessment is a systematic 
analysis that identifies the features, events, and processes (i.e., 
specific conditions or attributes of the geologic setting, degradation, 
deterioration, or alteration processes of engineered barriers, and 
interactions between the natural and engineered barriers) that might 
affect performance of the geologic repository; examines their effects on 
performance; and estimates the radiological exposures to the reasonably 
maximally exposed individual. The features, events, and processes 
considered in the performance assessment should represent a wide range 
of both beneficial and potentially adverse effects on performance (e.g., 
beneficial effects of radionuclide sorption; potentially adverse effects 
of fracture flow or a criticality event). Those features, events, and 
processes expected to materially affect compliance with Sec. 63.113(b) 
or be potentially adverse to performance are included, while events 
(event classes or scenario classes) that are very unlikely (less than 
one chance in 10,000 over 10,000 years) can be excluded from the 
analysis. An event class consists of all possible specific initiating 
events that

[[Page 266]]

are caused by a common natural process (e.g., the event class for 
seismicity includes the range of credible earthquakes for the Yucca 
Mountain site). Radiological exposures to the reasonably maximally 
exposed individual are estimated using the selected features, events, 
and processes, and incorporating the probability that the estimated 
exposures will occur. Additionally, performance assessment methods are 
appropriate for use in demonstrating compliance with the postclosure 
performance objectives for ground-water protection and human intrusion, 
and are subject to the requirements for performance assessments 
specified at Sec. 63.114 and applicable criteria in Subpart L (e.g., 
criteria for evaluating compliance with ground-water protection and 
individual protection standards).
    (k) Institutional controls. Active and passive institutional 
controls will be maintained over the Yucca Mountain site, and are 
expected to reduce significantly, but not eliminate, the potential for 
human activity that could inadvertently cause or accelerate the release 
of radioactive material. However, because it is not possible to make 
scientifically sound forecasts of the long-term reliability of 
institutional controls, it is not appropriate to include consideration 
of human intrusion into a fully risk-based performance assessment for 
purposes of evaluating the ability of the geologic repository to achieve 
the performance objective at Sec. 63.113(b). Hence, human intrusion is 
addressed in a stylized manner as described in paragraph (l) of this 
section.
    (l) Human intrusion. In contrast to events unrelated to human 
activity, the probability and characteristics of human intrusion 
occurring many hundreds or thousands of years into the future cannot be 
estimated by examining either the historic or geologic record. Rather 
than speculating on the nature and probability of future intrusion, it 
is more useful to assess how resilient the geologic repository would be 
against a human intrusion event. Although the consequences of an assumed 
intrusion event would be a separate analysis, the analysis is similar to 
the performance assessment required by Sec. 63.113(b) but subject to 
specific requirements for evaluation of human intrusion specified at 
Sec. Sec. 63.321, 63.322 and 63.342 of subpart L of this part.
    (m) Performance confirmation. A performance confirmation program 
will be conducted to evaluate the adequacy of assumptions, data, and 
analyses that led to the findings that permitted construction of the 
repository and subsequent emplacement of the wastes. Key geotechnical 
and design parameters, including any interactions between natural and 
engineered systems and components, will be monitored throughout site 
characterization, construction, emplacement, and operation to identify 
any significant changes in the conditions assumed in the license 
application that may affect compliance with the performance objectives 
specified at Sec. 63.113(b) and (c).
    (n) Ground-water protection. Separate ground-water protection 
standards are designed to protect the ground water resources in the 
vicinity of Yucca Mountain. These standards, specified at Sec. 63.331, 
require the estimation of ground water concentrations in the 
representative volume of water. Depending on the radionuclide, the 
estimated concentrations must either be below a specified concentration 
or result in an annual, drinking water dose to the whole body or any 
organ of no greater than 0.04 mSv (4 mrem). Although the estimation of 
radionuclide concentrations in the representative volume would be a 
separate analysis, the analysis is similar to the performance assessment 
required by Sec. 63.113(b) but subject to specific requirements for 
evaluation of ground-water protection specified at Sec. Sec. 63.331, 
63.332 and 63.342 of subpart L of this part.
    (o) Implementation of TEDE. When external exposure is determined by 
measurement with an external personal monitoring device, the deep-dose 
equivalent must be used in place of the effective dose equivalent, 
unless the effective dose equivalent is determined by a dosimetry method 
approved by the NRC. The assigned deep-dose equivalent must be for the 
part of the body receiving the highest exposure. The assigned shallow-
dose equivalent must be the dose averaged over the contiguous 10 square 
centimeters of skin receiving the highest exposure. The radiation

[[Page 267]]

and organ or tissue weighting factors in Appendix A of 40 CFR part 197 
are to be used to calculate TEDE. After the effective date of this 
regulation, the Commission may allow DOE to use updated factors, which 
have been issued by consensus scientific organizations and incorporated 
by EPA into Federal radiation guidance. Additionally, as scientific 
models and methodologies for estimating doses are updated, DOE may use 
the most current and appropriate (e.g., those accepted by the 
International Commission on Radiological Protection) scientific models 
and methodologies to calculate the TEDE. The weighting factors used in 
the calculation of TEDE must be consistent with the methodology used to 
perform the calculation.

                    Preclosure Performance Objectives


<R05>
Sec. 63.111  Performance objectives for the geologic repository 
operations area through permanent closure.

    (a) Protection against radiation exposures and releases of 
radioactive material. (1) The geologic repository operations area must 
meet the requirements of part 20 of this chapter.
    (2) During normal operations, and for Category 1 event sequences, 
the annual TEDE (hereafter referred to as ``dose'') to any real member 
of the public located beyond the boundary of the site may not exceed the 
preclosure standard specified at Sec. 63.204.
    (b) Numerical guides for design objectives. (1) The geologic 
repository operations area must be designed so that, taking into 
consideration Category 1 event sequences and until permanent closure has 
been completed, the aggregate radiation exposures and the aggregate 
radiation levels in both restricted and unrestricted areas, and the 
aggregate releases of radioactive materials to unrestricted areas, will 
be maintained within the limits specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (2) The geologic repository operations area must be designed so 
that, taking into consideration any single Category 2 event sequence and 
until permanent closure has been completed, no individual located on, or 
beyond, any point on the boundary of the site will receive, as a result 
of the single Category 2 event sequence, the more limiting of a TEDE of 
0.05 Sv (5 rem), or the sum of the deep dose equivalent and the 
committed dose equivalent to any individual organ or tissue (other than 
the lens of the eye) of 0.5 Sv (50 rem). The lens dose equivalent may 
not exceed 0.15 Sv (15 rem), and the shallow dose equivalent to skin may 
not exceed 0.5 Sv (50 rem).
    (c) Preclosure safety analysis. A preclosure safety analysis of the 
geologic repository operations area that meets the requirements 
specified at Sec. 63.112 must be performed. This analysis must 
demonstrate that:
    (1) The requirements of Sec. 63.111(a) will be met; and
    (2) The design meets the requirements of Sec. 63.111(b).
    (d) Performance confirmation. The geologic repository operations 
area must be designed so as to permit implementation of a performance 
confirmation program that meets the requirements of subpart F of this 
part.
    (e) Retrievability of waste. (1) The geologic repository operations 
area must be designed to preserve the option of waste retrieval 
throughout the period during which wastes are being emplaced and 
thereafter, until the completion of a performance confirmation program 
and Commission review of the information obtained from such a program. 
To satisfy this objective, the geologic repository operations area must 
be designed so that any or all of the emplaced waste could be retrieved 
on a reasonable schedule starting at any time up to 50 years after waste 
emplacement operations are initiated, unless a different time period is 
approved or specified by the Commission. This different time period may 
be established on a case-by-case basis consistent with the emplacement 
schedule and the planned performance confirmation program.
    (2) This requirement may not preclude decisions by the Commission to 
allow backfilling part, or all of, or permanent closure of the geologic 
repository operations area, before the end of the period of design for 
retrievability.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, a reasonable 
schedule for

[[Page 268]]

retrieval is one that would permit retrieval in about the same time as 
that required to construct the geologic repository operations area and 
emplace waste.

specific, naturally occurring and human-induced hazards in the safety 
analysis;
    (e) An analysis of the performance of the structures, systems, and 
components to identify those that are important to safety. This analysis 
identifies and describes the controls that are relied on to limit or 
prevent potential event sequences or mitigate their consequences. This 
analysis also identifies measures taken to ensure the availability of 
safety systems. The analysis required in this paragraph must include, 
but not necessarily be limited to, consideration of--
    (1) Means to limit concentration of radioactive material in air;
    (2) Means to limit the time required to perform work in the vicinity 
of radioactive materials;
    (3) Suitable shielding;
    (4) Means to monitor and control the dispersal of radioactive

    (13) Means to inspect, test, and maintain structures, systems, and 
components important to safety, as necessary, to ensure their continued 
functioning and readiness.
    (f) A description and discussion of the design, both surface and 
subsurface, of the geologic repository operations area, including--
    (1) The relationship between design criteria and the requirements 
specified at Sec. 63.111(a) and (b); and
    (2) The design bases and their relation to the design criteria.

                   Postclosure Performance Objectives


<R05>
Sec. 63.113  Performance objectives for the geologic repository after
permanent closure.

    (a) The geologic repository must include multiple barriers, 
consisting of both natural barriers and an engineered barrier system.
    (b) The engineered barrier system must be designed so that, working 
in combination with natural barriers, radiological exposures to the 
reasonably maximally exposed individual are within the limits specified 
at Sec. 63.311 of subpart L of this part. Compliance with this 
paragraph must be demonstrated through a performance assessment that

[[Page 269]]

meets the requirements specified at Sec. 63.114 of this subpart, and 
Sec. Sec. 63.303, 63.305, 63.312 and 63.342 of Subpart L of this part.
    (c) The engineered barrier system must be designed so that, working 
in combination with natural barriers, releases of radionuclides into the 
accessible environment are within the limits specified at Sec. 63.331 
of subpart L of this part. Compliance with this paragraph must be 
demonstrated through a performance assessment that meets the 
requirements specified at Sec. 63.114 of this subpart and Sec. Sec. 
63.303, 63.332 and 63.342 of subpart L of this part.
    (d) The ability of the geologic repository to limit radiological 
exposures to the reasonably maximally exposed individual, in the event 
of human intrusion into the engineered barrier system, must be 
demonstrated through an analysis that meets the requirements at 
Sec. Sec. 63.321 and 63.322 of subpart L of this part. Estimating 
radiological exposures to the reasonably maximally exposed individual 
requires a performance assessment that meets the requirements specified 
at Sec. 63.114 of this subpart, and Sec. Sec. 63.303, 63.305, 63.312 
and 63.342 of subpart L of this part.

                   Postclosure Performance Assessment


<R05>
Sec. 63.114  Requirements for performance assessment.

    (a) Any performance assessment used to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 63.113 for 10,000 years after disposal must:
    (1) Include data related to the geology, hydrology, and geochemistry 
(including disruptive processes and events) of the Yucca Mountain site, 
and the surrounding region to the extent necessary, and information on 
the design of the engineered barrier system used to define, for 10,000 
years after disposal, parameters and conceptual models used in the 
assessment.
    (2) Account for uncertainties and variabilities in parameter values, 
for 10,000 years after disposal, and provide for the technical basis for 
parameter ranges, probability distributions, or bounding values used in 
the performance assessment.
    (3) Consider alternative conceptual models of features and 
processes, for 10,000 years after disposal, that are consistent with 
available data and current scientific understanding and evaluate the 
effects that alternative conceptual models have on the performance of 
the geologic repository.
    (4) Consider only features, events, and processes consistent with 
the limits on performance assessment specified at Sec. 63.342.
    (5) Provide the technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of 
specific features, events, and processes in the performance assessment. 
Specific features, events, and processes must be evaluated in detail if 
the magnitude and time of the resulting radiological exposures to the 
reasonably maximally exposed individual, or radionuclide releases to the 
accessible environment, for 10,000 years after disposal, would be 
significantly changed by their omission.
    (6) Provide the technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of 
degradation, deterioration, or alteration processes of engineered 
barriers in the performance assessment, including those processes that 
would adversely affect the performance of natural barriers. Degradation, 
deterioration, or alteration processes of engineered barriers must be 
evaluated in detail if the magnitude and time of the resulting 
radiological exposures to the reasonably maximally exposed individual, 
or radionuclide releases to the accessible environment, for 10,000 years 
after disposal, would be significantly changed by their omission.
    (7) Provide the technical basis for models used to represent the 
10,000 years after disposal in the performance assessment, such as 
comparisons made with outputs of detailed process-level models and/or 
empirical observations (e.g., laboratory testing, field investigations, 
and natural analogs).
    (b) The performance assessment methods used to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are considered sufficient 
for the performance assessment for the period of time after 10,000 years 
and through the period of geologic stability.

    (iii) All other rights arising under lease, rights of entry, deed, 
patent, mortgage, appropriation, prescription, or otherwise.
    (b) Additional controls for permanent closure. Appropriate controls 
must be established outside of the geologic repository operations area. 
DOE shall exercise any jurisdiction and control over surface and 
subsurface estates necessary to prevent adverse human actions that could 
significantly reduce the geologic repository's ability to achieve 
isolation. The rights of DOE may take the form of appropriate possessory 
interests, servitudes, or withdrawals from location or patent under the 
general mining laws.
    (c) Additional controls through permanent closure. Appropriate 
controls must be established outside the geologic repository operations 
area. DOE shall exercise any jurisdiction or control of activities 
necessary to ensure the requirements at Sec. 63.111(a) and (b) are met. 
Control includes the authority to exclude members of the public, if 
necessary.
    (d) Water rights. (1) DOE shall also have obtained such water rights 
as may be needed to accomplish the purpose of the geologic repository 
operations area.
    (2) Water rights are included in the additional controls to be 
established under paragraph (b) of this section.


<R04>
               Subpart F_Performance Confirmation Program


<R05>
Sec. 63.131  General requirements.

    (a) The performance confirmation program must provide data that 
indicate, where practicable, whether:
    (1) Actual subsurface conditions encountered and changes in those 
conditions during construction and waste emplacement operations are 
within the limits assumed in the licensing review; and

repository operation, and that are designed or assumed to operate as 
barriers after permanent closure, are functioning as intended and 
anticipated.
    (b) The program must have been started during site characterization, 
and it will continue until permanent closure.
    (c) The program must include in situ monitoring, laboratory and 
field testing, and in situ experiments, as may be appropriate to provide 
the data required by paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) The program must be implemented so that:
    (1) It does not adversely affect the ability of the geologic and 
engineered elements of the geologic repository to meet the performance 
objectives.
    (2) It provides baseline information and analysis of that 
information on those parameters and natural processes pertaining to the 
geologic setting that

[[Page 271]]

may be changed by site characterization, construction, and operational 
activities.
    (3) It monitors and analyzes changes from the baseline condition of 
parameters that could affect the performance of a geologic repository.


<R05>
Sec. 63.132  Confirmation of geotechnical and design parameters.

    (a) During repository construction and operation, a continuing 
program of surveillance, measurement, testing, and geologic mapping must 
be conducted to ensure that geotechnical and design parameters are

    (d) These measurements and observations must be compared with the 
original design bases and assumptions. If significant differences exist 
between the measurements and observations and the original design bases 
and assumptions, the need for modifications to the design or in 
construction methods must be determined and these differences, their 
significance to repository performance, and the recommended changes 
reported to the Commission.
    (e) In situ monitoring of the thermomechanical response of the 
underground facility must be conducted until permanent closure, to 
ensure that the performance of the geologic and engineering features is 
within design limits.


<R05>

    (a) During the early or developmental stages of construction, a 
program for testing of engineered systems and components used in the 
design, such as, for example, borehole and shaft seals, backfill, and 
drip shields, as well as the thermal interaction effects of the waste 
packages, backfill, drip shields, rock, and unsaturated zone and 
saturated zone water, must be conducted.
    (b) The testing must be initiated as early as practicable.
    (c) If backfill is included in the repository design, a test must be 
conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of backfill placement and 
compaction procedures against design requirements before permanent 
backfill placement is begun.
    (d) Tests must be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of 
borehole, shaft, and ramp seals before full-scale operation proceeds to 
seal boreholes, shafts, and ramps.


<R05>
Sec. 63.134  Monitoring and testing waste packages.

<R04>
                       Subpart G_Quality Assurance


<R05>
Sec. 63.141  Scope.

    As used in this part, quality assurance comprises all those planned 
and systematic actions necessary to provide adequate confidence that the 
geologic repository and its structures, systems,

[[Page 272]]

or components will perform satisfactorily in service. Quality assurance 
includes quality control, which comprises those quality assurance 
actions related to the physical characteristics of a material, 
structure, component, or system that provide a means to control the 
quality of the material, structure, component, or system to 
predetermined requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 63.142  Quality assurance criteria.

    (a) Introduction and Applicability. DOE is required by Sec. 
63.21(c)(20) to include in its safety analysis report a description of 
the quality assurance program to be applied to all structures, systems, 
and components important to safety, to design and characterization of 
barriers important to waste isolation, and to related activities. These 
activities include: site characterization; acquisition, control, and 
analyses of samples and data; tests and experiments; scientific studies; 
facility and equipment design and construction; facility operation; 
performance confirmation; permanent closure; and decontamination and 
dismantling of surface facilities. The description must indicate how the 
applicable quality assurance requirements will be satisfied. DOE shall 
include information pertaining to the managerial and administrative 
controls to be used to ensure safe operation in its safety analysis 
report. High-level waste repositories include structures, systems, and 
components that prevent or mitigate the consequences of postulated event 
sequences or that are important to waste isolation capabilities that 
could cause undue risk to the health and safety of the public. The 
pertinent requirements of this subpart apply to all activities that are 
important to waste isolation and important to safety functions of those 
structures, systems, and components. These activities include designing, 
purchasing, fabricating, handling, shipping, storing, cleaning, 
erecting, installing, inspecting, testing, operating, maintaining, 
repairing, modifying, site characterization, performance confirmation, 
permanent closure, decontamination, and dismantling of surface 
facilities.
    (b) Organization. DOE shall establish and execute a quality 
assurance program. DOE may delegate to others, such as contractors, 
agents, or consultants, the work of establishing and executing the 
quality assurance program, or any part of it, but DOE retains 
responsibility for it.
    (1) The authority and duties of persons and organizations performing 
activities affecting the functions of structures, systems, and 
components that are important to waste isolation and important to safety 
must be clearly established and delineated in writing. These activities 
include both the performing functions of attaining quality objectives 
and the quality assurance functions. The quality assurance functions are 
those of:
    (i) Assuring that an appropriate quality assurance program is 
established and effectively executed; and
    (ii) Verifying that activities important to waste isolation and 
important to safety functions have been correctly performed by checking, 
auditing, and inspection of structures, systems, and components.
    (2) The persons and organizations performing quality assurance 
functions shall have sufficient authority and organizational freedom to 
identify quality problems; to initiate, recommend, or provide solutions; 
and to verify implementation of solutions. The persons and organizations 
performing quality assurance functions shall report to a management 
level so that the required authority and organizational freedom, 
including sufficient independence from cost and schedule when opposed to 
safety considerations, are provided.
    (3) Because of the many variables involved, such as the number of 
personnel, the type of activity being performed, and the location or 
locations where activities are performed, the organizational structure 
for executing the quality assurance program may take various forms 
provided that the persons and organizations assigned the quality 
assurance functions have this required authority and organizational 
freedom. Irrespective of the organizational structure, the individual(s) 
assigned the responsibility for assuring effective execution of any 
portion of the quality assurance program at any location where 
activities subject to 10 CFR part 63 are being performed must

[[Page 273]]

have direct access to the levels of management as may be necessary to 
perform this function.
    (c) Quality assurance program. DOE shall establish a quality 
assurance program that complies with the requirements of this subpart at 
the earliest practicable time, consistent with the schedule for 
accomplishing the activities. This program must be documented by written 
policies, procedures, or instructions and must be carried out throughout 
facility life in accordance with those policies, procedures, or 
instructions.
    (1) DOE shall identify the structures, systems, and components to be 
covered by the quality assurance program and the major organizations 
participating in the program, together with the designated functions of 
these organizations. The quality assurance program must control 
activities affecting the quality of the identified structures, systems, 
and components, to an extent consistent with their importance to safety.
    (2) Activities affecting quality must be accomplished under suitably 
controlled conditions. Controlled conditions include the use of 
appropriate equipment; suitable environmental conditions for 
accomplishing the activity, such as adequate cleanness; and assurance 
that all prerequisites for the given activity have been satisfied.
    (3) The program must take into account the need for special 
controls, processes, test equipment, tools, and skills to attain the 
required quality, and the need for verification of quality by inspection 
and test. The program must provide for indoctrination and training of 
personnel performing activities affecting quality as necessary to assure 
that suitable proficiency is achieved and maintained.
    (4) DOE shall regularly review the status and adequacy of the 
quality assurance program. Management of other organizations 
participating in the quality assurance program shall regularly review 
the status and adequacy of that part of the quality assurance program 
which they are executing.
    (d) Design control. (1) DOE shall establish measures to assure that 
applicable regulatory requirements and the design basis, as defined in 
Sec. 63.2 and as specified in the license application, for those 
structures, systems, and components to which this subpart applies, are 
correctly translated into specifications, drawings, procedures, and 
instructions. These measures must assure that appropriate quality 
standards are specified and included in design documents and that 
deviations from such standards are controlled. Measures must also be 
established for the selection and review for suitability of application 
of materials, parts, equipment, and processes that are important to 
waste isolation and important to safety functions of the structures, 
systems and components.
    (2) DOE shall establish measures to identify and control design 
interfaces and for coordination among participating design 
organizations. These measures must include the establishment of 
procedures among participating design organizations for the review, 
approval, release, distribution, and revision of documents involving 
design interfaces.
    (i) The design control measures must provide for verifying or 
checking the adequacy of design, such as by the performance of design 
reviews, by the use of alternate or simplified calculational methods, or 
by the performance of a suitable testing program. The verifying or 
checking process must be performed by individuals or groups other than 
those who performed the original design. These individuals may be from 
the same organization. If a test program is used to verify the adequacy 
of a specific design feature in lieu of other verifying or checking 
processes, it must include suitable qualifications testing of a 
prototype unit under the most adverse design conditions. Design control 
measures must be applied to items such as: criticality physics, stress, 
thermal, hydraulic, and preclosure and postclosure analyses; 
compatibility of materials; accessibility for inservice inspection, 
maintenance and repair; and delineation of acceptance criteria for 
inspections and tests.
    (ii) Design changes, including field changes, must be subject to 
design control measures commensurate with those applied to the original 
design and be approved by the organization that

[[Page 274]]

performed the original design unless the applicant designates another 
responsible organization.
    (e) Procurement document control. DOE shall establish measures to 
assure that applicable regulatory requirements, design bases, and other 
requirements necessary to assure adequate quality are suitably included 
or referenced in the documents for procurement of material, equipment, 
and services, whether purchased by the licensee or applicant or by its 
contractors or subcontractors. To the extent necessary, procurement 
documents must require contractors or subcontractors to provide a 
quality assurance program consistent with the pertinent provisions of 
this section.
    (f) Instructions, procedures, and drawings. Activities affecting 
quality must be prescribed by documented instructions, procedures, or 
drawings of a type appropriate to the circumstances and must be 
accomplished in accordance with these instructions, procedures, or 
drawings. Instructions, procedures, or drawings must include appropriate 
quantitative or qualitative acceptance criteria for determining that 
important activities have been satisfactorily accomplished.
    (g) Document control. DOE shall establish measures to control the 
issuance of documents, such as instructions, procedures, and drawings, 
including changes to them that prescribe all activities affecting 
quality. These measures must assure that documents, including changes, 
are reviewed for adequacy and approved for release by authorized 
personnel and are distributed to and used at the location where the 
prescribed activity is performed. Changes to documents must be reviewed 
and approved by the same organizations that performed the original 
review and approval unless the applicant designates another responsible 
organization.
    (h) Control of purchased material, equipment, and services. DOE 
shall establish measures to assure that purchased material, equipment, 
and services, whether purchased directly or through contractors and 
subcontractors, conform to the procurement documents.
    (1) These measures must include appropriate provisions for source 
evaluation and selection, objective evidence of quality furnished by the 
contractor or subcontractor, inspection at the contractor or 
subcontractor source, and examination of products upon delivery.
    (2) Documentary evidence that material and equipment conform to the 
procurement requirements must be available at the high-level waste 
repository site before the material and equipment are installed or used. 
This documentary evidence must be retained at the high-level waste 
repository site and be sufficient to identify the specific requirements, 
such as codes, standards, or specifications, met by the purchased 
material and equipment.
    (3) The effectiveness of the control of quality by contractors and 
subcontractors must be assessed by the licensee or applicant or designee 
at intervals consistent with the importance, complexity, and quantity of 
the product or services.
    (i) Identification and control of materials, parts, and components. 
Measures must be established for the identification and control of 
materials, parts, and components, including partially fabricated 
assemblies. These measures must assure that identification of the item 
is maintained by heat number, part number, serial number, or other 
appropriate means, either on the item or on records traceable to the 
item, as required throughout fabrication, erection, installation, and 
use of the item. These identification and control measures must be 
designed to prevent the use of incorrect or defective material, parts, 
and components.
    (j) Control of special processes. DOE shall establish measures to 
assure that special processes, including welding, heat treating, and 
nondestructive testing, are controlled and accomplished by qualified 
personnel using qualified procedures in accordance with applicable 
codes, standards, specifications, criteria, and other special 
requirements.
    (k) Inspection. DOE shall establish and execute a program for 
inspection of activities affecting quality to verify conformance with 
the documented instructions, procedures, and drawings

[[Page 275]]

for accomplishing the activity. The inspection must be performed by 
individuals other than those who performed the activity being inspected.
    (1) Examinations, measurements, or tests of material or products 
processed must be performed for each work operation where necessary to 
assure quality. If inspection of processed material or products is 
impossible or disadvantageous, indirect control by monitoring processing 
methods, equipment, and personnel must be provided. Both inspection and 
process monitoring must be provided when control is inadequate without 
both.
    (2) If mandatory inspection hold points that require witnessing or 
inspecting by the applicant's designated representative and beyond which 
work may not proceed without the consent of its designated 
representative are required, the specific hold points must be indicated 
in appropriate documents.
    (l) Test control. DOE shall establish a test program to assure that 
all testing required to demonstrate that structures, systems, and 
components important to safety will perform satisfactorily in service is 
identified and performed in accordance with written test procedures 
which incorporate the requirements and acceptance limits contained in 
applicable design documents.
    (1) The test program must include, as appropriate, proof tests prior 
to installation, preoperational tests, and operational tests during 
repository operation, of structures, systems, and components.
    (2) Test procedures must include provisions for assuring that all 
prerequisites for the given test have been met, that adequate test 
instrumentation is available and used, and that the test is performed 
under suitable environmental conditions.
    (3) Test results must be documented and evaluated to assure that 
test requirements have been satisfied.
    (m) Control of measuring and test equipment. DOE shall establish 
measures to assure that tools, gages, instruments, and other measuring 
and testing devices used in activities affecting quality are properly 
controlled, calibrated, and adjusted at specified periods to maintain 
accuracy within necessary limits.
    (n) Handling, storage, and shipping. DOE shall establish measures to 
control the handling, storage, shipping, cleaning and preservation of 
material and equipment in accordance with work and inspection 
instructions to prevent damage or deterioration. When necessary for 
particular products, special protective environments, such as inert gas 
atmosphere, specific moisture content levels, and temperature levels, 
must be specified and provided.
    (o) Inspection, test, and operating status. DOE shall establish 
measures to indicate the status of inspections and tests performed on 
individual items of the high-level waste repository by markings such as 
stamps, tags, labels, routing cards, or other suitable means. These 
measures must provide for the identification of items that have 
satisfactorily passed required inspections and tests, where necessary to 
preclude inadvertent bypassing of such inspections and tests. Measures 
must also be established for indicating the operating status of 
structures, systems, and components of the high-level waste repository, 
such as by tagging valves and switches, to prevent inadvertent 
operation.
    (p) Nonconforming materials, parts, or components. DOE shall 
establish measures to control materials, parts, or components which do 
not conform to requirements in order to prevent their inadvertent use or 
installation. These measures must include, as appropriate, procedures 
for identification, documentation, segregation, disposition, and 
notification to affected organizations. Nonconforming items must be 
reviewed and accepted, rejected, repaired or reworked in accordance with 
documented procedures.
    (q) Corrective action. DOE shall establish measures to assure that 
conditions adverse to quality, such as failures, malfunctions, 
deficiencies, deviations, defective material and equipment, and 
nonconformances are promptly identified and corrected. If significant 
conditions are adverse to quality, the measures must assure that the 
cause of the condition is determined and corrective action taken to 
preclude repetition. The identification of the significant condition 
adverse to quality, the cause

[[Page 276]]

of the condition, and the corrective action taken must be documented and 
reported to appropriate levels of management.
    (r) Quality assurance records. DOE shall maintain sufficient records 
to furnish evidence of activities affecting quality.
    (1) The records must include at least the following: Operating logs 
and the results of reviews, inspections, tests, audits, monitoring of 
work performance, and materials analyses.
    (2) The records must also include closely-related data such as 
qualifications of personnel, procedures, and equipment.
    (3) Inspection and test records must, at a minimum, identify the 
inspector or data recorder, the type of observation, the results, the 
acceptability, and the action taken in connection with any deficiencies 
noted.
    (4) Records must be identifiable and retrievable. Consistent with 
applicable regulatory requirements, the applicant shall establish 
requirements concerning record retention, such as duration, location, 
and assigned responsibility.
    (s) Audits. DOE shall carry out a comprehensive system of planned 
and periodic audits to verify compliance with all aspects of the quality 
assurance program and to determine the effectiveness of the program. The 
audits must be performed in accordance with the written procedures or 
check lists by appropriately trained personnel not having direct 
responsibilities in the areas being audited. Audit results must be 
documented and reviewed by management having responsibility in the area 
audited. Followup action, including reaudit of deficient areas, must be 
taken where indicated.

criteria required by Sec. 63.142.


<R05>
Sec. 63.144  Quality assurance program change.

    Changes to DOE's NRC-approved Safety Analysis Report quality 
assurance program description are processed as follows:
    (a) DOE may change a previously accepted quality assurance program 
description included or referenced in the Safety Analysis Report without 
prior NRC approval, if the change does not reduce the commitments in the 
program description previously accepted by the NRC. Changes to the 
quality assurance program description that do not reduce the commitments 
must be submitted every 24 months, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section. In addition to quality assurance program changes 
involving administrative improvements and clarifications, spelling 
corrections, punctuation, or editorial items, the following changes are 
not considered reductions in commitment:
    (1) The use of a quality assurance standard approved by the NRC 
which is more recent than the quality assurance standard in DOE's 
current quality assurance program at the time of the change;
    (2) The use of generic organizational position titles that clearly 
denote the position function, supplemented as necessary by descriptive 
text, rather than specific titles;
    (3) The use of generic organizational charts to indicate functional 
relationships, authorities, and responsibilities, or alternatively, the 
use of descriptive text;
    (4) The elimination of quality assurance program information that 
duplicates language in quality assurance regulatory guides and quality 
assurance standards to which the licensee is committed; and
    (5) Organizational revisions that ensure that persons and 
organizations performing quality assurance functions continue to have 
the requisite authority and organizational freedom, including sufficient 
independence from cost and schedule when opposed to safety 
considerations.
    (b) DOE shall submit changes made to the NRC-accepted Safety 
Analysis Report quality assurance program description that do reduce the 
commitments to the NRC and receive NRC approval prior to implementation, 
as follows:

[[Page 277]]

    (1) By an appropriate method listed in Sec. 63.4 of this chapter, 
the signed document must be submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, addressed: ATTN: Document Control Desk; Director, Office of 
Nuclear Material and Safeguards; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555-0001, and one copy to the appropriate NRC Resident 
Inspector, if one has been assigned to the site or facility.
    (2) The submittal of a change to the Safety Analysis Report quality 
assurance program description must include all pages affected by that 
change and must be accompanied by a forwarding letter identifying the 
change, the reason for the change, and the basis for concluding that the 
revised program incorporating the change continues to describe how the 
requirements of Sec. 63.142 will be satisfied and continues to satisfy 
the criteria of Sec. 63.142 and the Safety Analysis Report quality 
assurance program description previously accepted by the NRC (the letter 
need not provide the basis for changes that correct spelling, 
punctuation, or editorial items).
    (3) DOE shall maintain records of quality assurance program changes 
that do reduce commitments.

    Disposal means the emplacement of radioactive material into the 
Yucca Mountain disposal system with the intent of isolating it for as 
long as reasonably possible and with no intent of recovery, whether or 
not the design of the disposal system permits the ready recovery of the 
material. Disposal of radioactive material in the Yucca Mountain 
disposal system begins when all of the ramps and other openings into the 
Yucca Mountain repository are sealed.
    Ground water means water that is below the land surface and in a 
saturated zone.
    Human intrusion means breaching of any portion of the Yucca Mountain 
disposal system, within the repository footprint, by any human activity.
    Passive institutional controls means:

in water as determined by use of the method specified in 40 CFR part 
136.
    Undisturbed performance means that human intrusion or the occurrence 
of unlikely natural features, events, and processes do not disturb the 
disposal system.
    Undisturbed Yucca Mountain disposal system means that the Yucca 
Mountain disposal system is not affected by human intrusion.
    Waste means any radioactive material emplaced for disposal into the 
Yucca Mountain repository.
    Well-capture zone means the volume from which a well pumping at a 
defined rate is withdrawing water from an aquifer. The dimensions of the

<R05>
Sec. 63.303  Implementation of Subpart L.

    (a) Compliance is based upon the arithmetic mean of the projected 
doses from DOE's performance assessments for the period within 1 million 
years after disposal, with:
    (1) Sections 63.311(a)(1) and 63.311(a)(2); and
    (2) Sections 63.321(b)(1), 63.321(b)(2), and 63.331, if performance 
assessment is used to demonstrate compliance with either or both of 
these sections.
    (b) [Reserved]

[74 FR 10829, Mar. 13, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 63.304  Reasonable expectation.

    Reasonable expectation means that the Commission is satisfied that 
compliance will be achieved based upon the full record before it. 
Characteristics of reasonable expectation include that it:
    (1) Requires less than absolute proof because absolute proof is 
impossible to attain for disposal due to the uncertainty of projecting 
long-term performance;
    (2) Accounts for the inherently greater uncertainties in making 
long-term projections of the performance of the Yucca Mountain disposal 
system;
    (3) Does not exclude important parameters from assessments and 
analyses simply because they are difficult to precisely quantify to a 
high degree of confidence; and
    (4) Focuses performance assessments and analyses on the full range 
of defensible and reasonable parameter distributions rather than only 
upon extreme physical situations and parameter values.


<R05>
Sec. 63.305  Required characteristics of the reference biosphere.

    (a) Features, events, and processes that describe the reference 
biosphere must be consistent with present knowledge of the conditions in 
the region surrounding the Yucca Mountain site.
    (b) DOE should not project changes in society, the biosphere (other 
than climate), human biology, or increases or decreases of human 
knowledge or technology. In all analyses done to demonstrate compliance 
with this part, DOE must assume that all of those factors remain 
constant as they are at the time of submission of the license 
application.
    (c) DOE must vary factors related to the geology, hydrology, and 
climate based upon cautious, but reasonable assumptions of the changes 
in these factors that could affect the Yucca Mountain disposal system 
during the period of geologic stability, consistent with the 
requirements for performance assessments specified at Sec. 63.342.
    (d) Biosphere pathways must be consistent with arid or semi-arid 
conditions.

               Postclosure Individual Protection Standard


<R05>
Sec. 63.311  Individual protection standard after permanent closure.

    (a) DOE must demonstrate, using performance assessment, that there 
is a reasonable expectation that the reasonably maximally exposed 
individual receives no more than the following annual dose from releases 
from the undisturbed Yucca Mountain disposal system:
    (1) 0.15 mSv (15 mrem) for 10,000 years following disposal; and
    (2) 1.0 mSv (100 mrem) after 10,000 years, but within the period of 
geologic stability.
    (b) DOE's performance assessment must include all potential pathways 
of radionuclide transport and exposure.

[74 FR 10829, Mar. 13, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 63.312  Required characteristics of the reasonably maximally 
exposed individual.

    The reasonably maximally exposed individual is a hypothetical person 
who meets the following criteria:
    (a) Lives in the accessible environment above the highest 
concentration of radionuclides in the plume of contamination;
    (b) Has a diet and living style representative of the people who now 
reside in the Town of Amargosa Valley, Nevada. DOE must use projections 
based upon surveys of the people residing in the Town of Amargosa 
Valley, Nevada, to determine their current diets and living styles and 
use the mean values of these factors in the assessments conducted for 
Sec. Sec. 63.311 and 63.321;
    (c) Uses well water with average concentrations of radionuclides 
based on an annual water demand of 3000 acre-feet;
    (d) Drinks 2 liters of water per day from wells drilled into the 
ground water at the location specified in paragraph (a) of this section; 
and
    (e) Is an adult with metabolic and physiological considerations 
consistent with present knowledge of adults.

                        Human Intrusion Standard


<R05>
Sec. 63.321  Individual protection standard for human intrusion.

    (a) DOE must determine the earliest time after disposal that the 
waste package would degrade sufficiently that a human intrusion (see 
Sec. 63.322) could occur without recognition by the drillers.
    (b) DOE must demonstrate that there is a reasonable expectation that 
the reasonably maximally exposed individual receives, as a result of the 
human intrusion, no more than the following annual dose:
    (1) 0.15 mSv (15 mrem) for 10,000 years following disposal; and
    (2) 1.0 mSv (100 mrem) after 10,000 years, but within the period of 
geologic stability.
    (c) DOE's analysis must include all potential environmental pathways 
of radionuclide transport and exposure, subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 63.322.

[74 FR 10829, Mar. 13, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 63.322  Human intrusion scenario.

    For the purposes of the analysis of human intrusion, DOE must make 
the following assumptions:
    (a) There is a single human intrusion as a result of exploratory 
drilling for ground water;
    (b) The intruders drill a borehole directly through a degraded waste 
package into the uppermost aquifer underlying the Yucca Mountain 
repository;
    (c) The drillers use the common techniques and practices that are 
currently employed in exploratory drilling for ground water in the 
region surrounding Yucca Mountain;
    (d) Careful sealing of the borehole does not occur, instead natural 
degradation processes gradually modify the borehole;
    (e) No particulate waste material falls into the borehole;
    (f) The exposure scenario includes only those radionuclides 
transported to the saturated zone by water (e.g., water enters the waste 
package, releases radionuclides, and transports radionuclides by way of 
the borehole to the saturated zone); and
    (g) No releases are included which are caused by unlikely natural 
processes and events.

                    Ground-Water Protection Standards


<R05>
Sec. 63.331  Separate standards for protection of ground water.

    DOE must demonstrate that there is a reasonable expectation that, 
for 10,000 years of undisturbed performance after disposal, releases of 
radionuclides from waste in the Yucca Mountain disposal system into the 
accessible environment will not cause the level of radioactivity in the 
representative volume of ground water to exceed the limits in the 
following Table 1:

                                 representative volume.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 63.332  Representative volume.

    (a) The representative volume is the volume of ground water that 
would be withdrawn annually from an aquifer containing less than 10,000 
milligrams of total dissolved solids per liter of water to supply a 
given water demand. DOE must project the concentration of radionuclides 
released from the Yucca Mountain disposal system that will be in the 
representative volume. DOE must use the projected concentrations to 
demonstrate a reasonable expectation that the Yucca Mountain disposal 
system complies with Sec. 63.331. The DOE must make the following 
assumptions concerning the representative volume:
    (1) It includes the highest concentration level in the plume of 
contamination in the accessible environment;
    (2) Its position and dimensions in the aquifer are determined using 
average hydrologic characteristics which have cautious, but reasonable, 
values representative of the aquifers along the radionuclide migration 
path from the Yucca Mountain repository to the accessible environment as 
determined by site characterization; and
    (3) It contains 3,000 acre-feet of water (about 3,714,450,000 liters 
or 977,486,000 gallons).
    (b) DOE must use one of two alternative methods for determining the 
dimensions of the representative volume. The DOE must propose its chosen 
method, and any underlying assumptions, to NRC for approval.
    (1) DOE may calculate the dimensions as a well-capture zone. If DOE 
uses this approach, it must assume that the:
    (i) Water supply well(s) has (have) characteristics consistent with 
public water supply wells in the Town of Amargosa Valley, Nevada, for 
example, well-bore size and length of the screened intervals;
    (ii) Screened interval(s) include(s) the highest concentration in 
the plume of contamination in the accessible environment; and
    (iii) Pumping rates and the placement of the well(s) must be set to 
produce an annual withdrawal equal to the representative volume and to 
tap the highest concentration within the plume of contamination.
    (2) DOE may calculate the dimensions as a slice of the plume. If DOE 
uses this approach, it must:
    (i) Propose, for approval, where the location of the edge of the 
plume of contamination occurs. For example, the place where the 
concentration of radionuclides reaches 0.1% of the level of the highest 
concentration in the accessible environment;
    (ii) Assume that the slice of the plume is perpendicular to the 
prevalent direction of flow of the aquifer; and
    (iii) Assume that the volume of ground water contained within the 
slice of the plume equals the representative volume.

                          Additional Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 63.342  Limits on performance assessments.

    (a) DOE's performance assessments conducted to show compliance with 
Sec. Sec. 63.311(a)(1), 63.321(b)(1), and 63.331 shall not include 
consideration of very unlikely features, events, or processes, i.e., 
those that are estimated to have less than one chance in 100,000,000 per 
year of occurring. In addition, DOE's performance assessments need not 
evaluate the impacts resulting from any features, events, and processes 
or sequences of events and processes with a higher chance of occurring 
if the results of the performance assessments would not be changed 
significantly in the initial 10,000-year period after disposal.
    (b) For performance assessments conducted to show compliance with 
Sec. Sec. 63.321(b)(1) and 63.331, DOE's performance assessments shall 
exclude the unlikely features, events, and processes, or sequences of 
events and processes, i.e., those that are estimated to have less than 
one chance in 100,000 per year of occurring and at least one chance in 
100,000,000 per year of occurring.
    (c) For performance assessments conducted to show compliance with 
Sec. Sec. 63.311(a)(2) and 63.321(b)(2), DOE's performance assessments 
shall project the continued effects of the features, events, and 
processes included in paragraph (a) of this section beyond the 10,000-
year post-disposal period through the period of geologic stability. DOE 
must evaluate all of the features, events, or processes included in 
paragraph (a) of this section, and also:
    (1) DOE must assess the effects of seismic and igneous activity 
scenarios, subject to the probability limits in paragraph (a) of this 
section for very unlikely features, events, and processes, or sequences 
of events and processes. Performance assessments conducted to show 
compliance with Sec. 63.321(b)(2) are also subject to the probability 
limits in paragraph (b) of this section for unlikely features, events, 
and processes, or sequences of events and processes.
    (i) The seismic analysis may be limited to the effects caused by 
damage to the drifts in the repository, failure of the waste packages, 
and changes in the elevation of the water table under Yucca Mountain 
(i.e., the magnitude of the water table rise under Yucca Mountain).
    (ii) The igneous activity analysis may be limited to the effects of 
a volcanic event directly intersecting the repository. The igneous event 
may be limited to that causing damage to the waste packages directly, 
causing releases of radionuclides to the biosphere, atmosphere, or 
ground water.
    (2) DOE must assess the effects of climate change. The climate 
change analysis may be limited to the effects of increased water flow 
through the repository as a result of climate change, and the resulting 
transport and release of radionuclides to the accessible environment. 
The nature and degree of climate change may be represented by constant-
in-time climate conditions. The analysis may commence at 10,000 years 
after disposal and shall extend through the period of geologic 
stability. The constant-in-time values to be used to represent climate 
change are to be the spatial average of the deep percolation rate within 
the area bounded by the repository footprint. The constant-in-time deep 
percolation rates to be used to represent climate change shall be based 
on a lognormal distribution with an arithmetic mean of 41 mm/year (1.6 
in./year) and a standard deviation of 33 mm/year (1.3 in./year). The 
lognormal distribution is to be truncated so that the deep percolation 
rates vary between 10 and 100 mm/year (0.39 and 3.9 in./year).
    (3) DOE must assess the effects of general corrosion on engineered 
barriers. DOE may use a constant representative corrosion rate 
throughout the period of geologic stability or a distribution of 
corrosion rates correlated to other repository parameters.

Sec. 70.6  Interpretations.

    Except as specifically authorized by the Commission in writing, no 
interpretation of the meaning of the regulations in this part by any 
officer or employee of the Commission other than a written 
interpretation by the General Counsel will be recognized to be binding 
upon the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 70.7  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a 
Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission 
licensee or applicant against an employee for engaging in certain 
protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes discharge 
and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 
section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in 
general are related to the administration or enforcement of a 
requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy 
Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph 
(a) introductory text of this section or possible violations of 
requirements imposed under either of those statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text or under these 
requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory 
text.
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

[[Page 293]]

    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraphs (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant may be 
grounds for--
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license.
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee, applicant, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of the licensee or applicant.
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect 
an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.
    (e)(1) Each specific licensee, each applicant for a specific 
license, and each general licensee subject to part 19 shall prominently 
post the revision of NRC Form 3, ``Notice to Employees,'' referenced in 
10 CFR 19.11(c).
    (2) The posting of NRC Form 3 must be at locations sufficient to 
permit employees protected by this section to observe a copy on the way 
to or from their place of work. Premises must be posted not later than 
30 days after an application is docketed and remain posted while the 
application is pending before the Commission, during the term of the 
license, and for 30 days following license termination.
    (3) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in appendix D to part 20 of this chapter, by 
calling (301) 415-7232, via e-mail to FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov, or by 
accessing the NRC Web site at http://www.nrc.gov and selecting forms 
from the index found on the home page.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain 
any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an 
employee from participating in protected activity as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section including, but not limited to, 
providing information to the NRC or to his or her employer on potential 
violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

Sec. 70.23  Requirements for the approval of applications.

    (a) An application for a license will be approved if the Commission 
determines that:
    (1) The special nuclear material is to be used for the conduct of 
research or development activities of a type specified in section 31 of 
the Act, \1\ in activities licensed by the Commission under

[[Page 305]]

section 103 or 104 of the Act, or for such other uses as the Commission 
determines to be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Act;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The types of research and development activities specified in 
section 31 are those relating to:
    (1) Nuclear processes;
    (2) The theory and production of atomic energy, including processes, 
materials, and devices related to such production;
    (3) Utilization of special nuclear material and radioactive material 
for medical, biological, agricultural, health or military purposes;
    (4) Utilization of special nuclear material, atomic energy, and 
radioactive material and processes entailed in the utilization or 
production of atomic energy or such material for all other purposes, 
including industrial use, the generation of usable energy, and the 
demonstration of the practical value of utilization or production 
facilities for industrial or commercial purposes; and
    (5) The protection of health and the promotion of safety during

    (3) The applicant's proposed equipment and facilities are adequate 
to protect health and minimize danger to life or property;
    (4) The applicant's proposed procedures to protect health and to 
minimize danger to life or property are adequate;
    (5) Where the nature of the proposed activities is such as to 
require consideration by the Commission, that the applicant appears to 
be financially qualified to engage in the proposed activities in 
accordance with the regulations in this part;
    (6) Where the applicant is required to submit a summary description 
of the fundamental material controls provided in his procedures for the 
control of and accounting for special nuclear material pursuant to Sec. 
70.22 (b), the applicant's proposed controls are adequate;
    (7) Where the proposed activity is processing and fuel fabrication, 
scrap recovery, conversion of uranium hexafluoride, uranium enrichment 
facility construction and operation, or any other activity which the NRC 
determines will significantly affect the quality of the environment, the 
Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards or his/her designee, 
before commencement of construction of the plant or facility in which 
the activity will be conducted, on the basis of information filed and 
evaluations made pursuant to subpart A of part 51 of this chapter, has 
concluded, after weighing the environmental, economic, technical, and 
other benefits against environmental costs and considering available 
alternatives, that the action called for is the issuance of the proposed 
license, with any appropriate conditions to protect environmental 
values. Commencement of construction prior to this conclusion is grounds 
for denial to possess and use special nuclear material in the plant or 
facility. Commencement of construction as defined in section 70.4 may 
include non-construction activities if the activity has a reasonable 
nexus to radiological safety and security.
    (8) Where the proposed activity is the operation of a plutonium 
processing and fuel fabrication plant, construction of the principal 
structures, systems, and components approved pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section has been completed in accordance with the application;
    (9) Where the applicant is required to submit a plan for physical 
protection of special nuclear material in transit pursuant to Sec. 
70.22(g), of this chapter, the applicant's plan is adequate;
    (10) Where the applicant is required to submit a physical security 
plan pursuant to Sec. 70.22(h), the applicant's proposed plan is 
adequate;
    (11) Where the proposed activity is processing and fuel fabrication, 
scrap recovery, conversion of uranium hexafluoride, or involves the use 
of special nuclear material in a uranium enrichment facility, the 
applicant's proposed emergency plan is adequate.
    (12) Where the proposed activity is use of special nuclear material 
in a uranium enrichment facility, the applicable provisions of part 140 
of this chapter have been satisfied.
    (b) The Commission will approve construction of the principal 
structures, systems, and components of a plutonium processing and fuel 
fabrication plant on the basis of information filed pursuant to Sec. 
70.22(f) when the Commission has determined that the design bases of the 
principal structures, systems, and components, and the quality assurance 
program provide reasonable assurance of protection against natural 
phenomena and the consequences of potential accidents. \3\ Failure to 
obtain Commission approval prior to beginning of such construction may 
be

[[Page 306]]

grounds for denial of a license to possess and use special nuclear 
material in a plutonium processing and fuel fabrication plant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The criteria in appendix B of part 50 of this chapter will be 
used by the Commission in determining the adequacy of the quality 
assurance program.

Sec. 70.24  Criticality accident requirements.

    (a) Each licensee authorized to possess special nuclear material in 
a quantity exceeding 700 grams of contained uranium-235, 520 grams of 
uranium-233, 450 grams of plutonium, 1,500 grams of contained uranium-
235 if no uranium enriched to more than 4 percent by weight of uranium-
235 is present, 450 grams of any combination thereof, or one-half such 
quantities if massive moderators or reflectors made of graphite, heavy 
water or beryllium may be present, shall maintain in each area in which 
such licensed special nuclear material is handled, used, or stored, a 
monitoring system meeting the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1) or

detectors which will energize clearly audible alarm signals if 
accidental criticality occurs. This section is not intended to require 
underwater monitoring when special nuclear material is handled or stored 
beneath water shielding or to require monitoring systems when special 
nuclear material is being transported when packaged in accordance with 
the requirements of part 71 of this chapter.
    (1) The monitoring system shall be capable of detecting a 
criticality that produces an absorbed dose in soft tissue of 20 rads of 
combined neutron and gamma radiation at an unshielded distance of 2 
meters from the reacting material within one minute. Coverage of all 
areas shall be provided by two detectors.
    (2) Persons licensed prior to December 6, 1974, to possess special 
nuclear material subject to this section may maintain a monitoring 
system capable of detecting a criticality which generates radiation 
levels of 300 rems per hour one foot from the source of the radiation. 
The monitoring devices in the system shall have a preset alarm point of 
not less than 5 millirems per hour (in order to avoid false alarms) nor 
more than 20 millirems per hour. In no event may any such device be 
farther than 120 feet from the special nuclear material being handled, 
used, or stored; lesser distances may be necessary to meet the 
requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) on account of intervening 
shielding or other pertinent factors.
    (3) The licensee shall maintain emergency procedures for each area 
in which this licensed special nuclear material is handled, used, or 
stored to ensure that all personnel withdraw to an area of safety upon 
the sounding of the alarm. These procedures must include the conduct of 
drills to familiarize personnel with the evacuation plan, and 
designation of responsible individuals for determining the cause of the 
alarm, and placement of radiation survey instruments in accessible 
locations for use in such an emergency. The licensee shall retain a copy 
of current procedures for each area as a record for as long as licensed 
special nuclear material is handled, used, or stored in the area. The 
licensee shall retain any superseded portion of the procedures for three 
years after the portion is superseded.
    (b) Each licensee authorized to possess special nuclear material in 
quantities in excess of those specified in paragraph (a) shall:
    (1) Provide the means for identifying quickly which individuals have 
received doses of 10 rads or more.
    (2) Maintain facilities and supplies at the site for decontamination 
of personnel, arrangements for the services

[[Page 307]]

of a physician and other medical personnel qualified to handle radiation 
emergencies, arrangements for transportation of injured or contaminated 
individuals to treatment facilities, and arrangements for treatment of 
individuals at treatment facilities outside the site boundary.
    (c) Holders of licenses for construction or operation of a nuclear 
reactor issued pursuant to part 50 of this chapter, except critical 
assembly reactors, are exempt for the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section with respect to special nuclear material used or to be used 
in the reactor.
    (d)(1) The requirements in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section do not apply to a holder of a construction permit or operating 
license for a nuclear power reactor issued under part 50 of this chapter 
or a combined license issued under part 52 of this chapter, if the 
holder complies with the requirements of paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 50.68.
    (2) An exemption from Sec. 70.24 held by a licensee who thereafter 
elects to comply with requirements of paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 50.68 does 
not exempt that licensee from complying with any of the requirements in 
Sec. 50.68, but shall be ineffective so long as the licensee elects to 
comply with Sec. 50.68.

    (e) Each decommissioning funding plan must contain a cost estimate 
for decommissioning and a description of the method of assuring funds 
for decommissioning from paragraph (f) of this section, including means 
for adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels periodically 
over the life of the facility. Cost estimates must be adjusted at 
intervals not to exceed 3 years. The decommissioning funding plan must 
also contain a certification by the licensee that financial assurance 
for decommissioning has been provided in the amount of the cost estimate 
for decommissioning and a signed original of the financial instrument 
obtained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Financial assurance for decommissioning must be provided by one 
or more of the following methods:
    (1) Prepayment. Prepayment is the deposit prior to the start of 
operation into an account segregated from licensee assets and outside 
the licensee's administrative control of cash or liquid assets such that 
the amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs. 
Prepayment may be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government 
fund, certificate of deposit, or deposit of government securities.
    (2) A surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method. These 
methods guarantee that decommissioning costs will be paid. A surety 
method may be in the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, or line of 
credit. A parent company guarantee of funds for decommissioning costs 
based on a financial test may be used if the guarantee and test are as 
contained in appendix A to part 30. A parent company guarantee may not 
be used in combination with other financial methods to satisfy the 
requirements of this section. For commercial corporations that issue 
bonds, a guarantee of funds by the applicant or licensee for 
decommissioning costs based on a financial test may be used if the 
guarantee and test are as contained in appendix C to part 30. For 
commercial companies that do not issue bonds, a guarantee of funds by 
the applicant or licensee for decommissioning costs may be used if the 
guarantee and test are as contained in appendix D to part 30. For 
nonprofit entities, such as colleges, universities, and nonprofit 
hospitals, a guarantee of funds by the applicant or licensee may be used 
if the guarantee and test are as contained in appendix E to part 30. A 
guarantee by the applicant or licensee may not be used in combination 
with any other financial methods used to

[[Page 309]]

satisfy the requirements of this section or in any situation where the 
applicant or licensee has a parent company holding majority control of 
the voting stock of the company. Any surety method or insurance used to 
provide financial assurance for decommissioning must contain the 
following conditions:
    (i) The surety method or insurance must be open-ended or, if written 
for a specified term, such as five years, must be renewed automatically 
unless 90 days or more prior to the renewal date, the issurer notifies 
the Commission, the beneficiary, and the licensee of its intention not 
to renew. The surety method or insurance must also provide that the full 
face amount be paid to the beneficiary automatically prior to the 
expiration without proof of forfeiture if the licensee fails to provide 
a replacement acceptable to the Commission within 30 days after receipt 
of notification of cancellation.
    (ii) The surety method or insurance must be payable to a trust 
established for decommissioning costs. The trustee and trust must be 
acceptable to the Commission. An acceptable trustee includes an 
appropriate State or Federal government agency or an entity which has 
the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are 
regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.
    (iii) The surety method or insurance must remain in effect until the 
Commission has terminated the license.
    (3) An external sinking fund in which deposits are made at least 
annually, coupled with a surety method or insurance, the value of which 
may decrease by the amount being accumulated in the sinking fund. An 
external sinking fund is a fund established and maintained by setting 
aside funds periodically in an account segregated from licensee assets 
and outside the licenssee's administrative control in which the total 
amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs at the 
time termination of operation is expected. An external sinking fund may 
be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government fund, certificate 
of deposit, or deposit of government securities. The surety or insurance 
provisions must be as stated in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (4) In the case of Federal, State, or local government licensees, a 
statement of intent containing a cost estimate for decommissioning or an 
amount based on the Table in paragraph (d) of this section, and 
indicating that funds for decommissioning will be obtained when 
necessary.
    (5) When a governmental entity is assuming custody and ownership of 
a site, an arrangement that is deemed acceptable by such governmental 
entity.
    (g) Each person licensed under this part shall keep records of 
information important to the decommissioning of a facility in an 
identified location until the site is released for unrestricted use. If 
records important to the decommissioning of a facility are kept for 
other purposes, reference to these records and their locations may be 
used. Information the Commission considers important to decommissioning 
consists of--
    (1) Records of spills or other unusual occurrences involving the 
spread of contamination in and around the facility, equipment, or site. 
These records may be limited to instances when contamination remains 
after any cleanup procedures or when there is reasonable likelihood that 
contaminants may have spread to inaccessible areas as in the case of 
possible seepage into porous materials such as concrete. These records 
must include any known information on identification of involved 
nuclides, quantities, forms, and concentrations.
    (2) As-built drawings and modifications of structures and equipment 
in restricted areas where radioactive materials are used and/or stored 
and of locations of possible inaccessible contamination such as buried 
pipes which may be subject to contamination. If required drawings are 
referenced, each relevant document need not be indexed individually. If 
drawings are not available, the licensee shall substitute appropriate 
records of available information concerning these areas and locations.
    (3) Except for areas containing only sealed sources (provided the 
sources have not leaked or no contamination remains after cleanup of any 
leak), a

[[Page 310]]

list contained in a single document and updated every 2 years, of the 
following:
    (i) All areas designated and formerly designated as restricted areas 
as defined under 10 CFR 20.1003 (For requirements prior to January 1, 
1994, see 10 CFR 20.3 as contained in the CFR edition revised as of 
January 1, 1993.);
    (ii) All areas outside of restricted areas that require 
documentation under Sec. 70.25(g)(1);
    (iii) All areas outside of restricted areas where current and 
previous wastes have been buried as documented under 10 CFR 20.2108; and
    (iv) All areas outside of restricted areas that contain material 
such that, if the license expired, the licensee would be required to 
either decontaminate the area to meet the criteria for decommissioning 
in 10 CFR part 20, subpart E, or apply for approval for disposal under 
10 CFR 20.2002.
    (4) Records of the cost estimate performed for the decommissioning 
funding plan or of the amount certified for decommissioning, and records 
of the funding method used for assuring funds if either a funding plan 
or certification is used.

    Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 35572, June 17, 2011, Sec. 70.25 was 
amended by adding new paragraphs (c)(5) and (h) and by revising 
paragraph (e), the introductory text of paragraph (f), paragraph (f)(1), 
the introductory text of paragraph (f)(2), and paragraph (f)(3), 
effective Dec. 17, 2012. For the convenience of the user, the added and 
revised text is set forth as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 70.25  Financial assurance and recordkeeping for decommissioning.

                                * * * * *

    (c) * * *
    (5) If, in surveys made under 10 CFR 20.1501(a), residual 
radioactivity in the facility and environment, including the subsurface, 
is detected at levels that would, if left uncorrected, prevent the site 
from meeting the 10 CFR 20.1402 criteria for unrestricted use, the 
licensee must submit a decommissioning funding plan within one year of 
when the survey is completed.

                                * * * * *

    (e)(1) Each decommissioning funding plan must be submitted for 
review and approval and must contain--
    (i) A detailed cost estimate for decommissioning, in an amount 
reflecting:
    (A) The cost of an independent contractor to perform all 
decommissioning activities;
    (B) The cost of meeting the 10 CFR 20.1402 criteria for unrestricted 
use, provided that, if the applicant or licensee can demonstrate its 
ability to meet the provisions of 10 CFR 20.1403, the cost estimate may 
be based on meeting the 10 CFR 20.1403 criteria;
    (C) The volume of onsite subsurface material containing residual 
radioactivity that will require remediation; and
    (D) An adequate contingency factor.
    (ii) Identification of and justification for using the key 
assumptions contained in the DCE;
    (iii) A description of the method of assuring funds for 
decommissioning from paragraph (f) of this section, including means for 
adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels periodically over 
the life of the facility;
    (iv) A certification by the licensee that financial assurance for 
decommissioning has been provided in the amount of the cost estimate for 
decommissioning; and
    (v) A signed original, or, if permitted, a copy, of the financial 
instrument obtained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f) of this 
section (unless a previously submitted and accepted financial instrument 
continues to cover the cost estimate for decommissioning).
    (2) At the time of license renewal and at intervals not to exceed 3 
years, the decommissioning funding plan must be resubmitted with 
adjustments as necessary to account for changes in costs and the extent 
of contamination. If the amount of financial assurance will be adjusted 
downward, this can not be done until the updated decommissioning funding 
plan is approved. The decommissioning funding plan must update the 
information submitted with the original or prior approved plan, and must 
specifically consider the effect of the following events on 
decommissioning costs:
    (i) Spills of radioactive material producing additional residual 
radioactivity in onsite subsurface material;
    (ii) Waste inventory increasing above the amount previously 
estimated;
    (iii) Waste disposal costs increasing above the amount previously 
estimated;
    (iv) Facility modifications;
    (v) Changes in authorized possession limits;

[[Page 311]]

    (vi) Actual remediation costs that exceed the previous cost 
estimate;
    (vii) Onsite disposal; and
    (viii) Use of a settling pond.
    (f) The financial instrument must include the licensee's name, 
license number, and docket number; and the name, address, and other 
contact information of the issuer, and, if a trust is used, the trustee. 
When any of the foregoing information changes, the licensee must, within 
30 days, submit financial instruments reflecting such changes. Financial 
assurance for decommissioning must be provided by one or more of the 
following methods:
    (1) Prepayment. Prepayment is the deposit before the start of 
operation into an account segregated from licensee assets and outside 
the licensee's administrative control of cash or liquid assets such that 
the amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs. 
Prepayment must be made into a trust account, and the trustee and the 
trust must be acceptable to the Commission.
    (2) A surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method. These 
methods guarantee that decommissioning costs will be paid. A surety 
method may be in the form of a surety bond, or letter of credit. A 
parent company guarantee of funds for decommissioning costs based on a 
financial test may be used if the guarantee and test are as contained in 
Appendix A to this part. For commercial corporations that issue bonds, a 
guarantee of funds by the applicant or licensee for decommissioning 
costs based on a financial test may be used if the guarantee and test 
are as contained in appendix C to this part. For commercial companies 
that do not issue bonds, a guarantee of funds by the applicant or 
licensee for decommissioning costs may be used if the guarantee and test 
are as contained in appendix D to this part. For nonprofit entities, 
such as colleges, universities, and nonprofit hospitals, a guarantee of 
funds by the applicant or licensee may be used if the guarantee and test 
are as contained in Appendix E to this part. Except for an external 
sinking fund, a parent company guarantee or a guarantee by the applicant 
or licensee may not be used in combination with any other financial 
methods used to satisfy the requirements of this section. A guarantee by 
the applicant or licensee may not be used in any situation where the 
applicant or licensee has a parent company holding majority control of 
the voting stock of the company. Any surety method or insurance used to 
provide financial assurance for decommissioning must contain the 
following conditions:

                                * * * * *

    (3) An external sinking fund in which deposits are made at least 
annually, coupled with a surety method, insurance, or other guarantee 
method, the value of which may decrease by the amount being accumulated 
in the sinking fund. An external sinking fund is a fund established and 
maintained by setting aside funds periodically in an account segregated 
from licensee assets and outside the licensee's administrative control 
in which the total amount of funds would be sufficient to pay 
decommissioning costs at the time termination of operation is expected. 
An external sinking fund must be in the form of a trust. If the other 
guarantee method is used, no surety or insurance may be combined with 
the external sinking fund. The surety, insurance, or other guarantee 
provisions must be as stated in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

                                * * * * *

    (h) In providing financial assurance under this section, each 
licensee must use the financial assurance funds only for decommissioning 
activities and each licensee must monitor the balance of funds held to 
account for market variations. The licensee must replenish the funds, 
and report such actions to the NRC, as follows:
    (1) If, at the end of a calendar quarter, the fund balance is below 
the amount necessary to cover the cost of decommissioning, but is not 
below 75 percent of the cost, the licensee must increase the balance to 
cover the cost, and must do so within 30 days after the end of the 
calendar quarter.
    (2) If, at any time, the fund balance falls below 75 percent of the 
amount necessary to cover the cost of decommissioning, the licensee must 
increase the balance to cover the cost, and must do so within 30 days of 
the occurrence.
    (3) Within 30 days of taking the actions required by paragraph 
(h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section, the licensee must provide a written 
report of such actions to the Director, Office of Federal and State 
Materials and Environmental Management Programs, and state the new 
balance of the fund.

record for the entire period during which the licensee possesses the 
appropriate type and quantity of special nuclear material under each 
license for which the procedures were developed and, if any portion of 
the plan is superseded, retain that superseded portion for 3 years after 
the effective date of the change. The licensee shall not make a change 
that would decrease the safeguards effectiveness of the first four 
categories of information (i.e., Background, Generic Planning Base, 
Licensee Planning Base, and Responsibility Matrix) contained in any 
licensee safeguards contingency plan prepared pursuant to Sec. Sec. 
70.22(g), 70.22(j), 72.184, 73.20(c), 73.26(e)(1), 73.46(h)(1), or 
73.50(g)(1) of this chapter without the prior approval of the NRC. A 
licensee desiring to make such a change shall submit an application for 
an amendment to its license pursuant to Sec. 70.34. The licensee may 
make changes to the licensee safeguards contingency plan without prior 
NRC approval if the changes do not decrease the safeguards effectiveness 
of the plan. The licensee shall maintain each change to the plan made 
without prior approval as a record during the period for which 
possession of a formula quantity of special nuclear material is 
authorized under a license and retain the superseded portion for 3 years 
after the effective date of the change, and shall, within 60 days after 
the change is made, furnish a report containing a description of each 
change to the Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards; the 
report may be sent using an appropriate method listed in Sec. 70.5(a), 
and a copy of the report must be sent to the Regional Administrator of

73 of this chapter.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) Licensees required to submit emergency plans in accordance with 
Sec. 70.22(i) shall follow the emergency plan approved by the 
Commission. The licensee may change the approved plan without Commission 
approval if the changes do not decrease the effectiveness of the plan. 
Within six months after each change is made, the licensee shall, using 
an appropriate method listed in Sec. 70.5(a), furnish the Director, 
Division of Security Policy, Office of Nuclear Security and Incident 
Response, a copy of each change, with copies to the appropriate NRC 
Regional Office specified in appendix D to part 20 of this chapter and 
to affected offsite response organizations. Proposed changes that 
decrease the effectiveness of the approved emergency plan may not be 
implemented without prior application to and prior approval by the 
Commission.
    (j) Each licensee who possesses special nuclear material, or who 
transports, or delivers to a carrier for transport, a formula quantity 
of strategic special nuclear material, special nuclear material of 
moderate strategic significance, or special nuclear material of low 
strategic significance, or more than 100 grams of irradiated reactor 
fuel shall ensure that Safeguards Information is protected against 
unauthorized disclosure in accordance with the requirements in Sec.

<R05>
Sec. 70.38  Expiration and termination of licenses and decommissioning
of sites and separate buildings or outdoor areas.

    (a) Each specific license expires at the end of the day on the 
expiration date stated in the license unless the licensee has filed an 
application for renewal under Sec. 70.33 not less than 30 days before 
the expiration date stated in the existing license. If an application 
for renewal has been filed at least 30 days before the expiration date 
stated in the existing license, the existing license expires at the end 
of the day on which the Commission makes a final determination to deny 
the renewal application or, if the determination states an expiration 
date, the expiration date stated in the determination.
    (b) Each specific license revoked by the Commission expires at the 
end of the day on the date of the Commission's final determination to 
revoke the license, or on the expiration date stated in the 
determination, or as otherwise provided by Commission Order.
    (c) Each specific license continues in effect, beyond the expiration 
date if necessary, with respect to possession of special nuclear 
material until the Commission notifies the licensee in writing that the 
license is terminated. During this time, the licensee shall--
    (1) Limit actions involving special nuclear material to those 
related to decommissioning; and
    (2) Continue to control entry to restricted areas until they are 
suitable for release in accordance with NRC requirements.
    (d) Within 60 days of the occurrence of any of the following, 
consistent with the administrative directions in Sec. 70.5,

[[Page 316]]

each licensee shall provide notification to the NRC in writing and 
either begin decommissioning its site, or any separate building or 
outdoor area that contains residual radioactivity, so that the building 
or outdoor area is suitable for release in accordance with NRC 
requirements, or submit within 12 months of notification a 
decommissioning plan, if required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section, 
and begin decommissioning upon approval of that plan if--
    (1) The license has expired pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section; or
    (2) The licensee has decided to permanently cease principal 
activities, as defined in this part, at the entire site or in any 
separate building or outdoor area; or
    (3) No principal activities under the license have been conducted 
for a period of 24 months; or
    (4) No principal activities have been conducted for a period of 24 
months in any separate building or outdoor area that contains residual 
radioactivity such that the building or outdoor area is unsuitable for 
release in accordance with NRC requirements.
    (e) Coincident with the notification required by paragraph (d) of 
this section, the licensee shall maintain in effect all decommissioning 
financial assurances established by the licensee pursuant to Sec. 70.25 
in conjunction with a license issuance or renewal or as required by this 
section. The amount of the financial assurance must be increased, or may 
be decreased, as appropriate, to cover the detailed cost estimate for 
decommissioning established pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(v) of this 
section.
    (1) Any licensee who has not provided financial assurance to cover 
the detailed cost estimate submitted with the decommissioning plan shall 
do so when this rule becomes effective November 24, 1995.
    (2) Following approval of the decommissioning plan, a licensee may 
reduce the amount of the financial assurance as decommissioning proceeds 
and radiological contamination is reduced at the site with the approval 
of the Commission.
    (f) The Commission may grant a request to delay or postpone 
initiation of the decommissioning process if the Commission determines 
that this relief is not detrimental to the public health and safety and 
is otherwise in the public interest. The request must be submitted no 
later than 30 days before notification pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section. The schedule for decommissioning set forth in paragraph (d) of 
this section may not commence until the Commission has made a 
determination on the request.
    (g)(1) A decommissioning plan must be submitted if required by 
license condition or if the procedures and activities necessary to carry 
out decommissioning of the site or separate building or outdoor area 
have not been previously approved by the Commission and these procedures 
could increase potential health and safety impacts to workers or to the 
public, such as in any of the following cases:
    (i) Procedures would involve techniques not applied routinely during 
cleanup or maintenance operations;
    (ii) Workers would be entering areas not normally occupied where 
surface contamination and radiation levels are significantly higher than 
routinely encountered during operation;
    (iii) Procedures could result in significantly greater airborne 
concentrations of radioactive materials than are present during 
operation; or
    (iv) Procedures could result in significantly greater releases of 
radioactive material to the environment than those associated with 
operation.
    (2) The Commission may approve an alternate schedule for submittal 
of a decommissioning plan required pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section if the Commission determines that the alternative schedule is 
necessary to the effective conduct of decommissioning operations and 
presents no undue risk from radiation to the public health and safety 
and is otherwise in the public interest.
    (3) The procedures listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section may 
not be carried out prior to approval of the decommissioning plan.
    (4) The proposed decommissioning plan for the site or separate 
building or outdoor area must include:

[[Page 317]]

    (i) A description of the conditions of the site or separate building 
or outdoor area sufficient to evaluate the acceptability of the plan;
    (ii) A description of planned decommissioning activities;
    (iii) A description of methods used to ensure protection of workers 
and the environment against radiation hazards during decommissioning;
    (iv) A description of the planned final radiation survey; and
    (v) An updated detailed cost estimate for decommissioning, 
comparison of that estimate with present funds set aside for 
decommissioning, and a plan for assuring the availability of adequate 
funds for completion of decommissioning.
    (vi) A description of the physical security plan and material 
control and accounting plan provisions in place during decommissioning.
    (vii) For decommissioning plans calling for completion of 
decommissioning later than 24 months after plan approval, a 
justification for the delay based on the criteria in paragraph (i) of 
this section.
    (5) The proposed decommissioning plan will be approved by the 
Commission if the information therein demonstrates that the 
decommissioning will be completed as soon as practical and that the 
health and safety of workers and the public will be adequately 
protected.
    (h)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, 
licensees shall complete decommissioning of the site or separate 
building or outdoor area as soon as practicable but no later than 24 
months following the initiation of decommissioning.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, when 
decommissioning involves the entire site, the licensee shall request 
license termination as soon as practicable but no later than 24 months 
following the initiation of decommissioning.
    (i) The Commission may approve a request for an alternate schedule 
for completion of decommissioning of the site or separate building or 
outdoor area, and license termination if appropriate, if the Commission 
determines that the alternative is warranted by consideration of the 
following:
    (1) Whether it is technically feasible to complete decommissioning 
within the allotted 24-month period;
    (2) Whether sufficient waste disposal capacity is available to allow 
completion of decommissioning within the allotted 24-month period;
    (3) Whether a significant volume reduction in wastes requiring 
disposal will be achieved by allowing short-lived radionuclides to 
decay;
    (4) Whether a significant reduction in radiation exposure to workers 
can be achieved by allowing short-lived radionuclides to decay; and
    (5) Other site-specific factors which the Commission may consider 
appropriate on a case-by-case basis, such as regulatory requirements of 
other government agencies, lawsuits, ground-water treatment activities, 
monitored natural ground-water restoration, actions that could result in 
more environmental harm than deferred cleanup, and other factors beyond 
the control of the licensee.
    (j) As the final step in decommissioning, the licensee shall--
    (1) Certify the disposition of all licensed material, including 
accumulated wastes, by submitting a completed NRC Form 314 or equivalent 
information; and
    (2) Conduct a radiation survey of the premises where the licensed 
activities were carried out and submit a report of the results of this 
survey, unless the licensee demonstrates in some other manner that the 
premises are suitable for release in accordance with the criteria for 
decommissioning in 10 CFR part 20, subpart E. The licensee shall, as 
appropriate--
    (i) Report levels of gamma radiation in units of millisieverts 
(microroentgen) per hour at one meter from surfaces, and report levels 
of radioactivity, including alpha and beta, in units of megabecquerels 
(disintegrations per minute or microcuries) per 100 square centimeters 
removable and fixed for surfaces, megabecquerels (microcuries) per 
milliliter for water, and becquerels (picocuries) per gram for solids 
such as soils or concrete; and
    (ii) Specify the survey instrument(s) used and certify that each 
instrument is properly calibrated and tested.

[[Page 318]]

    (k) Specific licenses, including expired licenses, will be 
terminated by written notice to the licensee when the Commission 
determines that:
    (1) Special nuclear material has been properly disposed;
    (2) Reasonable effort has been made to eliminate residual 
radioactive contamination, if present; and
    (3)(i) A radiation survey has been performed which demonstrates that 
the premises are suitable for release in accordance with the criteria 
for decommissioning in 10 CFR part 20, subpart E; or
    (ii) Other information submitted by the licensee is sufficient to 
demonstrate that the premises are suitable for release in accordance 
with the criteria for decommissioning in 10 CFR part 20, subpart E.
    (4) Records required by Sec. 70.51(b)(6) have been received.

    (ii) Details of construction and design;
    (iii) Details of the method of incorporation and binding of the 
plutonium in the source;
    (iv) Procedures for and results of prototype testing of sources, 
which are designed to contain more than 0.005 microcurie of plutonium, 
to demonstrate that the plutonium contained in each source will not be 
released or be removed from the source under normal conditions of use;
    (v) Details of quality control procedures to be followed in 
manufacture of the source;
    (vi) Description of labeling to be affixed to the source or the 
storage container for the source;
    (vii) Any additional information, including experimental studies and 
tests, required by the Commission to facilitate a determination of the 
safety of the source.
    (3) Each source will contain no more than 5 microcuries of 
plutonium.
    (4) The Commission determines, with respect to any type of source 
containing more than 0.005 microcurie of plutonium, that:
    (i) The method of incorporation and binding of the plutonium in the 
source is such that the plutonium will not be released or be removed 
from the source under normal conditions of use and handling of the 
source; and
    (ii) The source has been subjected to and has satisfactorily passed 
the prototype tests prescribed by paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (5) For any type of source which is designed to contain more than 
0.005 microcurie of plutonium, the applicant has conducted prototype 
tests, in the order listed, on each of five prototypes of such source, 
which contains more than 0.005 microcurie of plutonium, as follows:
    (i) Initial measurement. The quantity of radioactive material 
deposited on the source shall be measured by direct counting of the 
source.
    (ii) Dry wipe test. The entire radioactive surface of the source 
shall be wiped with filter paper with the application of moderate finger 
pressure. Removal of radioactive material from the source shall be 
determined by measuring the radioactivity on the filter paper or by 
direct measurement of the radioactivity on the source following the dry 
wipe.
    (iii) Wet wipe test. The entire radioactive surface of the source 
shall be wiped with filter paper, moistened with water, with the 
application of moderate finger pressure. Removal of radioactive material 
from the source shall be determined by measuring the radioactivity on 
the filter paper after

[[Page 319]]

it has dried or by direct measurement of the radioactivity on the source 
following the wet wipe.
    (iv) Water soak test. The source shall be immersed in water at room 
temperature for a period of 24 consecutive hours. The source shall then 
be removed from the water. Removal of radioactive material from the 
source shall be determined by direct measurement of the radioactivity on 
the source after it has dried or by measuring the radioactivity in the 
residue obtained by evaporation of the water in which the source was 
immersed.
    (v) Dry wipe test. On completion of the preceding tests in 
paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section, the dry wipe test 
described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section shall be repeated.
    (vi) Observations. Removal of more than 0.005 microcurie of 
radioactivity in any test prescribed by this paragraph shall be cause 
for rejection of the source design. Results of prototype tests submitted 
to the Commission shall be given in terms of radioactivity in 
microcuries and percent of removal from the total amount of radioactive 
material deposited on the source.
    (b) Each person licensed under this section shall affix to each 
source, or storage container for the source, a label which shall contain 
sufficient information relative to safe use and storage of the source 
and shall include the following statement or a substantially similar 
statement which contains the information called for in the following 
statement. \1\

    (c) Each person licensed under this section shall perform a dry wipe 
test upon each source containing more than 0.1 microcurie of plutonium 
prior to transferring the source to a general licensee under Sec. 
70.19. This test shall be performed by wiping the entire radioactive 
surface of the source with a filter paper with the application of 
moderate finger pressure. The radioactivity on the paper shall be 
measured by using radiation detection instrumentation capable of 
detecting 0.005 microcurie of plutonium. If any such test discloses more 
than 0.005 microcurie of radioactive material, the source shall be 
deemed to be leaking or losing plutonium and shall not be transferred to 
a general licensee under Sec. 70.19.

through Sec. 70.76, implementation by current licensees of the Subpart 
H requirements shall be completed no later than the time of the ISA 
Summary submittal required in Sec. 70.62(c)(3)(ii).


<R05>
Sec. 70.61  Performance requirements.

    (a) Each applicant or licensee shall evaluate, in the integrated 
safety analysis performed in accordance with Sec. 70.62, its compliance 
with the performance requirements in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of 
this section.
    (b) The risk of each credible high-consequence event must be 
limited. Engineered controls, administrative controls, or both, shall be 
applied to the extent needed to reduce the likelihood of occurrence of 
the event so that, upon implementation of such controls, the event is 
highly unlikely or its consequences are less severe than those in 
paragrahs (b)(1)-(4) of this section. High consequence events are those 
internally or externally initiated events that result in:
    (1) An acute worker dose of 1 Sv (100 rem) or greater total 
effective dose equivalent;
    (2) An acute dose of 0.25 Sv (25 rem) or greater total effective 
dose equivalent to any individual located outside the controlled area 
identified pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section;
    (3) An intake of 30 mg or greater of uranium in soluble form by any 
individual located outside the controlled area identified pursuant to 
paragraph (f) of this section; or
    (4) An acute chemical exposure to an individual from licensed 
material or hazardous chemicals produced from licensed material that:
    (i) Could endanger the life of a worker, or
    (ii) Could lead to irreversible or other serious, long-lasting 
health effects to any individual located outside the controlled area 
identified pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. If an applicant 
possesses or plans to possess quantities of material capable of such 
chemical exposures, then the applicant shall propose appropriate 
quantitative standards for these health effects, as part of the 
information submitted pursuant to Sec. 70.65 of this subpart.
    (c) The risk of each credible intermediate-consequence event must be 
limited. Engineered controls, administrative controls, or both shall be 
applied to the extent needed so that, upon implementation of such 
controls,

[[Page 326]]

the event is unlikely or its consequences are less than those in 
paragraphs (c)(1)-(4) of this section. Intermediate consequence events 
are those internally or externally initiated events that are not high 
consequence events, that result in:
    (1) An acute worker dose of 0.25 Sv (25 rem) or greater total 
effective dose equivalent;
    (2) An acute dose of 0.05 Sv (5 rem) or greater total effective dose 
equivalent to any individual located outside the controlled area 
identified pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section;
    (3) A 24-hour averaged release of radioactive material outside the 
restricted area in concentrations exceeding 5000 times the values in 
Table 2 of Appendix B to Part 20; or
    (4) An acute chemical exposure to an individual from licensed 
material or hazardous chemicals produced from licensed material that:
    (i) Could lead to irreversible or other serious, long-lasting health 
effects to a worker, or
    (ii) Could cause mild transient health effects to any individual 
located outside the controlled area as specified in paragraph (f) of 
this section. If an applicant possesses or plans to possess quantities 
of material capable of such chemical exposures, then the applicant shall 
propose appropriate quantitative standards for these health effects, as 
part of the information submitted pursuant to Sec. 70.65 of this 
subpart.
    (d) In addition to complying with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, the risk of nuclear criticality accidents must be limited by 
assuring that under normal and credible abnormal conditions, all nuclear 
processes are subcritical, including use of an approved margin of 
subcriticality for safety. Preventive controls and measures must be the 
primary means of protection against nuclear criticality accidents.
    (e) Each engineered or administrative control or control system 
necessary to comply with paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section 
shall be designated as an item relied on for safety. The safety program, 
established and maintained pursuant to Sec. 70.62 of this subpart, 
shall ensure that each item relied on for safety will be available and 
reliable to perform its intended function when needed and in the context 
of the performance requirements of this section.
    (f) Each licensee must establish a controlled area, as defined in 
Sec. 20.1003. In addition, the licensee must retain the authority to 
exclude or remove personnel and property from the area. For the purpose 
of complying with the performance requirements of this section, 
individuals who are not workers, as defined in Sec. 70.4, may be 
permitted to perform ongoing activities (e.g., at a facility not related 
to the licensed activities) in the controlled area, if the licensee:
    (1) Demonstrates and documents, in the integrated safety analysis, 
that the risk for those individuals at the location of their activities 
does not exceed the performance requirements of paragraphs (b)(2), 
(b)(3), (b)(4)(ii), (c)(2), and (c)(4)(ii) of this section; or
    (2) Provides training that satisfies 10 CFR 19.12(a)(1)-(5) to these 
individuals and ensures that they are aware of the risks associated with 
accidents involving the licensed activities as determined by the 
integrated safety analysis, and conspicuously posts and maintains 
notices stating where the information in 10 CFR 19.11(a) may be examined 
by these individuals. Under these conditions, the performance 
requirements for workers specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section may be applied to these individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 70.62  Safety program and integrated safety analysis.

    (a) Safety program. (1) Each licensee or applicant shall establish 
and maintain a safety program that demonstrates compliance with the 
performance requirements of Sec. 70.61. The safety program may be 
graded such that management measures applied are graded commensurate 
with the reduction of the risk attributable to that item. Three elements 
of this safety program; namely, process safety information, integrated 
safety analysis, and management measures, are described in paragraphs 
(b) through (d) of this section.
    (2) Each licensee or applicant shall establish and maintain records 
that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of this section.

[[Page 327]]

    (3) Each licensee or applicant shall maintain records of failures 
readily retrievable and available for NRC inspection, documenting each 
discovery that an item relied on for safety or management measure has 
failed to perform its function upon demand or has degraded such that the 
performance requirements of Sec. 70.61 are not satisfied. These records 
must identify the item relied on for safety or management measure that 
has failed and the safety function affected, the date of discovery, date 
(or estimated date) of the failure, duration (or estimated duration) of 
the time that the item was unable to perform its function, any other 
affected items relied on for safety or management measures and their 
safety function, affected processes, cause of the failure, whether the 
failure was in the context of the performance requirements or upon 
demand or both, and any corrective or compensatory action that was 
taken. A failure must be recorded at the time of discovery and the 
record of that failure updated promptly upon the conclusion of each 
failure investigation of an item relied on for safety or management 
measure.
    (b) Process safety information. Each licensee or applicant shall 
maintain process safety information to enable the performance and 
maintenance of an integrated safety analysis. This process safety 
information must include information pertaining to the hazards of the 
materials used or produced in the process, information pertaining to the 
technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment 
in the process.
    (c) Integrated safety analysis. (1) Each licensee or applicant shall 
conduct and maintain an integrated safety analysis, that is of 
appropriate detail for the complexity of the process, that identifies:
    (i) Radiological hazards related to possessing or processing 
licensed material at its facility;
    (ii) Chemical hazards of licensed material and hazardous chemicals 
produced from licensed material;
    (iii) Facility hazards that could affect the safety of licensed 
materials and thus present an increased radiological risk;
    (iv) Potential accident sequences caused by process deviations or 
other events internal to the facility and credible external events, 
including natural phenomena;
    (v) The consequence and the likelihood of occurrence of each 
potential accident sequence identified pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) 
of this section, and the methods used to determine the consequences and 
likelihoods; and
    (vi) Each item relied on for safety identified pursuant to Sec. 
70.61(e) of this subpart, the characteristics of its preventive, 
mitigative, or other safety function, and the assumptions and conditions 
under which the item is relied upon to support compliance with the 
performance requirements of Sec. 70.61.
    (2) Integrated safety analysis team qualifications. To assure the 
adequacy of the integrated safety analysis, the analysis must be 
performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process 
operations. The team shall include at least one person who has 
experience and knowledge specific to each process being evaluated, and 
persons who have experience in nuclear criticality safety, radiation 
safety, fire safety, and chemical process safety. One member of the team 
must be knowledgeable in the specific integrated safety analysis 
methodology being used.
    (3) Requirements for existing licensees. Individuals holding an NRC 
license on September 18, 2000 shall, with regard to existing licensed 
activities:
    (i) By April 18, 2001, submit for NRC approval, a plan that 
describes the integrated safety analysis approach that will be used, the

analysis of each process.
    (ii) By October 18, 2004, or in accordance with the approved plan 
submitted under Sec. 70.62(c)(3)(i), complete an integrated safety 
analysis, correct all unacceptable performance deficiencies, and submit, 
for NRC approval, an integrated safety analysis summary, including a 
description of the management measures, in accordance with Sec. 70.65. 
The Commission may approve a request for an alternative schedule for 
completing the correction of unacceptable performance deficiencies if 
the

[[Page 328]]

Commission determines that the alternative is warranted by consideration 
of the following:
    (A) Adequate compensatory measures have been established;
    (B) Whether it is technically feasible to complete the correction of 
the unacceptable performance deficiency within the allotted 4-year 
period;
    (C) Other site-specific factors which the Commission may consider 
appropriate on a case-by-case basis and that are beyond the control of 
the licensee.
    (iii) Pending the correction of unacceptable performance 
deficiencies identified during the conduct of the integrated safety 
analysis, the licensee shall implement appropriate compensatory measures 
to ensure adequate protection.
    (d) Management measures. Each applicant or licensee shall establish 
management measures to ensure compliance with the performance 
requirements of Sec. 70.61. The measures applied to a particular 
engineered or administrative control or control system may be graded 
commensurate with the reduction of the risk attributable to that control 
or control system. The management measures shall ensure that engineered 
and administrative controls and control systems that are identified as 
items relied on for safety pursuant to Sec. 70.61(e) of this subpart 
are designed, implemented, and maintained, as necessary, to ensure they 
are available and reliable to perform their function when needed, to 
comply with the performance requirements of Sec. 70.61 of this subpart.

shall address the following baseline design criteria in the design of 
new facilities. Each existing licensee shall address the following 
baseline design criteria in the design of new processes at existing 
facilities that require a license amendment under Sec. 70.72. The 
baseline design criteria must be applied to the design of new facilities 
and new processes, but do not require retrofits to existing facilities 
or existing processes (e.g., those housing or adjacent to the new 
process); however, all facilities and processes must comply with the 
performance requirements in Sec. 70.61. Licensees shall maintain the 
application of these criteria unless the analysis performed pursuant to 
Sec. 70.62(c) demonstrates that a given item is not relied on for 
safety or does not require adherence to the specified criteria.
    (1) Quality standards and records. The design must be developed and 
implemented in accordance with management measures, to provide adequate 
assurance that items relied on for safety will be available and reliable 
to perform their function when needed. Appropriate records of these 
items must be maintained by or under the control of the licensee 
throughout the life of the facility.
    (2) Natural phenomena hazards. The design must provide for adequate 
protection against natural phenomena with consideration of the most 
severe documented historical events for the site.
    (3) Fire protection. The design must provide for adequate protection 
against fires and explosions.
    (4) Environmental and dynamic effects. The design must provide for 
adequate protection from environmental conditions and dynamic effects 
associated with normal operations, maintenance, testing, and postulated 
accidents that could lead to loss of safety functions.
    (5) Chemical protection. The design must provide for adequate 
protection against chemical risks produced from licensed material, 
facility conditions which affect the safety of licensed material, and 
hazardous chemicals produced from licensed material.
    (6) Emergency capability. The design must provide for emergency 
capability to maintain control of:
    (i) Licensed material and hazardous chemicals produced from licensed 
material;
    (ii) Evacuation of on-site personnel; and
    (iii) Onsite emergency facilities and services that facilitate the 
use of available offsite services.
    (7) Utility services. The design must provide for continued 
operation of essential utility services.
    (8) Inspection, testing, and maintenance. The design of items relied 
on for

[[Page 329]]

safety must provide for adequate inspection, testing, and maintenance, 
to ensure their availability and reliability to perform their function 
when needed.
    (9) Criticality control. The design must provide for criticality 
control including adherence to the double contingency principle.
    (10) Instrumentation and controls. The design must provide for 
inclusion of instrumentation and control systems to monitor and control 
the behavior of items relied on for safety.
    (b) Facility and system design and facility layout must be based on 
defense-in-depth practices. \1\ The design must incorporate, to the 
extent practicable:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As used in Sec. 70.64, Requirements for new facilities or new 
processes at existing facilities, defense-in-depth practices means a 
design philosophy, applied from the outset and through completion of the 
design, that is based on providing successive levels of protection such 
that health and safety will not be wholly dependent upon any single 
element of the design, construction, maintenance, or operation of the 
facility. The net effect of incorporating defense-in-depth practices is 
a conservatively designed facility and system that will exhibit greater 
tolerance to failures and external challenges. The risk insights 
obtained through performance of the integrated safety analysis can be 
then used to supplement the final design by focusing attention on the 
prevention and mitigation of the higher-risk potential accidents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Preference for the selection of engineered controls over 
administrative controls to increase overall system reliability; and
    (2) Features that enhance safety by reducing challenges to items 
relied on for safety.

event.
    (b) Written reports. Each licensee that makes a report required by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall submit a written follow-up report 
within 30 days of the initial report. The written report must contain 
the information as described in Sec. 70.50(c)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 70.76  Backfitting.

    (a) For each licensee, this provision shall apply to Subpart H 
requirements as soon as the NRC approves that licensee's ISA Summary 
pursuant to Sec. 70.66. For requirements other than Subpart H, this 
provision applies regardless of the status of the approval of a 
licensee's ISA Summary.
    (1) Backfitting is defined as the modification of, or addition to, 
systems, structures, or components of a facility; or to the procedures 
or organization required to operate a facility; any of which may result 
from a new or amended provision in the Commission rules or the 
imposition of a regulatory staff position interpreting the Commission 
rules that is either new or different from a previous NRC staff 
position.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the 
Commission shall require a systematic and documented analysis pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section for backfits which it seeks to impose.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the 
Commission shall require the backfitting of a facility only when it 
determines, based on the analysis described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, that there is a substantial increase in the overall protection 
of the public health and safety or the common defense and security to be 
derived from the backfit and that the direct and indirect costs of 
implementation for that facility are justified in view of this increased 
protection.
    (4) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section 
are inapplicable and, therefore, backfit analysis is not required and 
the standards in paragraph (a)(3) of this section do not apply where the 
Commission finds and declares, with appropriately documented evaluation 
for its finding, any of the following:

[[Page 332]]

    (i) That a modification is necessary to bring a facility into 
compliance with Subpart H of this part;
    (ii) That a modification is necessary to bring a facility into 
compliance with a license or the rules or orders of the Commission, or 
into conformance with written commitments by the licensee;
    (iii) That regulatory action is necessary to ensure that the 
facility provides adequate protection to the health and safety of the 
public and is in accord with the common defense and security; or
    (iv) That the regulatory action involves defining or redefining what 
level of protection to the public health and safety or common defense 
and security should be regarded as adequate.
    (5) The Commission shall always require the backfitting of a 
facility if it determines that the regulatory action is necessary to 
ensure that the facility provides adequate protection to the health and 
safety of the public and is in accord with the common defense and 
security.
    (6) The documented evaluation required by paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section must include a statement of the objectives of and reasons for 
the modification and the basis for invoking the exception. If immediate 
effective regulatory action is required, then the documented evaluation 
may follow, rather than precede, the regulatory action.
    (7) If there are two or more ways to achieve compliance with a 
license or the rules or orders of the Commission, or with written 
license commitments, or there are two or more ways to reach an adequate 
level of protection, then ordinarily the licensee is free to choose the 
way that best suits its purposes. However, should it be necessary or 
appropriate for the Commission to prescribe a specific way to comply 
with its requirements or to achieve adequate protection, then cost may 
be a factor in selecting the way, provided that the objective of 
compliance or adequate protection is met.
    (b) In reaching the determination required by paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, the Commission will consider how the backfit should be 
scheduled in light of other ongoing regulatory activities at the 
facility and, in addition, will consider information available 
concerning any of the following factors as may be appropriate and any 
other information relevant and material to the proposed backfit:
    (1) Statement of the specific objectives that the proposed backfit 
is designed to achieve;
    (2) General description of the activity that would be required by 
the licensee in order to complete the backfit;
    (3) Potential change in the risk to the public from the accidental 
release of radioactive material and hazardous chemicals produced from 
licensed material;
    (4) Potential impact on radiological exposure or exposure to 
hazardous chemicals produced from licensed material of facility 
employees;
    (5) Installation and continuing costs associated with the backfit, 
including the cost of facility downtime;
    (6) The potential safety impact of changes in facility or 
operational complexity, including the relationship to proposed and 
existing regulatory requirements;
    (7) The estimated resource burden on the NRC associated with the 
proposed backfit and the availability of such resources;
    (8) The potential impact of differences in facility type, design, or 
age on the relevancy and practicality of the proposed backfit; and
    (9) Whether the proposed backfit is interim or final and, if 
interim, the justification for imposing the proposed backfit on an 
interim basis.
    (c) No license will be withheld during the pendency of backfit 
analyses required by the Commission's rules.
    (d) The Executive Director for Operations shall be responsible for 
implementation of this section, and all analyses required by this 
section shall be approved by the Executive Director for Operations or 
his or her designee.

regulations or orders issued in accordance with the Act or any 
amendments thereto;
    (b) Any license may be revoked, suspended or modified for any 
material false statements in the application or any statement of fact 
required under section 182 of the Act or because of conditions revealed 
by such application or statement of fact or any report, record, or 
inspection or other means which would warrant the Commission to refuse 
to grant a license on an original application, or for failure to 
construct or operate a facility in accordance with the terms of the 
construction permit or license, the technical specifications in the 
application, or for violation of, or failure to observe any of the terms 
and conditions of the Act, or of any regulation of the Commission.
    (c) Upon revocation, suspension or modification of a license, the 
Commission may immediately retake possession of all special nuclear 
material held by the licensee. In cases found by the Commission to be of 
extreme importance to the national defense or security, or to the health 
and safety of the public, the Commission may recapture any special 
nuclear material held by the licensee prior to any of the procedures 
provided under section 551-558 of title 5 of the United States Code.
    (d) Except in cases of willfulness or those in which the public 
health, interest or safety requires otherwise, no license shall be 
modified, suspended or revoked unless, prior to the institution of 
proceedings therefor, facts or conduct which may warrant such action 
shall have been called to the attention of the licensee in writing and 
the licensee shall have been accorded opportunity to demonstrate or 
achieve compliance with all lawful requirements.

Sec. 71.0  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part establishes--
    (1) Requirements for packaging, preparation for shipment, and 
transportation of licensed material; and
    (2) Procedures and standards for NRC approval of packaging and 
shipping procedures for fissile material and for a quantity of other 
licensed material in excess of a Type A quantity.
    (b) The packaging and transport of licensed material are also 
subject to other parts of this chapter (e.g., 10 CFR parts 20, 21, 30, 
40, 70, and 73) and to the regulations of other agencies (e.g., the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (DOT) and the U.S. Postal Service) \1\ 
having jurisdiction over means of transport. The requirements of this 
part are in addition to, and not in substitution for, other 
requirements.

    (c) The regulations in this part apply to any licensee authorized by 
specific or general license issued by the Commission to receive, 
possess, use, or transfer licensed material, if the licensee delivers 
that material to a carrier for transport, transports the material 
outside the site of usage as specified in the NRC license, or transports 
that material on public highways. No provision of this part authorizes 
possession of licensed material.
    (d)(1) Exemptions from the requirement for license in Sec. 71.3 are 
specified in Sec. 71.14. General licenses for which no NRC package 
approval is required are issued in Sec. Sec. 71.20 through 71.23. The 
general license in Sec. 71.17 requires that an NRC certificate of 
compliance or other package approval be issued for the package to be 
used under this general license.
    (2) Application for package approval must be completed in accordance 
with subpart D of this part, demonstrating that the design of the 
package to be used satisfies the package approval standards contained in 
subpart E of this part, as related to the tests of subpart F of this 
part.
    (3) A licensee transporting licensed material, or delivering 
licensed material to a carrier for transport, shall comply with the 
operating control requirements of subpart G of this part; the quality 
assurance requirements of subpart H of this part; and the general 
provisions of subpart A of this part, including DOT regulations 
referenced in Sec. 71.5.
    (e) The regulations of this part apply to any person holding, or 
applying for, a certificate of compliance, issued pursuant to this part, 
for a package intended for the transportation of radioactive material, 
outside the confines of a licensee's facility or authorized place of 
use.
    (f) The regulations in this part apply to any person required to 
obtain a certificate of compliance, or an approved compliance plan, 
pursuant to part 76 of this chapter, if the person delivers radioactive 
material to a common or contract carrier for transport or transports the 
material outside the confines of the person's plant or other authorized 
place of use.
    (g) This part also gives notice to all persons who knowingly provide 
to any licensee, certificate holder, quality assurance program approval 
holder, applicant for a license, certificate, or quality assurance 
program approval, or to a contractor, or subcontractor of any of them, 
components, equipment, materials, or other goods or services, that 
relate to a licensee's, certificate holder's, quality assurance program 
approval holder's, or applicant's activities subject to this part, that 
they may be individually subject to NRC enforcement action for violation 
of Sec. 71.8.

    Natural thorium means thorium with the naturally occurring 
distribution of thorium isotopes (essentially 100 weight percent 
thorium-232).
    Normal form radioactive material means radioactive material that has 
not been demonstrated to qualify as ``special form radioactive 
material.''
    Optimum interspersed hydrogenous moderation means the presence of 
hydrogenous material between packages to such an extent that the maximum 
nuclear reactivity results.
    Package means the packaging together with its radioactive contents 
as presented for transport.
    (1) Fissile material package or Type AF package, Type BF package, 
Type B(U)F package, or Type B(M)F package means a fissile material 
packaging together with its fissile material contents.
    (2) Type A package means a Type A packaging together with its 
radioactive contents. A Type A package is defined and must comply with 
the DOT regulations in 49 CFR part 173.
    (3) Type B package means a Type B packaging together with its 
radioactive contents. On approval, a Type B package design is designated 
by NRC as B(U) unless the package has a maximum normal operating 
pressure of more than 700 kPa (100 lbs/in\2\) gauge or a pressure relief 
device that would allow the release of radioactive material to the 
environment under the tests specified in Sec. 71.73 (hypothetical 
accident conditions), in which case it will receive a designation B(M). 
B(U) refers to the need for unilateral approval of international 
shipments; B(M) refers to the need for multilateral approval of 
international shipments. There is no distinction made in how packages 
with these designations may be used in domestic transportation. To 
determine their distinction for international transportation, see DOT 
regulations in 49 CFR Part 173. A Type B package approved before 
September 6, 1983, was designated only as Type B. Limitations on its use 
are specified in Sec. 71.19.
    Packaging means the assembly of components necessary to ensure 
compliance with the packaging requirements of this part. It may consist 
of one or more receptacles, absorbent materials, spacing structures,

equipment may be designated as part of the packaging.
    Special form radioactive material means radioactive material that 
satisfies the following conditions:
    (1) It is either a single solid piece or is contained in a sealed 
capsule that can be opened only by destroying the capsule;
    (2) The piece or capsule has at least one dimension not less than 5 
mm (0.2 in); and
    (3) It satisfies the requirements of Sec. 71.75. A special form 
encapsulation designed in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 71.4 
in effect on June 30, 1983

(see 10 CFR part 71, revised as of January 1, 1983), and constructed 
before July 1, 1985, and a special form encapsulation designed in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 71.4 in effect on March 31, 
1996 (see 10 CFR part 71, revised as of January 1, 1983), and 
constructed before April 1, 1998, may continue to be used. Any other 
special form encapsulation must meet the specifications of this 
definition.
    Specific activity of a radionuclide means the radioactivity of the 
radionuclide per unit mass of that nuclide. The specific activity of a 
material in which the radionuclide is essentially uniformly distributed 
is the radioactivity per unit mass of the material.
    Spent nuclear fuel or Spent fuel means fuel that has been withdrawn 
from a nuclear reactor following irradiation, has undergone at least 1 
year's decay since being used as a source of energy in a power reactor, 
and has not been chemically separated into its constituent elements by 
reprocessing. Spent fuel includes the special nuclear material, 
byproduct material, source material, and other radioactive materials 
associated with fuel assemblies.

<R05>
Sec. 71.9  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, certificate holder, an 
applicant for a Commission license or a CoC, or a contractor or 
subcontractor of any of these, against an employee for engaging in 
certain protected activities, is prohibited. Discrimination includes 
discharge and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, 
conditions, or privileges of employment. The protected activities are 
established in section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as 
amended, and in general are related to the administration or enforcement 
of a requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, or the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended.
    (1) The protected activities include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph 
(a) of this section or possible violations of requirements imposed under 
either of those statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in paragraph (a) of this section or under these 
requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) of this 
section; and
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee's assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraph (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, certificate holder, applicant for a Commission 
license or a CoC, or a contractor or subcontractor of any of these may 
be grounds for:
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license or the CoC;
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee, applicant, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of the licensee or applicant; or
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect 
an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.

[[Page 344]]

    (e)(1) Each licensee, certificate holder, and applicant for a 
license or CoC must prominently post the current revision of NRC Form 3, 
``Notice to Employees,'' referenced in Sec. 19.11(c) of this chapter. 
This form must be posted at locations sufficient to permit employees 
protected by this section to observe a copy on the way to or from their 
place of work. The premises must be posted not later than 30 days after 
an application is docketed and remain posted while the application is 
pending before the Commission, during the term of the license or CoC, 
and for 30 days following license or CoC termination.
    (2) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in Appendix D to Part 20 of this chapter, by 
calling (301) 415-7232, via e-mail to FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov, or by 
visiting the NRC's Web site at http://www.nrc.gov and selecting forms 
from the index found on the home page.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain 
any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an 
employee from participating in a protected activity as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section including, but not limited to, 
providing information to the NRC or to his or her employer on potential 
violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

<R05>
Sec. 71.43  General standards for all packages.

    (a) The smallest overall dimension of a package may not be less than 
10 cm (4 in).
    (b) The outside of a package must incorporate a feature, such as a 
seal, that is not readily breakable and that, while intact, would be 
evidence that the package has not been opened by unauthorized persons.
    (c) Each package must include a containment system securely closed 
by a positive fastening device that cannot be opened unintentionally or 
by a pressure that may arise within the package.
    (d) A package must be made of materials and construction that assure 
that there will be no significant chemical, galvanic, or other reaction 
among the packaging components, among package contents, or between the 
packaging components and the package contents, including possible 
reaction resulting from inleakage of water, to the maximum credible 
extent. Account must be taken of the behavior of materials under 
irradiation.
    (e) A package valve or other device, the failure of which would 
allow radioactive contents to escape, must be protected against 
unauthorized operation and, except for a pressure relief device, must be 
provided with an enclosure to retain any leakage.
    (f) A package must be designed, constructed, and prepared for 
shipment so that under the tests specified in Sec. 71.71 (``Normal 
conditions of transport'') there would be no loss or dispersal of 
radioactive contents, no significant increase in external surface 
radiation levels, and no substantial reduction in the effectiveness of 
the packaging.
    (g) A package must be designed, constructed, and prepared for 
transport so that in still air at 38 [deg]C (100 [deg]F) and in the 
shade, no accessible surface of a package would have a temperature 
exceeding 50 [deg]C (122 [deg]F) in a nonexclusive use shipment, or 85 
[deg]C (185 [deg]F) in an exclusive use shipment.
    (h) A package may not incorporate a feature intended to allow 
continuous venting during transport.


<R05>
Sec. 71.45  Lifting and tie-down standards for all packages.

    (a) Any lifting attachment that is a structural part of a package 
must be designed with a minimum safety factor of three against yielding 
when used to lift the package in the intended manner, and it must be 
designed so that failure of any lifting device under excessive load 
would not impair the ability of the package to meet other requirements 
of this subpart. Any other structural part of the package that could be 
used to lift the package must be capable of being rendered inoperable 
for lifting the package during transport, or must be designed with 
strength equivalent to that required for lifting attachments.
    (b) Tie-down devices:
    (1) If there is a system of tie-down devices that is a structural 
part of the package, the system must be capable of withstanding, without 
generating stress in any material of the package in excess of its yield 
strength, a static force applied to the center of gravity of the package 
having a vertical component of 2 times the weight of the package with 
its contents, a horizontal component along the direction in which the 
vehicle travels of 10 times the weight of the package with its contents, 
and a horizontal component in the transverse direction of 5 times the 
weight of the package with its contents.
    (2) Any other structural part of the package that could be used to 
tie down the package must be capable of being rendered inoperable for 
tying down the package during transport, or must be designed with 
strength equivalent to that required for tie-down devices.
    (3) Each tie-down device that is a structural part of a package must 
be designed so that failure of the device under excessive load would not 
impair

[[Page 352]]

the ability of the package to meet other requirements of this part.

Sec. 71.47  External radiation standards for all packages.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each 
package of radioactive materials offered for transportation must be 
designed and prepared for shipment so that under conditions normally 
incident to transportation the radiation level does not exceed 2 mSv/h 
(200 mrem/h) at any point on the external surface of the package, and 
the transport index does not exceed 10.
    (b) A package that exceeds the radiation level limits specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section must be transported by exclusive use 
shipment only, and the radiation levels for such shipment must not 
exceed the following during transportation:
    (1) 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) on the external surface of the package, 
unless the following conditions are met, in which case the limit is 10 
mSv/h (1000 mrem/h):
    (i) The shipment is made in a closed transport vehicle;
    (ii) The package is secured within the vehicle so that its position 
remains fixed during transportation; and
    (iii) There are no loading or unloading operations between the 
beginning and end of the transportation;
    (2) 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) at any point on the outer surface of the 
vehicle, including the top and underside of the vehicle; or in the case 
of a flat-bed style vehicle, at any point on the vertical planes 
projected from the outer edges of the vehicle, on the upper surface of 
the load or enclosure, if used, and on the lower external surface of the 
vehicle; and
    (3) 0.1 mSv/h (10 mrem/h) at any point 2 meters (80 in) from the 
outer lateral surfaces of the vehicle (excluding the top and underside 
of the vehicle); or in the case of a flat-bed style vehicle, at any 
point 2 meters (6.6 feet) from the vertical planes projected by the 
outer edges of the vehicle (excluding the top and underside of the 
vehicle); and
    (4) 0.02 mSv/h (2 mrem/h) in any normally occupied space, except 
that this provision does not apply to private carriers, if exposed 
personnel under their control wear radiation dosimetry devices in 
conformance with 10 CFR 20.1502.
    (c) For shipments made under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section, the shipper shall provide specific written instructions to the 
carrier for maintenance of the exclusive use shipment controls. The 
instructions must be included with the shipping paper information.
    (d) The written instructions required for exclusive use shipments 
must be sufficient so that, when followed, they will cause the carrier 
to avoid actions that will unnecessarily delay delivery or unnecessarily 
result in increased radiation levels or radiation exposures to transport 
workers or members of the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 71.51  Additional requirements for Type B packages.

    (a) A Type B package, in addition to satisfying the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 71.41 through 71.47, must be designed, constructed, and 
prepared for shipment so that under the tests specified in:

be no loss or dispersal of radioactive contents--as demonstrated to a 
sensitivity of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> A<INF>2</INF> per hour, no significant 
increase in external surface radiation levels, and no substantial 
reduction in the effectiveness of the packaging; and
    (2) Section 71.73 (``Hypothetical accident conditions''), there 
would be no escape of krypton-85 exceeding 10 A<INF>2</INF> in 1 week, 
no escape of other radioactive material exceeding a total amount 
A<INF>2</INF> in 1 week, and no external radiation dose rate exceeding 
10 mSv/h (1 rem/h) at 1 m (40 in) from the external surface of the 
package.
    (b) Where mixtures of different radionuclides are present, the 
provisions of appendix A, paragraph IV of this part shall apply, except 
that for Krypton-85, an effective A<INF>2</INF> value equal to 10 
A<INF>2</INF> may be used.
    (c) Compliance with the permitted activity release limits of 
paragraph (a) of this section may not depend on filters or on a 
mechanical cooling system.

[[Page 353]]

    (d) For packages which contain radioactive contents with activity 
greater than 10\5\ A<INF>2</INF>, the requirements of Sec. 71.61 must

Sec. 71.53  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 71.55  General requirements for fissile material packages.

    (a) A package used for the shipment of fissile material must be 
designed and constructed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 71.41 through 
71.47. When required by the total amount of radioactive material, a 
package used for the shipment of fissile material must also be designed 
and constructed in accordance with Sec. 71.51.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (g) of this section, a 
package used for the shipment of fissile material must be so designed 
and constructed and its contents so limited that it would be subcritical 
if water were to leak into the containment system, or liquid contents 
were to leak out of the containment system so that, under the following 
conditions, maximum reactivity of the fissile material would be 
attained:
    (1) The most reactive credible configuration consistent with the 
chemical and physical form of the material;
    (2) Moderation by water to the most reactive credible extent; and
    (3) Close full reflection of the containment system by water on all 
sides, or such greater reflection of the containment system as may 
additionally be provided by the surrounding material of the packaging.
    (c) The Commission may approve exceptions to the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section if the package incorporates special design 
features that ensure that no single packaging error would permit 
leakage, and if appropriate measures are taken before each shipment to 
ensure that the containment system does not leak.
    (d) A package used for the shipment of fissile material must be so 
designed and constructed and its contents so limited that under the 
tests specified in Sec. 71.71 (``Normal conditions of transport'')--
    (1) The contents would be subcritical;
    (2) The geometric form of the package contents would not be 
substantially altered;
    (3) There would be no leakage of water into the containment system 
unless, in the evaluation of undamaged packages under Sec. 71.59(a)(1), 
it has been assumed that moderation is present to such an extent as to 
cause maximum reactivity consistent with the chemical and physical form 
of the material; and
    (4) There will be no substantial reduction in the effectiveness of 
the packaging, including:
    (i) No more than 5 percent reduction in the total effective volume 
of the packaging on which nuclear safety is assessed;
    (ii) No more than 5 percent reduction in the effective spacing 
between the fissile contents and the outer surface of the packaging; and
    (iii) No occurrence of an aperture in the outer surface of the 
packaging large enough to permit the entry of a 10 cm (4 in) cube.
    (e) A package used for the shipment of fissile material must be so 
designed and constructed and its contents so limited that under the 
tests specified in Sec. 71.73 (``Hypothetical accident conditions''), 
the package would be subcritical. For this determination, it must be 
assumed that:
    (1) The fissile material is in the most reactive credible 
configuration consistent with the damaged condition of the package and 
the chemical and physical form of the contents;
    (2) Water moderation occurs to the most reactive credible extent 
consistent with the damaged condition of the package and the chemical 
and physical form of the contents; and
    (3) There is full reflection by water on all sides, as close as is 
consistent with the damaged condition of the package.
    (f) For fissile material package designs to be transported by air:
    (1) The package must be designed and constructed, and its contents 
limited so that it would be subcritical, assuming reflection by 20 cm 
(7.9 in) of water but no water inleakage, when subjected to sequential 
application of:
    (i) The free drop test in Sec. 71.73(c)(1);

[[Page 354]]

    (ii) The crush test in Sec. 71.73(c)(2);
    (iii) A puncture test, for packages of 250 kg or more, consisting of 
a free drop of the specimen through a distance of 3 m (120 in) in a 
position for which maximum damage is expected at the conclusion of the 
test sequence, onto the upper end of a solid, vertical, cylindrical, 
mild steel probe mounted on an essentially unyielding, horizontal 
surface. The probe must be 20 cm (7.9 in) in diameter, with the striking 
end forming the frustum of a right circular cone with the dimensions of 
30 cm height, 2.5 cm top diameter, and a top edge rounded to a radius of 
not more than 6 mm (0.25 in). For packages less than 250 kg, the 
puncture test must be the same, except that a 250 kg probe must be 
dropped onto the specimen which must be placed on the surface; and
    (iv) The thermal test in Sec. 71.73(c)(4), except that the duration 
of the test must be 60 minutes.
    (2) The package must be designed and constructed, and its contents 
limited, so that it would be subcritical, assuming reflection by 20 cm 
(7.9 in) of water but no water inleakage, when subjected to an impact on 
an unyielding surface at a velocity of 90 m/s normal to the surface, at 
such orientation so as to result in maximum damage. A separate, 
undamaged specimen can be used for this evaluation.
    (3) Allowance may not be made for the special design features in 
paragraph (c) of this section, unless water leakage into or out of void 
spaces is prevented following application of the tests in paragraphs 
(f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section, and subsequent application of the 
immersion test in Sec. 71.73(c)(5).
    (g) Packages containing uranium hexafluoride only are excepted from 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section provided that:
    (1) Following the tests specified in Sec. 71.73 (``Hypothetical 
accident conditions''), there is no physical contact between the valve 
body and any other component of the packaging, other than at its 
original point of attachment, and the valve remains leak tight;
    (2) There is an adequate quality control in the manufacture, 
maintenance, and repair of packagings;
    (3) Each package is tested to demonstrate closure before each 
shipment; and
    (4) The uranium is enriched to not more than 5 weight percent 
uranium-235.

<R05>
Sec. 71.59  Standards for arrays of fissile material packages.

    (a) A fissile material package must be controlled by either the 
shipper or the carrier during transport to assure that an array of such 
packages remains subcritical. To enable this control, the designer of a 
fissile material package shall derive a number ``N'' based on all the 
following conditions being satisfied, assuming packages are stacked 
together in any arrangement and with close full reflection on all sides 
of the stack by water:
    (1) Five times ``N'' undamaged packages with nothing between the 
packages would be subcritical;
    (2) Two times ``N'' damaged packages, if each package were subjected 
to the tests specified in Sec. 71.73 (``Hypothetical accident 
conditions'') would be subcritical with optimum interspersed hydrogenous 
moderation; and
    (3) The value of ``N'' cannot be less than 0.5.
    (b) The CSI must be determined by dividing the number 50 by the 
value of ``N'' derived using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section. The value of the CSI may be zero provided that an 
unlimited number of packages are subcritical, such that the value of 
``N'' is effectively equal to infinity under the procedures specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. Any CSI greater than zero must be rounded 
up to the first decimal place.
    (c) For a fissile material package which is assigned a CSI value--
    (1) Less than or equal to 50, that package may be shipped by a 
carrier in a nonexclusive use conveyance, provided the sum of the CSIs

Sec. 71.64  Special requirements for plutonium air shipments.

    (a) A package for the shipment of plutonium by air subject to Sec. 
71.88(a)(4), in addition to satisfying the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
71.41 through 71.63, as applicable, must be designed, constructed, and 
prepared for shipment so that under the tests specified in--
    (1) Section 71.74 (``Accident conditions for air transport of 
plutonium'')--
    (i) The containment vessel would not be ruptured in its post-tested 
condition, and the package must provide a sufficient degree of

h) at a distance of 1 m (40 in) from the surface of the package in its 
post-tested condition in air; and
    (iii) A single package and an array of packages are demonstrated to 
be subcritical in accordance with this part, except that the damaged 
condition of the package must be considered to be that which results 
from the plutonium accident tests in Sec. 71.74, rather than the 
hypothetical accident tests in Sec. 71.73; and
    (2) Section 71.74(c), there would be no detectable leakage of water 
into the containment vessel of the package.
    (b) With respect to the package requirements of paragraph (a), there 
must be a demonstration or analytical assessment showing that--
    (1) The results of the physical testing for package qualification 
would not be adversely affected to a significant extent by--
    (i) The presence, during the tests, of the actual contents that will 
be transported in the package; and
    (ii) Ambient water temperatures ranging from 0.6 [deg]C (+33 [deg]F) 
to 38[deg]C (+100[deg]F) for those qualification tests involving water, 
and ambient atmospheric temperatures ranging from -40 [deg]C (-40 
[deg]F) to +54[deg]C (+130[deg]F) for the other qualification tests.
    (2) The ability of the package to meet the acceptance standards 
prescribed for the accident condition sequential tests would not be 
adversely affected if one or more tests in the sequence were deleted.

Sec. 71.71  Normal conditions of transport.

    (a) Evaluation. Evaluation of each package design under normal 
conditions of transport must include a determination of the effect on 
that design of

[[Page 356]]

the conditions and tests specified in this section. Separate specimens 
may be used for the free drop test, the compression test, and the 
penetration test, if each specimen is subjected to the water spray test 
before being subjected to any of the other tests.
    (b) Initial conditions. With respect to the initial conditions for 
the tests in this section, the demonstration of compliance with the 
requirements of this part must be based on the ambient temperature 
preceding and following the tests remaining constant at that value 
between -29 [deg]C (-20 [deg]F) and +38 [deg]C (+100 [deg]F) which is 
most unfavorable for the feature under consideration. The initial 
internal pressure within the containment system must be considered to be 
the maximum normal operating pressure, unless a lower internal pressure 
consistent with the ambient temperature considered to precede and follow 
the tests is more unfavorable.
    (c) Conditions and tests--(1) Heat. An ambient temperature of 38

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (8) Corner drop. A free drop onto each corner of the package in 
succession, or in the case of a cylindrical package onto each quarter of 
each rim, from a height of 0.3 m (1 ft) onto a flat, essentially 
unyielding, horizontal surface. This test applies only to fiberboard, 
wood, or fissile material rectangular packages not exceeding 50 kg (110 
lbs) and fiberboard, wood, or fissile material cylindrical packages not 
exceeding 100 kg (220 lbs).
    (9) Compression. For packages weighing up to 5000 kg (11,000 lbs), 
the package must be subjected, for a period of 24 hours, to a 
compressive load applied uniformly to the top and bottom of the package 
in the position in which the package would normally be transported. The 
compressive load must be the greater of the following:
    (i) The equivalent of 5 times the weight of the package; or
    (ii) The equivalent of 13 kPa (2 lbf/in\2\) multiplied by the 
vertically projected area of the package.
    (10) Penetration. Impact of the hemispherical end of a vertical 
steel cylinder of 3.2 cm (1.25 in) diameter and 6 kg (13 lbs) mass, 
dropped from a height of 1 m (40 in) onto the exposed surface of the 
package that is expected to be most vulnerable to puncture. The long 
axis of the cylinder must be perpendicular to the package surface.


<R05>
Sec. 71.73  Hypothetical accident conditions.

    (a) Test procedures. Evaluation for hypothetical accident conditions 
is to be based on sequential application of the tests specified in this 
section, in the order indicated, to determine their cumulative effect on 
a package or array of packages. An undamaged specimen may be used for 
the water immersion

[[Page 357]]

tests specified in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
    (b) Test conditions. With respect to the initial conditions for the 
tests, except for the water immersion tests, to demonstrate compliance 
with the requirements of this part during testing, the ambient air 
temperature before and after the tests must remain constant at that 
value between -29 [deg]C (-20 [deg]F) and +38 [deg]C (+100 [deg]F) which 
is most unfavorable for the feature under consideration. The initial 
internal pressure within the containment system must be the maximum 
normal operating pressure, unless a lower internal pressure, consistent 
with the ambient temperature assumed to precede and follow the tests, is 
more unfavorable.
    (c) Tests. Tests for hypothetical accident conditions must be 
conducted as follows:
    (1) Free drop. A free drop of the specimen through a distance of 9 m 
(30 ft) onto a flat, essentially unyielding, horizontal surface, 
striking the surface in a position for which maximum damage is expected.
    (2) Crush. Subjection of the specimen to a dynamic crush test by 
positioning the specimen on a flat, essentially unyielding horizontal 
surface so as to suffer maximum damage by the drop of a 500-kg (1100-lb) 
mass from 9 m (30 ft) onto the specimen. The mass must consist of a 
solid mild steel plate 1 m (40 in) by 1 m (40 in) and must fall in a 
horizontal attitude. The crush test is required only when the specimen 
has a mass not greater than 500 kg (1100 lb), an overall density not 
greater than 1000 kg/m \3\ (62.4 lb/ft \3\) based on external dimension, 
and radioactive contents greater than 1000 A<INF>2</INF> not as special 
form radioactive material. For packages containing fissile material, the 
radioactive contents greater than 1000 A<INF>2</INF> criterion does not 
apply.
    (3) Puncture. A free drop of the specimen through a distance of 1 m 
(40 in) in a position for which maximum damage is expected, onto the 
upper end of a solid, vertical, cylindrical, mild steel bar mounted on 
an essentially unyielding, horizontal surface. The bar must be 15 cm (6 
in) in diameter, with the top horizontal and its edge rounded to a 
radius of not more than 6 mm (0.25 in), and of a length as to cause 
maximum damage to the package, but not less than 20 cm (8 in) long. The 
long axis of the bar must be vertical.
    (4) Thermal. Exposure of the specimen fully engulfed, except for a 
simple support system, in a hydrocarbon fuel/air fire of sufficient 
extent, and in sufficiently quiescent ambient conditions, to provide an 
average emissivity coefficient of at least 0.9, with an average flame 
temperature of at least 800 [deg]C (1475 [deg]F) for a period of 30 
minutes, or any other thermal test that provides the equivalent total 
heat input to the package and which provides a time averaged 
environmental temperature of 800 [deg]C. The fuel source must extend 
horizontally at least 1 m (40 in), but may not extend more than 3 m (10 
ft), beyond any external surface of the specimen, and the specimen must 
be positioned 1 m (40 in) above the surface of the fuel source. For 
purposes of calculation, the surface absorptivity coefficient must be 
either that value which the package may be expected to possess if 
exposed to the fire specified or 0.8, whichever is greater; and the 
convective coefficient must be that value which may be demonstrated to 
exist if the package were exposed to the fire specified. Artificial 
cooling may not be applied after cessation of external heat input, and 
any combustion of materials of construction, must be allowed to proceed 
until it terminates naturally.
    (5) Immersion--fissile material. For fissile material subject to 
Sec. 71.55, in those cases where water inleakage has not been assumed 
for criticality analysis, immersion under a head of water of at least 
0.9 m (3 ft) in the attitude for which maximum leakage is expected.
    (6) Immersion--all packages. A separate, undamaged specimen must be 
subjected to water pressure equivalent to immersion under a head of 
water of at least 15 m (50 ft). For test purposes, an external pressure 
of water of 150 kPa (21.7 lbf/in\2\) gauge is considered to meet these 
conditions.

<R05>
Sec. 71.74  Accident conditions for air transport of plutonium.

    (a) Test conditions--Sequence of tests. A package must be physically 
tested to

[[Page 358]]

the following conditions in the order indicated to determine their 
cumulative effect.
    (1) Impact at a velocity of not less than 129 m/sec (422 ft/sec) at 
a right angle onto a flat, essentially unyielding, horizontal surface, 
in the orientation (e.g., side, end, corner) expected to result in 
maximum damage at the conclusion of the test sequence.
    (2) A static compressive load of 31,800 kg (70,000 lbs) applied in 
the orientation expected to result in maximum damage at the conclusion 
of the test sequence. The force on the package must be developed between 
a flat steel surface and a 5 cm (2 in) wide, straight, solid, steel bar. 
The length of the bar must be at least as long as the diameter of the 
package, and the longitudinal axis of the bar must be parallel to the 
plane of the flat surface. The load must be applied to the bar in a 
manner that prevents any members or devices used to support the bar from 
contacting the package.
    (3) Packages weighing less than 227 kg (500 lbs) must be placed on a 
flat, essentially unyielding, horizontal surface, and subjected to a 
weight of 227 kg (500 lbs) falling from a height of 3 m (10 ft) and 
striking in the position expected to result in maximum damage at the 
conclusion of the test sequence. The end of the weight contacting the 
package must be a solid probe made of mild steel. The probe must be the 
shape of the frustum of a right circular cone, 30 cm (12 in) long, 20 cm 
(8 in) in diameter at the base, and 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter at the 
end. The longitudinal axis of the probe must be perpendicular to the 
horizontal surface. For packages weighing 227 kg (500 lbs) or more, the 
base of the probe must be placed on a flat, essentially unyielding 
horizontal surface, and the package dropped from a height of 3 m (10 ft) 
onto the probe, striking in the position expected to result in maximum 
damage at the conclusion of the test sequence.
    (4) The package must be firmly restrained and supported such that 
its longitudinal axis is inclined approximately 45[deg] to the 
horizontal. The area of the package that made first contact with the 
impact surface in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be in the 
lowermost position. The package must be struck at approximately the 
center of its vertical projection by the end of a structural steel angle 
section falling from a height of at least 46 m (150 ft). The angle 
section must be at least 1.8 m (6 ft) in length with equal legs at least 
13 cm (5 in) long and 1.3 cm (0.5 in) thick. The angle section must be 
guided in such a way as to fall end-on, without tumbling. The package 
must be rotated approximately 90[deg] about its longitudinal axis and 
struck by the steel angle section falling as before.
    (5) The package must be exposed to luminous flames from a pool fire 
of JP-4 or JP-5 aviation fuel for a period of at least 60 minutes. The 
luminous flames must extend an average of at least 0.9 m (3 ft) and no 
more than 3 m (10 ft) beyond the package in all horizontal directions. 
The position and orientation of the package in relation to the fuel must 
be that which is expected to result in maximum damage at the conclusion 
of the test sequence. An alternate method of thermal testing may be 
substituted for this fire test, provided that the alternate test is not 
of shorter duration and would not result in a lower heating rate to the 
package. At the conclusion of the thermal test, the package must be 
allowed to cool naturally or must be cooled by water sprinkling, 
whichever is expected to result in maximum damage at the conclusion of 
the test sequence.
    (6) Immersion under at least 0.9 m (3 ft) of water.
    (b) Individual free-fall impact test. (1) An undamaged package must 
be physically subjected to an impact at a velocity not less than the 
calculated terminal free-fall velocity, at mean sea level, at a right 
angle onto a flat, essentially unyielding, horizontal surface, in the 
orientation (e.g., side, end, corner) expected to result in maximum 
damage.
    (2) This test is not required if the calculated terminal free-fall 
velocity of the package is less than 129 m/sec (422 ft/sec), or if a 
velocity not less than either 129 m/sec (422 ft/sec) or the calculated 
terminal free-fall velocity of the package is used in the sequential 
test of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) Individual deep submersion test. An undamaged package must be 
physically submerged and physically subjected to

[[Page 359]]

an external water pressure of at least 4 MPa (600 lbs/in \2\).


<R05>
Sec. 71.75  Qualification of special form radioactive material.

    (a) Special form radioactive materials must meet the test 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Each solid radioactive 
material or capsule specimen to be tested must be manufactured or 
fabricated so that it is representative of the actual solid material or 
capsule that will be transported, with the proposed radioactive content 
duplicated as closely as practicable. Any differences between the 
material to be transported and the test material, such as the use of 
non-radioactive contents, must be taken into account in determining 
whether the test requirements have been met. In addition:
    (1) A different specimen may be used for each of the tests;
    (2) The specimen may not break or shatter when subjected to the 
impact, percussion, or bending tests;
    (3) The specimen may not melt or disperse when subjected to the heat 
test;
    (4) After each test, leaktightness or indispersibility of the 
specimen must be determined by a method no less sensitive than the 
leaching assessment procedure prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section. For a capsule resistant to corrosion by water, and which has an 
internal void volume greater than 0.1 milliliter, an alternative to the 
leaching assessment is a demonstration of leaktightness of 
x10<SUP>-4</SUP> torr-liter/s (1.3xx10<SUP>-4</SUP> atm-cm\3\/s) based 
on air at 25 [deg]C (77 [deg]F) and one atmosphere differential pressure 
for solid radioactive content, or x10<SUP>-6</SUP> torr-liter/s 
(1.3xx10<SUP>-6</SUP> atm-cm\3\/s) for liquid or gaseous radioactive 
content; and
    (5) A specimen that comprises or simulates radioactive material 
contained in a sealed capsule need not be subjected to the leaktightness 
procedure specified in this section, provided it is alternatively 
subjected to any of the tests prescribed in ISO/TR4826-1979(E), ``Sealed 
radioactive sources leak test methods'' which is available from the 
American National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 
10018.
    (b) Test methods--(1) Impact Test. The specimen must fall onto the 
target from a height of 9 m (30 ft) or greater in the orientation 
expected to result in maximum damage. The target must be a flat, 
horizontal surface of such mass and rigidity that any increase in its 
resistance to displacement or deformation, on impact by the specimen, 
would not significantly increase the damage to the specimen.
    (2) Percussion Test. (i) The specimen must be placed on a sheet of 
lead that is supported by a smooth solid surface, and struck by the flat 
face of a steel billet so as to produce an impact equivalent to that 
resulting from a free drop of 1.4 kg (3 lbs) through 1 m (40 in);
    (ii) The flat face of the billet must be 25 millimeters (mm) (1 
inch) in diameter with the edges rounded off to a radius of 3 mm <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq> 0.3 mm(.12 in <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 0.012 in);
    (iii) The lead must be hardness number 3.5 to 4.5 on the Vickers 
scale and thickness 25 mm (1 in) or greater, and must cover an area 
greater than that covered by the specimen;
    (iv) A fresh surface of lead must be used for each impact; and
    (v) The billet must strike the specimen so as to cause maximum 
damage.
    (3) Bending test. (i) This test applies only to long, slender 
sources with a length of 10 cm (4 inches) or greater and a length to 
width ratio of 10 or greater;
    (ii) The specimen must be rigidly clamped in a horizontal position 
so that one half of its length protrudes from the face of the clamp;
    (iii) The orientation of the specimen must be such that the specimen 
will suffer maximum damage when its free end is struck by the flat face 
of a steel billet;
    (iv) The billet must strike the specimen so as to produce an impact 
equivalent to that resulting from a free vertical drop of 1.4 kg (3 lbs) 
through 1 m (40 in); and
    (v) The flat face of the billet must be 25 mm (1 inch) in diameter 
with the edges rounded off to a radius of 3 mm <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 
0.3 mm (.12 in <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 0.012 in).
    (4) Heat test. The specimen must be heated in air to a temperature 
of not less than 800 [deg]C (1475 [deg]F), held at that temperature for 
a period of 10 minutes, and then allowed to cool.

[[Page 360]]

material--
    (i) The specimen must be immersed for 7 days in water at ambient 
temperature. The water must have a pH of 6-8 and a maximum conductivity

[deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>9 [deg]F) and maintained at that 
temperature for 4 hours;
    (vi) The activity of the water must then be determined. The sum of 
the activities determined here and in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this 
section must not exceed 2 kilobecquerels (kBq) (0.05 microcurie 
([micro]Ci)).
    (2) For encapsulated material--

those planned and systematic actions necessary to provide adequate 
confidence that a system or component will perform satisfactorily in 
service. Quality assurance includes quality control, which comprises 
those quality assurance actions related to control of the physical 
characteristics and quality of the material or component to 
predetermined requirements. The licensee, certificate holder, and 
applicant for a CoC are responsible for the quality assurance 
requirements as they apply to design, fabrication, testing, and 
modification of packaging. Each licensee is responsible for the quality 
assurance provision which applies to its use of a packaging for the 
shipment of licensed material subject to this subpart.
    (b) Establishment of program. Each licensee, certificate holder, and 
applicant for a CoC shall establish, maintain, and execute a quality 
assurance program satisfying each of the applicable criteria of 
Sec. Sec. 71.101 through 71.137 and satisfying any specific provisions 
that are applicable to the licensee's activities including procurement 
of packaging. The licensee, certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC 
shall execute the applicable criteria in a graded approach to an extent 
that is commensurate with the quality assurance requirement's importance 
to safety.
    (c) Approval of program. (1) Before the use of any package for the 
shipment of licensed material subject to this subpart, each licensee 
shall obtain Commission approval of its quality assurance program. Using 
an appropriate method listed in Sec. 71.1(a), each licensee shall file 
a description of its quality assurance program, including a discussion 
of which requirements of this subpart are applicable and how they will 
be satisfied, by submitting the description to: ATTN: Document Control 
Desk, Director, Division of Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation, 
Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.
    (2) Before the fabrication, testing, or modification of any package

licensee, certificate holder, or applicant for a CoC shall obtain 
Commission approval of its quality assurance program. Each certificate 
holder or applicant for a CoC shall, in accordance with Sec. 71.1, file 
a description of its quality assurance program, including a discussion 
of which requirements of this subpart are applicable and how they will 
be satisfied.
    (d) Existing package designs. The provisions of this paragraph deal 
with packages that have been approved for use in accordance with this 
part before January 1, 1979, and which have been designed in accordance 
with the provisions of this part in effect at the time of application 
for package approval. Those packages will be accepted as having been 
designed in accordance with a quality assurance program that satisfies 
the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Existing packages. The provisions of this paragraph deal with 
packages that have been approved for use in accordance with this part 
before January 1, 1979, have been at least partially fabricated before 
that date, and for which the fabrication is in accordance with the 
provisions of this part in effect at the time of application for 
approval of package design. These packages will be accepted as having 
been fabricated and assembled in accordance with a quality assurance 
program that satisfies the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) Previously approved programs. A Commission-approved quality 
assurance program that satisfies the applicable criteria of subpart H of 
this part, Appendix B of part 50 of this chapter, or subpart G of part 
72 of this chapter, and that is established, maintained,

[[Page 367]]

and executed regarding transport packages, will be accepted as 
satisfying the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Before 
first use, the licensee, certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC 
shall notify the NRC, in accordance with Sec. 71.1, of its intent to 
apply its previously approved subpart H, Appendix B, or subpart G 
quality assurance program to transportation activities. The licensee, 
certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC shall identify the program 
by date of submittal to the Commission, Docket Number, and date of 
Commission approval.
    (g) Radiography containers. A program for transport container 
inspection and maintenance limited to radiographic exposure devices, 
source changers, or packages transporting these devices and meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 34.31(b) of this chapter or equivalent Agreement 
State requirement, is deemed to satisfy the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
71.17(b) and 71.101(b).

Sec. 71.103  Quality assurance organization.

    (a) The licensee, \2\ certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC 
shall be responsible for the establishment and execution of the quality 
assurance program. The licensee, certificate holder, and applicant for a 
CoC may delegate to others, such as contractors, agents, or consultants, 
the work of establishing and executing the quality assurance program, or 
any part of the quality assurance program, but shall retain 
responsibility for the program. These activities include performing the 
functions associated with attaining quality objectives and the quality 
assurance functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ While the term ``licensee'' is used in these criteria, the 
requirements are applicable to whatever design, fabrication, assembly, 
and testing of the package is accomplished with respect to a package 
before the time a package approval is issued.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The quality assurance functions are--
    (1) Assuring that an appropriate quality assurance program is 
established and effectively executed; and
    (2) Verifying, by procedures such as checking, auditing, and 
inspection, that activities affecting the functions that are important 
to safety have been correctly performed.
    (c) The persons and organizations performing quality assurance 
functions must have sufficient authority and organizational freedom to--
    (1) Identify quality problems;
    (2) Initiate, recommend, or provide solutions; and
    (3) Verify implementation of solutions.
    (d) The persons and organizations performing quality assurance 
functions shall report to a management level that assures that the 
required authority and organizational freedom, including sufficient 
independence from cost and schedule, when opposed to safety 
considerations, are provided.
    (e) Because of the many variables involved, such as the number of 
personnel, the type of activity being performed, and the location or 
locations where activities are performed, the organizational structure 
for executing the quality assurance program may take various forms, 
provided that the persons and organizations assigned the quality 
assurance functions have the required authority and organizational 
freedom.
    (f) Irrespective of the organizational structure, the individual(s) 
assigned the responsibility for assuring effective execution of any 
portion of the quality assurance program, at any location where 
activities subject to this section are being performed, must have direct 
access to the levels of management necessary to perform this function.

     Sec. Appendix A to Part 71--Determination of A<INF>1</INF> and 
                              A<INF>2</INF>

    I. Values of A<INF>1</INF> and A<INF>2</INF> for individual 
radionuclides, which are the bases for many activity limits elsewhere in 
these regulations, are given in Table A-1. The curie (Ci) values 
specified are obtained by converting from the Terabecquerel (TBq) value. 
The Terabecquerel values are the regulatory

[[Page 372]]

standard. The curie values are for information only and are not intended 
to be the regulatory standard. Where values of A<INF>1</INF> and 
A<INF>2</INF> are unlimited, it is for radiation control purposes only. 
For nuclear criticality safety, some materials are subject to controls 
placed on fissile material.
    II. a. For individual radionuclides whose identities are known, but 
which are not listed in Table A-1, the A<INF>1</INF> and A<INF>2</INF> 
values contained in Table A-3 may be used. Otherwise, the licensee shall 
obtain prior Commission approval of the A<INF>1</INF> and A<INF>2</INF> 
values for radionuclides not listed in Table A-1, before shipping the 
material.
    b. For individual radionuclides whose identities are known, but 
which are not listed in Table A-2, the exempt material activity 
concentration and exempt consignment activity values contained in Table 
A-3 may be used. Otherwise, the licensee shall obtain prior Commission 
approval of the exempt material activity concentration and exempt 
consignment activity values for radionuclides not listed in Table A-2, 
before shipping the material.
    c. The licensee shall submit requests for prior approval, described 
under paragraphs II.a. and II.b. of this Appendix, to the Commission, in 
accordance with Sec. 71.1 of this part.
    III. In the calculations of A<INF>1</INF> and A<INF>2</INF> for a 
radionuclide not in Table A-1, a single radioactive decay chain, in 
which radionuclides are present in their naturally occurring 
proportions, and in which no daughter radionuclide has a half-life 
either longer than 10 days, or longer than that of the parent 
radionuclide, shall be considered as a single radionuclide, and the 
activity to be taken into account, and the A<INF>1</INF> and 
A<INF>2</INF> value to be applied, shall be those corresponding to the 
parent radionuclide of that chain. In the case of radioactive decay 
chains in which any daughter radionuclide has a half-life either longer 
than 10 days, or greater than that of the parent radionuclide, the 
parent and those daughter radionuclides shall be considered as mixtures 
of different radionuclides.
    IV. For mixtures of radionuclides whose identities and respective 
activities are known, the following conditions apply:
    a. For special form radioactive material, the maximum quantity 
transported in a Type A package is as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JA04.014

where B(i) is the activity of radionuclide I, and A<INF>1</INF>(i) is 
the A<INF>1</INF> value for radionuclide I.
    b. For normal form radioactive material, the maximum quantity 
transported in a Type A package is as follows:

[Sigma]B(i)/A<INF>2</INF> (i) <= 1

where B(i) is the activity of radionuclide i, and A<INF>2</INF>(i) is 
the A<INF>2</INF> value for radionuclide i.
    c. Alternatively, the A<INF>1</INF> value for mixtures of special 
form material may be determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JA04.016

where f(i) is the fraction of activity for radionuclide I in the 
mixture, and A<INF>1</INF>(i) is the appropriate A<INF>1</INF> value for 
radionuclide I.
    d. Alternatively, the A<INF>2</INF> value for mixtures of normal 
form material may be determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JA04.017

where f(i) is the fraction of activity for radionuclide I in the 
mixture, and A<INF>2</INF>(i) is the appropriate A<INF>2</INF> value for 
radionuclide I.
    e. The exempt activity concentration for mixtures of nuclides may be 
determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JA04.018

where f(i) is the fraction of activity concentration of radionuclide I 
in the mixture, and [A] is the activity concentration for exempt 
material containing radionuclide I.
    f. The activity limit for an exempt consignment for mixtures of 
radionuclides may be determined as follows:

[[Page 373]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JA04.019

where f(i) is the fraction of activity of radionuclide I in the mixture, 
and A is the activity limit for exempt consignments for radionuclide I.
    V. When the identity of each radionuclide is known, but the 
individual activities of some of the radionuclides are not known, the 
radionuclides may be grouped, and the lowest A<INF>1</INF> or 
A<INF>2</INF> value, as appropriate, for the radionuclides in each group 
may be used in applying the formulas in paragraph IV. Groups may be 
based on the total alpha activity and the total beta/gamma activity when 
these are known, using the lowest A<INF>1</INF> or A<INF>2</INF> values 
for the alpha emitters and beta/gamma emitters.

a A1 and/or A2 values include contributions from daughter nuclides with half-lives less than 10 days.
b The values of A1 and A2 in Curies (Ci) are approximate and for information only; the regulatory standard units are Terabecquerels (TBq), (see Appendix
  A to part 71--Determination of A1 and A2, Section I.). For radionuclide Bi-205, the specific activity is corrected to 1.5 x 10\3\ TBq/g. For
  radionuclide Cm-248, the specific activity is corrected to 1.6 x 10-\4\ TBq/g. For radionuclide Eu-150 (long lived), the A1 value is corrected to 7.0
  x 10-\1\ TBq. For radionuclide Te-132(a), the specific activity is corrected to 3.0 x 10\5\ Ci/g.
c The quantity may be determined from a measurement of the rate of decay or a measurement of the radiation level at a prescribed distance from the
  source.
d These values apply only to compounds of uranium that take the chemical form of UF6, UO2F2 and UO2(NO3)2 in both normal and accident conditions of
  transport.
e These values apply only to compounds of uranium that take the chemical form of UO3, UF4, UCl4 and hexavalent compounds in both normal and accident
  conditions of transport.
f These values apply to all compounds of uranium other than those specified in notes (d) and (e) of this table.
g These values apply to unirradiated uranium only.

Sec. 72.10  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, certificate holder, an 
applicant for a Commission license or a CoC, or a contractor or 
subcontractor of any of these, against an employee for engaging in 
certain protected activities, is prohibited. Discrimination includes 
discharge and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, 
conditions, or

[[Page 396]]

privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 
section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in 
general are related to the administration or enforcement of a 
requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy 
Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph 
(a) introductory text of this section or possible violations of 
requirements imposed under either of those statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text or under these 
requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory 
text.
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraph (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, certificate holder, applicant for a Commission 
license or a CoC, or a contractor or subcontractor of any of these may 
be grounds for:
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license or the CoC.
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee, applicant, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of the licensee or applicant.
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect 
an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.
    (e)(1) Each licensee, certificate holder, and applicant for a 
license or CoC must prominently post the revision of NRC Form 3, 
``Notice to Employees,'' referenced in 10 CFR 19.11(c). This form must 
be posted at locations sufficient to permit employees protected by this 
section to observe a copy on the way to or from their place of work. The 
premises must be posted not later than 30 days after an application is 
docketed and remain posted while the application is pending before the 
Commission, during the term of the license or CoC, and for 30 days 
following license or CoC termination.
    (2) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in appendix D to part 20 of this chapter, by 
calling (301) 415-7232, via e-mail to FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov, or by 
visiting the NRC's Web site at

[[Page 397]]

http://www.nrc.gov and selecting forms from the index found on the home 
page.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain 
any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an 
employee from participating in protected activity as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section including, but not limited to, 
providing information to the NRC or to his or her employer on potential 
violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

Sec. 72.30  Financial assurance and recordkeeping for decommissioning.

    (a) Each application under this part must include a proposed 
decommissioning plan that contains sufficient information on proposed 
practices and procedures for the decontamination of the site and 
facilities and for disposal of residual radioactive materials after all 
spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and reactor-related GTCC waste 
have been removed, in order to provide reasonable assurance that the 
decontamination and decommissioning of the ISFSI or MRS at the end of 
its useful life will provide adequate protection to the health and 
safety of the public. This plan must identify and discuss those design 
features of the ISFSI or MRS that facilitate its decontamination and 
decommissioning at the end of its useful life.
    (b) The proposed decommissioning plan must also include a 
decommissioning funding plan containing information on how reasonable 
assurance will be provided that funds will be available to decommission 
the ISFSI or MRS. This information must include a cost estimate for 
decommissioning and a description of the method of assuring funds for 
decommissioning from paragraph (c) of this section, including means of 
adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels periodically over 
the life of the ISFSI or MRS.
    (c) Financial assurance for decommissioning must be provided by one 
or more of the following methods:
    (1) Prepayment. Prepayment is the deposit prior to the start of 
operation into an account segregated from licensee assets and outside 
the licensee's administrative control of cash or liquid assets such that 
the amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs. 
Prepayment may be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government 
fund, certificate of deposit, or deposit of government securities.
    (2) A surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method. These 
methods guarantee that decommissioning costs will be paid. A surety 
method may be in the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, or line of 
credit. A parent company guarantee of funds for decommissioning costs 
based on a financial test may be used if the guarantee and test are as 
contained in appendix A to part 30. A parent company guarantee may not 
be used in combination with other financial methods to satisfy the 
requirements of this section. For commercial corporations that issue 
bonds, a guarantee of funds by the applicant or licensee for 
decommissioning costs based on a financial test may be used if the 
guarantee and test are as contained in appendix C to part 30. For 
commercial corporations that do not issue bonds, a guarantee of funds by 
the applicant or licensee for decommissioning costs may be used if the 
guarantee and test are as contained in appendix D to part 30. A 
guarantee by the applicant or licensee may not be used in combination 
with any other financial methods used to satisfy the requirements of 
this section or in any situation where the applicant or licensee has a 
parent company holding majority control of the voting stock of the 
company. Any surety method or insurance used to provide financial 
assurance for decommissioning must contain the following conditions:
    (i) The surety method or insurance must be open-ended or, if written 
for a specified term, such as five years, must be renewed automatically 
unless 90 days or more prior to the renewal date, the issuer notifies 
the Commission, the beneficiary, and the licensee of its intention not 
to renew. The surety method or insurance must also provide that the full 
face amount be paid to the beneficiary automatically prior to the 
expiration without proof of forfeiture if the licensee fails to provide 
a replacement acceptable to the Commission withing 30 days after receipt 
of notification or cancellation.
    (ii) The surety method or insurance must be payable to a trust 
established for decomissioning costs. The trustee and trust must be 
acceptable to the Commission. An acceptable trustee includes an 
appropriate State or Federal government agency or an entity which has 
the authority to act as a trustee

[[Page 403]]

and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or 
State agency.
    (iii) The surety or insurance must remain in effect until the 
Commission has terminated the license.
    (3) An external sinking fund in which deposits are made at least 
annually, coupled with a surety method or insurance, the value of which 
may decrease by the amount being accumulated in the sinking fund. An 
external sinking fund is a fund establishing and maintained by setting 
aside funds periodically in an account segregated from licensee assets 
and outside the licensee's administrative control in which the total 
amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs at the 
time termination of operation is expected. An external sinking fund may 
be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government fund, certificate 
of deposit, or deposit of government securities. The surety or insurance 
provision must be as stated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (4) In the case of Federal, State, or local government licensees, a 
statement of intent containing a cost estimate for decommissioning, and 
indicating that funds for decommissioning will be obtained when 
necessary.
    (5) In the case of licensees who are issued a power reactor license 
under Part 50 of this chapter, the methods of 10 CFR 50.75(b), (e), and 
(h), as applicable.
    (6) When a governmental entity is assuming ownership of a site, an 
arrangement that is deemed acceptable by such governmental entity.
    (d) Each person licensed under this part shall keep records of 
information important to the decommissioning of a facility in an 
identified location until the site is released for unrestricted use. If 
records important to the decommissioning of a facility are kept for 
other purposes, reference to these records and their locations may be 
used. Information the Commission considers important to decommissioning 
consists of--
    (1) Records of spills or other unusual occurrences involving the 
spread of contamination in and around the facility, equipment, or site. 
These records may be limited to instances when contamination remains 
after any cleanup procedures or when there is reasonable likelihood that 
contaminants may have spread to inaccessible areas as in the case of 
possible seepage into porous materials such as concrete. These records 
must include any known information on identification of involved 
nuclides, quantities, forms, and concentrations.
    (2) As-built drawings and modifications of structures and equipment 
in restricted areas where radioactive materials are used and/or stored, 
and of locations of possible inaccessible contamination such as buried 
pipes which may be subject to contamination. If required drawings are 
referenced, each relevant document need not be indexed individually. If 
drawings are not available, the licensee shall substitute appropriate 
records of available information concerning these areas and locations.
    (3) A list contained in a single document and updated no less than 
every 2 years of the following:
    (i) All areas designated and formerly designated as restricted areas 
as defined under 10 CFR 20.1003; and
    (ii) All areas outside of restricted areas that require 
documentation under Sec. 72.30(d)(1).
    (4) Records of the cost estimate performed for the decommissioning 
funding plan or of the amount certified for decommissioning, and records 
of the funding method used for assuring funds if either a funding plan 
or certification is used.

<R05>
Sec. 72.30  Financial assurance and recordkeeping for decommissioning.

                                * * * * *

    (b) Each holder of, or applicant for, a license under this part must 
submit for NRC review and approval a decommissioning funding plan that 
must contain:
    (1) Information on how reasonable assurance will be provided that 
funds will be available to decommission the ISFSI or MRS.
    (2) A detailed cost estimate for decommissioning, in an amount 
reflecting:
    (i) The cost of an independent contractor to perform all 
decommissioning activities;
    (ii) An adequate contingency factor; and
    (iii) The cost of meeting the Sec. 20.1402 of this chapter criteria 
for unrestricted use, provided that, if the applicant or licensee can 
demonstrate its ability to meet the provisions of Sec. 20.1403 of this 
chapter, the cost estimate may be based on meeting the Sec. 20.1403 
criteria.
    (3) Identification of and justification for using the key 
assumptions contained in the DCE.
    (4) A description of the method of assuring funds for 
decommissioning from paragraph (e) of this section, including means for 
adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels periodically over 
the life of the facility.
    (5) The volume of onsite subsurface material containing residual 
radioactivity that will require remediation to meet the criteria for 
license termination.
    (6) A certification that financial assurance for decommissioning has 
been provided in the amount of the cost estimate for decommissioning.
    (c) At the time of license renewal and at intervals not to exceed 3 
years, the decommissioning funding plan must be resubmitted with 
adjustments as necessary to account for changes in costs and the extent 
of contamination. If the amount of financial assurance will be adjusted 
downward, this can not be done until the updated decommissioning funding 
plan is approved. The decommissioning funding plan must update the 
information submitted with the original or prior approved plan and must 
specifically consider the effect of the following events on 
decommissioning costs:
    (1) Spills of radioactive material producing additional residual 
radioactivity in onsite subsurface material.
    (2) Facility modifications.
    (3) Changes in authorized possession limits.
    (4) Actual remediation costs that exceed the previous cost estimate.
    (d) If, in surveys made under 10 CFR 20.1501(a), residual 
radioactivity in soils or groundwater is detected at levels that would 
require such radioactivity to be reduced to a level permitting release 
of the property for unrestricted use under the decommissioning 
requirements in part 20 of this chapter, the licensee must submit a new 
or revised decommissioning funding plan within one year of when the 
survey is completed.
    (e) The financial instrument must include the licensee's name, 
license number, and docket number; and the name, address, and other 
contact information of the issuer, and, if a trust is used, the trustee. 
When any of the foregoing information changes, the licensee must, within 
30 days, submit financial instruments reflecting such changes. Financial 
assurance for decommissioning must be provided by one or more of the 
following methods:
    (1) Prepayment. Prepayment is the deposit before the start of 
operation into an account segregated from licensee assets and outside 
the licensee's administrative control of cash or liquid assets such that 
the amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs. 
Prepayment must be made into a trust account, and the trustee and the 
trust must be acceptable to the Commission.
    (2) A surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method. These 
methods guarantee that decommissioning costs will be paid. A surety 
method may be in the form of a surety bond, or letter of credit. A 
parent company guarantee of funds for decommissioning costs based on a 
financial test may be used if the guarantee and test are as contained in 
Appendix A to part 30 of this chapter. For commercial corporations that 
issue bonds, a guarantee of funds by the applicant or licensee for 
decommissioning costs based on a financial test may be used if the 
guarantee and test are as contained in Appendix C to part 30 of this 
chapter. For commercial companies that do not issue bonds, a guarantee 
of funds by the applicant or licensee for decommissioning costs may be 
used if the guarantee and test are as contained in Appendix D to part 30 
of this chapter. Except for an external sinking fund, a parent company 
guarantee or a guarantee by the applicant or licensee may not be used in 
combination with other financial methods to satisfy the requirements of 
this section. A guarantee by the applicant or licensee may not be used 
in any situation where the applicant or licensee has a parent company 
holding majority control of the voting stock of the company. Any surety 
method or insurance used to provide financial assurance for 
decommissioning must contain the following conditions:

                                * * * * *

    (3) An external sinking fund in which deposits are made at least 
annually, coupled with a surety method, insurance, or other guarantee 
method, the value of which may decrease by the amount being accumulated 
in the sinking fund.

[[Page 405]]

An external sinking fund is a fund established and maintained by setting 
aside funds periodically in an account segregated from licensee assets 
and outside the licensee's administrative control in which the total 
amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs at the 
time termination of operation is expected. An external sinking fund must 
be in the form of a trust. If the other guarantee method is used, no 
surety or insurance may be combined with the external sinking fund. The 
surety, insurance, or other guarantee provisions must be as stated in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

                                * * * * *

    (5) In the case of licensees who are issued a power reactor license 
under part 50 of this chapter or ISFSI licensees who are an electric 
utility, as defined in part 50 of this chapter, with a specific license 
issued under this part, the methods of 10 CFR 50.75(b), (e), and (h), as 
applicable. In the event that funds remaining to be placed into the 
licensee's ISFSI decommissioning external sinking fund are no longer 
approved for recovery in rates by a competent rate making authority, the 
licensee must make changes to provide financial assurance using one or 
more of the methods stated in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this 
section.
    (f) * * *
    (3) * * *
    (ii) All areas outside of restricted areas that require 
documentation under Sec. 72.30(f)(1).
    (4) Records of the cost estimate performed for the decommissioning 
funding plan and records of the funding method used for assuring funds 
are available for decommissioning.
    (g) In providing financial assurance under this section, each 
licensee must use the financial assurance funds only for decommissioning 
activities and each licensee must monitor the balance of funds held to 
account for market variations. The licensee must replenish the funds, 
and report such actions to the NRC, as follows:
    (1) If, at the end of a calendar year, the fund balance is below the 
amount necessary to cover the cost of decommissioning, but is not below 
75 percent of the cost, the licensee must increase the balance to cover 
the cost, and must do so within 30 days after the end of the calendar 
year.
    (2) If, at any time, the fund balance falls below 75 percent of the 
amount necessary to cover the cost of decommissioning, the licensee must 
increase the balance to cover the cost, and must do so within 30 days of 
the occurrence.
    (3) Within 30 days of taking the actions required by paragraph 
(g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section, the licensee must provide a written 
report of such actions to the Director, Office of Federal and State 
Materials and Environmental Management Programs, and state the new 
balance of the fund.

Sec. 72.54  Expiration and termination of licenses and decommissioning
of sites and separate buildings or outdoor areas.

    (a) Each specific license expires at the end of the day on the 
expiration date stated in the license except when a licensee has filed 
an application for renewal pursuant to Sec. 72.42 not less than 24 
months before the expiration of the existing license. If an application 
for renewal has been filed at least 24 months prior to the expiration 
date stated in the existing license, the existing license expires at the 
end of the day on which the Commission makes a final determination to 
deny the renewal application or, if the determination states an 
expiration date, the expiration date stated in the determination.
    (b) Each specific license revoked by the Commission expires at the 
end of the day on the date of the Commission's final determination to 
revoke the license or on the expiration date stated in the determination 
or as otherwise provided by Commission Order.
    (c) Each specific license continues in effect, beyond the expiration 
date if necessary, with respect to possession of licensed material until 
the Commission notifies the licensee in writing that the license is 
terminated. During this time, the licensee shall--
    (1) Limit actions involving spent fuel, reactor-related GTCC waste, 
or other licensed material to those related to decommissioning; and
    (2) Continue to control entry to restricted areas until they are 
suitable for release in accordance with NRC requirements.
    (d) As required by Sec. 72.42(b), or within 60 days of the 
occurrence of any of the following, consistent with the administrative 
directions in Sec. 72.4, each licensee shall notify the NRC in writing, 
and submit within 12 months of this notification, a final 
decommissioning plan and begin decommissioning upon approval of the plan 
if--
    (1) The licensee has decided to permanently cease principal 
activities, as defined in this part, at the entire site or any separate 
building or outdoor area that contains residual radioactivity such that 
the building or outdoor area is unsuitable for release in accordance 
with NRC requirements; or
    (2) No principal activities under the license have been conducted 
for a period of 24 months; or
    (3) No principal activities have been conducted for a period of 24 
months in any separate building or outdoor area that contains residual 
radioactivity such that the building or outdoor area is unsuitable for 
release in accordance with NRC requirements.
    (e) Coincident with the notification required by paragraph (d) of 
this section, the licensee shall maintain in effect all decommissioning 
financial assurances established by the licensee pursuant to Sec. 72.30 
in conjunction with a license issuance or renewal or as required by this 
section. The amount of the financial assurance must be increased, or may 
be decreased, as appropriate, to cover the detailed cost estimate for 
decommissioning established pursuant to paragraph (g)(5) of this 
section.
    (1) Any licensee who has not provided financial assurance to cover 
the detailed cost estimate submitted with the decommissioning plan shall 
do so when this rule becomes effective November 24, 1995.
    (2) Following approval of the decommissioning plan, a licensee may 
reduce the amount of the financial assurance as decommissioning proceeds 
and radiological contamination is reduced at the site with the approval 
of the Commission.
    (f)(1) The Commission may grant a request to delay or postpone 
initiation of the decommissioning process if the Commission determines 
that this relief is not detrimental to the public health and safety and 
is otherwise in the public interest. The request must be submitted no 
later than 30 days before notification pursuant to paragraph (d) of

[[Page 417]]

this section. The schedule for decommissioning set forth in paragraph 
(d) of this section may not commence until the Commission has made a 
determination on the request.
    (2) The Commission may approve an alternate schedule for submittal 
of the final decommissioning plan required pursuant to paragraph (d) of 
this section if the Commission determines that the alternate schedule is 
necessary to the effective conduct of decommissioning operations and 
presents no undue risk from radiation to the public health and safety, 
and is otherwise to the public interest.
    (g) The proposed final decommissioning plan must include--
    (1) A description of the current conditions of the site or separate 
building or outdoor area sufficient to evaluate the acceptability of the 
plan;
    (2) The choice of the alternative for decommissioning with a 
description of the activities involved;
    (3) A description of controls and limits on procedures and equipment 
to protect occupational and public health and safety;
    (4) A description of the planned final radiation survey; and
    (5) An updated detailed cost estimate for the chosen alternative for 
decommissioning, comparison of that estimate with present funds set 
aside for decommissioning, and plan for assuring the availability of 
adequate funds for completion of decommissioning including means for 
adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels over any storage 
or surveillance period; and
    (6) A description of technical specifications and quality assurance 
provisions in place during decommissioning.
    (h) For final decommissioning plans in which the major dismantlement 
activities are delayed by first placing the ISFSI or MRS in storage, 
planning for these delayed activities may be less detailed. Updated 
detailed plans must be submitted and approved prior to the start of 
these activities.
    (i) If the final decommissioning plan demonstrates that the 
decommissioning will be completed as soon as practicable, performed in 
accordance with the regulations in this chapter, and will not be 
inimical to the common defense and security or to the health and safety 
of the public, and after notice to interested persons, the Commission 
will approve the plan subject to any appropriate conditions and 
limitations and issue an order authorizing decommissioning.
    (j)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, each 
licensee shall complete decommissioning of the site or separate building 
or outdoor area as soon as practicable but no later than 24 months 
following approval of the final decommissioning plan by the Commission.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, when 
decommissioning involves the entire site, each licensee shall request 
license termination as soon as practicable but no later than 24 months 
following approval of the final decommissioning plan by the Commission.
    (k) The Commission may approve a request for an alternate schedule 
for completion of decommissioning of the site or separate building or 
outdoor area, and license termination if appropriate, if the Commission 
determines that the alternate schedule is warranted by consideration of 
the following:
    (1) Whether it is technically feasible to complete decommissioning 
within the allotted 24-month period;
    (2) Whether sufficient waste disposal capacity is available to allow 
completion of decommissioning within the allotted 24-month period;
    (3) Whether a significant volume reduction in wastes requiring 
disposal will be achieved by allowing short-lived radionuclides to 
decay;
    (4) Whether a significant reduction in radiation exposure to workers 
can be achieved by allowing short-lived radionuclides to decay; and
    (5) Other site-specific factors that the Commission may consider 
appropriate on a case-by-case basis, such as regulatory requirements of 
other government agencies, lawsuits, ground-water treatment activities, 
monitored natural ground-water restoration, actions that could result in 
more environmental harm than deferred cleanup, and other factors beyond 
the control of the licensee.
    (l) As the final step in decommissioning, the licensee shall--

[[Page 418]]

    (1) Certify the disposition of all licensed material, including 
accumulated wastes, by submitting a completed NRC Form 314 or equivalent 
information; and
    (2) Conduct a radiation survey of the premises where the licensed 
activities were conducted and submit a report of the results of this 
survey, unless the licensee demonstrates in some other manner that the 
premises are suitable for release in accordance with the criteria for 
decommissioning in 10 CFR part 20, subpart E. The licensee shall, as 
appropriate--
    (i) Report levels of gamma radiation in units of millisieverts 
(microroentgen) per hour at one meter from surfaces, and report levels 
of radioactivity, including alpha and beta, in units of megabecquerels 
(disintegrations per minute or microcuries) per 100 square centimeters 
removable and fixed for surfaces, megabecquerels (microcuries) per 
milliliter for water, and becquerels (picocuries) per gram for solids 
such as soils or concrete; and
    (ii) Specify the survey instrument(s) used and certify that each 
instrument is properly calibrated and tested.
    (m) Specific licenses, including expired licenses, will be 
terminated by written notice to the licensee when the Commission 
determines that--
    (1) The decommissioning has been performed in accordance with the 
approved final decommissioning plan and the order authorizing 
decommissioning; and
    (2)(i) A radiation survey has been performed which demonstrates that 
the premises are suitable for release in accordance with the criteria 
for decommissioning in 10 CFR part 20, subpart E; or
    (ii) Other information submitted by the licensee is sufficient to 
demonstrate that the premises are suitable for release in accordance 
with the criteria for decommissioning in 10 CFR part 20, subpart E.
    (3) Records required by Sec. 72.80(e) have been received.

environmental impact of the ISFSI or MRS must be investigated and 
assessed.
    (b) Proposed sites for the ISFSI or MRS must be examined with 
respect to the frequency and the severity of external natural and man-
induced events that could affect the safe operation of the ISFSI or MRS.
    (c) Design basis external events must be determined for each 
combination of proposed site and proposed ISFSI or MRS design.
    (d) Proposed sites with design basis external events for which 
adequate protection cannot be provided through ISFSI or MRS design shall 
be deemed

[[Page 427]]

unsuitable for the location of the ISFSI or MRS.
    (e) Pursuant to subpart A of part 51 of this chapter for each 
proposed site for an ISFSI and pursuant to sections 141 or 148 of NWPA, 
as appropriate (96 Stat. 2241, 101 Stat. 1330-235, 42 U.S.C. 10161, 
10168) for each proposed site for an MRS, the potential for radiological 
and other environmental impacts on the region must be evaluated with due 
consideration of the characteristics of the population, including its 
distribution, and of the regional environs, including its historical and 
esthetic values.
    (f) The facility must be sited so as to avoid to the extent possible 
the long-term and short-term adverse impacts associated with the 
occupancy and modification of floodplains.


<R05>
Sec. 72.92  Design basis external natural events.

    (a) Natural phenomena that may exist or that can occur in the region 
of a proposed site must be identified and assessed according to their 
potential effects on the safe operation of the ISFSI or MRS. The 
important natural phenomena that affect the ISFSI or MRS design must be 
identified.
    (b) Records of the occurrence and severity of those important 
natural phenomena must be collected for the region and evaluated for 
reliability, accuracy, and completeness. The applicant shall retain 
these records until the license is issued.
    (c) Appropriate methods must be adopted for evaluating the design 
basis external natural events based on the characteristics of the region 
and the current state of knowledge about such events.


<R05>
Sec. 72.94  Design basis external man-induced events.

    (a) The region must be examined for both past and present man-made 
facilities and activities that might endanger the proposed ISFSI or MRS. 
The important potential man-induced events that affect the ISFSI or MRS 
design must be identified.
    (b) Information concerning the potential occurrence and severity of 
such events must be collected and evaluated for reliability, accuracy, 
and completeness.
    (c) Appropriate methods must be adopted for evaluating the design 
basis external man-induced events, based on the current state of 
knowledge about such events.


<R05>
Sec. 72.96  Siting limitations.

    (a) An ISFSI which is owned and operated by DOE must not be located 
at any site within which there is a candidate site for a HLW repository. 
This limitation shall apply until such time as DOE decides that such 
candidate site is no longer a candidate site under consideration for 
development as a HLW repository.
    (b) An MRS must not be sited in any State in which there is located 
any site approved for site characterization for a HLW repository. This 
limitation shall apply until such time as DOE decides that the candidate 
site is no longer a candidate site under consideration for development 
as a repository. This limitation shall continue to apply to any site 
selected for construction as a repository.
    (c) If an MRS is located, or is planned to be located, within 50 
miles of the first HLW repository, any Commission decision approving the 
first HLW repository application must limit the quantity of spent fuel 
or high-level radioactive waste that may be stored. This limitation 
shall prohibit the storage of a quantity of spent fuel containing in 
excess of 70,000 metric tons of heavy metal, or a quantity of solidified 
high-level radioactive waste resulting from the reprocessing of such a 
quantity of spent fuel, in both the repository and the MRS until such 
time as a second repository is in operation.
    (d) An MRS authorized by section 142(b) of NWPA (101 Stat. 1330-232, 
42 U.S.C. 10162(b)) may not be constructed in the State of Nevada. The 
quantity of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste that may 
be stored at an MRS authorized by section 142(b) of NWPA shall be 
subject to the limitations in Sec. 72.44(g) of this part instead of the 
limitations in paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 72.98  Identifying regions around an ISFSI or MRS site.

    (a) The regional extent of external phenomena, man-made or natural, 
that are used as a basis for the design of the ISFSI or MRS must be 
identified.
    (b) The potential regional impact due to the construction, operation 
or decommissioning of the ISFSI or MRS must be identified. The extent of 
regional impacts must be determined on the basis of potential measurable 
effects on the population or the environment from ISFSI or MRS 
activities.
    (c) Those regions identified pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section must be investigated as appropriate with respect to:
    (1) The present and future character and the distribution of 
population,
    (2) Consideration of present and projected future uses of land and 
water within the region, and
    (3) Any special characteristics that may influence the potential 
consequences of a release of radioactive material during the operational 
lifetime of the ISFSI or MRS.


<R05>
Sec. 72.100  Defining potential effects of the ISFSI or MRS on the region.

    (a) The proposed site must be evaluated with respect to the effects 
on populations in the region resulting from the release of radioactive 
materials under normal and accident conditions during operation and 
decommissioning of the ISFSI or MRS; in this evaluation both usual and 
unusual regional and site characteristics shall be taken into account.
    (b) Each site must be evaluated with respect to the effects on the 
regional environment resulting from construction, operation, and 
decommissioning for the ISFSI or MRS; in this evaluation both usual and 
unusual regional and site characteristics must be taken into account.

applications before October 16, 2003 and applications for other
than dry cask modes of storage.

    (a)(1) East of the Rocky Mountain Front (east of approximately 
104[deg] west longitude), except in areas of known seismic activity 
including but not limited to the regions around New Madrid, MO, 
Charleston, SC, and Attica, NY, sites will be acceptable if the results 
from onsite foundation and geological investigation, literature review, 
and regional geological reconnaissance show no unstable geological 
characteristics, soil stability problems, or potential for vibratory 
ground motion at the site in excess of an appropriate response spectrum 
anchored at 0.2 g.
    (2) For those sites that have been evaluated under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section that are east of the Rocky Mountain Front, and that are 
not in areas of known seismic activity, a standardized design earthquake 
(DE) described by an appropriate response spectrum anchored at 0.25 g 
may be used. Alternatively, a site-specific DE may be determined by 
using the criteria and level of investigations required by appendix A of 
part 100 of this chapter.
    (b) West of the Rocky Mountain Front (west of approximately 104[deg] 
west longitude), and in other areas of known potential seismic activity, 
seismicity will be evaluated by the techniques of appendix A of part 100 
of this chapter. Sites that lie within the range of strong near-field 
ground motion from historical earthquakes on large capable faults should 
be avoided.
    (c) Sites other than bedrock sites must be evaluated for their 
liquefaction potential or other soil instability due to vibratory ground 
motion.
    (d) Site-specific investigations and laboratory analyses must show 
that soil conditions are adequate for the proposed foundation loading.
    (e) In an evaluation of alternative sites, those which require a 
minimum of engineered provisions to correct site deficiencies are 
preferred. Sites with unstable geologic characteristics should be 
avoided.
    (f) The design earthquake (DE) for use in the design of structures 
must be determined as follows:
    (1) For sites that have been evaluated under the criteria of 
appendix A of 10 CFR part 100, the DE must be equivalent to the safe 
shutdown earthquake (SSE) for a nuclear power plant.
    (2) Regardless of the results of the investigations anywhere in the 
continental U.S., the DE must have a value

[[Page 429]]

for the horizontal ground motion of no less than 0.10 g with the 
appropriate response spectrum.

104[deg] west longitude), except in areas of known seismic activity 
including but not limited to the regions around New Madrid, MO; 
Charleston, SC; and Attica, NY; sites will be acceptable if the results 
from onsite foundation and geological investigation, literature review, 
and regional geological reconnaissance show no unstable geological 
characteristics, soil stability problems, or potential for vibratory 
ground motion at the site in excess of an appropriate response spectrum 
anchored at 0.2 g.
    (2) For those sites that have been evaluated under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section that are east of the Rocky Mountain Front, and that are 
not in areas of known seismic activity, a standardized design earthquake 
ground motion (DE) described by an appropriate response spectrum 
anchored at 0.25 g may be used. Alternatively, a site-specific DE may be 
determined by using the criteria and level of investigations required by 
paragraph (f) of this section. For a site with a co-located nuclear 
power plant (NPP), the existing geological and seismological design 
criteria for the NPP may be used. If the existing design criteria for 
the NPP is used and the site has multiple NPPs, then the criteria for 
the most recent NPP must be used.
    (b) West of the Rocky Mountain Front (west of approximately 104[deg] 
west longitude), and in other areas of known potential seismic activity 
east of the Rocky Mountain Front, seismicity must be evaluated by the 
techniques presented in paragraph (f) of this section. If an ISFSI or 
MRS is located on an NPP site, the existing geological and seismological 
design criteria for the NPP may be used. If the existing design criteria 
for the NPP is used and the site has multiple NPPs, then the criteria 
for the most recent NPP must be used.
    (c) Sites other than bedrock sites must be evaluated for their 
liquefaction potential or other soil instability due to vibratory ground 
motion.
    (d) Site-specific investigations and laboratory analyses must show 
that soil conditions are adequate for the proposed foundation loading.
    (e) In an evaluation of alternative sites, those which require a 
minimum of engineered provisions to correct site deficiencies are 
preferred. Sites with unstable geologic characteristics should be 
avoided.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, 
the DE for use in the design of structures, systems, and components must 
be determined as follows:
    (1) Geological, seismological, and engineering characteristics. The 
geological, seismological, and engineering characteristics of a site and 
its environs must be investigated in sufficient scope and detail to 
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed site, to provide 
sufficient information to support evaluations performed to arrive at 
estimates of the DE, and to permit adequate engineering solutions to 
actual or potential geologic and seismic effects at the proposed site. 
The size of the region to be investigated and the type of data pertinent 
to the investigations must be determined based on the nature of the 
region surrounding the proposed site. Data on the vibratory ground 
motion, tectonic surface deformation, nontectonic deformation, 
earthquake recurrence rates, fault geometry and slip rates, site 
foundation material, and seismically induced floods and water waves must 
be obtained by reviewing pertinent literature and carrying out field 
investigations. However, each applicant shall investigate all geologic 
and seismic factors (for example, volcanic activity) that may affect the 
design and operation of the proposed ISFSI or MRS facility irrespective 
of whether these factors are explicitly included in this section.
    (2) Geologic and seismic siting factors. The geologic and seismic 
siting factors considered for design must include a determination of the 
DE for the site, the potential for surface tectonic and nontectonic 
deformations, the design

[[Page 430]]

bases for seismically induced floods and water waves, and other design 
conditions as stated in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (i) Determination of the Design Earthquake Ground Motion (DE). The 
DE for the site is characterized by both horizontal and vertical free-
field ground motion response spectra at the free ground surface. In view 
of the limited data available on vibratory ground motions for strong 
earthquakes, it usually will be appropriate that the design response 
spectra be smoothed spectra. The DE for the site is determined 
considering the results of the investigations required by paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section. Uncertainties are inherent in these estimates 
and must be addressed through an appropriate analysis, such as a 
probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) or suitable sensitivity 
analyses.
    (ii) Determination of the potential for surface tectonic and 
nontectonic deformations. Sufficient geological, seismological, and 
geophysical data must be provided to clearly establish if there is a 
potential for surface deformation.
    (iii) Determination of design bases for seismically induced floods 
and water waves. The size of seismically induced floods and water waves 
that could affect a site from either locally or distantly generated 
seismic activity must be determined.
    (iv) Determination of siting factors for other design conditions. 
Siting factors for other design conditions that must be evaluated 
include soil and rock stability, liquefaction potential, and natural and 
artificial slope stability. Each applicant shall evaluate all siting 
factors and potential causes of failure, such as, the physical 
properties of the materials underlying the site, ground disruption, and 
the effects of vibratory ground motion that may affect the design and 
operation of the proposed ISFSI or MRS.
    (3) Regardless of the results of the investigations anywhere in the 
continental U.S., the DE must have a value for the horizontal ground 
motion of no less than 0.10 g with the appropriate response spectrum.

                    Subpart F_General Design Criteria


<R05>
Sec. 72.120  General considerations.

    (a) As required by Sec. 72.24, an application to store spent fuel 
or reactor-related GTCC waste in an ISFSI or to store spent fuel, high-
level radioactive waste, or reactor-related GTCC waste in an MRS must 
include the design criteria for the proposed storage installation. These 
design criteria establish the design, fabrication, construction, 
testing, maintenance and performance requirements for structures, 
systems, and components important to safety as defined in Sec. 72.3. 
The general design criteria identified in this subpart establish minimum 
requirements for the design criteria for an ISFSI or an MRS. Any 
omissions in these general design criteria do not relieve the applicant 
from the requirement of providing the necessary safety features in the 
design of the ISFSI or MRS.
    (b) The ISFSI must be designed to store spent fuel and/or solid 
reactor-related GTCC waste.
    (1) Reactor-related GTCC waste may not be stored in a cask that also 
contains spent fuel. This restriction does not include radioactive 
materials that are associated with fuel assemblies (e.g., control rod 
blades or assemblies, thimble plugs, burnable poison rod assemblies, or 
fuel channels);
    (2) Liquid reactor-related GTCC wastes may not be received or stored 
in an ISFSI; and
    (3) If the ISFSI is a water-pool type facility, the reactor-related 
GTCC waste must be in a durable solid form with demonstrable leach 
resistance.
    (c) The MRS must be designed to store spent fuel, solid high-level 
radioactive waste, and/or solid reactor-related GTCC waste.
    (1) Reactor-related GTCC waste may not be stored in a cask that also 
contains spent fuel. This restriction does not include radioactive 
materials associated with fuel assemblies (e.g., control rod blades or 
assemblies, thimble plugs, burnable poison rod assemblies, or fuel 
channels);
    (2) Liquid high-level radioactive wastes or liquid reactor-related 
GTCC wastes may not be received or stored in an MRS; and
    (3) If the MRS is a water-pool type facility, the high-level waste 
and reactor-related GTCC waste must be in a durable solid form with 
demonstrable leach resistance.
    (d) The ISFSI or MRS must be designed, made of materials, and 
constructed to ensure that there will be no significant chemical, 
galvanic, or other reactions between or among the storage system 
components, spent fuel, reactor-related GTCC waste, and/or high level 
waste including possible reaction with water during wet loading and 
unloading operations or during storage in a water-pool type ISFSI or 
MRS. The behavior of materials under irradiation and thermal conditions 
must be taken into account.
    (e) The NRC may authorize exceptions, on a case-by-case basis, to 
the restrictions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section regarding the 
commingling of spent fuel and reactor-related GTCC waste in the same 
cask.

[66 FR 51842, Oct. 11, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 72.122  Overall requirements.

    (a) Quality Standards. Structures, systems, and components important 
to safety must be designed, fabricated, erected, and tested to quality 
standards commensurate with the importance to safety of the function to 
be performed.

[[Page 432]]

    (b) Protection against environmental conditions and natural 
phenomena. (1) Structures, systems, and components important to safety 
must be designed to accommodate the effects of, and to be compatible 
with, site characteristics and environmental conditions associated with 
normal operation, maintenance, and testing of the ISFSI or MRS and to 
withstand postulated accidents.
    (2)(i) Structures, systems, and components important to safety must 
be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena such as 
earthquakes, tornadoes, lightning, hurricanes, floods, tsunami, and 
seiches, without impairing their capability to perform their intended 
design functions. The design bases for these structures, systems, and 
components must reflect:
    (A) Appropriate consideration of the most severe of the natural 
phenomena reported for the site and surrounding area, with appropriate 
margins to take into account the limitations of the data and the period 
of time in which the data have accumulated, and
    (B) Appropriate combinations of the effects of normal and accident 
conditions and the effects of natural phenomena.
    (ii) The ISFSI or MRS also should be designed to prevent massive 
collapse of building structures or the dropping of heavy objects as a 
result of building structural failure on the spent fuel, high-level 
radioactive waste, or reactor-related GTCC waste or on to structures, 
systems, and components important to safety.
    (3) Capability must be provided for determining the intensity of 
natural phenomena that may occur for comparison with design bases of 
structures, systems, and components important to safety.
    (4) If the ISFSI or MRS is located over an aquifer which is a major 
water resource, measures must be taken to preclude the transport of 
radioactive materials to the environment through this potential pathway.
    (c) Protection against fires and explosions. Structures, systems, 
and components important to safety must be designed and located so that 
they can continue to perform their safety functions effectively under 
credible fire and explosion exposure conditions. Noncombustible and 
heat-resistant materials must be used wherever practical throughout the 
ISFSI or MRS, particularly in locations vital to the control of 
radioactive materials and to the maintenance of safety control 
functions. Explosion and fire detection, alarm, and suppression systems 
shall be designed and provided with sufficient capacity and capability 
to minimize the adverse effects of fires and explosions on structures, 
systems, and components important to safety. The design of the ISFSI or 
MRS must include provisions to protect against adverse effects that 
might result from either the operation or the failure of the fire 
suppression system.
    (d) Sharing of structures, systems, and components. Structures, 
systems, and components important to safety must not be shared between 
an ISFSI or MRS and other facilities unless it is shown that such 
sharing will not impair the capability of either facility to perform its 
safety functions, including the ability to return to a safe condition in 
the event of an accident.
    (e) Proximity of sites. An ISFSI or MRS located near other nuclear 
facilities must be designed and operated to ensure that the cumulative 
effects of their combined operations will not constitute an unreasonable 
risk to the health and safety of the public.
    (f) Testing and maintenance of systems and components. Systems and 
components that are important to safety must be designed to permit 
inspection, maintenance, and testing.
    (g) Emergency capability. Structures, systems, and components 
important to safety must be designed for emergencies. The design must 
provide for accessibility to the equipment of onsite and available 
offsite emergency facilities and services such as hospitals, fire and 
police departments, ambulance service, and other emergency agencies.
    (h) Confinement barriers and systems. (1) The spent fuel cladding 
must be protected during storage against degradation that leads to gross 
ruptures or the fuel must be otherwise confined such that degradation of 
the fuel during storage will not pose operational safety problems with 
respect to its removal

[[Page 433]]

from storage. This may be accomplished by canning of consolidated fuel 
rods or unconsolidated assemblies or other means as appropriate.
    (2) For underwater storage of spent fuel, high-level radioactive 
waste, or reactor-related GTCC waste in which the pool water serves as a 
shield and a confinement medium for radioactive materials, systems for 
maintaining water purity and the pool water level must be designed so 
that any abnormal operations or failure in those systems from any cause 
will not cause the water level to fall below safe limits. The design 
must preclude installations of drains, permanently connected systems, 
and other features that could, by abnormal operations or failure, cause 
a significant loss of water. Pool water level equipment must be provided 
to alarm in a continuously manned location if the water level in the 
storage pools falls below a predetermined level.
    (3) Ventilation systems and off-gas systems must be provided where 
necessary to ensure the confinement of airborne radioactive particulate 
materials during normal or off-normal conditions.
    (4) Storage confinement systems must have the capability for 
continuous monitoring in a manner such that the licensee will be able to 
determine when corrective action needs to be taken to maintain safe 
storage conditions. For dry spent fuel storage, periodic monitoring is 
sufficient provided that periodic monitoring is consistent with the dry 
spent fuel storage cask design requirements. The monitoring period must 
be based upon the spent fuel storage cask design requirements.
    (5) The high-level radioactive waste and reactor-related GTCC waste 
must be packaged in a manner that allows handling and retrievability 
without the release of radioactive materials to the environment or 
radiation exposures in excess of part 20 limits. The package must be 
designed to confine the high-level radioactive waste for the duration of 
the license.
    (i) Instrumentation and control systems. Instrumentation and control 
systems for wet spent fuel and reactor-related GTCC waste storage must 
be provided to monitor systems that are important to safety over 
anticipated ranges for normal operation and off-normal operation. Those 
instruments and control systems that must remain operational under 
accident conditions must be identified in the Safety Analysis Report. 
Instrumentation systems for dry storage casks must be provided in 
accordance with cask design requirements to monitor conditions that are 
important to safety over anticipated ranges for normal conditions and 
off-normal conditions. Systems that are required under accident 
conditions must be identified in the Safety Analysis Report.
    (j) Control room or control area. A control room or control area, if 
appropriate for the ISFSI or MRS design, must be designed to permit 
occupancy and actions to be taken to monitor the ISFSI or MRS safely 
under normal conditions, and to provide safe control of the ISFSI or MRS 
under off-normal or accident conditions.
    (k) Utility or other services. (1) Each utility service system must 
be designed to meet emergency conditions. The design of utility services 
and distribution systems that are important to safety must include 
redundant systems to the extent necessary to maintain, with adequate 
capacity, the ability to perform safety functions assuming a single 
failure.
    (2) Emergency utility services must be designed to permit testing of 
the functional operability and capacity, including the full operational 
sequence, of each system for transfer between normal and emergency 
supply sources; and to permit the operation of associated safety 
systems.
    (3) Provisions must be made so that, in the event of a loss of the 
primary electric power source or circuit, reliable and timely emergency 
power will be provided to instruments, utility service systems, the 
central security alarm station, and operating systems, in amounts 
sufficient to allow safe storage conditions to be maintained and to 
permit continued functioning of all systems essential to safe storage.
    (4) An ISFSI or MRS which is located on the site of another facility 
may share common utilities and services with such a facility and be 
physically

[[Page 434]]

connected with the other facility; however, the sharing of utilities and 
services or the physical connection must not significantly:
    (i) Increase the probability or consequences of an accident or 
malfunction of components, structures, or systems that are important to 
safety; or
    (ii) Reduce the margin of safety as defined in the basis for any 
technical specifications of either facility.
    (l) Retrievability. Storage systems must be designed to allow ready 
retrieval of spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and reactor-
related GTCC waste for further processing or disposal.

<R05>
Sec. 72.124  Criteria for nuclear criticality safety.

    (a) Design for criticality safety. Spent fuel handling, packaging, 
transfer, and storage systems must be designed to be maintained 
subcritical and to ensure that, before a nuclear criticality accident is 
possible, at least two unlikely, independent, and concurrent or 
sequential changes have occurred in the conditions essential to nuclear 
criticality safety. The design of handling, packaging, transfer, and 
storage systems must include margins of safety for the nuclear 
criticality parameters that are commensurate with the uncertainties in 
the data and methods used in calculations and demonstrate safety for the 
handling, packaging, transfer and storage conditions and in the nature 
of the immediate environment under accident conditions.
    (b) Methods of criticality control. When practicable, the design of 
an ISFSI or MRS must be based on favorable geometry, permanently fixed 
neutron absorbing materials (poisons), or both. Where solid neutron 
absorbing materials are used, the design must provide for positive means 
of verifying their continued efficacy. For dry spent fuel storage 
systems, the continued efficacy may be confirmed by a demonstration or 
analysis before use, showing that significant degradation of the neutron 
absorbing materials cannot occur over the life of the facility.
    (c) Criticality monitoring. A criticality monitoring system shall be 
maintained in each area where special nuclear material is handled, used, 
or stored which will energize clearly audible alarm signals if 
accidental criticality occurs. Underwater monitoring is not required 
when special nuclear material is handled or stored beneath water 
shielding. Monitoring of dry storage areas where special nuclear 
material is packaged in its stored configuration under a license issued 
under this subpart is not required.

Sec. 72.126  Criteria for radiological protection.

    (a) Exposure control. Radiation protection systems must be provided 
for all areas and operations where onsite personnel may be exposed to 
radiation or airborne radioactive materials. Structures, systems, and 
components for which operation, maintenance, and required inspections 
may involve occupational exposure must be designed, fabricated, located, 
shielded, controlled, and tested so as to control external and internal 
radiation exposures to personnel. The design must include means to:
    (1) Prevent the accumulation of radioactive material in those 
systems requiring access;
    (2) Decontaminate those systems to which access is required;
    (3) Control access to areas of potential contamination or high 
radiation within the ISFSI or MRS;
    (4) Measure and control contamination of areas requiring access;

radioactive components; for example, by providing sufficient space for 
ease of operation and designing equipment for ease of repair and 
replacement; and
    (6) Shield personnel from radiation exposure.
    (b) Radiological alarm systems. Radiological alarm systems must be 
provided in accessible work areas as appropriate to warn operating 
personnel of radiation and airborne radioactive material concentrations 
above a given

[[Page 435]]

setpoint and of concentrations of radioactive material in effluents 
above control limits. Radiation alarm systems must be designed with 
provisions for calibration and testing their operability.
    (c) Effluent and direct radiation monitoring. (1) As appropriate for 
the handling and storage system, effluent systems must be provided. 
Means for measuring the amount of radionuclides in effluents during 
normal operations and under accident conditions must be provided for 
these systems. A means of measuring the flow of the diluting medium, 
either air or water, must also be provided.
    (2) Areas containing radioactive materials must be provided with 
systems for measuring the direct radiation levels in and around these 
areas.
    (d) Effluent control. The ISFSI or MRS must be designed to provide 
means to limit to levels as low as is reasonably achievable the release 
of radioactive materials in effluents during normal operations; and 
control the release of radioactive materials under accident conditions. 
Analyses must be made to show that releases to the general environment 
during normal operations and anticipated occurrences will be within the 
exposure limit given in Sec. 72.104. Analyses of design basis accidents 
must be made to show that releases to the general environment will be 
within the exposure limits given in Sec. 72.106. Systems designed to 
monitor the release of radioactive materials must have means for 
calibration and testing their operability.

reactor-related greater than Class C waste, and other radioactive
waste storage and handling.

    (a) Spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and reactor-related 
GTCC waste storage and handling systems. Spent fuel storage, high-level 
radioactive waste storage, reactor-related GTCC waste storage and other 
systems that might contain or handle radioactive materials associated 
with spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, or reactor-related GTCC 
waste, must be designed to ensure adequate safety under normal and 
accident conditions. These systems must be designed with--

    Source: 64 FR 56122, Oct. 15, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 72.140  Quality assurance requirements.

    (a) Purpose. This subpart describes quality assurance requirements 
that apply to design, purchase, fabrication, handling, shipping, 
storing, cleaning, assembly, inspection, testing, operation, 
maintenance, repair, modification of structures, systems, and 
components, and decommissioning that are important to safety. As used in 
this subpart, ``quality assurance'' comprises all those planned and 
systematic actions necessary to provide adequate confidence that a 
structure, system, or component will perform satisfactorily in service. 
Quality assurance includes quality control, which comprises those 
quality assurance actions related to

[[Page 436]]

control of the physical characteristics and quality of the material or 
component to predetermined requirements. The certificate holder and 
applicant for a CoC are responsible for the quality assurance 
requirements as they apply to the design, fabrication, and testing of a 
spent fuel storage cask until possession of the spent fuel storage cask 
is transferred to the licensee. The licensee and the certificate holder 
are also simultaneously responsible for these quality assurance 
requirements through the oversight of contractors and subcontractors.
    (b) Establishment of program. Each licensee, applicant for a 
license, certificate holder, applicant for a CoC shall establish, 
maintain, and execute a quality assurance program satisfying each of the 
applicable criteria of this subpart, and satisfying any specific 
provisions which are applicable to the licensee's, applicant's for a 
license, certificate holder's, and applicant's for a CoC activities. The 
licensee, applicant for a license, certificate holder, and applicant for 
a CoC shall execute the applicable criteria in a graded approach to an 
extent that is commensurate with the quality assurance requirements' 
importance to safety. The quality assurance program must cover the 
activities identified in this subpart throughout the life of the 
activity. For licensees, this includes activities from the site 
selection through decommissioning prior to termination of the license. 
For certificate holders, this includes activities from development of 
the spent fuel storage cask design through termination of the CoC.
    (c) Approval of program. (1) Each licensee, applicant for a license, 
certificate holder, or applicant for a CoC shall file a description of 
its quality assurance program, including a discussion of which 
requirements of this subpart are applicable and how they will be 
satisfied, in accordance with Sec. 72.4.
    (2) Each licensee shall obtain Commission approval of its quality 
assurance program prior to receipt of spent fuel and/or reactor-related 
GTCC waste at the ISFSI or spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, 
and/or reactor-related GTCC waste at the MRS. Each licensee or applicant 
for a specific license shall obtain Commission approval of its quality 
assurance program before commencing fabrication or testing of a spent 
fuel storage cask.
    (3) Each certificate holder or applicant for a CoC shall obtain 
Commission approval of its quality assurance program before commencing 
fabrication or testing of a spent fuel storage cask.
    (d) Previously-approved programs. A quality assurance program 
previously approved by the Commission as satisfying the requirements of 
Appendix B to part 50 of this chapter, subpart H to part 71 of this 
chapter, or subpart G to this part will be accepted as satisfying the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, except that a licensee, 
applicant for a license, certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC who 
is using an Appendix B or subpart H quality assurance program shall also 
meet the recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 72.174. In filing the 
description of the quality assurance program required by paragraph (c) 
of this section, each licensee, applicant for a license, certificate 
holder, and applicant for a CoC shall notify the NRC, in accordance with 
Sec. 72.4, of its intent to apply its previously-approved quality 
assurance program to ISFSI activities or spent fuel storage cask 
activities. The notification shall identify the previously-approved 
quality assurance program by date of submittal to the Commission, docket 
number, and date of Commission approval.

execution of the quality assurance program. The licensee and certificate 
holder may delegate to others, such as contractors, agents, or 
consultants, the work of establishing and executing the quality 
assurance program, but the licensee and the certificate holder shall 
retain responsibility for the program. The licensee, applicant for a 
license, certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC shall clearly 
establish and delineate in

appendix A means:
    (1) For domestic shipments--the Regional Office within whose region 
the licensee who is responsible for the physical protection arrangements 
of the shipment is located.
    (2) For export shipments--the Regional Office within whose region 
the licensee who is responsible for the physical protection arrangements 
of the shipment is located, and the Regional Office for the region in 
which the last point of exit of the shipment from the U.S. is located.
    (3) For import shipments--the Regional Office within whose region 
the licensee who is responsible for the physical protection arrangements 
of the shipment is located, and the Regional Office for the region in 
which the first point of entry of the shipment into the U.S. is located.
    Armed escort means an armed person, not necessarily uniformed, whose 
primary duty is to accompany shipments of special nuclear material for 
the protection of such shipments against theft or radiological sabotage.
    Armed response personnel means persons, not necessarily uniformed, 
whose primary duty in the event of attempted theft of special nuclear 
material or radiological sabotage shall be to respond, armed and 
equipped, to prevent or delay such actions.
    Authorized individual means any individual, including an employee, a 
student, a consultant, or an agent of a licensee who has been designated 
in writing by a licensee to have responsibility for surveillance of or 
control over special nuclear material or to have unescorted access to

    Background check includes, at a minimum, a Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) criminal history records check (including 
verification of identity based on fingerprinting), employment history, 
education, and personal references. Individuals engaged in activities 
subject to regulation by the Commission, applicants for licenses to 
engage in Commission-regulated activities, and individuals who have 
notified the Commission in writing of an intent to file an application 
for licensing, certification, permitting, or approval of a product or 
activity subject to regulation by the Commission are required under 
Sec. 73.57 to conduct fingerprinting and criminal history records 
checks before granting access to Safeguards Information. A background 
check must be sufficient to support the trustworthiness and reliability

temporary storage area or cargo compartment containing the shipment.
    Controlled access area means any temporarily or permanently 
established area which is clearly demarcated, access to which is 
controlled and which affords isolation of the material or persons within 
it.
    Deceit means methods used to attempt to gain unauthorized access, 
introduce unauthorized materials, or remove strategic special nuclear 
materials, where the attempt involves falsification to present the 
appearance of authorized access.

or scenarios and other information related to the protection of the 
transported material if the unauthorized disclosure of such analyses, 
procedures, scenarios, or other information could reasonably be expected 
to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the 
public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing 
the likelihood of theft, diversion, or sabotage of source, byproduct, or 
special nuclear material.
    (3) Inspections, audits and evaluations. Information not classified 
as National Security Information or Restricted Data pertaining to 
safeguards and security inspections and reports, including:
    (i) Portions of inspection reports, evaluations, audits, or 
investigations that contain details of a licensee's or applicant's 
physical security system or that disclose uncorrected defects, 
weaknesses, or vulnerabilities in the system. Disclosure of corrected 
defects, weaknesses, or vulnerabilities is subject to an assessment 
taking into account such factors as trending analyses and the impacts of 
disclosure on licensees having similar physical security systems; and
    (ii) Reports of investigations containing general information may be 
released after corrective actions have been completed, unless withheld 
pursuant to other authorities, e.g., the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552).
    (4) Correspondence. Portions of correspondence insofar as they 
contain Safeguards Information as set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (5) Other information within the scope of Section 147 of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, that the Commission determines by order 
or regulation could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse 
effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and 
security by significantly increasing the likelihood of theft, diversion, 
or sabotage of source, byproduct, or special nuclear material or a 
facility.
    (b) Conditions for access. (1) Except as the Commission may 
otherwise authorize, no person may have access to Safeguards Information 
unless the person has an established ``need to know'' for the 
information and has undergone a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
criminal history records check using the procedures set forth in Sec. 
73.57.
    (2) In addition, a person to be granted access to Safeguards 
Information must be trustworthy and reliable, based on a background 
check or other means approved by the Commission.
    (3) The categories of individuals specified in 10 CFR 73.59 are 
exempt from the criminal history records check and background check 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section by virtue 
of their occupational status.
    (4) For persons participating in an NRC adjudicatory proceeding, the 
``need to know'' determination shall be made by the originator of the 
Safeguards Information upon receipt of a request for access to the 
Safeguards Information. Where the information is in the possession of 
the originator and the NRC staff, whether in its original form or 
incorporated into another document or other matter by the recipient, the 
NRC staff shall make the determination. In the event of a dispute 
regarding the ``need to know'' determination, the presiding officer of 
the proceeding shall determine whether the ``need to know'' findings in 
Sec. 73.2 can be made.

[[Page 466]]

    (5) Except as the Commission may otherwise authorize, no person may 
disclose Safeguards Information to any other person except as set forth 
in this section.
    (c) Protection while in use or storage. (1) While in use, matter 
containing Safeguards Information must be under the control of an 
individual authorized access to Safeguards Information. This requirement 
is satisfied if the Safeguards Information is attended by such an 
individual even though the information is in fact not constantly being 
used. Safeguards Information within alarm stations, or rooms 
continuously occupied by authorized individuals need not be stored in a 
locked security storage container.
    (2) While unattended, Safeguards Information must be stored in a 
locked security storage container. The container shall not identify the 
contents of the matter contained and must preclude access by individuals 
not authorized access in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
Knowledge of lock combinations protecting Safeguards Information must be 
limited to a minimum number of personnel for operating purposes who have 
a ``need to know'' and are otherwise authorized access to Safeguards 
Information in accordance with the provisions of this Part. Access to 
lock combinations must be strictly controlled so as to prevent 
disclosure to an individual not authorized access to Safeguards 
Information.
    (d) Preparation and marking of documents or other matter. (1) Each 
document or other matter that contains Safeguards Information as 
described in Sec. 73.21(a)(1)(i) and this section must be marked to 
indicate the presence of such information in a conspicuous manner on the 
top and bottom of each page. The first page of the document or other 
matter must also contain:
    (i) The name, title, and organization of the individual authorized 
to make a Safeguards Information determination, and who has determined 
that the document or other matter contains Safeguards Information;
    (ii) The date the determination was made; and
    (iii) An indication that unauthorized disclosure will be subject to 
civil and criminal sanctions.
    (2) In addition to the markings at the top and bottom of each page, 
any transmittal letters or memoranda to or from the NRC which do not in 
themselves contain Safeguards Information shall be marked to indicate 
that attachments or enclosures contain Safeguards Information but that 
the transmittal document or other matter does not (i.e., ``When 
separated from Safeguards Information enclosure(s), this document is 
decontrolled provided the transmittal document does not otherwise 
warrant protection from unauthorized disclosure'').
    (3) Any transmittal document or other matter forwarding Safeguards 
Information must alert the recipient that protected information is 
enclosed. Certification that a document or other matter contains 
Safeguards Information must include the name and title of the certifying 
official and date designated. Portion marking is required only for 
correspondence to and from the NRC (i.e., cover letters, but not 
attachments) that contains Safeguards Information. The portion marking 
must be sufficient to allow the recipient to identify and distinguish 
those sections of the transmittal document or other information 
containing the Safeguards Information from non-Safeguards Information.
    (4) Marking of documents or other matter containing or transmitting 
Safeguards Information shall, at a minimum include the words 
``Safeguards Information'' to ensure identification of protected 
information for the protection of facilities and material covered by 
Sec. 73.22.
    (e) Reproduction of matter containing Safeguards Information. 
Safeguards Information may be reproduced to the minimum extent necessary 
consistent with need without permission of the originator. Equipment 
used to reproduce Safeguards Information must be evaluated to ensure 
that unauthorized individuals cannot access Safeguards Information 
(e.g., unauthorized individuals cannot access Safeguards Information by 
gaining access to retained memory or network connectivity).

[[Page 467]]

    (f) External transmission of documents and material. (1) Documents 
or other matter containing Safeguards Information, when transmitted 
outside an authorized place of use or storage, must be packaged in two 
sealed envelopes or wrappers to preclude disclosure of the presence of 
protected information. The inner envelope or wrapper must contain the 
name and address of the intended recipient and be marked on both sides, 
top and bottom, with the words ``Safeguards Information.'' The outer 
envelope or wrapper must be opaque, addressed to the intended recipient, 
must contain the address of the sender, and may not bear any markings or 
indication that the document or other matter contains Safeguards 
Information.
    (2) Safeguards Information may be transported by any commercial 
delivery company that provides service with computer tracking features, 
U.S. first class, registered, express, or certified mail, or by any 
individual authorized access pursuant to these requirements.
    (3) Except under emergency or extraordinary conditions, Safeguards 
Information shall be transmitted outside an authorized place of use or 
storage only by NRC approved secure electronic devices, such as 
facsimiles or telephone devices, provided that transmitters and 
receivers implement processes that will provide high assurance that 
Safeguards Information is protected before and after the transmission or 
electronic mail through the internet, provided that the information is 
encrypted by a method (Federal Information Processing Standard [FIPS] 
140-2 or later) approved by the appropriate NRC Office; the information 
is produced by a self contained secure automatic data process system; 
and transmitters and receivers implement the information handling 
processes that will provide high assurance that Safeguards Information 
is protected before and after transmission. Physical security events 
required to be reported pursuant to Sec. 73.71 are considered to be 
extraordinary conditions.
    (g) Processing of Safeguards Information on electronic systems. (1) 
Safeguards Information may be stored, processed or produced on a stand-
alone computer (or computer system) for processing of Safeguards 
Information. ``Stand-alone'' means a computer or computer system to 
which access is limited to individuals authorized access to Safeguards 
Information. A stand-alone computer or computer system shall not be 
physically or in any other way connected to a network accessible by 
users who are not authorized access to Safeguards Information.
    (2) Each computer not located within an approved and lockable 
security storage container that is used to process Safeguards 
Information must have a removable storage medium with a bootable 
operating system. The bootable operating system must be used to load and 
initialize the computer. The removable storage medium must also contain 
the software application programs. Data may be saved on either the 
removable storage medium that is used to boot the operating system, or 
on a different removable storage medium. The removable storage medium 
must be secured in a locked security storage container when not in use.
    (3) A mobile device (such as a laptop computer) may also be used for 
the processing of Safeguards Information provided the device is secured 
in a locked security storage container when not in use. Other systems 
may be used if approved for security by the appropriate NRC office.
    (4) Any electronic system that has been used for storage, processing 
or production of Safeguards Information must be free of recoverable 
Safeguards Information prior to being returned to nonexclusive use.
    (h) Removal from Safeguards Information category. Documents or other 
matter originally containing Safeguards Information must be removed from 
the Safeguards Information category at such time as the information no 
longer meets the criteria contained in this part. Care must be exercised 
to ensure that any document or other matter decontrolled not disclose 
Safeguards Information in some other form or be combined with other 
unprotected information to disclose Safeguards Information. The 
authority to determine that a document or other matter may be 
decontrolled will only be exercised by the

[[Page 468]]

NRC, with NRC approval, or in consultation with the individual or 
organization that made the original determination.
    (i) Destruction of matter containing Safeguards Information. 
Documents or other matter containing Safeguards Information shall be 
destroyed when no longer needed. The information can be destroyed by 
burning, shredding or any other method that precludes reconstruction by 
means available to the public at large. Piece sizes no wider than one 
quarter inch composed of several pages or documents and thoroughly mixed 
are considered completely destroyed.

Sec. 73.23  Protection of Safeguards Information--Modified Handling:
Specific requirements.

    This section contains specific requirements for the protection of 
Safeguards Information in the hands of any person subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 73.21(a)(1)(ii) and related to panoramic and 
underwater irradiators that possess greater than 370 TBq (10,000 Ci) of 
byproduct material in the form of sealed sources; manufacturers and 
distributors of items containing source material, or byproduct or 
special nuclear material in greater than or equal to Category 2 
quantities of concern; transportation of more than 1000 Tbq (27,000 Ci) 
but less than or equal to 100 grams of spent nuclear fuel; research and 
test reactors that possess special nuclear material of moderate 
strategic significance or special nuclear material of low strategic 
significance; and transportation of source, byproduct, or special 
nuclear material in greater than or equal to Category 1 quantities of 
concern. The requirements of this section distinguish Safeguards 
Information requiring modified handling requirements (SGI-M) from the 
specific Safeguards Information handling requirements applicable to 
facilities and materials needing a higher level of protection, as set 
forth in Sec. 73.22.
    (a) Information to be protected. The types of information and 
documents that must be protected as Safeguards Information--Modified 
Handling include non-public security-related requirements such as 
protective measures, interim compensatory measures, additional security 
measures, and the following, as applicable:
    (1) Physical protection. Information not classified as Restricted 
Data or National Security Information related to physical protection, 
including:
    (i) The composite physical security plan for the facility or site;
    (ii) Site specific drawings, diagrams, sketches, or maps that 
substantially represent the final design features of the physical 
security system not easily discernible by members of the public;
    (iii) Alarm system layouts showing the location of intrusion 
detection devices, alarm assessment equipment, alarm system wiring, 
emergency power sources for security equipment, and duress alarms not 
easily discernible by members of the public;
    (iv) Physical security orders and procedures issued by the licensee 
for members of the security organization detailing duress codes, patrol 
routes and schedules, or responses to security contingency events;
    (v) Site specific design features of plant security communications 
systems;
    (vi) Lock combinations, mechanical key design, or passwords integral 
to the physical security system;
    (vii) The composite facility guard qualification and training plan/
measures disclosing features of the physical security system or response 
procedures;
    (viii) Descriptions of security activities which disclose features 
of the physical security system or response measures;
    (ix) Information relating to onsite or offsite response forces, 
including size, armament of the response forces, and arrival times of 
such forces committed to respond to security contingency events; and
    (x) Engineering and safety analyses, security-related procedures or 
scenarios, and other information revealing site-specific details of the 
facility or materials if the unauthorized disclosure of such analyses, 
procedures, scenarios, or other information could reasonably be expected 
to have a significant adverse effect on the health and

[[Page 469]]

safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly 
increasing the likelihood of theft, diversion, or sabotage of source, 
byproduct, or special nuclear material.
    (2) Physical protection in transit. Information not classified as 
Restricted Data or National Security Information related to the physical 
protection of shipments of more than 1000 Tbq (27,000 Ci) but less than 
or equal to 100 grams of spent nuclear fuel, source material and 
byproduct material in Category 1 quantities of concern, and special 
nuclear material in less than a formula quantity (except for those 
materials covered under Sec. 73.22), including:
    (i) Information regarding transportation security measures, 
including physical security plans and procedures, immobilization 
devices, and escort requirements, more detailed than NRC regulations;
    (ii) Scheduling and itinerary information for shipments (scheduling 
and itinerary information for shipments that are inherently self-
disclosing, such as a shipment that created extensive news coverage or 
an announcement by a public official confirming receipt, may be 
decontrolled after shipment departure). Scheduling and itinerary 
information for shipments that are not inherently self-disclosing may be 
decontrolled 2 days after the shipment is completed. Scheduling and 
itinerary information used for the purpose of preplanning, coordination, 
and advance notification may be shared with others on a ``need to know'' 
basis and need not be designated as Safeguards Information-Modified 
Handling);
    (iii) Arrangements with and capabilities of local police response 
forces, and locations of safe havens identified along the transportation 
route;
    (iv) Details of alarm and communication systems, communication 
procedures, and duress codes;
    (v) Procedures for response to security contingency events; and
    (vi) Engineering or safety analyses, security-related procedures or 
scenarios and other information related to the protection of the 
transported material if the unauthorized disclosure of such analyses, 
procedures, scenarios, or other information could reasonably be expected 
to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the 
public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing 
the likelihood of theft, diversion, or sabotage of source, byproduct, or 
special nuclear material.
    (3) Inspections, audits and evaluations. Information not classified 
as National Security Information or Restricted Data pertaining to 
safeguards and security inspections and reports, including:
    (i) Portions of inspection reports, evaluations, audits, or 
investigations that contain details of a licensee's or applicant's 
physical security system or that disclose uncorrected defects, 
weaknesses, or vulnerabilities in the system. Disclosure of corrected 
defects, weaknesses, or vulnerabilities is subject to an assessment 
taking into account such factors as trending analyses and the impacts of 
disclosure on licensees having similar physical security systems; and
    (ii) Reports of investigations containing general information may be 
released after the corrective actions have been completed, unless 
withheld pursuant to other authorities, e.g., the Freedom of Information 
Act (5 U.S.C. 552).
    (4) Correspondence. Portions of correspondence insofar as they 
contain Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-
Modified Handling, as set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of 
this section.
    (5) Other information within the scope of Section 147 of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, that the Commission determines by order 
or regulation could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse 
effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and 
security by significantly increasing the likelihood of theft, diversion, 
or sabotage of source, byproduct, or special nuclear material or a 
facility.
    (b) Conditions for access. (1) Except as the Commission may 
otherwise authorize, no person may have access to Safeguards Information

has an established ``need to know'' for the information and has 
undergone a Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal history records

[[Page 470]]

check using the procedures set forth in Sec. 73.57.
    (2) In addition, a person to be granted access to Safeguards 
Information must be trustworthy and reliable, based on a background 
check or other means approved by the Commission.
    (3) The categories of individuals specified in 10 CFR 73.59 are 
exempt from the criminal history records check and background check 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section by virtue 
of their occupational status:
    (4) For persons participating in an NRC adjudicatory proceeding, the 
``need to know'' determination shall be made by the originator of the 
Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified 
Handling upon receipt of a request for access to the Safeguards 
Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling. 
Where the information is in the possession of the originator and the NRC 
staff, whether in its original form or incorporated into another 
document or other matter by the recipient, the NRC staff shall make the 
determination. In the event of a dispute regarding the ``need to know'' 
determination, the presiding officer of the proceeding shall determine 
whether the ``need to know'' findings in Sec. 73.2 can be made.
    (5) Except as the Commission may otherwise authorize, no person may 
disclose Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-
Modified Handling to any other person except as set forth in this 
section.
    (c) Protection while in use or storage. (1) While in use, matter 
containing Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-
Modified Handling must be under the control of an individual authorized 
access to such information. This requirement is satisfied if the 
Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified 
Handling is attended by such an individual even though the information 
is in fact not constantly being used. Safeguards Information designated 
as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling within alarm stations, or 
rooms continuously occupied by authorized individuals, need not be 
locked in a file drawer or cabinet.
    (2) While unattended, Safeguards Information designated as 
Safeguards Information-Modified Handling must be stored in a locked file 
drawer or cabinet. The container shall not identify the contents of the 
matter contained and must preclude access by individuals not authorized 
access in accordance with the provisions of this section. Knowledge of 
lock combinations or access to keys protecting Safeguards Information 
designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling must be limited 
to a minimum number of personnel for operating purposes who have a 
``need to know'' and are otherwise authorized access to Safeguards 
Information in accordance with the provisions of this Part. Access to 
lock combinations must be strictly controlled so as to prevent 
disclosure to an individual not authorized access to Safeguards 
Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling.
    (d) Preparation and marking of documents or other matter. (1) Each

as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling as described in Sec. 
73.23(a) and in this section must be marked to indicate the presence of 
Safeguards Information with modified handling requirements in a 
conspicuous manner on the top and bottom of each page. The first page of 
the document or other matter must also contain:
    (i) The name, title, and organization of the individual authorized 
to make a ``Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-
Modified Handling'' determination, and who has determined that the 
document or other matter contains Safeguards Information designated as 
Safeguards Information-Modified Handling;
    (ii) The date the determination was made; and
    (iii) An indication that unauthorized disclosure will be subject to 
civil and criminal sanctions.
    (2) In addition to the markings at the top and bottom of each page, 
any transmittal letters or memoranda to or from the NRC which do not in 
themselves contain Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards 
Information-Modified Handling shall be marked to

[[Page 471]]

indicate that attachments or enclosures contain Safeguards Information 
designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling but that the 
transmittal document does not (i.e., ``When separated from Safeguards 
Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling 
enclosure(s), this document is decontrolled provided the transmittal 
document does not otherwise warrant protection from unauthorized 
disclosure'').
    (3) Any transmittal document or other matter forwarding Safeguards 
Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling must 
alert the recipient that protected information is enclosed. 
Certification that a document or other matter contains Safeguards 
Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling must 
include the name and title of the certifying official and date 
designated. Portion marking is required only for correspondence to and 
from the NRC (i.e., cover letters, but not attachments) that contains 
Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified 
Handling. The portion marking must be sufficient to allow the recipient 
to identify and distinguish those sections of the transmittal document 
or other information containing the Safeguards Information from non-
Safeguards Information.
    (4) Marking of documents or other matter containing or transmitting 
Safeguards Information with modified handling requirements shall, at a 
minimum include the words ``Safeguards Information-Modified Handling'' 
to ensure identification of protected information for the protection of 
facilities and material covered by Sec. 73.23.
    (e) Reproduction of matter containing Safeguards Information 
designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling. Safeguards 
Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling may 
be reproduced to the minimum extent necessary, consistent with need, 
without permission of the originator. Equipment used to reproduce 
Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified 
Handling must be evaluated to ensure that unauthorized individuals

or other matter containing Safeguards Information designated as 
Safeguards Information-Modified Handling, when transmitted outside an 
authorized place of use or storage, must be packaged in two sealed 
envelopes or wrappers to preclude disclosure of the presence of 
protected information. The inner envelope or wrapper must contain the 
name and address of the intended recipient and be marked on both sides, 
top and bottom, with the words ``Safeguards Information-Modified 
Handling.'' The outer envelope or wrapper must be opaque, addressed to 
the intended recipient, must contain the address of the sender, and may 
not bear any markings or indication that the document contains 
Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified 
Handling.
    (2) Safeguards Information designated Safeguards Information-
Modified Handling may be transported by any commercial delivery company 
that provides service with computer tracking features, U.S. first class, 
registered, express, or certified mail, or by any individual authorized 
access pursuant to these requirements.
    (3) Except under emergency or extraordinary conditions, Safeguards 
Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling must 
be transmitted electronically only by protected telecommunications 
circuits (including facsimile) or encryption by a method (Federal 
Information Processing Standard [FIPS] 140-2 or later) approved by the 
appropriate NRC office. For the purpose of this section, emergency or 
extraordinary conditions are defined as any circumstances that require 
immediate communications in order to report, summon assistance for, or 
respond to a security contingency event or an event that has potential 
security significance. Physical security events required to be reported 
pursuant to Sec. 73.71 are considered to be extraordinary conditions.

[[Page 472]]

    (g) Processing of Safeguards Information-Modified Handling on 
electronic systems. (1) Safeguards Information designated for modified 
handling may be stored, processed or produced on a computer or computer 
system, provided that the system is assigned to the licensee's or 
contractor's facility. Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards 
Information-Modified Handling files must be protected, either by a 
password or encryption, to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining 
access. Word processors such as typewriters are not subject to these 
requirements as long as they do not transmit information off-site. Note: 
if Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified 
Handling is produced on a typewriter, the ribbon must be properly marked 
and be removed and stored in the same manner as other Safeguards 
Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling.
    (2) Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-
Modified Handling files may be transmitted over a network if the file is 
encrypted. In such cases, the licensee will select a commercially 
available encryption system that the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) has validated as conforming to Federal Information 
Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 or later. Safeguards Information 
designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling files shall be 
properly labeled to indicate the presence of Safeguards Information with 
modified handling requirements and saved to removable matter and stored 
in a locked file drawer or cabinet.
    (3) A mobile device (such as a laptop computer) may also be used for 
the processing of Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards 
Information-Modified Handling provided the device is secured in an 
appropriate locked storage container when not in use. Other systems may 
be used if approved for security by the appropriate NRC office.
    (4) Any electronic system that has been used for storage, processing 
or production of Safeguards Information must be free of recoverable 
Safeguards Information designated as Safeguards Information-Modified 
Handling prior to being returned to nonexclusive use.
    (h) Removal from Safeguards Information-Modified Handling category. 
Documents or other matter originally containing Safeguards Information 
designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling must be removed 
from the Safeguards Information category at such time as the information 
no longer meets the criteria contained in this Part. Care must be 
exercised to ensure that any document or other matter decontrolled shall 
not disclose Safeguards Information in some other form or be combined 
with other unprotected information to disclose Safeguards Information. 
The authority to determine that a document or other matter may be 
decontrolled will only be exercised by the NRC, with NRC approval, or in 
consultation with the individual or organization that made the original 
determination.
    (i) Destruction of matter containing Safeguards Information 
designated as Safeguards Information-Modified Handling. Documents or 
other matter containing Safeguards Information shall be destroyed when 
no longer needed. The information can be destroyed by burning,

period for which the licensee possesses the special nuclear material 
under the license for which the system was developed and, if any portion 
of the system is superseded, retain the superseded material for three 
years after each change. The system shall include:
    (i) Written security procedures which document the structure of the 
transportation security organization and which detail the duties of 
drivers and escorts and other individuals responsible for security; and
    (ii) Provision for written approval of such procedures and any 
revisions thereto by the individual with overall responsibility for the 
security function.
    (4) Neither the licensee nor the licensee's agent shall permit an 
individual to act as an escort or other security organization member 
unless the individual has been trained, equipped, and qualified to 
perform each assigned security job duty in accordance with appendix B, 
of this part, ``General Criteria for Security Personnel.'' Upon the 
request of an authorized representative of the Commission, the licensee 
or the agent shall demonstrate the ability of the physical security 
personnel to carry out their assigned duties and responsibilities. Armed 
escorts shall requalify in accordance with appendix B to this part at 
least every 12 months. Each requalification must be documented. The 
licensee or the agent shall retain documentation of the initial 
qualification for the term of employment and of each requalification as 
a record for three years from the date of the requalification.
    (5) Armed escort and armed response force personnel armament shall 
include handguns, shotguns, and semiautomatic rifles, as described in 
appendix B to this part.

all armed response personnel to prevent or impede acts of radiological 
sabotage or theft of strategic special material by using sufficient 
force to counter the force directed at him including the use of deadly 
force when armed escorts or armed response personnel have a reasonable 
belief that it is necessary in self-defense or in the defense of others.
    (f) Transfer and storage of strategic special nuclear material for 
domestic shipments. (1) Strategic special nuclear material shall be 
placed in a protected area at transfer points if transfer is not 
immediate from one transport to another. Where a protected area is not 
available a controlled access area shall be established for the 
shipment. The transport may serve as a controlled access area.
    (2) All transfers shall be protected by at least seven armed escorts 
or other armed personnel--one of whom shall serve as commander. At least 
five of the armed personnel (including the commander) shall be available 
to protect the shipment and at least three of the five shall keep the 
strategic special nuclear material under continuous surveillance while 
it is at the transfer point. The two remaining armed personnel shall 
take up positions at a remote monitoring location. The remote location 
may be a radio-equipped vehicle or a nearby place, apart from the 
shipment area, so that a single act cannot remove the capability of the 
personnel protecting the shipment for calling for assistance. Each of 
the seven armed escorts or other armed personnel shall be capable of 
maintaining communication with each other. The commander shall have the 
capability to communicate with the personnel at the remote location and 
with local law enforcement agencies for emergency assistance. In 
addition, the armed escort personnel at the remote location shall have 
the capability to communicate with the law enforcement agencies and with 
the shipment movement control center. The commander shall call the 
remote location at least every 30 minutes to report the status of the 
shipment. If the calls are not received within the prescribed time, the 
personnel in the remote location shall request assistance from the law 
enforcement authorities, notify the shipment movement control center and 
initiate the appropriate contingency plans. Armed escorts or other armed 
personnel shall observe the opening of the cargo compartment of the 
incoming transport and ensure that the shipment is complete by checking 
locks and seals. A shipment loaded onto or transferred to another 
transport shall be checked to assure complete loading or transfer. 
Continuous visual surveillance of the cargo compartment shall be 
maintained up to the time the transport departs from the terminal. The 
escorts shall observe the transport until it has departed and shall 
notify the licensee or his agent of the latest status immediately 
thereafter.
    (g) Access control subsystems and procedures. (1) A numbered picture 
badge identification procedure shall be used to identify all individuals 
who will have custody of a shipment. The identification procedure shall 
require that the individual who has possession of the strategic special 
nuclear material shall have, in advance, identification picture badges 
of all individuals who are to assume custody for the shipment. The 
shipment shall be released only when the individual who has possession 
of strategic special nuclear material has assured positive 
identification of all of the persons assuming custody for the shipment 
by comparing the copies of the identification badges that have been 
received in advance to the identification badges carried by the 
individuals who will assume custody of the shipment.
    (2) Access to protected areas, controlled access areas, transports, 
escort vehicles, aircraft, rail cars, and containers where strategic 
special nuclear material is located shall be limited to individuals who 
have been properly identified and have been authorized access to these 
areas.
    (3) Strategic special nuclear material shall be shipped in 
containers that are

[[Page 478]]

protected by tamper-indicating seals. The containers also shall be 
locked if they are not in another locked container or transport. The 
outermost container or transport also shall be protected by tamper-
indicating seals.

    (5) All physical protection related subsystems and components shall 
be maintained in operable condition. Corrective action procedures and 
compensatory measures shall be developed and employed to assure that the 
effectiveness of the physical protection system is not reduced by any 
single failure or other contingencies affecting the operation of the 
physical protection related equipment or structures.
    (6) The transportation security program must be reviewed at least 
every 12 months by individuals independent of both security program 
management and personnel who have direct responsibility for 
implementation of the security program. The review must include an audit 
of transportation security procedures and practices, an evaluation of 
the effectiveness of the transportation physical protection system, an 
audit of the transportation physical protection system testing and 
maintenance program, and an audit of commitments established for 
response by local law enforcement authorities. The results and 
recommendations of the review, management's findings on whether the 
transportation security program is currently effective, and any actions 
taken as a result of recommendations from prior reviews, must be 
documented in a report to the responsible organization management and to 
corporate management at least one level higher than that having 
responsibility for the day-to-day plant operation. These reports must be 
maintained in an auditable form, available for inspection for a period 
of 3 years.

commencing on the anniversary of the date specified in paragraph 
(i)(2)(ii) of this section, an exercise must be carried out at least 
every four months for each shift, one third of which are to be force-on-
force. The licensee shall use these exercises to demonstrate its 
capability to respond to attempts to steal strategic special nuclear 
material. During each of the 12-month periods, the NRC shall observe one 
of the force-on-force exercises which demonstrates overall security 
system performance. The licensee shall notify the NRC of the scheduled 
exercise 60 days prior to that exercise. The licensee shall document the 
results of all exercises. The licensee shall retain the documentation of 
each exercise as a record for three years after each exercise is 
completed.
    (10) In addition to the medical examinations and physical fitness 
requirements of paragraph I.C of Appendix B of this part, each Tactical 
Response Team member, armed response person, and guard, except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(10)(v) of this section, shall participate in a 
physical fitness training program on a continuing basis.
    (i) The elements of the physical fitness training program must 
include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:
    (A) Training sessions of sufficient frequency, duration, and 
intensity to be of aerobic benefit, e.g., normally a frequency of three 
times per week, maintaining an intensity of approximately 75 percent of 
maximum heart rate for 20 minutes;
    (B) Activities that use large muscle groups, that can be maintained 
continuously, and that are rhythmical and aerobic in nature, e.g., 
running, bicycling, rowing, swimming, or cross-country skiing; and
    (C) Musculoskeletal training exercises that develop strength, 
flexibility, and endurance in the major muscle groups, e.g., legs, arms, 
and shoulders.
    (ii) The licensee shall assess Tactical Response Team members, armed 
response personnel, and guards for general fitness once every 4 months 
to determine the effectiveness of the continuing physical fitness 
training program. Assessments must include a recent health history, 
measures of cardiovascular fitness, percent of body fat, flexibility, 
muscular strength, and endurance. Individual exercise programs must be 
modified to be consistent with the needs of each participating Tactical 
Response Team member, armed response person, and guard and consistent 
with the environments in which they must be prepared to perform their 
duties. Individuals who exceed 4 months without being assessed for 
general fitness due to excused time off from work must be assessed 
within 15 calendar days of returning to duty as a Tactical Response Team 
member, armed response person, or guard.
    (iii) Within 30 days prior to participation in the physical fitness 
training program, the licensee shall give Tactical Response Team 
members, armed response personnel, and guards a medical examination 
including a determination and written certification by a licensed 
physician that there are no medical contraindications, as disclosed by 
the medical examination, to participation in the physical fitness 
training program.
    (iv) Licensees may temporarily waive an individual's participation 
in the physical fitness training program on the advice of the licensee's 
examining physician, during which time the individual may not be 
assigned duties as a Tactical Response Team member.
    (v) Guards whose duties are to staff the central or secondary alarm 
station and those who control exit or entry portals are exempt from the 
physical fitness training program specified in

[[Page 490]]

paragraph (b)(10) of this section, provided that they are not assigned 
temporary response guard duties.
    (11) In addition to the physical fitness demonstration contained in 
paragraph I.C of Appendix B of this part, Tactical Response Team 
members, armed response personnel, and guards shall meet or exceed the 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) through (b)(11)(v) of this 
section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(11)(vi) of this section, 
initially and at least once every 12 months thereafter.
    (i) For Tactical Response Team members the criteria are a 1-mile run 
in 8 minutes and 30 seconds or less and a 40-yard dash starting from a 
prone position in 8 seconds or less. For armed response personnel and 
guards that are not members of the Tactical Response Team the criteria 
are a one-half mile run in 4 minutes and 40 seconds or less and a 40-
yard dash starting from a prone position in 8.5 seconds or less. The 
test may be taken in ordinary athletic attire under the supervision of 
licensee designated personnel. The licensee shall retain a record of 
each individual's performance for 3 years.
    (ii) Incumbent Tactical Response Team members, armed response 
personnel, and guards shall meet or exceed the qualification criteria 
within 12 months of NRC approval of the licensee's revised Fixed Site 
Physical Protection Plan. New employees hired after the approval date 
shall meet or exceed the qualification criteria prior to assignment as a 
Tactical Response Team member, armed response person, or guard.
    (iii) Tactical Response Team members, armed response personnel, and 
guards shall be given a medical examination including a determination 
and written certification by a licensed physician that there are no 
medical contraindications, as disclosed by the medical examination, to 
participation in the physical fitness performance testing. The medical 
examination must be given within 30 days prior to the first 
administration of the physical fitness performance test, and on an 
annual basis thereafter.
    (iv) The licensee shall place Tactical Response Team members, armed 
response persons, and guards, who do not meet or exceed the 
qualification criteria, in a monitored remedial physical fitness 
training program and relieve them of security duties until they 
satisfactorily meet or exceed the qualification criteria.
    (v) Licensees may temporarily waive the annual performance testing 
for an individual on the advice of the licensee's examining physician, 
during which time the individual may not be assigned duties as a 
Tactical Response Team member.
    (vi) Guards whose duties are to staff the central or secondary alarm 
station and those who control exit or entry portals are exempt from the 
annual performance testing specified in paragraph (b)(11) of this 
section, provided that they are not assigned temporary response guard 
duties.
    (12) The licensee may elect to comply with the requirements of this 
paragraph instead of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(10) and (b)(11) 
of this section. In addition to the physical fitness qualifications of 
paragraph I.C of Appendix B of this part, each licensee subject to the 
requirements of this section shall develop and submit to the NRC for 
approval site specific, content-based, physical fitness performance 
tests which will--when administered to each Tactical Response Team 
member, armed response person, or guard--duplicate the response duties 
these individuals may need to perform during a strenuous tactical 
engagement.
    (i) The test must be administered to each Tactical Response Team 
member, armed response person, and guard once every 3 months. The test 
must specifically address the physical capabilities needed by armed 
response personnel during a strenuous tactical engagement at the

given a

[[Page 491]]

medical examination including a determination and written certification 
by a licensed physician that there are no medical contraindications, as 
disclosed by the medical examination, to participation in the physical 
fitness performance test.
    (iii) Guards whose duties are to staff the central or secondary 
alarm station and those who control exit or entry portals are exempt 
from the performance test specified in paragraph (b)(12) of this 
section, provided that they are not assigned temporary response guard 
duties.
    (c) Physical barrier subsystems. (1) vital equipment must be located 
only within a vital area, and strategic special nuclear material must be 
stored or processed only in a material access area. Both vital areas and 
material access areas must be located within a protected area so that 
access to vital equipment and to strategic special nuclear material 
requires passage through at least three physical barriers. The perimeter 
of the protected area must be provided with two separated physical 
barriers with an intrusion detection system placed between the two. The 
inner barrier must be positioned and constructed to enhance assessment 
of penetration attempts and to delay attempts at unauthorized exit from 
the protected area. The perimeter of the protected area must also 
incorporate features and structures that prevent forcible vehicle entry. 
More than one vital area or material access area may be located within a 
single protected area.
    (2) The physical barriers at the perimeter of the protected area 
shall be separated from any other barrier designated as a physical 
barrier for a vital area or material access area within the protected 
area.
    (3) Isolation zones shall be maintained in outdoor areas adjacent to 
the physical barrier at the perimeter of the protected area and shall be 
large enough to permit observation of the activities of people on either 
side of that barrier in the event of its penetration. If parking 
facilities are provided for employees or visitors, they shall be located 
outside the isolation zone and exterior to the protected area.
    (4) Isolation zones and all exterior areas within the protected area 
shall be provided with illumination sufficient for the monitoring and 
observation requirements of paragraphs (c)(3), (e)(8), (h)(4) and (h)(6) 
of this section, but not less than 0.2 footcandle measured horizontally 
at ground level.
    (5) Strategic special nuclear material, other than alloys, fuel 
elements or fuel assemblies, shall:
    (i) Be stored in a vault when not undergoing processing if the 
material can be used directly in the manufacture of a nuclear explosive 
device. Vaults used to protect such material shall be capable of 
preventing entry to stored SSNM by a single action in a forced entry 
attempt, except as such single action would both destroy the barrier and 
render contained SSNM incapable of being removed, and shall provide 
sufficient delay to prevent removal of stored SSNM prior to arrival of 
response personnel capable of neutralizing the design basis threat 
stated in Sec. 73.1.
    (ii) Be stored in tamper-indicating containers;
    (iii) Be processed only in material access areas constructed with 
barriers that provide significant delay to penetration; and
    (iv) Be kept in locked compartments or locked process equipment 
while undergoing processing except when personally attended.
    (6) Enriched uranium scrap (enriched to 20% or greater) in the form 
of small pieces, cuttings, chips, solutions or in other forms which 
result from a manufacturing process, contained in 30 gallon or larger 
containers with a uranium-235 content of less than 0.25 grams per liter, 
may be stored within a locked and separately fenced area within a larger 
protected area provided that the storage area fence is no closer than 25 
feet to the perimeter of the protected area. The storage area when 
unoccupied shall be protected by a guard or watchman who shall patrol at 
intervals not exceeding 4 hours, or by intrusion alarms.
    (d) Access control subsystems and procedures. (1) A numbered picture 
badge identification subsystem shall be used for all individuals who are 
authorized

[[Page 492]]

access to protected areas without escort. An individual not employed by 
the licensee but who requires frequent and extended access to protected, 
material access, or vital areas may be authorized access to such areas 
without escort provided that he receives a picture badge upon entrance 
into the protected area and returns the badge upon exit from the 
protected area, and that the badge indicates, (i) Non-employee--no 
escort required; (ii) areas to which access is authorized and (iii) the 
period for which access has been authorized. Badges shall be displayed 
by all individuals while inside the protected areas.
    (2) Unescorted access to vital areas, material access areas and 
controlled access areas shall be limited to individuals who are 
authorized access to the material and equipment in such areas, and who 
require such access to perform their duties. Access to material access 
areas shall include at least two individuals. Authorization for such 
individuals shall be indicated by the issuance of specially coded 
numbered badges indicating vital areas, material access areas, and 
controlled access areas to which access is authorized. No activities 
other than those which require access to strategic special nuclear 
material or to equipment used in the processing, use, or storage of 
strategic special nuclear material, or necessary maintenance, shall be 
permitted within a material access area.
    (3) The licensee shall establish and follow written procedures that 
will permit access control personnel to identify those vehicles that are 
authorized and those materials that are not authorized entry to 
protected, material access, and vital areas. The licensee shall retain a 
copy of the current procedures as a record until the Commission 
terminates each license for which the procedures were developed and, if 
any portion of the procedures is superseded, retain the superseded 
material for three years after each change.
    (4)(i) The licensee shall control all points of personnel and 
vehicle access into a protected area. Identification and search of all 
individuals for firearms, explosives, and incendiary devices must be 
made and authorization must be checked at these points except for 
Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel on official duty and 
United States Department of Energy couriers engaged in the transport of 
special nuclear material. The search function for detection of firearms, 
explosives, and incendiary devices must be accomplished through the use 
of detection equipment capable of detecting both firearms and 
explosives. The individual responsible for the last access control 
function (controlling admission to the protected area) shall be isolated 
within a structure with bullet resisting walls, doors, ceiling, floor, 
and windows.
    (ii) When the licensee has cause to suspect that an individual is 
attempting to introduce firearms, explosives, or incendiary devices into 
a protected area, the licensee shall conduct a physical pat-down search 
of that individual. Whenever firearms or explosives detection equipment 
at a portal is out of service or not operating satisfactorily, the 
licensee shall conduct a physical pat-down search of all persons who 
would otherwise have been subject to search using the equipment.
    (5) At the point of personnel and vehicle access into a protected 
area, all hand-carried packages except those carried by individuals 
exempted from personal search under the provisions of paragraph 
(d)(4)(i) of this part must be searched for firearms, explosives, and 
incendiary devices.
    (6) All packages and material for delivery into a protected area 
must be checked for proper identification and authorization and searched 
for firearms, explosives, and incendiary devices prior to admittance 
into the protected area, except those Commission-approved delivery and 
inspection activities specifically designated by the licensee to be 
carried out within material access, vital, or protected areas for 
reasons of safety, security, or operational necessity.
    (7) All vehicles, except United States Department of Energy vehicles 
engaged in transporting special nuclear material and emergency vehicles 
under emergency conditions, shall be searched for firearms, explosives, 
and incendiary devices prior to entry into the protected area. Vehicle 
areas to be searched shall include the cab, engine

[[Page 493]]

compartment, undercarriage, and cargo area.
    (8) All vehicles, except designated licensee vehicles, requiring 
entry into the protected area shall be escorted by a member of the 
security organization while within the protected area, and to the extent 
practicable shall be off-loaded in an area that is not adjacent to a 
vital area. Designated licensee vehicles shall be limited in their use 
to onsite plant functions and shall remain in the protected area except 
for operational, maintenance, security and emergency purposes. The 
licensee shall exercise positive control over all such designated 
vehicles to assure that they are used only by authorized persons and for 
authorized purposes.
    (9) The licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle 
access to material access areas, vital areas, and controlled access 
areas. At least two armed guards trained in accordance with the 
provisions contained in paragraph (b)(7) of this section and appendix B 
of this part shall be posted at each material access area control point 
whenever in use. Identification and authorization of personnel and 
vehicles must be verified at the material access area control point. 
Prior to entry into a material access area, packages must be searched 
for firearms, explosives, and incendiary devices. All vehicles, 
materials and packages, including trash, wastes, tools, and equipment 
exiting from a material access area must be searched for concealed 
strategic special nuclear material by a team of at least two individuals 
who are not authorized access to that material access area. Each 
individual exiting a material access area shall undergo at least two 
separate searches for concealed strategic special nuclear material. For 
individuals exiting an area that contains only alloyed or encapsulated 
strategic special nuclear material, the second search may be conducted 
in a random manner.
    (10) Before exiting from a material access area, containers of 
contaminated wastes must be drum scanned and tamper sealed by at least 
two individuals, working and recording their findings as a team, who do 
not have access to material processing and storage areas. The licensee 
shall retain the records of these findings for three years after the 
record is made.
    (11) Strategic special nuclear material being prepared for shipment 
offsite, including product, samples and scrap, shall be packed and 
placed in sealed containers in the presence of at least two individuals 
working as a team who shall verify and certify the content of each 
shipping container through the witnessing of gross weight measurements 
and nondestructive assay, and through the inspection of tamper seal 
integrity and associated seal records.
    (12) Areas used for preparing strategic special nuclear material for 
shipment and areas used for packaging and screening trash and wastes 
shall be controlled access areas and shall be separated from processing 
and storage areas.
    (13) Individuals not permitted by the licensee to enter protected 
areas without escort must be escorted by a watchman or other individual 
designated by the licensee while in a protected area and must be badged 
to indicate that an escort is required. In addition, the individual 
shall be required to register his or her name, date, time, purpose of 
visit and employment affiliation, citizenship, and name of the 
individual to be visited in a log. The licensee shall retain each log as 
a record for three years after the last entry is made in the log.
    (14) All keys, locks, combinations and related equipment used to 
control access to protected, material access, vital, and controlled 
access areas shall be controlled to reduce the probability of 
compromise. Whenever there is evidence that a key, lock, combination, or 
related equipment may have been compromised it shall be changed. Upon 
termination of employment of any employee, keys, locks, combinations, 
and related equipment to which that employee had access, shall be 
changed.
    (15) The licensee may not announce or otherwise communicate to its 
employees or site contractors the arrival or presence of an NRC 
safeguards inspector unless specifically requested to do so by the NRC 
safeguards inspector.
    (e) Detection, surveillance and alarm subsystems and procedures. (1) 
The licensee shall provide an intrusion alarm

[[Page 494]]

subsystem with a capability to detect penetration through the isolation 
zone and to permit response action.
    (2) All emergency exits in each protected, material access, and 
vital area shall be locked to prevent entry from the outside and alarmed 
to provide local visible and audible alarm annunciation.
    (3) All unoccupied vital areas and material access areas shall be 
locked and protected by an intrusion alarm subsystem which will alarm 
upon the entry of a person anywhere into the area, upon exit from the 
area, and upon movement of an individual within the area, except that 
for process material access areas only the location of the strategic 
special nuclear material within the area is required to be so alarmed. 
Vaults and process areas that contain strategic special nuclear material 
that has not been alloyed or encapsulated shall also be under the 
surveillance of closed circuit television that is monitored in both 
alarm stations. Additionally, means shall be employed which require that 
an individual other than an alarm station operator be present at or have 
knowledge of access to such unoccupied vaults or process areas.
    (4) All manned access control points in the protected area barrier, 
all security patrols and guard stations within the protected area, and 
both alarm stations shall be provided with duress alarms.
    (5) All alarms required pursuant to this section shall annunciate in 
a continuously manned central alarm station located within the protected 
area and in at least one other independent continuously manned onsite 
station not necessarily within the protected area, so that a single act 
cannot remove the capability of calling for assistance or responding to 
an alarm. The alarm stations shall be controlled access areas and their 
walls, doors, ceiling, floor, and windows shall be bullet-resisting. The 
central alarm station shall be located within a building so that the 
interior of the central alarm station is not visible from the perimeter 
of the protected area. This station may not contain any operational 
activities that would interfere with the execution of the alarm response 
function.
    (6) All alarms required by this section shall remain operable from 
independent power sources in the event of the loss of normal power. 
Switchover to standby power shall be automatic and shall not cause false 
alarms on annunciator modules.
    (7) All alarm devices including transmission lines to annunciators 
shall be tamper indicating and self-checking e.g., an automatic 
indication shall be provided when a failure of the alarm system or a 
component occurs, when there is an attempt to compromise the system, or 
when the system is on standby power. The annunciation of an alarm at the 
alarm stations shall indicate the type of alarm (e.g., intrusion alarm, 
emergency exit alarm, etc.) and location. The status of all alarms and 
alarm zones shall be indicated in the alarm stations.
    (8) All exterior areas within the protected area shall be monitored 
or periodically checked to detect the presence of unauthorized persons, 
vehicles, materials, or unauthorized activities.
    (9) Methods to observe individuals within material access areas to 
assure that strategic special nuclear material is not moved to 
unauthorized locations or in an unauthorized manner shall be provided 
and used on a continuing basis.
    (f) Communication subsystems. (1) Each guard, watchman, or armed 
response individual on duty shall be capable of maintaining continuous 
communication with an individual in each continuously manned alarm 
station required by paragraph (e)(5) of this section, who shall be 
capable of calling for assistance from other guards, watchmen, and armed 
response personnel and from law enforcement authorities.
    (2) Each alarm station required by paragraph (e)(5) of this section 
shall have both conventional telephone service and radio or microwave 
transmitted two-way voice communication, either directly or through an 
intermediary, for the capability of communication with the law 
enforcement authorities.
    (3) Non-portable communications equipment controlled by the licensee 
and required by this section shall remain operable from independent 
power

[[Page 495]]

sources in the event of the loss of normal power.
    (g) Test and maintenance programs. The licensee shall have a test 
and maintenance program for intrusion alarms, emergency exit alarms, 
communications equipment, physical barriers, and other physical 
protection related devices and equipment used pursuant to this section 
that shall provide for the following:
    (1) Tests and inspections during the installation and construction 
of physical protection related subsystems and components to assure that 
they comply with their respective design criteria and performance 
specifications.
    (2) Preoperational tests and inspections of physical protection 
related subsystems and components to demonstrate their effectiveness and 
availability with respect to their respective design criteria and 
performance specifications.
    (3) Operational tests and inspections of physical protection related 
subsystems and components to assure their maintenance in an operable and 
effective condition, including:
    (i) Testing of each intrusion alarm at the beginning and end of any 
period that it is used. If the period of continuous use is longer than 
seven days, the intrusion alarm shall also be tested at least once every 
seven days.
    (ii) Testing of communications equipment required for communications 
onsite, including duress alarms, for performance not less frequently 
than once at the beginning of each security personnel work shift. 
Communications equipment required for communications offsite shall be 
tested for performance not less than once a day.
    (4) Preventive maintenance programs shall be established for 
physical protection related subsystems and components to assure their 
continued maintenance in an operable and effective condition.
    (5) All physical protection related subsystems and components shall 
be maintained in operable condition. The licensee shall develop and 
employ corrective action procedures and compensatory measures to assure 
that the effectiveness of the physical protection system is not reduced 
by failure or other contingencies affecting the operation of the 
security related equipment or structures. Repairs and maintenance shall 
be performed by at least two individuals working as a team who have been 
trained in the operation and performance of the equipment. The security 
organization shall be notified before and after service is performed and 
shall conduct performance verification tests after the service has been 
completed.
    (6) The security program must be reviewed at least every 12 months 
by individuals independent of both security program management and 
personnel who have direct responsibility for implementation of the 
security program. The security program review must include an audit of 
security procedures and practices, an evaluation of the effectiveness of 
the physical protection system, an audit of the physical protection 
system testing and maintenance program, and an audit of commitments 
established for response by local law enforcement authorities. The 
results and recommendations of the security program review, and any 
actions taken, must be documented in a report to the licensee's plant 
manager and to corporate management at least one level higher than that 
having responsibility for the day-to-day plant operations. These reports 
must be maintained in an auditable form, available for inspection for a 
period of 3 years.
    (h) Contingency and response plans and procedures. (1) The licensee 
shall establish, maintain, and follow an NRC-approved safeguards 
contingency plan for responding to threats, thefts, and radiological 
sabotage related to the strategic special nuclear material and nuclear 
facilities subject to the provisions of this section. Safeguards 
contingency plans must be in accordance with the criteria in appendix C 
to this part, ``Licensee Safeguards Contingency Plans.'' Contingency 
plans must include, but not limited to, the response requirements listed 
in paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(5) of this section. The licensee shall 
retain the current safeguards contingency plan as a record until the 
Commission terminates the license and, if any portion of the plan is 
superseded, retain that superseded portion for 3 years after the 
effective date of change.

[[Page 496]]

    (2) The licensee shall establish and document response arrangements 
that have been made with local law enforcement authorities. The licensee 
shall retain documentation of the current arrangements as a record until 
the Commission terminates each license requiring the arrangements and, 
if any arrangement is superseded, retain the superseded material for 
three years after each change.
    (3) A Tactical Response Team consisting of a minimum of five (5) 
members must be available at the facility to fulfill assessment and 
response requirements. In addition, a force of guards or armed response 
personnel also must be available to provide assistance as necessary. The 
size and availability of the additional force must be determined on the 
basis of site-specific considerations that could affect the ability of 
the total onsite response force to engage and impede the adversary force 
until offsite assistance arrives. The rationale for the total number and 
availabiliy of onsite armed response personnel must be included in the 
physical protection plans submitted to the Commission for approval.
    (4) Upon detection of abnormal presence or activity of persons or 
vehicles within an isolation zone, a protected area, a material access 
area, or a vital area, or upon evidence or indication of intrusion into 
a protected area, a material access area, or a vital area, the licensee 
security organization shall:
    (i) Determine whether or not a threat exists,
    (ii) Assess the extent of the threat, if any,
    (iii) Take immediate concurrent measures to neutralize the threat 
by:
    (A) Requiring responding guards or other armed response personnel to 
interpose themselves between vital areas and material access areas and 
any adversary attempting entry for purposes of radiological sabotage or 
theft of strategic special nuclear material and to intercept any person 
exiting with special nuclear material, and
    (B) Informing local law enforcement agencies of the threat and 
requesting assistance.
    (5) The licensee shall instruct every guard and all armed response 
personnel to prevent or impede acts of radiological sabotage or theft of 
strategic special nuclear material by using force sufficient to counter 
the force directed at him including the use of deadly force when the 
guard or other armed response person has a reasonable belief that it is 
necessary in self-defense or in the defense of others.
    (6) To facilitate initial response to detection of penetration of 
the protected area and assessment of the existence of a threat, a 
capability of observing the isolation zones and the physical barrier at 
the perimeter of the protected area shall be provided, preferably by 
means of closed circuit television or by other suitable means which 
limit exposure of responding personnel to possible attack.
    (7) Alarms occurring within unoccupied vaults and unoccupied 
material access areas containing unalloyed or unencapsulated strategic 
special nuclear material shall be assessed by at least two security 
personnel using closed circuit television (CCTV) or other remote means.
    (8) Alarms occurring within unoccupied material access areas that 
contain only alloyed or encapsulated strategic special nuclear material 
shall be assessed as in paragraph (h)(7) of this section or by at least 
two security personnel who shall undergo a search before exiting the 
material access area.
    (i) Implementation schedule for revisions to physical protection 
plans. (1) By November 28, 1994, each licensee shall submit a revised 
Fixed Site Physical Protection Plan to the NRC for approval. The revised 
plan must describe how the licensee will comply with the requirements of

that are not readily separable from other radioactive material and which 
have total external radiation dose rates in excess of 100 rems per hour 
at a distance of 3 feet from any accessible surfaces without intervening 
shielding other than at nuclear reactor facility licensed under parts 50 
or 52 of this chapter, shall comply with the following:
    (a) Physical security organization. (1) The licensee shall establish 
a security organization, including guards, to protect his facility 
against radiological sabotage and the special nuclear material in his 
possession against theft.
    (2) At least one supervisor of the security organization shall be on 
site at all times.
    (3) The licensee shall establish, maintain, and follow written 
security procedures that document the structure of the security 
organization and detail the duties of guards, watchmen, and other 
individuals responsible for security. The licensee shall retain a copy 
of the current procedures as a record until the Commission terminates 
each license for which the procedures were developed and, if any portion 
of the procedures is superseded, retain the superseded material for 
three years after each change.
    (4) The licensee may not permit an individual to act as a guard, 
watchman, armed response person, or other member of the security 
organization unless the individual has been trained, equipped, and 
qualified to perform each assigned security job duty in accordance with 
appendix B, ``General Criteria for Security Personnel,'' to this part. 
Upon the request of an authorized representative of the Commission, the 
licensee shall demonstrate the ability of the physical security 
personnel to carry out their assigned duties and responsibilities. Each 
guard, watchman, armed response person, and other member of the security 
organization shall requalify in accordance with appendix B to this part 
at least every 12 months. This requalification must be documented. The 
licensee shall retain the documentation of each requalification as a 
record for three years after the requalification.
    (b) Physical barriers. (1) The licensee shall locate vital equipment 
only within a vital area, which, in turn, shall be located within a 
protected area such that access to vital equipment requires passage 
through at least two physical barriers. More than one vital area may be 
within a single protected area.
    (2) The licensee shall locate material access areas only within 
protected areas such that access to the material access area requires 
passage through at least two physical barriers. More than one material 
access area may be within a single protected area.
    (3) The physical barrier at the perimeter of the protected area 
shall be separated from any other barrier designated as a physical 
barrier within the protected area, and the intervening space monitored 
or periodically checked to detect the presence of persons or vehicles so 
that the facility security organization can respond to suspicious 
activity or to the breaching of any physical barrier.
    (4) An isolation zone shall be maintained around the physical 
barrier at the perimeter of the protected area and any part of a 
building used as part of that physical barrier. The isolation zone shall 
be monitored to detect the presence of individuals or vehicles within 
the zone so as to allow response by armed members of the license 
security organization to be initiated at the time of penetration of the 
protected area. Parking facilities, both for employees and visitors, 
shall be located outside the isolation zone.
    (5) Isolation zones and clear areas between barriers shall be 
provided with illumination sufficient for the monitoring required by 
paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section, but not less than 0.2 foot 
candles.
    (c) Access requirements. The licensee shall control all points of 
personnel

[[Page 498]]

and vehicle access into a protected area, including shipping or 
receiving areas, and into each vital area. Identification of personnel 
and vehicles shall be made and authorization shall be checked at such 
points.
    (1) At the point of personnel and vehicle access into a protected 
area, all individuals, except employees who possess a NRC or United 
States Department of Energy access authorization, and all hand-carried 
packages shall be searched for devices such as firearms, explosives, and 
incendiary devices, or other items which could be used for radiological 
sabotage. The search shall be conducted either by a physical search or 
by the use of equipment capable of detecting such devices. Employees who 
possess an NRC or Department of Energy access authorization shall be 
searched at random intervals. Subsequent to search, drivers of delivery 
and service vehicles shall be escorted at all times while within the 
protection area.
    (2) All packages being delivered into the protected area shall be 
checked for proper identification and authorization. Packages other than 
hand-carried packages shall be searched at random intervals.
    (3) A picture badge identification system shall be used for all 
individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.
    (4) Access to vital areas and material access areas shall be limited 
to individuals who are authorized access to vital equipment or special 
nuclear material and who require such access to perform their duties. 
Authorization for such individuals shall be provided by the issuance of 
specially coded numbered badges indicating vital areas and material 
access areas to which access is authorized. Unoccupied vital areas and 
material access areas shall be protected by an active intrusion alarm 
system.
    (5) Individuals not employed by the licensee must be escorted by a 
watchman, or other individual designated by the licensee, while in a 
protected area and must be badged to indicate that an escort is 
required. In addition, the licensee shall require that each individual 
not employed by the licensee register his or her name, date, time, 
purpose of visit, employment affiliation, citizenship, name and badge 
number of the escort, and name of the individual to be visited. The 
licensee shall retain the register of information for three years after 
the last entry is made in the register. Except for a driver of a 
delivery or service vehicle, an individual not employed by the licensee 
who requires frequent and extended access to a protected area or a vital 
area need not be escorted if the individual is provided with a picture 
badge, which the individual must receive upon entrance into the 
protected area and return each time he or she leaves the protected area, 
that indicates--
    (i) Nonemployee-no escort required,
    (ii) Areas to which access is authorized, and
    (iii) The period for which access has been authorized.
    (6) No vehicles used primarily for the conveyance of individuals 
shall be permitted within a protected area except under emergency 
conditions.
    (7) Keys, locks, combinations, and related equipment shall be 
controlled to minimize the possibility of compromise and promptly 
changed whenever there is evidence that they have been compromised. Upon 
termination of employment of any employee, keys, locks, combinations, 
and related equipment to which that employee had access shall be 
changed.
    (d) Detection aids. (1) All alarms required pursuant to this part 
shall annunciate in a continuously manned central alarm station located 
within the protected area and in at least one other continuously manned 
station, not necessarily within the protected area, such that a single 
act cannot remove the capability of calling for assistance or otherwise 
responding to an alarm. All alarms shall be self-checking and tamper 
indicating. The annunciation of an alarm at the onsite central alarm 
station shall indicate the type of alarm (e.g., intrusion alarm, 
emergency exit alarm, etc.) and location. All intrusion alarms, 
emergency exit alarms, alarm systems, and line supervisory systems shall 
at minimum meet the performance and reliability levels indicated by GSA 
Interim Federal Specification W-A-00450 B (GSA-

[[Page 499]]

FSS). The GSA Interim Federal Specification has been approved for 
incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register. A 
copy of the material is available for inspection at the NRC Library, 
11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852-2738.
    (2) All emergency exits in each protected area and each vital area 
shall be alarmed.
    (e) Communication requirements. (1) Each guard or watchman on duty 
shall be capable of maintaining continuous communication with an 
individual in a continuously manned central alarm station within the 
protected area, who shall be capable of calling for assistance from 
other guards and watchmen and from local law enforcement authorities.
    (2) The alarm stations required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall have conventional telephone service for communication with the law 
enforcement authorities as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.

radio voice communication shall be established in addition to 
conventional telephone service between local law enforcement authorities 
and the facility and shall terminate at the facility in a continuously 
manned central alarm station within the protected area.
    (4) All communications equipment, including offsite equipment, shall 
remain operable from independent power sources in the event of loss of 
primary power.
    (f) Testing and maintenance. Each licensee shall test and maintain 
intrusion alarms, emergency alarms, communications equipment, physical 
barriers, and other security related devices or equipment utilized 
pursuant to this section as follows:
    (1) All alarms, communications equipment, physical barriers, and 
other security related devices or equipment shall be maintained in 
operable and effective condition.
    (2) Each intrusion alarm shall be functionally tested for 
operability and required performance at the beginning and end of each 
interval during which it is used for security, but not less frequently 
than once every seven (7) days.
    (3) Communications equipment shall be tested for operability and 
performance not less frequently than once at the beginning of each 
security personnel work shift.
    (g) Response requirement. (1) The licensee shall establish,

three years after each change.
    (3) Upon detection of abnormal presence or activity of persons or 
vehicles within an isolation zone, a protected area, a material access 
area, or a vital area; or upon evidence or indication of intrusion into 
a protected area, material access area, or vital area, the licensee 
security organization shall:
    (i) Determine whether or not a threat exists,
    (ii) Assess the extent of the threat, if any, and
    (iii) Take immediate concurrent measures to neutralize the threat, 
by:
    (A) Requiring responding guards to interpose themselves between 
material access areas and vital areas and any adversary attempting entry 
for the purpose of theft of special nuclear material or radiological 
sabotage and to intercept any person exiting with special nuclear 
material, and,
    (B) Informing local law enforcement agencies of the threat and 
requesting assistance.

[[Page 500]]

    (4) The licensee shall instruct every guard to prevent or impede 
attempted acts of theft or radiological sabotage by using force 
sufficient to counter the force directed at him including deadly force 
when the guard has a reasonable belief it is necessary in self-defense 
or in the defense of others.
    (h) Each licensee shall establish, maintain, and follow an NRC-
approved training and qualifications plan outlining the processes by 
which guards, watchmen, armed response persons, and other members of the 
security organization will be selected, trained, equipped, tested, and 
qualified to ensure that these individuals meet the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

surveillance and be protected by an active intrusion alarm system which 
is capable of detecting penetrations through the isolation zone and that 
is monitored in a continually staffed primary alarm station and in one 
additional continually staffed location. The primary alarm station must 
be located within the protected area; have bullet-resisting walls, 
doors, ceiling, and floor; and the interior of the station must not be 
visible from outside the protected area. A timely means for assessment 
of alarms must also be provided. Regarding alarm monitoring, the 
redundant location need only provide a summary indication that an alarm 
has been generated.
    (4) The protected area must be monitored by daily random patrols.
    (5) A security organization with written procedures must be 
established. The security organization must include sufficient personnel 
per shift to provide for monitoring of detection systems and the conduct 
of surveillance, assessment, access control, and communications to 
assure adequate response. Members of the security organization must be 
trained, equipped, qualified, and requalified to perform assigned job 
duties in accordance with appendix B to part 73, sections I.A, (1) (a) 
and (b), B(1)(a), and the applicable portions of II.
    (6) Documented liaison with a designated response force or local law 
enforcement agency (LLEA) must be established to permit timely response 
to unauthorized penetration or activities.
    (7) A personnel identification system and a controlled lock system 
must be established and maintained to limit access to authorized 
individuals.
    (8) Redundant communications capability must be provided between 
onsite security force members and designated response force or LLEA.
    (9) All individuals, vehicles, and hand-carried packages entering 
the protected area must be checked for proper authorization and visually 
searched for explosives before entry.
    (10) Written response procedures must be established and maintained 
for addressing unauthorized penetration of, or activities within, the 
protected area including Category 5, ``Procedures,'' of appendix C to 
part 73. The licensee shall retain a copy of response procedures as a 
record for 3 years or until termination of the license for which the 
procedures were developed. Copies of superseded material must be 
retained for 3 years after each change or until termination of the 
license.
    (11) All detection systems and supporting subsystems must be tamper 
indicating with line supervision. These systems, as well as 
surveillance/assessment and illumination systems, must be maintained in 
operable condition. Timely compensatory measures must be taken after 
discovery of inoperability, to assure that the effectiveness of the of 
the security system is not reduced.
    (12) The physical protection program must be reviewed once every 24 
months by individuals independent of both physical protection program 
management and personnel who have direct responsibility for 
implementation of the physical protection program. The physical 
protection program review must include an evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the physical protection system and a verification of 
the liaison established with the designated response force or LLEA.
    (13) The following documentation must be retained as a record for 3 
years after the record is made or until termination of the license. 
Duplicate records to those required under Sec. 72.180 of part 72 and

shall provide any information related to the claimed education that 
could reflect on the individual's trustworthiness and reliability and, 
at a minimum, verify that the individual was registered for the classes 
and received grades that indicate that the individual participated in 
the educational process during the claimed period.
    (iv) If a previous employer, educational institution, or any other 
entity with which the individual claims to have been engaged fails to 
provide information or indicates an inability or unwillingness to 
provide information within 3 business days of the request, the licensee, 
applicant, or contractor or vendor shall:
    (A) Document this refusal or unwillingness in the licensee's, 
applicant's, or contractor's or vendor's record of the investigation; 
and
    (B) Obtain a confirmation of employment, educational enrollment and 
attendance, or other form of engagement claimed by the individual from 
at least one alternate source that has not been previously used.
    (v) When any licensee, applicant, contractor, or vendor is seeking 
the information required for an unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization decision under this section and has obtained a signed 
release from the subject individual authorizing the disclosure of such 
information, other licensees, applicants, contractors and vendors shall 
make available the personal or access authorization information 
requested regarding the denial or unfavorable termination of unescorted 
access or unescorted access authorization.
    (vi) In conducting an employment history evaluation, the licensee, 
applicant, contractor, or vendor may obtain information and documents by 
electronic means, including, but not limited to, telephone, facsimile, 
or e-mail. Licensees, applicants, contractors, or vendors shall make a 
record of the contents of the telephone call and shall retain that 
record, and any documents or electronic files obtained electronically, 
in accordance with paragraph (o) of this section.
    (5) Credit history evaluation. Licensees, applicants, contractors 
and vendors shall ensure that the full credit history of any individual 
who is applying for unescorted access or unescorted access authorization 
is evaluated. A full credit history evaluation must include, but is not 
limited to, an inquiry to detect potential fraud or misuse of social 
security numbers or other financial identifiers, and a review and 
evaluation of all of the information that is provided by a national 
credit-reporting agency about the individual's credit history. For 
individuals including foreign nationals and United States citizens who 
have resided outside the United States and do not have established 
credit history that covers at least the most recent seven years in the 
United States, the licensee, applicant, contractor or vendor must 
document all attempts to obtain information regarding the individual's 
credit history and financial responsibility from some relevant entity 
located in that other country or countries.
    (6) Character and reputation evaluation. Licensees, applicants, 
contractors, and vendors shall ascertain the character and reputation of 
an individual who has applied for unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization by conducting reference checks. Reference checks may not 
be conducted with any person who is known to be a close member of the 
individual's family, including but not limited to, the individual's 
spouse, parents, siblings, or children, or any individual who resides in 
the individual's permanent household. The reference checks must focus on 
the individual's reputation for trustworthiness and reliability.
    (7) Criminal history review. The licensee's or applicant's reviewing 
official shall evaluate the entire criminal history record of an 
individual who is applying for unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization to determine whether the individual has a record of 
criminal activity that may adversely impact his or her trustworthiness 
and reliability. A criminal history record must be obtained in 
accordance with the requirements of

[[Page 521]]

Sec. 73.57. For individuals who do not have or are not expected to have 
unescorted access, a criminal history record of the individual shall be 
obtained in accordance with the requirements set forth in paragraph 
(k)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (e) Psychological assessment. In order to assist in determining an 
individual's trustworthiness and reliability, licensees, applicants, 
contractors or vendors shall ensure that a psychological assessment has 
been completed before the individual is granted unescorted access or 
certified unescorted access authorization. Individuals who are applying 
for initial unescorted access or unescorted access authorization, or who 
have not maintained unescorted access or unescorted access authorization 
for greater than 365 days, shall be subject to a psychological 
assessment. The psychological assessment must be designed to evaluate 
the possible adverse impact of any noted psychological characteristics 
on the individual's trustworthiness and reliability.
    (1) A licensed psychologist or psychiatrist with the appropriate 
training and experience shall conduct the psychological assessment.
    (2) The psychological assessment must be conducted in accordance 
with the applicable ethical principles for conducting such assessments 
established by the American Psychological Association or American 
Psychiatric Association.
    (3) At a minimum, the psychological assessment must include the 
administration and interpretation of a standardized, objective, 
professionally-accepted psychological test that provides information to 
identify indications of disturbances in personality or psychopathology 
that may have adverse implications for an individual's trustworthiness 
and reliability. A psychiatrist or psychologist specified in paragraph 
(e) of this section shall establish the predetermined thresholds for 
each scale, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, that 
must be applied in interpreting the results of the psychological test to 
determine whether an individual must be interviewed by a licensed 
psychiatrist or psychologist, under Sec. 73.56(e)(4)(i) of this 
section.
    (4) The psychological assessment must include a clinical interview:
    (i) If an individual's scores on the psychological test in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section identify indications of disturbances in 
personality or psychopathology that may have implications for an 
individual's trustworthiness and reliability; or
    (ii) If the individual is a member of the population that performs 
one or more job functions that are critical to the safe and secure 
operation of the licensee's facility, as defined in paragraph 
(i)(1)(v)(B) of this section.
    (5) In the course of conducting a psychological assessment for those 
individuals who are specified in paragraph (h) of this section for 
initial unescorted access or unescorted access authorization category, 
if the licensed psychologist or psychiatrist identifies or discovers any 
information, including a medical condition, that could adversely impact 
the individual's fitness for duty or trustworthiness and reliability, 
the licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor shall ensure that the 
psychologist or psychiatrist contact appropriate medical personnel to 
obtain further information as need for a determination. The results of 
the evaluation and a recommendation shall be provided to the licensee's 
or applicant's reviewing official.
    (6) During psychological reassessments, if the licensed psychologist 
or psychiatrist identifies or discovers any information, including a 
medical condition, that could adversely impact the fitness for duty or 
trustworthiness and reliability of those individuals who are currently 
granted unescorted access or certified unescorted access authorization 
status, he or she shall inform (1) the reviewing official of the 
discovery within 24 hours of the discovery and (2) the medical personnel 
designated in the site implementing procedures, who shall ensure that an 
appropriate evaluation of the possible medical condition is conducted 
under the requirements of part 26 of this chapter. The results of the 
evaluation and a recommendation shall be provided to the licensee's or 
applicant's reviewing official.

[[Page 522]]

    (f) Behavioral observation. (1) Licensee and applicant access 
authorization programs must include a behavioral observation program 
that is designed to detect behaviors or activities that may constitute 
an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of the public and common 
defense and security, including a potential threat to commit 
radiological sabotage. Licensees, applicants and contractors or vendors 
must ensure that the individuals specified in paragraph (b)(1) and, if 
applicable, (b)(2) of this section are subject to behavioral 
observation.
    (2) Each person subject to the behavior observation program shall be 
responsible for communicating to the licensee or applicant observed 
behaviors of individuals subject to the requirements of this section. 
Such behaviors include any behavior of individuals that may adversely 
affect the safety or security of the licensee's facility or that may 
constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety or the 
common defense and security, including a potential threat to commit 
radiological sabotage.
    (i) Licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors shall ensure 
that individuals who are subject to this section also successfully 
complete initial behavioral observation training and requalification 
behavior observation training as required in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Behavioral observation training must be:
    (A) Completed before the licensee grants unescorted access or 
certifies unescorted access authorization or an applicant certifies 
unescorted access authorization, as defined in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of 
this section,
    (B) Current before the licensee grants unescorted access update or 
reinstatement or licensee or applicant certifies unescorted access 
authorization reinstatement as defined in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this 
section, and
    (C) Maintained in a current status during any period of time an 
individual possesses unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) For initial behavioral observation training, individuals shall 
demonstrate completion by passing a comprehensive examination that 
addresses the knowledge and abilities necessary to detect behavior or 
activities that have the potential to constitute an unreasonable risk to 
the health and safety of the public and common defense and security, 
including a potential threat to commit radiological sabotage. Remedial 
training and re-testing are required for individuals who fail to 
satisfactorily complete the examination.
    (iv) Individuals shall complete refresher training on a nominal 12-
month frequency, or more frequently where the need is indicated. 
Individuals may take and pass a comprehensive examination that meets the 
requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section in lieu of 
completing annual refresher training.
    (v) Initial and refresher training may be delivered using a variety 
of media, including, but not limited to, classroom lectures, required 
reading, video, or computer-based training systems. The licensee, 
applicant, or contractor or vendor shall monitor the completion of 
training.
    (3) Individuals who are subject to an access authorization program 
under this section shall at a minimum, report any concerns arising from 
behavioral observation, including, but not limited to, concerns related 
to any questionable behavior patterns or activities of others to the 
reviewing official, his or her supervisor, or other management personnel 
designated in their site procedures. The recipient of the report shall, 
if other than the reviewing official, promptly convey the report to the 
reviewing official, who shall reassess the reported individual's 
unescorted access or unescorted access authorization status. The 
reviewing official shall determine the elements of the reassessment 
based on the accumulated information of the individual. If the reviewing 
official has a reason to believe that the reported individual's 
trustworthiness or reliability is questionable, the reviewing official 
shall either administratively withdraw or terminate the individual's 
unescorted access or unescorted access authorization while completing 
the re-evaluation or investigation. If the reviewing official

[[Page 523]]

determines from the information provided that there is cause for 
additional action, the reviewing official may inform the supervisor of 
the reported individual.
    (g) Self-reporting of legal actions. (1) Any individual who has 
applied for unescorted access or unescorted access authorization or is 
maintaining unescorted access or unescorted access authorization under 
this section shall promptly report to the reviewing official, his or her 
supervisor, or other management personnel designated in site procedures 
any legal action(s) taken by a law enforcement authority or court of law 
to which the individual has been subject that could result in 
incarceration or a court order or that requires a court appearance, 
including but not limited to an arrest, an indictment, the filing of 
charges, or a conviction, but excluding minor civil actions or 
misdemeanors such as parking violations or speeding tickets. The 
recipient of the report shall, if other than the reviewing official, 
promptly convey the report to the reviewing official. On the day that 
the report is received, the reviewing official shall evaluate the 
circumstances related to the reported legal action(s) and re-determine 
the reported individual's unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization status.
    (2) The licensee or applicant shall inform the individual of this 
obligation, in writing, prior to granting unescorted access or 
certifying unescorted access authorization.
    (h) Granting unescorted access and certifying unescorted access 
authorization. Licensees and applicants shall implement the requirements 
of this paragraph for granting or certifying initial or reinstated 
unescorted access or unescorted access authorization. The investigatory 
information collected to satisfy the requirements of this section for 
individuals who are being considered for unescorted access or unescorted 
access authorization shall be valid for a trustworthiness and 
reliability determination by a licensee or applicant for 30 calendar 
days.
    (1) Determination basis. (i) The licensee's or applicant's reviewing 
official shall determine whether to grant, certify, deny, unfavorably 
terminate, maintain, or administratively withdraw an individual's 
unescorted access or unescorted access authorization status, based on an 
evaluation of all of the information required by this section.
    (ii) The licensee's or applicant's reviewing official may not grant 
unescorted access or certify unescorted access authorization status to 
an individual until all of the information required by this section has 
been evaluated by the reviewing official and the reviewing official has 
determined that the accumulated information supports a determination of 
the individual's trustworthiness and reliability. However, the reviewing 
official may deny or terminate unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization of any individual based on disqualifying information even 
if not all the information required by this section has been collected 
or evaluated.
    (2) Unescorted access for NRC-certified personnel. Licensees and 
applicants shall grant unescorted access to any individual who has been 
certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as suitable for such 
access.
    (3) Access denial. Licensees or applicants may not permit an 
individual, who is identified as having an access-denied status by 
another licensee subject to this section, or has an access authorization 
status other than favorably terminated, to enter any nuclear power plant 
protected area or vital area, under escort or otherwise, or take actions 
by electronic means that could adversely impact the licensee's or 
applicant's safety, security, or emergency response or their facilities, 
under supervision or otherwise, except upon completion of the initial 
unescorted access authorization process.
    (4) Granting unescorted access and certifying unescorted access 
authorization--(i) Initial unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization. In satisfying the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section, for individuals who have never held unescorted access or 
unescorted access authorization status or whose unescorted access or 
unescorted access authorization status has been interrupted for a period 
of 3 years or more, the licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor 
shall satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g)

[[Page 524]]

of this section. In meeting requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(4) 
of this section, the licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor shall 
evaluate the 3 years before the date on which the application for 
unescorted access was submitted, or since the individual's eighteenth 
birthday, whichever is shorter. For the 1-year period proceeding the 
date upon which the individual applies for unescorted access or 
unescorted access authorization, the licensee, applicant or contractor 
or vendor shall ensure that the employment history evaluation is 
conducted with every employer, regardless of the length of employment. 
For the remaining 2-year period, the licensee, applicant, or contractor 
or vendor shall ensure that the employment history evaluation is 
conducted with the employer by whom the individual claims to have been 
employed the longest within each calendar month.
    (ii) Reinstatement of unescorted access. In satisfying the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, for individuals who 
have previously been granted unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization, but whose access had been terminated under favorable 
conditions, licensees, applicants or contractors or vendors shall 
satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this 
section, with consideration of the specific requirements for periods of 
interruption described below in paragraphs (h)(4)(ii)(A) or 
(h)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, as applicable. However, for individuals 
whose unescorted access or unescorted access authorization was 
interrupted for less than or equal to 30 calendar days, licensees, 
applicants, or contractors or vendors must only satisfy the requirements 
set forth in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section. The 
applicable periods of interruption are determined by the number of 
calendar days between the day after the individual's access was 
terminated and the day upon which the individual applies for unescorted 
access or unescorted access authorization.
    (A) For individuals whose last unescorted access or unescorted 
access authorization status has been interrupted for more than 30 
calendar days but less than or equal to 365 calendar days, the licensee, 
applicant or contractor or vendor shall complete the individual's 
employment history evaluation in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section, within 5 business days after 
reinstatement. The licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor shall 
ensure that the employment history evaluation has been conducted with 
the employer by whom the individual claims to have been employed the 
longest within the calendar month. However, if the employment history 
evaluation is not completed within 5 business days of reinstatement due 
to circumstances that are outside of the licensee's, applicant's, or 
contractor's or vendor's control and the licensee or applicant, 
contractor or vendor is not aware of any potentially disqualifying 
information regarding the individual within the past 5 years, the 
licensee may extend the individual's unescorted access an additional 5 
business days. If the employment history evaluation is not completed 
within this extended 5 business days, the licensee shall 
administratively withdraw unescorted access and complete the employment 
history evaluation in accordance with Sec. 73.56(d)(4) of this section. 
For re-certification of unescorted access authorization, prior to re-
certification of unescorted access authorization status of an 
individual, the licensee or applicant shall complete all the elements 
stated above including drug screening and employment evaluation.
    (B) For individuals whose last unescorted access or unescorted 
access authorization status has been interrupted for greater than 365 
calendar days but fewer than 3 years the licensee, applicant or 
contractor or vendor shall evaluate the period of time since the 
individual last held unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization status, up to and including the day the individual applies 
for re-instated unescorted access authorization. For the 1-year period 
proceeding the date upon which the individual applies for unescorted 
access authorization, the licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor 
shall ensure that the employment history evaluation is conducted with 
every employer, regardless of the length of employment.

[[Page 525]]

For the remaining period, the licensee, applicant or contractor or 
vendor shall ensure that the employment history evaluation is conducted 
with the employer by whom the individual claims to have been employed 
the longest within each calendar month. In addition, the individual 
shall be subject to the psychological assessment required in Sec. 
73.56(e).
    (5) Accepting unescorted access authorization from other access 
authorization programs. Licensees who are seeking to grant unescorted 
access or certify unescorted access authorization or applicants who are 
seeking to certify unescorted access authorization to an individual who 
is subject to another access authorization program or another access 
authorization program that complies with this section may rely on those 
access authorization programs or access authorization program elements 
to comply with the requirements of this section. However, the licensee 
who is seeking to grant unescorted access or the licensee or applicant 
who is seeking to certify unescorted access authorization shall ensure 
that the program elements to be accepted have been maintained consistent 
with the requirements of this section by the other access authorization 
program.
    (6) Information sharing. To meet the requirements of this section, 
licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors may rely upon the 
information that other licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors 
who are also subject to this section, have gathered about individuals 
who have previously applied for unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization, and developed about individuals during periods in which 
the individuals maintained unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization status.
    (i) Maintaining unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization.
    (1) Individuals may maintain unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization status under the following conditions:
    (i) The individual remains subject to a behavioral observation 
program that complies with the requirements of Sec. 73.56(f) of this 
section.
    (ii) The individual successfully completes behavioral observation 
refresher training or testing on the nominal 12-month frequency required 
in Sec. 73.56(f)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) The individual complies with the licensee's or applicant's 
access authorization program policies and procedures to which he or she 
is subject, including the self-reporting of legal actions responsibility 
specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (iv) The individual is subject to an annual supervisory review 
conducted in accordance with the requirements of the licensee's or 
applicant's behavioral observation program. The individual shall be 
subject to a supervisory interview in accordance with the requirements 
of the licensee's or applicant's behavioral observation program, if the 
supervisor does not have the frequent interaction with the individual 
throughout the review period needed to form an informed and reasonable 
opinion regarding the individual's behavior, trustworthiness, and 
reliability.
    (v) The licensee's or applicant's reviewing official determines that 
the individual continues to be trustworthy and reliable. This 
determination must, at a minimum, be based on the following:
    (A) A criminal history update and credit history re-evaluation for 
any individual with unescorted access. The criminal history update and 
credit history re-evaluation must be completed within 5 years of the 
date on which these elements were last completed.
    (B) For individuals who perform one or more of the job functions 
described in this paragraph, the trustworthiness and reliability 
determination must be based on a criminal history update and credit 
history re-evaluation within three years of the date on which these 
elements were last completed, or more frequently, based on job 
assignment as determined by the licensee or applicant, and a 
psychological re-assessment within 5 years of the date on which this 
element was last completed:
    (1) Individuals who have extensive knowledge of defensive strategies 
and design and/or implementation of the plant's defense strategies, 
including--
    (i) Site security supervisors;
    (ii) Site security managers;
    (iii) Security training instructors; and

[[Page 526]]

    (iv) Corporate security managers;
    (2) Individuals in a position to grant an applicant unescorted 
access or unescorted access authorization, including site access 
authorization managers;
    (3) Individuals assigned a duty to search for contraband or other 
items that could be used to commit radiological sabotage (i.e., weapons, 
explosives, incendiary devices);
    (4) Individuals who have access, extensive knowledge, or 
administrative control over plant digital computer and communication 
systems and networks as identified in Sec. 73.54, including--
    (i) Plant network systems administrators;
    (ii) IT personnel who are responsible for securing plant networks; 
or
    (5) Individuals qualified for and assigned duties as: armed security 
officers, armed responders, alarm station operators, response team 
leaders, and armorers as defined in the licensee's or applicant's 
Physical Security Plan; and reactor operators, senior reactor operators 
and non-licensed operators. Non-licensed operators include those 
individuals responsible for the operation of plant systems and 
components, as directed by a reactor operator or senior reactor 
operator. A non-licensed operator also includes individuals who monitor 
plant instrumentation and equipment and principally perform their duties 
outside of the control room.
    (C) The criminal history update and the credit history re-evaluation 
shall be completed within 30 calendar days of each other.
    (vi) If the criminal history update, credit history re-evaluation, 
psychological re-assessment, if required, and supervisory review and 
interview, if applicable, have not been completed and the information 
evaluated by the reviewing official within the time frame specified 
under paragraph (v) of this section, the licensee or applicant shall 
administratively withdraw the individual's unescorted access or 
unescorted access authorization until these requirements have been met.
    (2) If an individual who has unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization status is not subject to an access authorization program 
that meets the requirements of this part for more than 30 continuous 
days, then the licensee or applicant shall terminate the individual's 
unescorted access or unescorted access authorization status and the 
individual shall meet the requirements in this section, as applicable, 
to regain unescorted access or unescorted access authorization.
    (j) Access to vital areas. Licensees or applicants shall establish, 
implement, and maintain a list of individuals who are authorized to have 
unescorted access to specific nuclear power plant vital areas during 
non-emergency conditions. The list must include only those individuals 
who have a continued need for access to those specific vital areas in 
order to perform their duties and responsibilities. The list must be 
approved by a cognizant licensee or applicant manager or supervisor who 
is responsible for directing the work activities of the individual who 
is granted unescorted access to each vital area, and updated and re-
approved no less frequently than every 31 days.
    (k) Trustworthiness and reliability of background screeners and 
access authorization program personnel. Licensees, applicants, and 
contractors or vendors shall ensure that any individual who collects, 
processes, or has access to personal information that is used to make 
unescorted access or unescorted access authorization determinations 
under this section has been determined to be trustworthy and reliable.
    (1) Background screeners. Licensees, applicants, and contractors or 
vendors who rely on individuals who are not directly under their control 
to collect and process information that will be used by a reviewing 
official to make unescorted access or unescorted access authorization 
determinations shall ensure that a trustworthiness and reliability 
evaluation of such individuals has been completed to support a 
determination that such individuals are trustworthy and reliable. At a 
minimum, the following checks are required:
    (i) Verify the individual's true identity as specified in paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section;
    (ii) A local criminal history review and evaluation based on

    (iv) An employment history review and evaluation covering the past 3 
years; and
    (v) An evaluation of character and reputation.
    (2) Access authorization program personnel. Licensees, applicants, 
and contractors or vendors shall ensure that any individual who 
evaluates personal information for the purpose of processing 
applications for unescorted access or unescorted access authorization, 
including but not limited to a psychologist or psychiatrist who conducts 
psychological assessments under Sec. 73.56(e), has access to the files, 
records, and personal information associated with individuals who have 
applied for unescorted access or unescorted access authorization, or is 
responsible for managing any databases that contain such files, records, 
and personal information has been determined to be trustworthy and 
reliable, as follows:
    (i) The individual is subject to an access authorization program 
that meets the requirements of this section; or
    (ii) The licensee, applicant, and contractor or vendor determines 
that the individual is trustworthy and reliable based upon an evaluation 
that meets the requirements of Sec. 73.56(d)(1) through (d)(6) and (e) 
and either a local criminal history review and evaluation as specified 
in Sec. 73.56(k)(1)(ii) or a criminal history check that meets the 
requirements of Sec. 73.56(d)(7).
    (l) Review procedures. Each licensee and applicant shall include a 
procedure for the notification of individuals who are denied unescorted 
access, unescorted access authorization, or who are unfavorably 
terminated. Additionally, procedures must include provisions for the 
review, at the request of the affected individual, of a denial or 
unfavorable termination of unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization that may adversely affect employment. The procedure must 
contain a provision to ensure the individual is informed of the grounds 
for the denial or unfavorable termination and allow the individual an 
opportunity to provide additional relevant information and an 
opportunity for an objective review of the information upon which the 
denial or unfavorable termination of unescorted access or unescorted 
access authorization was based. The procedure must provide for an 
impartial and independent internal management review. Licensees and 
applicants shall not grant unescorted access or certify unescorted 
access authorization, or permit the individual to maintain unescorted 
access or unescorted access authorization during the review process.
    (m) Protection of information. Each licensee, applicant, contractor, 
or vendor shall establish and maintain a system of files and procedures 
to ensure personal information is not disclosed to unauthorized persons.
    (1) Licensees, applicants and contractors or vendors shall obtain 
signed consent from the subject individual that authorizes the 
disclosure of any information collected and maintained under this 
section before disclosing the information, except for disclosures to the 
following individuals:
    (i) The subject individual or his or her representative, when the 
individual has designated the representative in writing for specified 
unescorted access authorization matters;
    (ii) NRC representatives;
    (iii) Appropriate law enforcement officials under court order;
    (iv) A licensee's, applicant's, or contractor's or vendor's 
representatives who have a need to have access to the information in 
performing assigned duties, including determinations of trustworthiness 
and reliability and audits of access authorization programs;
    (v) The presiding officer in a judicial or administrative proceeding 
that is initiated by the subject individual;
    (vi) Persons deciding matters under the review procedures in 
paragraph (k) of this section; or
    (vii) Other persons pursuant to court order.
    (2) All information pertaining to a denial or unfavorable 
termination of the individual's unescorted access or unescorted access 
authorization shall be promptly provided, upon receipt of a

[[Page 528]]

written request by the subject individual or his or her designated 
representative as designated in writing. The licensee or applicant may 
redact the information to be released to the extent that personal 
privacy information, including the name of the source of the information 
is withheld.
    (3) A contract with any individual or organization who collects and 
maintains personal information that is relevant to an unescorted access 
or unescorted access authorization determination must require that such 
records be held in confidence, except as provided in paragraphs (m)(1) 
through (m)(2) of this section.
    (4) Licensees, applicants, or contractors or vendors and any 
individual or organization who collects and maintains personal 
information on behalf of a licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor, 
shall establish, implement, and maintain a system and procedures for the 
secure storage and handling of the information collected.
    (n) Audits and corrective action. Each licensee and applicant shall 
be responsible for the continuing effectiveness of the access 
authorization program, including access authorization program elements 
that are provided by the contractors or vendors, and the access 
authorization programs of any of the contractors or vendors that are 
accepted by the licensee or applicant. Each licensee, applicant, and 
contractor or vendor shall ensure that access authorization programs and 
program elements are audited to confirm compliance with the requirements 
of this section and those comprehensive actions are taken to correct any 
non-conformance that is identified.
    (1) Each licensee and applicant shall ensure that its entire access 
authorization program is audited nominally every 24 months. Licensees, 
applicants and contractors or vendors are responsible for determining 
the appropriate frequency, scope, and depth of additional auditing 
activities within the nominal 24-month period based on the review of 
program performance indicators, such as the frequency, nature, and 
severity of discovered problems, personnel or procedural changes, and 
previous audit findings.
    (2) Access authorization program services that are provided to a 
licensee or applicant by contractor or vendor personnel who are off site 
or are not under the direct daily supervision or observation of the 
licensee's or applicant's personnel must be audited by the licensee or 
applicant on a nominal 12-month frequency. In addition, any access 
authorization program services that are provided to contractors or 
vendors by subcontractor personnel who are off site or are not under the 
direct daily supervision or observation of the contractor's or vendor's 
personnel must be audited by the licensee or applicant on a nominal 12-
month frequency.
    (3) Licensee's and applicant's contracts with contractors or vendors 
must reserve the licensee's or applicant's right to audit the 
contractors or vendors and the contractor's or vendor's subcontractors 
providing access authorization program services at any time, including 
at unannounced times, as well as to review all information and 
documentation that is reasonably relevant to the performance of the 
program.
    (4) Licensee's and applicant's contracts with the contractors or 
vendors, and contractors' or vendors' contracts with subcontractors, 
must also require that the licensee or applicant shall be provided 
access to and be permitted to take away copies of any documents or data 
that may be needed to assure that the contractor or vendor and its 
subcontractors are performing their functions properly and that staff 
and procedures meet applicable requirements.
    (5) Audits must focus on the effectiveness of the access 
authorization program or program element(s), as appropriate. At least 
one member of the licensee or applicant audit team shall be a person who 
is knowledgeable of and practiced with meeting the performance 
objectives and requirements of the access authorization program or 
program elements being audited. The individuals performing the audit of 
the access authorization program or program element(s) shall be 
independent from both the subject access authorization programs' 
management and from personnel who are directly responsible

[[Page 529]]

for implementing the access authorization program or program elements 
being audited.
    (6) The results of the audits, along with any recommendations, must 
be documented in the site corrective action program in accordance with 
Sec. 73.55(b)(10) and reported to senior management having 
responsibility in the area audited and to management responsible for the 
access authorization program. Each audit report must identify conditions 
that are adverse to the proper performance of the access authorization 
program, the cause of the condition(s), and, when appropriate, 
recommended corrective actions, and corrective actions taken. The 
licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor shall review the audit 
findings and take any additional corrective actions, to include re-
auditing of the deficient areas where indicated, to preclude repetition 
of the condition.
    (7) Licensees and applicants may jointly conduct audits, or may 
accept audits of the contractors or vendors that were conducted by other 
licensees and applicants who are subject to this section, if the audit 
addresses the services obtained from the contractor or vendor by each of 
the sharing licensees and applicants. The contractors or vendors may 
jointly conduct audits, or may accept audits of its subcontractors that 
were conducted by other licensees, applicants, or contractors or vendors 
who are subject to this section, if the audit addresses the services 
obtained from the subcontractor by each of the sharing licensees, 
applicants, and the contractors or vendors.
    (i) Licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors shall review 
audit records and reports to identify any areas that were not covered by 
the shared or accepted audit and ensure that authorization program 
elements and services upon which the licensee, applicant, or contractor 
or vendor relies are audited, if the program elements and services were 
not addressed in the shared audit.
    (ii) Sharing licensees and applicants need not re-audit the same 
contractor or vendor for the same time. Sharing contractors or vendors 
need not re-audit the same subcontractor for the same time.
    (iii) Sharing licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors 
shall maintain a copy of the shared audits, including findings, 
recommendations, and corrective actions.
    (o) Records. Licensee, applicants, and contractors or vendors shall 
maintain the records that are required by the regulations in this 
section for the period specified by the appropriate regulation. If a 
retention period is not otherwise specified, these records must be 
retained until the Commission terminates the facility's license, 
certificate, or other regulatory approval.
    (1) Records may be stored and archived electronically, provided that 
the method used to create the electronic records meets the following 
criteria:
    (i) Provides an accurate representation of the original records;
    (ii) Prevents unauthorized access to the records;
    (iii) Prevents the alteration of any archived information and/or 
data once it has been committed to storage; and
    (iv) Permits easy retrieval and re-creation of the original records.
    (2) Licensees and applicants who are subject to this section shall 
retain the following records:
    (i) Records of the information that must be collected under 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section that results in the granting of 
unescorted access or rtifying of unescorted access authorization for at 
least 5 years after the licensee or applicant terminates or denies an 
individual's unescorted access or unescorted access authorization or 
until the completion of all related legal proceedings, whichever is 
later;
    (ii) Records pertaining to denial or unfavorable termination of 
unescorted access or unescorted access authorization and related 
management actions for at least 5 years after the licensee or applicant 
terminates or denies an individual's unescorted access or unescorted 
access authorization or until the completion of all related legal 
proceedings, whichever is later; and
    (iii) Documentation of the granting and termination of unescorted 
access or unescorted access authorization for

[[Page 530]]

at least 5 years after the licensee or applicant terminates or denies an 
individual's unescorted access or unescorted access authorization or 
until the completion of all related legal proceedings, whichever is 
later. Contractors or vendors may maintain the records that are or were 
pertinent to granting, certifying, denying, or terminating unescorted 
access or unescorted access authorization that they collected for 
licensees or applicants. If the contractors or vendors maintain the 
records on behalf of a licensee or an applicant, they shall follow the 
record retention requirement specified in this section. Upon termination 
of a contract between the contractor and vendor and a licensee or 
applicant, the contractor or vendor shall provide the licensee or 
applicant with all records collected for the licensee or applicant under 
this chapter.
    (3) Licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors shall retain 
the following records for at least 3 years or until the completion of 
all related proceedings, whichever is later:
    (i) Records of behavioral observation training conducted under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section; and
    (ii) Records of audits, audit findings, and corrective actions taken 
under paragraph (n) of this section.
    (4) Licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors shall retain 
written agreements for the provision of services under this section, for 
three years after termination or completion of the agreement, or until 
completion of all proceedings related to a denial or unfavorable 
termination of unescorted access or unescorted access authorization that 
involved those services, whichever is later.
    (5) Licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors shall retain 
records of the background investigations, psychological assessments, 
supervisory reviews, and behavior observation program actions related to 
access authorization program personnel, conducted under paragraphs (d) 
and (e) of this section, for the length of the individual's employment 
by or contractual relationship with the licensee, applicant, or the 
contractor or vendor and three years after the termination of 
employment, or until the completion of any proceedings relating to the 
actions of such access authorization program personnel, whichever is 
later.
    (6) Licensees, applicants, and the contractors or vendors who have 
been authorized to add or manipulate data that is shared with licensees 
subject to this section shall ensure that data linked to the information 
about individuals who have applied for unescorted access or unescorted 
access authorization, which is specified in the licensee's or 
applicant's access authorization program documents, is retained.
    (i) If the shared information used for determining individual's 
trustworthiness and reliability changes or new or additional information 
is developed about the individual, the licensees, applicants, and the 
contractors or vendors that acquire this information shall correct or 
augment the data and ensure it is shared with licensees subject to this 
section. If the changed, additional or developed information has 
implications for adversely affecting an individual's trustworthiness and 
reliability, the licensee, applicant, or the contractor or vendor who 
discovered or obtained the new, additional or changed information, 
shall, on the day of discovery, inform the reviewing official of any 
licensee or applicant access authorization program under which the 
individual is maintaining his or her unescorted access or unescorted 
access authorization status of the updated information.
    (ii) The reviewing official shall evaluate the shared information 
and take appropriate actions, which may include denial or unfavorable 
termination of the individual's unescorted access authorization. If the 
notification of change or updated information cannot be made through 
usual methods, licensees, applicants, and the contractors or vendors 
shall take manual actions to ensure that the information is shared as 
soon as reasonably possible. Records maintained in any database(s) must 
be available for NRC review.
    (7) If a licensee or applicant administratively withdraws an 
individual's unescorted access or unescorted access authorization status 
caused by a delay in completing any portion of the background 
investigation or for a licensee

[[Page 531]]

or applicant initiated evaluation, or re-evaluation that is not under 
the individual's control, the licensee or applicant shall record this 
administrative action to withdraw the individual's unescorted access or 
unescorted access authorization with other licensees subject to this 
section. However, licensees and applicants shall not document this 
administrative withdrawal as denial or unfavorable termination and shall 
not respond to a suitable inquiry conducted under the provisions of 10 
CFR parts 26, a background investigation conducted under the provisions 
of this section, or any other inquiry or investigation as denial nor 
unfavorable termination. Upon favorable completion of the background 
investigation element that caused the administrative withdrawal, the 
licensee or applicant shall immediately ensure that any matter that 
could link the individual to the administrative action is eliminated 
from the subject individual's access authorization or personnel record 
and other records, except if a review of the information obtained or 
developed causes the reviewing official to unfavorably terminate or deny 
the individual's unescorted access.

<R05>
Sec. 73.57  Requirements for criminal history records checks of 
individuals granted unescorted access to a nuclear power facility or
access to Safeguards Information.

    (a) General. (1) Each licensee who is authorized to operate a 
nuclear power reactor under part 50 of this chapter, or to engage in an 
activity subject to regulation by the Commission shall comply with the 
requirements of this section.
    (2) Each applicant for a license to operate a nuclear power reactor 
under part 50 of this chapter or to engage in an activity subject to 
regulation by the Commission, as well as each entity who has provided 
written notice to the Commission of intent to file an application for 
licensing, certification, permitting, or approval of a product subject 
to regulation by the Commission shall submit fingerprints for those 
individuals who will have access to Safeguards Information.
    (3) Before receiving its operating license under part 50 of this 
chapter or before the Commission makes its finding under Sec. 52.103(g) 
of this chapter, each applicant for a license to operate a nuclear power 
reactor (including an applicant for a combined license) may submit 
fingerprints for those individuals who will require unescorted access to 
the nuclear power facility.
    (b) General performance objective and requirements. (1) Except those 
listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, each licensee subject to the 
provisions of this section shall fingerprint each individual who is 
permitted unescorted access to the nuclear power facility or access to 
Safeguards Information. Individuals who have unescorted access 
authorization on April 1, 1987 will retain such access pending licensee 
receipt of the results of the criminal history check on the individual's 
fingerprints, so long as the cards were submitted by September 28, 1987. 
The licensee will then review and use the information received from the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and based on the provisions 
contained in this rule, determine either to continue to grant or to deny 
further unescorted access to the facility or Safeguards Information for 
that individual. Individuals who do not have unescorted access or access 
to Safeguards Information after April 1, 1987 shall be fingerprinted by 
the licensee and the results of the criminal history records check shall 
be used prior to making a determination for granting unescorted access 
to the nuclear power facility or access to Safeguards Information.
    (2) Licensees need not fingerprint in accordance with the 
requirements of this section for the following categories:
    (i) For unescorted access to the nuclear power facility (but must 
adhere to provisions contained in Sec. Sec. 73.21 and 73.22): NRC 
employees and NRC contractors on official agency business; individuals 
responding to a site emergency in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 73.55(a); a representative of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) engaged in activities associated with the U.S./IAEA 
Safeguards Agreement at designated facilities who

[[Page 532]]

has been certified by the NRC; law enforcement personnel acting in an 
official capacity; State or local government employees who have had 
equivalent reviews of FBI criminal history data; and individuals 
employed at a facility who possess ``Q'' or ``L'' clearances or possess 
another active government granted security clearance, i.e., Top Secret, 
Secret, or Confidential;
    (ii) For access to Safeguards Information only but must adhere to 
provisions contained in Sec. Sec. 73.21, 73.22, and 73.23: the 
categories of individuals specified in 10 CFR 73.59.
    (iii) Any licensee currently processing criminal history requests 
through the FBI pursuant to Executive Order 10450 need not also submit 
such requests to the NRC under this section; and
    (iv) Upon further notice to licensees and without further 
rulemaking, the Commission may waive certain requirements of this 
section on a temporary basis.
    (3) The licensee shall notify each affected individual that the 
fingerprints will be used to secure a review of his/her criminal history 
record, and inform the individual of proper procedures for revising the 
record or including explanation in the record.
    (4) Fingerprinting is not required if the utility is reinstating the 
unescorted access to the nuclear power facility or access to Safeguards 
Information granted an individual if:
    (i) The individual returns to the same nuclear power utility that 
granted access and such access has not been interrupted for a continuous 
period of more than 365 days; and
    (ii) The previous access was terminated under favorable conditions.
    (5) Fingerprints need not be taken, in the discretion of the 
licensee, if an individual who is an employee of a licensee, contractor, 
manufacturer, or supplier has been granted unescorted access to a 
nuclear power facility or to Safeguards Information by another licensee, 
based in part on a criminal history records check under this section. 
The criminal history check file may be transferred to the gaining 
licensee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section.
    (6) All fingerprints obtained by the licensee under this section 
must be submitted to the Attorney General of the United States through 
the Commission.
    (7) The licensee shall review the information received from the 
Attorney General and consider it in making a determination for granting 
unescorted access to the individual or access to Safeguards Information.
    (8) A licensee shall use the information obtained as part of a 
criminal history records check solely for the purpose of determining an 
individual's suitability for unescorted access to the nuclear power 
facility or access to Safeguards Information.
    (c) Prohibitions. (1) A licensee may not base a final determination 
to deny an individual unescorted access to the nuclear power facility or 
access to Safeguards Information solely on the basis of information 
received from the FBI involving:
    (i) An arrest more than 1 year old for which there is no information 
of the disposition of the case; or
    (ii) An arrest that resulted in dismissal of the charge or an 
acquittal.
    (2) A licensee may not use information received from a criminal 
history check obtained under this section in a manner that would 
infringe upon the rights of any individual under the First Amendment to 
the Constitution of the United States, nor shall the licensee use the 
information in any way which would discriminate among individuals on the 
basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, or age.
    (d) Procedures for processing of fingerprint checks. (1) For the 
purpose of complying with this section, licensees shall, using an 
appropriate method listed in Sec. 73.4, submit to the NRC's Division of 
Facilities and Security, Mail Stop T-6E46, one completed, legible 
standard fingerprint card (Form FD-258, ORIMDNRCOOOZ) or, where 
practicable, other fingerprint record for each individual requiring 
unescorted access to the nuclear power facility or access to Safeguards 
Information, to the Director of the NRC's Division of Facilities and 
Security, marked for the attention of the Division's Criminal History 
Check Section. Copies of these forms may be obtained by writing the

[[Page 533]]

Office of Information Services, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555-0001, by calling (301) 415-7232, or by e-mail to 
FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov. Guidance on what alternative formats might be 
practicable is referenced in Sec. 73.4. The licensee shall establish 
procedures to ensure that the quality of the fingerprints taken results 
in minimizing the rejection rate of fingerprint cards due to illegible 
or incomplete cards.
    (2) The Commission will review applications for criminal history 
checks for completeness. Any Form FD-258 or other fingerprint record 
containing omissions or evident errors will be returned to the licensee 
for corrections. The fee for processing fingerprint checks includes one 
free resubmission if the initial submission is returned by the FBI 
because the fingerprint impressions cannot be classified. The one free 
resubmission must have the FBI Transaction Control Number reflected on 
the resubmission. If additional submissions are necessary, they will be 
treated as an initial submittal and require a second payment of the 
processing fee. The payment of a new processing fee entitles the 
submitter to an additional free resubmittal, if necessary. Previously 
rejected submissions may not be included with the third submission 
because the submittal will be rejected automatically.
    (3)(i) Fees for the processing of fingerprint checks are due upon 
application. Licensees shall submit payment with the application for the 
processing of fingerprints through corporate check, certified check, 
cashier's check, money order, or electronic payment, made payable to 
``U.S. NRC.'' (For guidance on making electronic payments, contact the 
Security Branch, Division of Facilities and Security, at (301) 415-
7404). Combined payment for multiple applications is acceptable.
    (ii) The application fee is the sum of the user fee charged by the 
FBI for each fingerprint card or other fingerprint record submitted by 
the NRC on behalf of a nuclear power plant licensee, and an 
administrative processing fee assessed by the NRC. The NRC processing 
fee covers administrative costs associated with NRC handling of licensee 
fingerprint submissions. The Commission publishes the amount of the 
fingerprint check application fee on the NRC public Web site. (To find 
the current fee amount, go to the Electronic Submittals page at http://
www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html and see the link for the 
Criminal History Program under Electronic Submission Systems.) The 
Commission will directly notify licensees who are subject to this 
regulation of any fee changes.
    (4) The Commission will forward to the submitting licensee all data 
received from the FBI as a result of the licensee's application(s) for 
criminal history checks, to include the FBI fingerprint record.
    (e) Right to correct and complete information. (1) Prior to any 
final adverse determination, the licensee shall make available to the 
individual the contents of records obtained from the FBI for the purpose 
of assuring correct and complete information. Confirmation of receipt by 
the individual of this notification must be maintained by the licensee 
for a period of 1 year from the date of the notification.
    (2) If after reviewing the record, an individual believes that it is 
incorrect or incomplete in any respect and wishes changes, corrections, 
or updating (of the alleged deficiency), or to explain any matter in the 
record, the individual may initiate challenge procedures. These 
procedures include direct application by the individual challenging the 
record to the agency, i.e., law enforcement agency, that contributed the 
questioned information or direct challenge as to the accuracy or 
completeness of any entry on the criminal history record to the 
Assistant Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation Identification 
Division, Washington, DC 20537-9700 as set forth in 28 CFR 16.30 through 
16.34. In the latter case, the FBI then forwards the challenge to the 
agency that submitted the data requesting that agency to verify or 
correct the challenged entry. Upon receipt of an official communication 
directly from the agency that contributed the original information, the 
FBI Identification Division makes any changes necessary in accordance 
with the information supplied by that agency. Licensees must provide at 
least 10

[[Page 534]]

days for an individual to initiate action to challenge the results of an 
FBI criminal history records check after the record being made available 
for his/her review. The licensee may make a final adverse determination 
based upon the criminal history record, if applicable, only upon receipt 
of the FBI's confirmation or correction of the record.
    (3) In addition to the right to obtain records from the FBI in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the right to initiate challenge 
procedures in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an individual 
participating in an NRC adjudication and seeking to obtain Safeguards 
Information for use in that adjudication may appeal a final adverse 
determination by the NRC Office of Administration to the presiding 
officer of the proceeding. The request may also seek to have the Chief 
Administrative Judge designate an officer other than the presiding 
officer of the proceeding to review the adverse determination.
    (f) Protection of information. (1) Each licensee who obtains a 
criminal history record on an individual under this section shall 
establish and maintain a system of files and procedures for protection 
of the record and the personal information from unauthorized disclosure.
    (2) The licensee may not disclose the record or personal information 
collected and maintained to persons other than the subject individual, 
his/her representative, or to those who have a need to have access to 
the information in performing assigned duties in the process of granting 
or denying unescorted access to the nuclear power facility or access to 
Safeguards Information. No individual authorized to have access to the 
information may re-disseminate the information to any other individual 
who does not have a need to know.
    (3) The personal information obtained on an individual from a 
criminal history record check may be transferred to another licensee:
    (i) Upon the individual's written request to the licensee holding 
the data to re-disseminate the information contained in his/her file; 
and
    (ii) The gaining licensee verifies information such as name, date of 
birth, social security number, sex, and other applicable physical 
characteristics for identification.
    (4) The licensee shall make criminal history records obtained under 
this section available for examination by an authorized representative 
of the NRC to determine compliance with the regulations and laws.
    (5) The licensee shall retain all fingerprint and criminal history 
records received from the FBI, or a copy if the individual's file has 
been transferred, on an individual (including data indicating no record) 
for 1 year after termination or denial of unescorted access to the 
nuclear power facility or access to Safeguards Information.

Sec. 73.60  Additional requirements for physical protection at 
nonpower reactors.

    Each nonpower reactor licensee who, pursuant to the requirements of 
part 70 of this chapter, possesses at any site or contiguous sites 
subject to control by the licensee uranium-235 (contained in uranium 
enriched to 20 percent or more in the U-235 isotope), uranium-233, or 
plutonium, alone or in any combination in a quantity of 5000 grams or 
more computed by the formula, grams=(grams contained U-235)+2.5 (grams 
U-233+grams plutonium), shall protect the special nuclear material from 
theft or diversion pursuant to the requirements of paragraphs 73.67 (a), 
(b), (c), and (d), in addition to this section, except that a licensee 
is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and 
(e) of this section to the extent that it possesses or uses special 
nuclear material that is not readily separable from other radioactive 
material and that has a total external radiation dose rate in excess of 
100 rems per hour at a distance of 3 feet from any accessible surface 
without intervening shielding.
    (a) Access requirements. (1) Special nuclear material shall be 
stored or processed only in a material access area. No activities other 
than those which require access to special nuclear material or equipment 
employed in the process, use, or storage of special nuclear material, 
shall be permitted within a material access area.
    (2) Material access areas shall be located only within a protected 
area to which access is controlled.

[[Page 536]]

    (3) Special nuclear material not in process shall be stored in a 
vault equipped with an intrusion alarm or in a vault-type room, and each 
such vault or vault-type room shall be controlled as a separate material 
access area.
    (4) Enriched uranium scrap in the form of small pieces, cuttings, 
chips, solutions or in other forms which result from a manufacturing 
process, contained in 30-gallon or larger containers, with a uranium-235 
content of less than 0.25 grams per liter, may be stored within a locked

other elements of the physical security system, be required to meet 
minimum criteria to ensure that they will effectively perform their 
assigned security-related job duties. In order to ensure that those 
individuals responsible for security are properly equipped and qualified 
to execute the job duties prescribed for

[[Page 549]]

them, the NRC has developed general criteria that specify security 
personnel qualification requirements.
    These general criteria establish requirements for the selection, 
training, equipping, testing, and qualification of individuals who will 
be responsible for protecting special nuclear materials, nuclear 
facilities, and nuclear shipments.
    When required to have security personnel that have been trained, 
equipped, and qualified to perform assigned security job duties in 
accordance with the criteria in this appendix, the licensee must 
establish, maintain, and follow a plan that shows how the criteria will 
be met. The plan must be submitted to the NRC for approval and must be 
implemented within 30 days after approval by the NRC unless otherwise 
specified by the NRC in writing.

    (1) To organize the response effort at the licensee level;
    (2) To provide predetermined, structured responses by licensees to 
safeguards contingencies;
    (3) To ensure the integration of the licensee response with the 
responses by other entities; and
    (4) To achieve a measurable performance in response capability.
    Licensee safeguards contingency planning should result in organizing 
the licensee's resources in such a way that the participants will be 
identified, their several responsibilities specified, and the responses 
coordinated. The responses should be timely.
    It is important to note that a licensee's safeguards contingency 
plan is intended to be complementary to any emergency plans developed 
under appendix E to part 50 of this chapter, Sec. 52.17 or Sec. 52.79, 
or to Sec. 70.22(i) of this chapter.

                          contents of the plan

    Each licensee safeguards contingency plan shall include five 
categories of information:
1. Background
2. Generic Planning Base
3. Licensee Planning Base
4. Responsibility Matrix
5. Procedures
    Although the implementing procedures (the fifth category of Plan 
information) are the culmination of the planning process, and therefore 
are an integral and important part of the safeguards contingency plan, 
they entail operating details subject to frequent changes. They need not 
be submitted to the Commission for approval, but will be inspected by 
NRC staff on a periodic basis. The licensee is responsible for ensuring 
that the implementing procedures reflect the information in the 
Responsibility Matrix, appropriately summarized and suitably presented 
for effective use by the responding entities.
    The following paragraphs describe the contents of the safeguards 
contingency plan.
    1. Background. Under the following topics, this category of 
information shall identify and define the perceived dangers and 
incidents with which the plan will deal and the general way it will 
handle these:
    a. Perceived Danger--A statement of the perceived danger to the 
security of special nuclear material, licensee personnel, and licensee 
property, including covert diversion of special nuclear material, 
radiological sabotage, and overt attacks. The statement of perceived 
danger should conform with that promulgated by the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. (The statement contained in 10 CFR 73.55(a) or subsequent 
Commission statements will suffice.)
    b. Purpose of the Plan--A discussion of the general aims and 
operational concepts underlying implementation of the plan.
    c. Scope of the Plan--A delineation of the types of incidents 
covered in the plan.
    d. Definitions--A list of terms and their definitions used in 
describing operational and technical aspects of the plan.
    2. Generic Planning Base. Under the following topics, this category 
of information shall define the criteria for initiation and termination 
of responses to safeguards contingencies together with the specific 
decisions, actions, and supporting information needed to bring about 
such responses:
    a. Identification of those events that will be used for signaling 
the beginning or aggravation of a safeguards contingency according to 
how they are perceived initially by licensee's personnel. Such events 
may include alarms or other indications signaling penetration of a 
protected area, vital area, or material access area; material control or 
material accounting indications of material missing or unaccounted for; 
or threat indications--either verbal, such as telephoned threats, or 
implied, such as escalating civil disturbances.
    b. Definition of the specific objective to be accomplished relative 
to each identified event. The objective may be to obtain a level of 
awareness about the nature and severity of the safeguards contingency in 
order to prepare for further responses; to establish a level of response 
preparedness; or to successfully nullify or reduce any adverse 
safeguards consequences arising from the contingency.
    3. Licensee Planning Base. This category of information shall 
include the factors affecting contingency planning that are specific for 
each facility or means of transportation. To the extent that the topics 
are treated in adequate detail in the licensee's approved physical 
security plan, they may be incorporated by cross reference to that plan. 
The following topics should be addressed:
    a. Licensee's Organizational Structure for Contingency Responses--A 
delineation of the organization's chain of command and delegation of 
authority as these apply to safeguards contingencies.
    b. Physical Layout--(i) Fixed Sites--A description of the physical 
structures and their location on the site, and a description of the site 
in relation to nearby town, roads, and other environmental features 
important to the effective coordination of response operations. 
Particular emphasis should be placed on main and alternate entry routes 
for law-enforcement assistance forces and the location of control points 
for marshalling and coordinating response activities.
    (ii) Transportation--A description of the vehicles, shipping routes, 
preplanned alternate routes, and related features.
    c. Safeguards Systems Hardware--A description of the physical 
security and accounting system hardware that influence how the licensee 
will respond to an event.

[[Page 562]]

Examples of systems to be discussed are communications, alarms, locks, 
seals, area access, armaments, and surveillance.
    d. Law Enforcement Assistance--A listing of available local law 
enforcement agencies and a description of their response capabilities 
and their criteria for response; and a discussion of working agreements 
or arrangements for communicating with these agencies.
    e. Policy Constraints and Assumptions--A discussion of State laws, 
local ordinances, and company policies and practices that govern 
licensee response to incidents. Examples that may be discussed include:
Use of deadly force;
Use of employee property;
Use of off-duty employees;
Site security jurisdictional boundaries.
    f. Administrative and Logistical Considerations--Descriptions of 
licensee practices that may have an influence on the response to 
safeguards contingency events. The considerations shall include a 
description of the procedures that will be used for ensuring that all 
equipment needed to effect a successful response to a safeguards 
contingency will be easily accessible, in good working order, and in 
sufficient supply to provide redundancy in case of equipment failure.
    4. Responsibility Matrix. This category of information consists of 
detailed identification of the organizational entities responsible for 
each decision and action associated with specific responses to 
safeguards contingencies. For each initiating event, a tabulation shall 
be made for each response entity depicting the assignment of 
responsibilities for all decisions and actions to be taken in response 
to the initiating event. (Not all entities will have assigned 
responsibilities for any given initiating event.) The tabulations in the 
Responsibility Matrix shall provide an overall picture of the response 
actions and their interrelationships. Safeguards responsibilities shall 
be assigned in a manner that precludes conflict in duties or 
responsibilities that would prevent the execution of the plan in any 
safeguards contingency.
    5. Procedures. In order to aid execution of the detailed plan as 
developed in the Responsibility Matrix, this category of information 
shall detail the actions to be taken and decisions to be made by each 
member or unit of the organization as planned in the Responsibility 
Matrix.

                            Audit and Review

    (1) For nuclear facilities subject to the requirements of Sec. 
73.46, the licensee shall provide for a review of the safeguards 
contingency plan at intervals not to exceed 12 months. For nuclear power 
reactor licensees subject to the requirements of Sec. 73.55, the 
licensee shall provide for a review of the safeguards contingency plan 
either:
    (i) At intervals not to exceed 12 months, or
    (ii) As necessary, based on an assessment by the licensee against 
performance indicators, and as soon as reasonably practicable after a 
change occurs in personnel, procedures, equipment, or facilities that 
potentially could adversely affect security, but no longer than 12 
months after the change. In any case, each element of the safeguards 
contingency plan must be reviewed at least every 24 months.
    (2) A licensee subject to the requirements of either Sec. 73.46 or 
Sec. 73.55 shall ensure that the review of the safeguards contingency 
plan is by individuals independent of both security program management 
and personnel who have direct responsibility for implementation of the 
security program. The review must include an audit of safeguards 
contingency procedures and practices, and an audit of commitments 
established for response by local law enforcement authorities.
    (3) The licensee shall document the results and the recommendations 
of the safeguards contingency plan review, management findings on 
whether the safeguards contingency plan is currently effective, and any 
actions taken as a result of recommendations from prior reviews in a 
report to the licensee's plant manager and to corporate management at 
least one level higher than that having responsibility for the day-to-
day plant operation. The report must be maintained in an auditable form, 
available for inspection for a period of 3 years.

          II. Nuclear Power Plant Safeguards Contingency Plans

                             A. Introduction

    The safeguards contingency plan is a documented plan that describes 
how licensee personnel implement their physical protection program to 
defend against threats to their facility, up to and including the design 
basis threat of radiological sabotage. The goals of licensee safeguards 
contingency plans are:
    (1) To organize the response effort at the licensee level;
    (2) To provide predetermined, structured response by licensees to 
safeguards contingencies;
    (3) To ensure the integration of the licensee response by other 
entities; and
    (4) To achieve a measurable performance in response capability.
    Licensee safeguards contingency planning should result in organizing 
the licensee's resources in such a way that the participants will be 
identified, their responsibilities specified, and the responses 
coordinated. The responses should be timely, and include personnel who 
are trained and qualified to respond in accordance with a documented 
training and qualification program.
    The evaluation, validation, and testing of this portion of the 
program shall be conducted in accordance with appendix B of this

[[Page 563]]

part, General Criteria for Security Personnel. The licensee's safeguards 
contingency plan is intended to maintain effectiveness during the 
implementation of emergency plans developed under appendix E to part 50 
of this chapter.

                         B. Contents of the Plan

    Each safeguards contingency plan shall include five (5) categories 
of information:
    (1) Background.
    (2) Generic planning base.
    (3) Licensee planning base.
    (4) Responsibility matrix.
    (5) Implementing procedures.
    Although the implementing procedures (the fifth category of plan 
information) are the culmination of the planning process, and are an 
integral and important part of the safeguards contingency plan, they 
entail operating details subject to frequent changes. They need not be 
submitted to the Commission for approval, but are subject to inspection 
by NRC staff on a periodic basis.
    1. Background. This category of information shall identify the 
perceived dangers and incidents that the plan will address and a general 
description of how the response is organized.
    a. Perceived Danger--Consistent with the design basis threat 
specified in Sec. 73.1(a)(1), licensees shall identify and describe the 
perceived dangers, threats, and incidents against which the safeguards 
contingency plan is designed to protect.
    b. Purpose of the Plan--Licensees shall describe the general goals, 
objectives and operational concepts underlying the implementation of the 
approved safeguards contingency plan.
    c. Scope of the Plan--A delineation of the types of incidents 
covered by the plan.
    (i) How the onsite response effort is organized and coordinated to 
effectively respond to a safeguards contingency event.
    (ii) How the onsite response for safeguards contingency events has 
been integrated in other site emergency response procedures.
    d. Definitions--A list of terms and their definitions used in 
describing operational and technical aspects of the approved safeguards 
contingency plan.
    2. Generic Planning Base. Licensees shall define the criteria for 
initiation and termination of responses to security events to include 
the specific decisions, actions, and supporting information needed to 
respond to each type of incident covered by the approved safeguards 
contingency plan. To achieve this result the generic planning base must:
    a. Identify those events that will be used for signaling the 
beginning or aggravation of a safeguards contingency event according to 
how they are perceived initially by licensee's personnel. Licensees 
shall ensure detection of unauthorized activities and shall respond to 
all alarms or other indications signaling a security event, such as 
penetration of a protected area, vital area, or unauthorized barrier 
penetration (vehicle or personnel); tampering, bomb threats, or other 
threat warnings--either verbal, such as telephoned threats, or implied, 
such as escalating civil disturbances.
    b. Define the specific objective to be accomplished relative to each 
identified safeguards contingency event. The objective may be to obtain 
a level of awareness about the nature and severity of the safeguards 
contingency to prepare for further responses; to establish a level of 
response preparedness; or to successfully nullify or reduce any adverse 
safeguards consequences arising from the contingency.
    c. Identify the data, criteria, procedures, mechanisms and 
logistical support necessary to achieve the objectives identified.
    3. Licensee Planning Base. This category of information shall 
include factors affecting safeguards contingency planning that are 
specific for each facility. To the extent that the topics are treated in 
adequate detail in the licensee's approved physical security plan, they 
may be incorporated by reference in the Safeguards Contingency Plan. The 
following topics must be addressed:
    a. Organizational Structure. The safeguards contingency plan must 
describe the organization's chain of command and delegation of authority 
during safeguards contingency events, to include a general description 
of how command and control functions will be coordinated and maintained.
    b. Physical Layout. The safeguards contingency plan must include a 
site map depicting the physical structures located on the site, 
including onsite independent spent fuel storage installations, and a 
description of the structures depicted on the map. Plans must also 
include a description and map of the site in relation to nearby towns, 
transportation routes (e.g., rail, water, and roads), pipelines, 
airports, hazardous material facilities, and pertinent environmental 
features that may have an effect upon coordination of response 
activities. Descriptions and maps must indicate main and alternate entry 
routes for law enforcement or other offsite response and support 
agencies and the location for marshaling and coordinating response 
activities.
    c. Safeguards Systems. The safeguards contingency plan must include 
a description of the physical security systems that support and 
influence how the licensee will respond to an event in accordance with 
the design basis threat described in Sec. 73.1(a). The licensee's 
description shall begin with onsite physical protection measures 
implemented at the outermost facility perimeter, and must move inward 
through those measures implemented to protect target set equipment.

Sec. Appendix E to Part 73--Levels of Physical Protection To Be Applied 
           in International Transport of Nuclear Material \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See appendix C to part 110 of this chapter from the physical 
description of the categories of nuclear material as set forth in Annex 
I to the Convention. For the purposes of this part, the following 
categories of nuclear material are synonymous:
    Category I is a formula quantity of strategic special nuclear 
material;
    Category II is special nuclear material of moderate strategic 
significance or irradiated fuel; and
    Category III is special nuclear material of low strategic 
significance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (Verbatim from Annex I to the Convention on the Physical Protection 
of Nuclear Material)
    (a) Levels of physical protection for nuclear material during 
storage incidental to international nuclear transport include:
    (1) For Category III materials, storage within an area to which 
access is controlled;
    (2) For Category II materials, storage within an area under constant 
surveillance by guards or electronic devices, surrounded by a physical 
barrier with a limited number of points of entry under appropriate 
control or any area with an equivalent level of physical protection;
    (3) For Category I material, storage within a protected area as 
defined for Category II, to which, in addition, access is restricted to 
persons whose trustworthiness has been determined, and which is under 
surveillance by guards who are in close communication with appropriate 
response forces. Specific measures taken in this context should have as 
their objective the detection and prevention of any assault, 
unauthorized access, or unauthorized removal of material.
    (b) Levels of physical protection for nuclear material during 
international transport include:
    (1) For Category II and III materials, transportation shall take 
place under special precautions including prior arrangements among 
sender, receiver, and carrier, and prior agreement between natural or 
legal persons subject to the jurisdiction and regulation of exporting 
and importing States, specifying time, place and procedures for 
transferring transport responsibility;
    (2) For Category I materials, transportation shall take place under 
special precautions identified for transportation of Category II and III 
materials, and in addition, under constant surveillance by escorts and 
under conditions which assure close communication with appropriate 
response forces;
    (3) For natural uranium other than in the form of ore or ore 
residue, transportation protection for quantities exceeding 500 
kilograms U shall include advance notification of shipment specifying 
mode of transport, expected time of arrival and [shall provide for] 
confirmation of receipt of shipment.

   Calculations Concerning Multiple Sources or Multiple Radionuclides

    The ``sum of fractions'' methodology for evaluating combinations of 
multiple sources or multiple radionuclides, is to be used in determining 
whether a facility or activity meets or exceeds the threshold limits and 
is thus subject to the physical and/or information security requirements 
of this part.
    I. If multiple sources and/or multiple radionuclides are present in 
a facility or activity, the sum of the fractions of the activity of each 
of the radionuclides must be determined to verify the facility or 
activity is less than the Category 1 or 2 limits of Table 1, as 
appropriate. Otherwise, if the calculated sum of the fractions ratio, 
using the following equation, is greater than or equal to 1.0, then the 
facility or activity meets or exceeds the threshold limits of Table 1 
and the applicable physical and/or information security provisions of 
this part apply.
    II. Use the equation below to calculate the sum of the fractions 
ratio by inserting the actual activity of the applicable radionuclides 
from Table 1 or of the individual sources (of the same radionuclides 
from Table 1) in the numerator of the equation and the corresponding 
threshold activity limit from Table 1 in the denominator of the 
equation. Sum of the fraction calculations must be performed in metric 
values (i.e., TBq) and the numerator and denominator values must be in 
the same units.
R<INF>1</INF> = activity for radionuclides or source number 1
R<INF>2</INF> = activity for radionuclides or source number 2
R<INF>N</INF> = activity for radionuclides or source number n
AR<INF>1</INF> = activity limit for radionuclides or source number 1
AR<INF>2</INF> = activity limit for radionuclides or source number 2
AR<INF>N</INF> = activity limit for radionuclides or source number n

    (a) This part has been established to contain the requirements for 
the control and accounting of special nuclear material at fixed sites 
and for documenting the transfer of special nuclear material. General 
reporting requirements as well as specific requirements for certain 
licensees possessing special nuclear material of low strategic 
significance, special nuclear material of moderate strategic 
significance, and formula quantities of strategic special nuclear 
material are included. Requirements for the control and accounting of 
source material at enrichment facilities are also included.
    (b) The general conditions and procedures for the submittal of a 
license application for the activities covered in this part are detailed 
in Sec. 70.22 of this chapter.

Sec. 74.4  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Abrupt loss means a loss occurring in the time interval between 
consecutive sequential performances of a material control test which is 
designed to detect anomalies potentially indicative of a loss of 
strategic special nuclear material from a specific unit of SSNM (i.e.,

[[Page 572]]

a quantity characterized by a unique measurement) introduced into a 
process.
    Accessible location means a process location at which SSNM could be 
acquired without leaving evidence of the acquisition, i.e., without 
tools or other equipment to obviously violate the integrity of the 
containment.
    Act means the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 919), including 
any amendments thereto.
    Active inventory means the sum of additions to inventory, beginning 
inventory, ending inventory, and removals from inventory, after all 
common terms have been excluded. Common terms are any material values 
which appear in the active inventory calculation more than once and come 
from the same measurement.
    Additions to material in process means: (1) Receipts that are 
opened, except for receipts opened only for sampling and subsequently 
maintained under tamper-safing; (2) opened sealed sources; and (3) 
material removed from process for nonconformance with chemical or 
physical specifications that is subsequently reprocessed, measured for 
contained SSNM, and reintroduced to process.
    Alarm Threshold means a predetermined quantity of SSNM calculated 
from the specified probability of detection for a given loss and the 
standard deviation associated with a material control test. An alarm 
threshold serves to trigger a response action.
    Batch means a portion of source material or special nuclear material 
handled as a unit for accounting purposes at a key measurement point and 
for which the composition and quantity are defined by a single set of 
measurements. The source material or special nuclear material may be in 
bulk form or contained in a number of separate items.
    Beginning inventory (BI) means the book inventory quantity at the 
beginning of an inventory period, and is the reconciled physical 
inventory entered into the books as an adjusted inventory at the 
completion of the prior inventory period.
    Bias means the deviation of the expected value of a random variable 
from the corresponding correct or assigned value.
    Calibration means the process of determining the numerical 
relationship between the observed output of a measurement system and the 
value, based upon reference standards, of the characteristic being 
measured.
    Category IA material means SSNM directly useable in the manufacture 
of a nuclear explosive device, except if:
    (1) The dimensions are large enough (at least two meters in one 
dimension, greater than one meter in each of two dimensions, or greater 
than 25cm in each of three dimensions) to preclude hiding the item on an 
individual;
    (2) The total weight of an encapsulated item of SSNM is such that it 
cannot be carried inconspicuously by one person (i.e., at least 50 
kilograms gross weight); or
    (3) The quantity of SSNM (less than 0.05 formula kilograms) in each 
container requires protracted diversions to accumulate five formula 
kilograms.
    Category IB material means all SSNM material other than Category IA.
    Commission means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its duly 
authorized representatives.
    Continuous process means a unit process in which feed material must 
be introduced in a systematic manner in order to maintain equilibrium 
conditions.
    Controlled access area means any temporarily or permanently 
established area which is clearly demarcated, access to which is 
controlled, and which affords isolation of the material or persons 
within it.
    DOE means the U.S. Department of Energy or its duly authorized 
representatives.
    Effective kilograms of special nuclear material means:
    (1) For plutonium and uranium-233 their weight in kilograms;
    (2) For uranium with an enrichment in the isotope U\235\ of 0.01 (1 
percent) and above, its element weight in kilograms multiplied by the 
square of its enrichment expressed as a decimal weight fraction; and
    (3) For uranium with an enrichment in the isotope U\235\ below 0.01 
(1 percent), its element weight in kilograms multiplied by 0.0001.

[[Page 573]]

    Element means uranium or plutonium.

process level with the additional qualification that difficult to 
measure components may be modeled.
    Process yield means the quantity of SSNM actually removed from a

<R05>
Sec. 74.45  Measurements and measurement control.

    (a) General. Licensees subject to Sec. 74.41 of this part shall 
establish and maintain the measurement and measurement control 
capabilities required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Measurements. The licensee shall:

[[Page 586]]

    (1) Establish, maintain, and use a program for the measurement of 
all SNM received, produced, transferred between internal control areas, 
on inventory, or shipped, discarded, or otherwise removed from 
inventory, except for:
    (i) Sealed sources that have been determined by other means to 
contain less than 10 grams of uranium-235, uranium-233, or plutonium 
each;
    (ii) Samples received, transferred between internal control areas, 
or on inventory that have been determined by other means to contain less 
than 10 grams of uranium-235, uranium-233, or plutonium each;
    (iii) Receipt of sealed sources, of any quantity, previously 
manufactured and shipped by the licensee and which are returned to the 
licensee, provided the unique identity and encapsulation integrity have 
not been compromised, and the booked receipt quantity equals the 
previously shipped quantity for the involved sealed sources; and
    (iv) Heterogeneous scrap that cannot be accurately measured in its 
as received form, provided this scrap is measured after dissolution 
within 18 months of receipt. The after dissolution measurement must 
include measurement of both the resulting solution and any undissolved 
residues, before any co-mingling with other scrap solutions or residues.
    (2) Maintain and follow a program for the development and use of 
written procedures that includes documented review and approval of these 
procedures, and any revisions thereof, before use, for:
    (i) Preparing or acquiring, maintaining, storing, and using 
reference standards;
    (ii) Calibrating measurement systems, performing bulk mass and 
volume measurements, conducting nondestructive assay measurements, 
obtaining samples, and performing laboratory analyses for element 
concentration and isotope abundance; and
    (iii) Recording, reviewing, and reporting measurements.
    (c) Measurement control. To maintain measurement quality and to 
estimate measurement uncertainty values, the licensee shall:
    (1) Assign responsibility for planning, developing, coordinating, 
and administering a measurement control program to an individual who has 
no direct responsibility for performing measurements or for SNM 
processing or handling, and who holds a position at an organizational 
level which permits independence of action and has adequate authority to 
obtain all the information required to monitor and evaluate measurement 
quality as required by this section.
    (2) Ensure that any contractor who performs MC&A measurements 
services conforms with applicable requirements in paragraphs (c)(5), 
(6), (7), (10) and (11) of this section. Conformance must include 
reporting by the contractor of sufficient measurement control data to 
allow the licensee to calculate bias corrections and measurement limits 
of error.
    (3) Ensure that potential sources of sampling error are identified 
and that samples are representative by performing process sampling tests 
using well characterized materials to establish or verify the 
applicability of utilized procedures for sampling SNM and for 
maintaining sample integrity during transport and storage. These 
sampling tests or sample integrity tests, as appropriate, shall be 
conducted whenever:
    (i) A new sampling procedure or technique is used, or new sampling 
equipment is installed;
    (ii) A sampling procedure, technique, or sampling equipment is 
modified to the extent that a systematic sampling error could be 
introduced; and
    (iii) Sample containers, sample transport methods, or sample storage 
conditions are changed or modified to the extent that a systematic 
sampling error could be introduced.
    (4) Establish and maintain a measurement control program so that for 
each inventory period the SEID is less than 0.125 percent of the active 
inventory, and assure that any MC&A measurements performed under 
contract are controlled so that the licensee can satisfy this 
requirement.
    (5) Generate current data on the performance of each measurement 
system used during each material balance period for the establishment of 
measured

[[Page 587]]

values and estimated measurement uncertainties, including estimates of 
bias, variance components for calibration, sampling, and repeat 
measurements. The program data must reflect the current process and 
measurement conditions existing at the time the control measurements are 
made.
    (6) Use standards on an ongoing basis for the calibration and 
control of all measurement systems used for SNM accountability. 
Calibrations shall be repeated whenever any significant change occurs in 
a measurement system or when program data indicate a need for 
recalibration. Calibrations and control standard measurements shall be 
based on standards whose assigned values are traceable to certified 
reference standards or certified standard reference materials. 
Additionally, control standards shall be representative of the process 
material or items being measured by the measurement system in question.
    (7) Conduct control measurements to provide current data for the 
determination of random error behavior. On a predetermined schedule, the 
program shall include, as appropriate:
    (i) Replicate analyses of individual samples;
    (ii) Analysis of replicate process samples;
    (iii) Replicate volume measurements of bulk process batches;
    (iv) Replicate weight measurements of process items and bulk 
batches, or alternatively, the use of data generated from the replicate 
weighings of control standard weights as derived from the control 
standard program; and
    (v) Replicate NDA measurements of individual process containers 
(items), or alternatively, the use of data generated from the replicate 
measurements of NDA control standards as derived from the control 
standard program.
    (8) Use all measurements and measurement controls generated during 
the current material balance period for the estimation of the SEID.
    (9) Evaluate with appropriate statistical methods all measurement 
system data generated in paragraph (c)(5) of this section to determine 
significant contributors to the measurement uncertainties associated 
with inventory differences and shipper-receiver differences, so that if 
SEID exceeds the limits established in paragraph (c)(4) of this section,

Sec. 74.51  Nuclear material control and accounting for strategic
special nuclear material.

    (a) General performance objectives. Each licensee who is authorized 
to possess five or more formula kilograms of strategic special nuclear 
material (SSNM) and to use such material at any site, other than a 
nuclear reactor licensed pursuant to part 50 of this chapter, an 
irradiated fuel reprocessing plant, an operation involved with waste 
disposal, or an independent spent fuel storage facility licensed 
pursuant to part 72 of this chapter shall establish, implement, and 
maintain a Commission-approved material control and accounting (MC&A) 
system that will achieve the following objectives:
    (1) Prompt investigation of anomalies potentially indicative of SSNM 
losses;

[[Page 588]]

    (2) Timely detection of the possible abrupt loss of five or more 
formula kilograms of SSNM from an individual unit process;
    (3) Rapid determination of whether an actual loss of five or more 
formula kilograms occurred;
    (4) Ongoing confirmation of the presence of SSNM in assigned 
locations; and
    (5) Timely generation of information to aid in the recovery of SSNM 
in the event of an actual loss.
    (b) System capabilities. To achieve the general performance 
objectives specified in Sec. 74.51(a), the MC&A system must provide the 
capabilities described in Sec. Sec. 74.53, 74.55, 74.57 and 74.59 and 
must incorporate checks and balances that are sufficient to detect 
falsification of data and reports that could conceal diversion by:
    (1) An individual, including an employee in any position; or
    (2) Collusion between an individual with MC&A responsibilities and 
another individual who has responsibility or control within both the 
physical protection and the MC&A systems.
    (c) Implementation dates. Each applicant for a license, and each 
licensee that, upon application for modification of a license, would 
become newly subject to paragraph (a) of this section, shall submit a 
fundamental nuclear material control (FNMC) plan describing how the MC&A 
system shall satisfy the requirement of paragraph (b) of this section. 
The FNMC plan shall be implemented when a license is issued or modified 
to authorize the activities being addressed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, or by the date specified in a license condition.
    (d) Inventories. Notwithstanding Sec. 74.59(f)(1), licensees shall 
perform at least three bimonthly physical inventories after 
implementation of the NRC approved FNMC Plan and shall continue to 
perform bimonthly inventories until performance acceptable to the NRC 
has been demonstrated and the Commission has issued formal approval to 
perform semiannual inventories. Licensees who have prior experience with 
process monitoring and/or can demonstrate acceptable performance against 
all Plan commitments may request authorization to perform semiannual 
inventories at an earlier date.

detecting an abrupt loss of five formula kilograms within three working 
days of a loss of Category IA material from any accessible process 
location and within seven calendar days of a loss of Category IB 
material from any accessible process location;
    (2) A quality control test whereby process differences greater than 
three times the estimated standard deviation of the process difference 
estimator and 25 grams of SSNM are investigated; and
    (3) A trend analysis for monitoring and evaluating sequences of 
material control test results from each unit process to determine if 
they indicate a pattern of losses or gains that are of safeguards 
significance.

[[Page 589]]

    (c) For research and development operations exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the licensee shall:
    (1) Perform material balance tests on a lot or a batch basis, as 
appropriate, or monthly, whichever is sooner, and investigate any 
difference greater than 200 grams of plutonium or U-233 or 300 grams of 
U-235 that exceeds three times the estimated standard error of the 
inventory difference estimator;
    (2) Evaluate material balance results generated during an inventory 
period for indications of measurement biases or unidentified loss 
streams and investigate, determine the cause(s) of, and institute 
corrective action for cumulative inventory differences generated during 
an inventory period that exceed three formula kilograms of SSNM.


<R05>
Sec. 74.55  Item monitoring.

    (a) Licensees subject to Sec. 74.51 shall provide the detection 
capability described in paragraph (b) of this section for laboratory 
samples containing less than 0.05 formula kilograms of SSNM and any 
uniquely identified items of SSNM that have been quantitatively 
measured, the validity of that measurement independently confirmed, and 
that additionally have been either:
    (1) Tamper-safed or placed in a vault or controlled access area that 
provides protection at least equivalent to tamper-safing; or
    (2) Sealed such that removal of SSNM would be readily and 
permanently apparent (e.g., encapsulated).
    (b) The licensee shall verify on a statistical sampling basis, the 
presence and integrity of SSNM items. The statistical sampling plan must 
have at least 99 percent power of detecting item losses that total five 
formula kilograms or more, plant-wide, within:
    (1) Thirty calendar days for Category IA items and 60 calendar days 
for Category IB items contained in a vault or in a permanently 
controlled access area isolated from the rest of the material access 
area (MAA);
    (2) Three working days for Category IA items and seven calendar days 
for Category BI items located elsewhere in the MAA, except for reactor 
components measuring at least one meter in length and weighing in excess 
of 30 kilograms for which the time interval shall be 30 calendar days;
    (3) Sixty calendar days for items in a permanently controlled access 
area outside of an MAA; or
    (4) Sixty calendar days for samples in a vault or permanently 
controlled access area and 30 calendar days for samples elsewhere in the 
MAA for samples each containing less than 0.05 formula kilograms of 
SSNM.
    (c) Items containing scrap in the form of small pieces, cuttings, 
chips, solutions, or in other forms that result from a manufacturing 
process, held in containers of 30 gallon or larger, with an SSNM 
concentration of less than 0.25 grams per liter are exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 74.57  Alarm resolution.

    (a) Licensees subject to Sec. 74.51 shall provide the MC&A alarm 
resolution capabilities described in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section.
    (b) Licensees shall resolve the nature and cause of any MC&A alarm 
within approved time periods.
    (c) Each licensee shall notify the NRC Operations Center by 
telephone of any MC&A alarm that remains unresolved beyond the time 
period specified for its resolution in the licensee's fundamental 
nuclear material control plan. Notification must occur within 24 hours 
except when a holiday or weekend intervenes in which case the 
notification must occur on the next scheduled workday. The licensee may 
consider an alarm to be resolved if:
    (1) Clerical or computational error is found that clearly was the 
cause for the alarm; or
    (2) An assignable cause for the alarm is identified or it is 
substantiated that no material loss has occurred.
    (d) If a material loss has occurred, the licensee shall determine 
the amount of SSNM lost and take corrective action to:
    (1) Return out-of-place SSNM, if possible, to its appropriate place;
    (2) Update and correct associated records; and
    (3) Modify the MC&A system, if appropriate, to prevent similar 
future occurrences.

[[Page 590]]

    (e) The licensee shall provide an ability to rapidly assess the 
validity of alleged thefts.
    (f) If an abrupt loss detection estimate exceeds five formula 
kilograms of SSNM:
    (1) Material processing operations related to the alarm must be 
suspended until completion of planned alarm resolution activities, 
unless the suspension of operations will adversely affect the ability to 
resolve the alarm. Operation of continuous processes may continue for 24 
hours from the time of the occurrence of the alarm during which time 
checks shall be made for mistakes in records or calculations that could 
have caused the alarm.
    (2) Within 24 hours, the licensee shall notify the NRC Operations 
Center by telephone that an MC&A alarm resolution procedure has been 
initiated.

<R05>
Sec. 74.59  Quality assurance and accounting requirements.

    (a) Licensees subject to Sec. 74.51 shall provide the quality 
assurance and accounting capabilities described in paragraphs (b) 
through (h) of this section.
    (b) Management structure. The licensee shall:
    (1) Establish and maintain a management structure that includes 
clear overall responsibility for planning, coordinating, and 
administering material control and accounting functions, independence of 
material control and accounting functions from production 
responsibilities, and separation of functions such that the activities 
of one individual or organizational unit serve as controls over and 
checks of the activities of others; and
    (2) Provide for the adequate review, approval, and use of those 
material control and accounting procedures that are identified in the 
approved FNMC plan as being critical to the effectiveness of the 
described system.
    (c) Personnel qualification and training. The licensee shall assure 
that personnel who work in key positions where mistakes could degrade 
the effectiveness of the material control and accounting system are 
trained to maintain a high level of safeguards awareness and are 
qualified to perform their duties and/or responsibilities.
    (d) Measurements. The licensee shall establish and maintain a system 
of measurements sufficient to:
    (1) Substantiate the plutonium element and uranium element and 
isotope content of all SSNM received, produced, transferred between 
areas of custodial responsibility, on inventory, or shipped, discarded, 
or otherwise removed from inventory;
    (2) Enable the estimation of the standard deviation associated with 
each measured quantity; and
    (3) Provide the data necessary for performance of the material 
control tests required by Sec. 74.53(b).
    (e) Measurement control. The licensee shall assure that the quality 
of SSNM measurement systems and material processing practices is 
continually controlled to a level of effectiveness sufficient to satisfy 
the capabilities required for detection, response, and accounting. To 
achieve this objective the licensee shall:
    (1) Perform engineering analyses and evaluations of the design, 
installation, preoperational tests, calibration, and operation of all 
measurement systems to be used for MC&A purposes;
    (2) Perform process and engineering tests using well characterized 
materials to establish or to verify the applicability of existing 
procedures for mixing and sampling SSNM and maintaining sample integrity 
during transport and storage. Tests must be repeated at least every 
three years, at any time there is a process modification that alters the 
physical or chemical composition of the SSNM, or whenever there is a 
change in the sampling technique or equipment; and
    (3) Generate current data on the performance of measurement 
processes, including, as appropriate, values for bias corrections, 
uncertainties on calibration factors, and random error standard 
deviations. The program must include:
    (i) The onging use of standards for calibration and control of all 
applicable measurement systems. Calibrations must be repeated whenever 
any change in a measurement system occurs which

[[Page 591]]

has the potential to affect a measurement result or when program data, 
generated by tests performed at a pre-determined frequency, indicate a 
need for recalibration. Calibrations and tests must be based on 
standards with traceability to national standards or nationally accepted 
measurement systems; and
    (ii) A system of control measurements to provide current data for 
the estimation of the standard deviations that are significant 
contributors to the measurement uncertainties associated with shipper/
receiver differences, inventory differences, and process differences.
    (4) Utilize the data generated during the current material balance 
period for the estimation of the standard error of the inventory 
difference (SEID) and the standard error of the process differences. 
Calibration and measurement error data collected and used during 
immediately preceeding material balance periods may be combined with 
current data provided that the measurement systems are in statistical 
control and the combined data are utilized in characterizing the 
unknowns.
    (5) Evaluate all program data and information to assure that 
measurement performance is so controlled that the SEID estimator is less 
than 0.1 percent of active inventory.
    (6) Apply bias corrections by an appropriate procedure whereby:
    (i) Bias corrections are applied to individual items if for any 
measurement system the relative bias estimate exceeds twice the standard 
deviation of its estimator, the absolute bias estimate exceeds 50 grams 
of SSNM when applied across all affected items, and the absolute bias 
estimate on an individual item basis exceeds the rounding error of 
affected items; and
    (ii) All biases (regardless of significance) that are not applied as 
corrections to individual items are applied as a correction to the 
inventory difference.
    (7) Investigate and take corrective action, as appropriate, to 
identify and reduce associated measurement biases when, for like 
material types (i.e., measured by the same measurement system), the net 
cumulative shipper/receiver differences accumulated over a six-month 
period exceed the larger of one formula kilogram or 0.1 percent of the 
total amount received.
    (8) Establish and maintain a statistical control system designed to 
monitor the quality of each type of program measurement. Control limits 
must be established to be equivalent to levels of significance of 0.05 
and 0.001. Control data exceeding the 0.05 limits must be investigated 
and corrective action taken in a timely manner. Whenever a single data 
point exceeds the 0.001 control limit, the measurement system in 
question must not be used for material control and accounting purposes 
until it has been brought into control at the 0.05 level.
    (f) Physical inventory. The licensee shall:
    (1) Except as required by part 75 of this Chapter, perform a 
physical inventory at least every six calendar months and within 45 days 
after the start of the ending inventory:
    (i) Calculate the inventory difference (ID); estimate the standard 
error of the inventory difference (SEID); and investigate and report any 
SEID estimate of 0.1 percent or more of active inventory, and any ID 
that exceeds both three times SEID and 200 grams of plutonium or 
uranium-233, or 300 grams of uranium-235 contained in high enriched 
uranium.
    (ii) If required to perform an investigation pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(1)(i) of this section, evaluate the significance of the inventory 
difference relative to expected performance as determined from an 
analysis of an appropriate sequence of historical inventory differences;
    (iii) Investigate and report, by an appropriate method listed in 
Sec. 74.6, to the Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and 
Safeguards, any difference that exceeds three times the standard 
deviation determined from the sequential analysis;
    (iv) Perform a reinventory if directed to do so by the Commission; 
and
    (v) Reconcile and adjust the plant and subsidiary book records to 
the results of the physical inventory.
    (2) Implement policies, practices, and procedures designed to ensure 
the quality of physical inventories. These must include:

[[Page 592]]

    (i) Development of procedures for tamper-safing of containers or 
vaults containing SSNM not in process that include adequate controls to 
assure the validity of assigned SSNM values;
    (ii) Maintenance of records of the quantities of SSNM added to and 
removed from process;
    (iii) Requirements for signed documentation of all SSNM transfers 
between areas with different custodial responsibility that reflect all 
quantities of SSNM transferred;
    (iv) Means for control of and accounting for internal transfer 
documents;
    (v) Cutoff procedures for transfers and processing so that all 
quantities of SSNM are inventoried and none are inventoried more than 
once;
    (vi) Cutoff procedures for records and reports so that all transfers 
for the inventory and material balance interval and no others are 
included in the records;
    (vii) Inventory procedures for sealed sources and containers or 
vaults containing SSNM that assure reliable identification and 
quantification of contained SSNM;
    (viii) Inventory procedures for in-process SSNM that provide for 
measurement of quantities not previously measured for element and 
isotope, as appropriate, and remeasurement of material previously 
measured but whose validity has not been assured by tamper-safing or 
equivalent protection; and
    (ix) Written instructions for conducting physical inventories that 
detail assignments, responsibilities, and preparation for and 
performance of an inventory.
    (g) Accounting. The licensee shall establish auditable records 
sufficient to demonstrate that the requirements of Sec. Sec. 74.53, 
74.55, 74.57, and 74.59 have been met and retain those records for at 
least three years unless a longer retention period is required by part 
75 of this Chapter.
    (h) Internal control. The licensee shall:
    (1) Establish procedures for shipping and receiving SSNM that 
provide for:
    (i) Accurate identification and measurement of the quantities 
shipped and received;
    (ii) Review and evaluation of shipper/receiver differences on an 
individual container or lot basis, as appropriate, on a shipment basis, 
and on a batch basis when required by part 75 of this Chapter;
    (iii) Investigation and corrective action when shipper/receiver 
differences exceed twice the estimated standard deviation of the 
difference estimator and the larger of 0.5 percent of the amount of SSNM 
in the container, lot, or shipment, as appropriate, or 50 grams of SSNM; 
and
    (iv) Documentation of shipper/receiver difference evaluations, 
investigations, and corrective actions.
    (2) Establish a scrap control program that assures that:
    (i) Internally generated scrap and scrap from other licensees or 
contractors is segregated until accountability is established; and
    (ii) Any scrap measured with a standard deviation greater than five 
percent of the measured amount is recovered so that the results are 
segregated by inventory period and recovered within six months of the 
end of the inventory period in which the scrap was generated except 
where it can be demonstrated that the scrap measurement uncertainty will 
not cause noncompliance with Sec. 74.59(e)(5).
    (3) Incorporate checks and balances in the MC&A system sufficient to 
control the rate of human errors in material control and accounting 
information.
    (4) Perform independent assessments at least every 12 months that 
assess the performance of the MC&A system, review its effectiveness, and 
document management's action on prior assessment recommendations. 
Assessments must include an evaluation of the measurement control 
program of any outside contractor laboratory performing MC&A 
measurements for a licensee, unless the contractor is also subject to 
the requirements of Sec. 74.59(e).
    (5) Assign custodial responsibility in a manner that ensures that 
such responsibility can be effectively executed for all SSNM possessed 
under license.

Sec. 75.8  IAEA inspections.

    (a) As provided in the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol, 
inspections may be ad hoc, routine, special, or a complementary access 
(or a combination of the foregoing). The objectives of the IAEA 
inspectors in the performance of inspections are as follows:
    (1) Ad hoc inspections to verify information contained in the 
licensee's, applicant's, or certificate holder's facility information or 
initial inventory report, or to identify and verify changes in the 
situation which have occurred after the initial inventory reporting date 
at any location where the initial inventory report or any inspections 
carried out indicate that nuclear material subject to safeguards under 
the Safeguards Agreement may be present;
    (2) Ad hoc inspections to identify and, if possible, verify the 
quantity and composition of the nuclear material referred to in 
notifications specified

[[Page 599]]

under Sec. 75.43(b) (pertaining to exports) or Sec. 75.43(c) 
(pertaining to imports) at any place where nuclear material may be 
located;
    (3) Routine inspections are conducted as specified by the facility 
attachments referred to in Sec. 75.15 to verify nuclear material and 
as-built facility design at the strategic points and the records 
maintained under this part;
    (4) Special inspections may be conducted at any of the places 
specified above and any additional places where the Commission (in 
coordination with other Federal agencies), in response to an IAEA 
request, finds access to be necessary;
    (5) Complementary access may be conducted at a location, using 
measures permitted under the Additional Protocol and as specified by 
managed access procedures, for the IAEA inspectors to verify the 
completeness and accuracy of the information provided on DOC/NRC Form 
AP-1 or AP-A and associated forms; and
    (6) Complementary access must be provided at any additional 
locations where the Commission (in coordination with other Federal 
agencies), in response to an IAEA request, finds access to be necessary.
    (b) The NRC will notify the applicant, licensee, or certificate 
holder of each such inspection or complementary access in writing as 
soon as possible after receiving the IAEA's notice from the U.S. 
Department of State. The applicant, licensee, or certificate holder 
should consult with the Commission immediately if the inspection or 
complementary access would unduly interfere with its activities or if 
its key personnel cannot be available.
    (c) Each applicant, licensee, or certificate holder subject to the 
provisions of this part shall recognize as a duly authorized 
representative of the IAEA any person bearing IAEA credentials for whom 
the NRC has provided written or electronic authorization that the IAEA 
representative is permitted to conduct inspection activities on 
specified dates. If the IAEA representative's credentials have not been 
confirmed by the NRC, the applicant, licensee, or certificate holder 
shall not admit the person until the NRC has confirmed the person's 
credentials. The applicant, licensee, or certificate holder shall notify 
the Commission promptly, by telephone, whenever an IAEA representative 
arrives at a facility or location without advance notification. The 
applicant, licensee, or certificate holder shall also contact the 
Commission, by telephone, within one hour with respect to the 
credentials of any person who claims to be an IAEA representative and 
shall accept written or electronic confirmation of the credentials from 
the NRC. Confirmation may be requested through the NRC Operations Center 
(commercial telephone number 301-816-5100).
    (d) Each applicant, licensee, or certificate holder subject to the 
provisions of this part shall allow the IAEA opportunity to conduct an 
NRC-approved inspection or complementary access of the facility or 
location to verify the information submitted under Sec. Sec. 75.10, 
75.11, and 75.31 through 75.43. The NRC will assign an employee to 
accompany IAEA representative(s) at all times during the inspection or 
complementary access. The applicant, licensee, or certificate holder may 
accompany IAEA representatives who inspect or access the facility or 
location. The IAEA representatives should not be delayed or otherwise 
impeded in the exercise of their duties.
    (e) Each applicant, licensee, or certificate holder shall permit the 
IAEA, in conducting an ad hoc, routine, or special inspection at a 
facility, to:
    (1) Examine records kept under Sec. 75.21;
    (2) Observe that the measurements of nuclear material at key 
measurement points for material balance accounting are representative;
    (3) Verify the function and calibration of instruments and other 
measurement control equipment;
    (4) Observe that samples at key measurement points for material 
balance accounting are taken in accordance with procedures that produce 
representative samples, observe the treatment and analysis of the 
samples, and obtain duplicates of these samples;
    (5) Arrange to use the IAEA's own equipment for independent 
measurement and surveillance; and
    (6) Perform other measures requested by the IAEA and approved by the 
NRC.

3 years after each change is made.
    (c) A request made under Sec. 2.390(b) of this chapter will not be 
treated as a request under this section unless the application makes 
specific reference to this section, nor shall a determination to 
withhold information from public disclosure necessarily require a 
determination that this information not be transmitted physically to the 
IAEA.
    (d) Where consistent with the Safeguards Agreement, the Commission 
may at its own initiative, or at the request of a licensee, determine 
that any information submitted under Sec. Sec. 75.10, and 75.11 shall 
not be physically transmitted to, or made available for examination by, 
the IAEA.

    (c) Imports. (1) Notification shall be given (to the fullest extent 
possible on the basis of available information) with respect to nuclear 
material which immediately prior to export is subject to safeguards, 
under an agreement with the IAEA, in the country from which the 
material, directly or indirectly, is being exported. Such notification 
is only required, however, if the quantities of nuclear material are as 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Notification shall be given with respect to any proposed import 
of nuclear material described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in an 
amount exceeding one effective kilogram. If the licensee anticipates 
that it will receive two or more shipments of such nuclear material, 
within any 90-day period from points of origin in the same country, 
notification shall be given with respect to each shipment if the 
aggregate quantity of such nuclear material to be received exceeds one 
effective kilogram.
    (d) Domestic transfers. Notification must be given regarding any 
shipments of nuclear material (other than small quantities in the form 
of samples containing less than 0.01 effective kilogram per sample) to a 
non-eligible destination. As used in this paragraph, a non-eligible 
destination means any destination in the United States other than a 
facility on the Eligible Facilities List.

Sec. 75.44  Timing of advance notification.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
notification to the Commission, when required by Sec. 75.43, must be 
given:

[[Page 608]]

    (1) In the case of exports and domestic transfers, at least 20 days 
in advance of the preparation of the nuclear material for shipment from 
the facility.
    (2) In the case of imports, at least 12 days in advance of the 
unpacking of nuclear material at the facility.
    (b) For a particular receipt or shipment of nuclear material, the 
Commission will approve a shorter notice period than that specified by 
paragraph (a) of this section, for good cause, if it determines that 
observing the specified notification period would result in delay in 
shipment or unpackaging.

Sec. 76.7  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by the Corporation, a contractor, or a 
subcontractor of the Corporation against an employee for engaging in 
certain protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes 
discharge and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, 
conditions, or privileges of employment. The protected activities are 
established in Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as 
amended, and in general are related to the administration or enforcement 
of a requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy 
Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the above statutes or possible 
violations of requirements imposed under either of the above statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the above statutes or under these requirements if the employee has 
identified the alleged illegality to the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the above statutes; and
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or attempting to assist or 
participate in, the protected activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs by 
filing a complaint alleging the violation with the Department of Labor, 
Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division. The 
Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back pay, and compensatory 
damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraphs (a), (e), or (f) of this section by 
the Corporation, or a contractor or subcontractor of the Corporation may 
be grounds for:
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the certificate.
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the Corporation or a contractor 
or subcontractor of the Corporation.
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer or others which adversely affect an 
employee may be predicated upon nondiscrimination grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.
    (e)(1) The Corporation shall prominently post the revision of NRC 
Form 3, ``Notice to Employees,'' referenced in 10 CFR 19.11(c). This 
form must be posted at locations sufficient to permit employees 
protected by this section to observe a copy on the way to or from their 
place of work. Premises must be posted during the term of the 
certificate and for 30 days following certificate termination.
    (2) The Corporation shall notify its contractors of the prohibition 
against discrimination for engaging in protected activities.
    (3) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the NRC 
Region III Office listed in appendix D to part 20 of this chapter, by 
calling (301) 415-7232, via e-mail to FORMS.Resource@nrc.gov,

[[Page 615]]

or by accessing the NRC Website at http://www.nrc.gov and selecting 
forms from the index found on the home page.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to Section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain 
any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an 
employee from participating in protected activity as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section including, but not limited to, 
providing information to the NRC or to his or her employer on potential 
violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

Sec. 76.70  Post issuance.

    (a) Amendment of certificate terms and conditions. The terms and 
conditions of a certificate of compliance or an approved compliance plan 
are subject to modification by reason of amendments to the Act, or by 
reason of rules, regulations, or orders issued in accordance with the 
Act.
    (b) Revocation, suspension, or amendments for cause. A certificate 
of compliance or a compliance plan may be revoked, suspended, or 
amended, in whole or in part for:
    (1) Any material false statement in the application or statement of 
fact required by the Commission in connection with the application;
    (2) Conditions revealed by the application, or any report, record, 
inspection, or other means which would warrant the Commission to refuse 
to grant a certificate or approve a compliance plan on an original 
application; and
    (3) Violation of, or failure to observe any of, the applicable terms 
and conditions of the Act, or the certificate of compliance, the 
compliance plan, or any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission.
    (c) Procedures governing amendment, revocation, suspension, or 
imposing requirements by order. (1) Except in cases of willfulness or 
those in which the public health interest, common defense and security, 
or safety requires otherwise, no certificate of compliance or compliance 
plan may be amended, suspended, or revoked unless before the institution 
of proceedings therefore, facts or conduct which may warrant the action 
must have been called to the attention of the Corporation in writing and 
the Corporation shall have been accorded an opportunity to demonstrate 
or achieve compliance with the lawful requirements related to such 
action.
    (2) The Commission may institute a proceeding to modify, suspend, or 
revoke a certificate or take such other action as may be proper by 
serving on the Corporation or other person subject to the jurisdiction 
of the Commission an order that will:
    (i) Allege the violations with which the Corporation or other person 
subject to the Commission's jurisdiction is charged, or the potentially 
hazardous conditions or other facts deemed to be sufficient ground for 
the proposed action, and specify the action proposed;
    (ii) Provide that the Corporation or other person who is charged 
must, and other interested persons may, submit a written response to the 
order within a reasonable period after publication of the order as may 
be specified in the order;
    (iii) Specify the issues for resolution should the order be 
contested;
    (iv) State the effective date of the order; if the Commission finds 
the public health, common defense and security, or safety, so require or 
that the violation or conduct causing the violation is willful, the 
order may provide that the proposed action be immediately effective 
pending further order and include a statement of reasons for making the 
proposed action immediately effective;

[[Page 625]]

    (v) Provide that the Commission may make a final decision after 
consideration of the written submissions or may in its discretion adopt 
by order, upon the Commission's own initiative or at the request of the 
Corporation or an interested person, further procedures for a hearing of 
the issues before making a final enforcement decision. These procedures 
may include requirements for further participation in the proceeding, 
such as the requirements for intervention under Part 2, subparts C, G or 
L of this chapter. Submission of written comments by interested persons 
do not constitute entitlement to further participation in the 
proceeding. Further procedures will not normally be provided for at the 
request of an interested person unless the person is adversely affected 
by the order.
    (3) The Corporation or other person to whom the Commission has 
issued an immediately effective order may, in addition to submitting a 
written response, move the Commission to set aside the immediate 
effectiveness of the order on the ground that the order, including the 
need for immediate effectiveness, is not based on adequate evidence but 
on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error. The motion must 
state with particularity the reasons why the order is not based on 
adequate evidence and must be accompanied by affidavits or other 
evidence relied on. The NRC staff shall respond within 5 days of the 
receipt of the motion.
    (d) Notice of violation. (1) In response to an alleged violation of 
any provision of the Act or NRC regulations or the conditions of a 
certificate, compliance plan, or an order issued by the Commission, the 
Commission may serve on the Corporation or other person subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Commission a written notice of violation. A separate 
notice may be omitted if an order or demand for information pursuant to 
this section is issued that otherwise identifies the apparent violation. 
The notice of violation will concisely state the alleged violation and 
will require the Corporation or other person subject to it, within 
twenty (20) days of the date of the notice or other specified time, to 
submit a written explanation or statement in reply including:
    (i) Corrective steps which have been taken by the Corporation or 
other person and the results achieved;
    (ii) Corrective steps which will be taken; and
    (iii) The date when full compliance will be achieved.
    (2) The notice may require the Corporation or other person subject 
to the jurisdiction of the Commission to admit or deny the violation and 
to state the reasons for the violation, if admitted. It may provide 
that, if an adequate reply is not received within the time specified in 
the notice, the Commission may issue an order or a demand for 
information as to why the certificate should not be modified, suspended, 
or revoked or why such other action as may be proper should not be 
taken.
    (e) Additional information. At any time after the granting of a 
certificate of compliance or approval of a compliance plan, the 
Commission may require further statements from the Corporation, signed 
under oath or affirmation, in order to enable the Commission to 
determine whether the certificate or approved compliance plan should be 
modified or revoked.

Sec. 76.74  Computation and extension of time.

    (a) In computing any period of time, the day of the act, event or 
default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not 
included. The last day of the period so computed is included unless it 
is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday at the place where the action or

or allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the time fixed or 
the period of time prescribed may for good cause be extended or 
shortened by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 76.76  Backfitting.

    (a)(1) Backfitting is defined as the modification of, or addition 
to, systems, structures, or components of a plant; or to the procedures 
or organization required to operate a plant; any of which may result 
from a new or amended provision in the Commission rules or the 
imposition of a regulatory staff position interpreting the Commission 
rules that is either new or different from a previous NRC staff 
position.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the 
Commission shall require a systematic and documented analysis pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section for backfits which it seeks to impose.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the 
Commission shall require the backfitting of a plant only when it 
determines, based on the analysis described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, that there is a substantial increase in the overall protection 
of the public health and safety or the common defense and security to be 
derived from the backfit and that the direct and indirect costs of 
implementation for that plant are justified in view of this increased 
protection.
    (4) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section 
are inapplicable and, therefore, backfit analysis is not required and 
the standards in paragraph (a)(3) of this section do not apply where the 
Commission or staff, as appropriate, finds and declares, with 
appropriately documented evaluation for its finding, any of the 
following:
    (i) That a modification is necessary to bring a plant into 
compliance with a certificate or the rules or orders of the Commission, 
or into conformance with written commitments by the Corporation; or
    (ii) That regulatory action is necessary to ensure that the plant 
provides adequate protection to the health and safety of the public and 
is in accord with the common defense and security; or
    (iii) That the regulatory action involves defining or redefining 
what level of protection to the public health and safety or common 
defense and security should be regarded as adequate.
    (5) The Commission shall always require the backfitting of a plant 
if it determines that the regulatory action is necessary to ensure that 
the plant provides adequate protection to the health and safety of the 
public and is in accord with the common defense and security.
    (6) The documented evaluation required by paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section must include a statement of the

[[Page 627]]

objectives of and reasons for the modification and the basis for 
invoking the exception. If immediate effective regulatory action is 
required, then the documented evaluation may follow, rather than 
precede, the regulatory action.
    (7) If there are two or more ways to achieve compliance with a 
certificate or the rules or orders of the Commission, or with written 
Corporation commitments, or there are two or more ways to reach a level 
of protection which is adequate, then ordinarily the Corporation is free 
to choose the way which best suits its purposes. However, should it be 
necessary or appropriate for the Commission to prescribe a specific way 
to comply with its requirements or to achieve adequate protection, then 
cost may be a factor in selecting the way, provided that the objective 
of compliance or adequate protection is met.
    (b) In reaching the determination required by paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, the Commission will consider how the backfit should be 
scheduled in light of other ongoing regulatory activities at the plant 
and, in addition, will consider information available concerning any of 
the following factors as may be appropriate and any other information 
relevant and material to the proposed backfit:
    (1) Statement of the specific objectives that the proposed backfit 
is designed to achieve;
    (2) General description of the activity that would be required by 
the Corporation in order to complete the backfit;
    (3) Potential change in the risk to the public from the accidental 
release of radioactive material;
    (4) Potential impact on radiological exposure of facility employees;
    (5) Installation and continuing costs associated with the backfit, 
including the cost of plant downtime;
    (6) The potential safety impact of changes in plant or operational 
complexity, including the relationship to proposed and existing 
regulatory requirements;
    (7) The estimated resource burden on the NRC associated with the 
proposed backfit and the availability of such resources;
    (8) The potential impact of differences in plant type, design, or 
age on the relevancy and practicality of the proposed backfit; and
    (9) Whether the proposed backfit is interim or final and, if 
interim, the justification for imposing the proposed backfit on an 
interim basis.
    (c) No certificate will be withheld during the pendency of backfit 
analyses required by the Commission's rules.
    (d) The Executive Director for Operations shall be responsible for 
implementation of this section, and all analyses required by this 
section shall be approved by the Executive Director for Operations or 
his or her designee.

             NRC-Owned Inventions--Patents and Applications


<R05>
Sec. 81.10  Authority.

    The regulations of this subpart governing the licensing or rights in 
NRC

[[Page 637]]

inventions are issued pursuant to the authority of the Commission under 
42 U.S.C. 2186 (sec. 156 of the Act), 42 U.S.C. 2201g (sec. 161g. of the 
Act), and according to regulations issued by the Administrator of 
General Services pursuant to the Memorandum and Statement of Government 
Patent Policy issued by President Nixon on August 23, 1971 (36 FR 
16887).


<R05>
Sec. 81.11  Policy.

    (a) The inventions covered by the U.S. patents and patent 
applications vested in the Government of the United States of America, 
as represented by or in the custody of the Commission, normally will 
best serve the public interest when they are developed to the point of 
practical application and made available to the public in the shortest 
time possible.
    (b) The Commission generally prefers to make these inventions 
available to all interested parties through the granting of nonexclusive 
licenses. However, the Commission recognizes that to obtain commercial 
utilization of an invention, it may be necessary to grant an exclusive 
license for a limited period of time as an incentive for the investment 
of risk capital to achieve practical application of an invention.
    (c) Whenever the Commission deems it appropriate to grant an 
exclusive license, the license will be negotiated on terms and 
conditions most favorable to the interests of the public and the 
Government. In considering the accord of such a license, due weight will 
be given to assisting small business and minority business enterprises, 
as well as economically depressed, low income and labor surplus areas 
within the United States.
    (d) All licenses shall be by express written instruments. No license 
shall be granted or implied in an NRC invention except as provided for 
in these regulations or in patent rights articles under Commission 
procurement regulations, pursuant to the Act, or pursuant to any 
existing or future treaty or agreement between the United States and any 
foreign government or intergovernmental organization.
    (e) No grant of a license under this subpart shall be construed to 
confer upon any licensee any immunity from the antitrust laws or from 
liability for patent misuse, and the acquisition and use of rights 
pursuant to this subpart shall not be immunized from the operation of 
State or Federal law by reason of the source of the grant.
    (f) No grant of a license under this subpart shall be construed to 
confer any authorization under chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, or any other 
chapter or section of the Act (42 U.S.C., sec. 2011-2296) for which 
separate application for a license must be made in accordance with the 
Act or other Commission regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 81.13  Publication of NRC inventions available for licensing.

    (a) The Commission will have published periodically a list of the 
NRC inventions available for licensing under this subpart in the Federal 
Register, the U.S. Patent Office Official Gazette, and in one other 
publication which it is determined will best serve the public interest 
and, where advisable, in other publications.
    (b) Interested persons may obtain copies of such lists by 
communicating with the Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of U.S. 
patents may be obtained from the U.S. Patent Office. Copies of U.S. 
patent application specifications, or microfiche reproductions thereof, 
may be secured at reasonable cost from the National Technical 
Information Service (NTIS) or from the U.S. Patent Office with 
Commission approval.

[38 FR 7318, Mar. 20, 1973, as amended at 40 FR 8793, Mar. 3, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 81.20  Nonexclusive licenses.

    (a) NRC inventions will normally be made available for the grant of 
nonexclusive licenses to responsible applicants who will practice the 
invention and make its benefits reasonably accessible to the public.
    (1) The nonexclusive license will be revocable, at the option of the 
Commission, if the licensee does not comply with all the terms and 
conditions of the license agreement.
    (2) The duration of the license shall be for a specified period and/
or such additional period as may be provided for in the license 
agreement.

[[Page 638]]

    (3) The license shall require the licensee to bring the invention to 
the point of practical application within a period specified in the 
license agreement, or as the period may be extended by the Commission, 
and then to continue to make the benefits of the invention reasonably 
accessible to the public.
    (4) The license shall be granted for all of the fields of use of the 
invention, or only such fields of use as may be specified in the license 
agreement, and throughout the United States of America, its territories 
and possessions, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia or in any 
lesser geographic portion thereof as may be specified in the license 
agreement.
    (5) The licensee shall be required to submit periodic reports on his 
efforts to bring the invention to a point of practical application and 
the extent to which he continues to make the benefits of the invention 
reasonably accessible to the public. Unless otherwise specified in the 
license, such periodic reports will be required annually prior to the 
anniversary date of the grant of the license. The reports shall contain 
information within the licensee's knowledge, or which the licensee may 
acquire under normal business practices, pertaining to the commercial 
use being made of the invention, and other information which the 
Commission may determine to be pertinent to the licensing activity of 
the Commission and specified in the license agreement.
    (6) Normally a royalty shall not be charged U.S. citizens and U.S. 
corporations for nonexclusive licenses on NRC inventions.
    (7) The license may extend to wholly-owned subsidiaries of the 
licensee but shall be nonassignable, or otherwise nontransferable, 
without approval of the Commission.
    (8) The Commission may revoke the license (i) for failure of the 
licensee to bring the invention to the point of practical application or 
to continue to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible 
to the public, (ii) if the licensee defaults in making any periodic 
report required by the license, or (iii) if the licensee commits any 
breach of any covenant or agreement therein contained, or (iv) if the 
licensee willfully makes, or has made, a false statement of a material 
fact or omitted a material fact in the license application submitted 
pursuant to Sec. 81.40(a) or in any report required by the license 
agreement.
    (9) The Commission may restrict the licensee to the particular 
fields of use and/or geographical areas in which the licensee has 
brought the invention to the point of practical application and continue 
to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the 
public.
    (10) Before revoking or restricting any license granted pursuant to 
this subpart, the Commission shall mail to the licensee and any 
sublicensee of record, at the last address filed with the Commission, a 
written notice of the Commission's intention to revoke or restrict the 
license, and the licensee and any sublicensee shall be allowed thirty 
(30) days after the mailing of such notice, or within such period as may 
be granted by the Commission, to remedy any breach of any covenant or 
agreement as referred to in paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this section, or to 
show cause why the license should not be revoked or restricted.
    (11) Subject to the rights reserved to the Government in this 
section, the licensee shall be granted the nonexclusive rights to make, 
use, and/or sell the invention in accordance with the terms and 
conditions specified in the license agreement.
    (12) The license may be subject to such other terms and conditions 
as the Commission may deem in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 81.30  Limited exclusive licenses.

    (a) An NRC invention may be made available for the grant of a 
limited exclusive license provided that:
    (1) The invention has been published as available for licensing 
pursuant to Sec. 81.13 for a period of at least six (6) months.
    (2) The Commission has determined that (i) the invention may be 
brought to the point of practical application in certain fields of use 
or in certain geographical locations by exclusive licensing, (ii) the 
desired practical application has not been achieved under any

[[Page 639]]

nonexclusive license granted on the invention, and (iii) the desired 
practical application is not likely to be achieved expeditiously in the 
public interest under a nonexclusive license or as a result of further 
Government-funded research or development.
    (3) Notice of the selection of a prospective licensee to be granted 
a limited exclusive license of a specified duration and scope shall have 
been transmitted to the Attorney General of the United States and shall 
have been published for at least sixty (60) days in the Federal Register 
with a statement advising of the rights of license applicants or third 
parties to apply for nonexclusive licenses or bring information to the 
attention of the Commission under the next paragraph.
    (4) After expiration of the period in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the Commission has determined (i) that no applicant for a 
nonexclusive license has brought or will bring the invention to the 
point of practical application as specified in the prospective exclusive 
license within a reasonable period under a nonexclusive license, and 
(ii) that the granting of the license would be in the public interest 
and not be inconsistent with the Act after consideration of all the 
facts and any written evidence and argument which third parties may 
present to the Commission within sixty (60) days of the publication of 
the notices of the selection of the licensee under paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.
    (5) The Commission shall record and make available for public 
inspection, upon request, all decisions and the basis thereof under this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 81.31  Selection of an exclusive licensee.

    An exclusive licensee will be selected by the Commission on bases 
consistent with the policy set forth in Sec. 81.11 of this subpart in 
accordance with the procedures herein, based upon the information 
supplied to the Commission in a license application under Sec. 81.40. 
Consideration will be given to: (a) The capabilities of the applicant to 
further the technical and market development of the invention to bring 
the same to the point of practical application, (b) the applicant's plan 
to undertake development of the invention, (c) the projected impact on 
competition, (d) the benefit to the Government and the public, as well 
as (e) assistance to small business and minority business enterprises 
and economically depressed, low income and labor surplus areas, and (f) 
whether the applicant is a U.S. citizen or corporation.


<R05>
Sec. 81.32  Terms of exclusive license grant.

    (a) NRC inventions may be made available for the grant of limited 
exclusive licenses to responsible applicants who will bring the 
invention to the point of practical application and make its benefits 
reasonably accessible to the public.
    (1) The license may be granted for all or less than all fields of 
use of the invention, and throughout the United States of America, its 
territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, 
or any lesser geographical portion thereof.
    (2) The duration of the license will be negotiated and shall include 
(i) a period of exclusivity specified in the license, which shall be 
related to the period necessary to provide a reasonable incentive for 
the licensee to invest the necessary risk capital to bring the invention 
to the point of practical application and which shall not exceed 5 years 
or be extended unless the Commission determines on the basis of a 
written submission supported by a factual showing that a longer period 
is reasonably necessary to permit the licensee to enter the market and 
recoup his investment in bringing the invention to the point of 
practical application; and (ii) a terminal portion, sufficient to make 
the invention reasonably available for the granting of nonexclusive 
licenses under Sec. 81.20, during which the licensee may have a 
nonexclusive license if the licensee continues to make the invention 
reasonably accessible to the public.
    (3) The license shall require the licensee to bring the invention to 
the point of practical application within a period specified in the 
license agreement, or, subject to the approval of the Commission, within 
a longer period,

[[Page 640]]

and then to continue to make the benefits of the invention reasonably 
accessible to the public.
    (4) The license shall require the licensee to expand a specified 
minimum sum of money and/or to take other specified action, within 
indicated periods as specified in the license, in an effort to bring the 
invention to the point of practical application. Reasonable royalties 
shall be charged by the Commission, as specified in the license 
agreement, unless the Commission determines that it would not be in the 
public interest to charge royalties.
    (5) The license shall be subject to an irrevocable, royalty-free 
right of the Government of the United States to practice and have 
practiced the invention by or on behalf of the Government of the United 
States and on behalf of any foreign Government or intergovernmental 
organization pursuant to any existing or future treaty or agreement with 
the United States.
    (6) The license shall reserve to the Commission the right to require 
the licensee to grant sublicenses to responsible applicants to practice 
the invention on terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, (i) 
to the extent that the invention is required for public use by 
governmental regulations, or (ii) as may be necessary to fulfill health 
or safety needs, or (iii) if the invention is useful in the production 
or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy and the 
licensing of such invention is of importance to effectuate the policies 
and purposes of the Act, (iv) for other public purposes as stipulated in 
the license agreement. In the event that the licensee and the Commission 
cannot agree upon reasonable terms for such sublicenses, the terms, 
including a reasonable royalty, may be fixed pursuant to the procedure 
set forth in section 157(c) of the Act.
    (7) Subject to the right reserved to the Government in paragraphs 
(a) (5) and (6) of this section, the licensee shall be granted the 
exclusive right to make, use, and/or sell the invention in accordance 
with the terms and conditions specified in the license agreement.
    (8) The license may extend to wholly owned subsidiaries of the 
licensee but shall be nonassignable and otherwise nontransferable 
without approval of the Commission, except assignment may be made, upon 
notice to the Commission, to successors of that part of the licensee's 
business to which the invention pertains.
    (9) An exclusive licensee may grant sublicenses under his license 
only with the approval of the Commission. Any sublicense or assignment 
granted by an exclusive licensee shall be subject to the terms and 
conditions of the exclusive license, including the rights retained by 
the Government thereunder, and a copy of each such sublicense or 
assignment shall be furnished to the Commission.
    (10) The license shall require the licensee to submit periodic 
reports on his efforts to achieve practical application of the invention 
and the extent to which he continues to make the benefits of the 
invention reasonably accessible to the public. Unless otherwise 
specified in the license, such reports will be required annually on the 
anniversary date of the grant of the license. The report shall contain 
information within the licensee's knowledge, or which the licensee may 
acquire under normal business practices, pertaining to the commercial 
use being made of the invention, and other information which the 
Commission may determine to be pertinent to the licensing activity of 
the Commission as is specified in the license agreement.
    (11) The Commission may modify or revoke the license (i) for failure 
of the licensee to bring the invention to the point of practical 
application within the period specified in the license agreement or to 
continue to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to 
the public; (ii) if the licensee fails to expend the minimum sum of 
money or to take any other action specified in the license agreement 
within the periods specified in the license agreement in an effort to 
bring the invention to the point of practical application; (iii) if the 
licensee defaults in making any payments or periodic reports required by 
the license; or (iv) if the licensee commits any breach of any covenant 
or agreement therein contained; or (v) if the licensee willfully makes, 
or has made, a false statement

[[Page 641]]

of a material fact or willfully omitted a material fact in the license 
application submitted pursuant to Sec. 81.40 or in any report required 
by the license agreement.
    (12) Before modifying or revoking any license granted pursuant to 
this subpart for any cause, the Commission shall mail to the licensee 
and any sublicensee of record at the last address filed with the 
Commission a written notice of the Commission's intention to modify or 
revoke the license, and the licensee and any sublicensee shall be 
allowed thirty (30) days after the mailing of such notice, or within 
such period as may be granted by the Commission, to remedy any breach of 
any covenant or agreement referred to in paragraph (a)(11)(iv) of this 
section or to show cause why the license should not be modified or 
revoked.
    (13) An exclusive licensee shall be granted the right to sue at his 
own expense any party who infringes the rights set forth in his license 
and covered by the licensed patent. The licensee may join the Government 
of the United States, upon consent of the Attorney General, as a party 
complainant in such suit, but without expense to the Government and the 
licensee shall pay costs and any final judgment or decree that may be 
rendered against the Government in such suit. The Government shall have 
an absolute right to intervene in any such suit at its own expense. The 
licensee shall be obligated to furnish promptly to the Government, upon 
request, copies of all pleadings and other papers filed in any such suit 
and of evidence adduced in proceedings relating to the licensed patent, 
including, but not limited to, negotiations or settlements and 
agreements settling claims by a licensee based on the licensed patent, 
and all other books, documents, papers, and records pertaining to such 
suit. If, as a result of any such litigation, the patent shall be 
declared invalid, the licensee shall have the right to surrender his 
license and be relieved from any further obligation thereunder.
    (14) A licensee may surrender his license at any time prior to 
termination of the license upon notice thereof to the Commission, and 
upon approval of the Commission, but the licensee shall not be relieved 
of the obligations thereunder without specific approval of the 
Commission.
    (15) The license may be subject to such other terms and conditions 
as the Commission may deem in the public interest.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 81.50  Additional licenses.

    Subject to any outstanding licenses, nothing in this subpart shall 
preclude the Commission from granting additional nonexclusive and 
limited exclusive licenses for inventions covered by this subpart when

conflicts with other rules or requirements of the NRC;
    (2) An application of the regulation in the particular circumstances 
would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary 
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule;
    (3) When compliance would result in undue hardship or other costs 
that are significantly in excess of those contemplated when the 
regulation was adopted, or that are significantly in excess of those 
incurred by others similarly situated;
    (4) When the exemption would result in benefit to the common defense 
and security that compensates for any decrease in security that may 
result from the grant of the exemption;
    (5) When the exemption would provide only temporary relief from the 
applicable regulation and the licensee or applicant has made good faith 
efforts to comply with the regulation;
    (6) When there is any other material circumstance not considered

Sec. 95.15  Approval for processing licensees and others for facility
clearance.

    (a) A licensee, certificate holder, or other person who has a need 
to use, process, store, reproduce, transmit, transport, or handle NRC 
classified information at any location in connection with Commission-
related activities shall promptly request an NRC facility clearance. 
This specifically includes situations where a licensee, certificate 
holder, or other person needs a contractor or consultant to have access 
to NRC classified information. Also included are others who require 
access to classified information in connection with NRC regulated 
activities but do not require use, storage, or possession of classified 
information outside of NRC facilities. However, it is not necessary for 
a licensee, certificate holder, or other person to request an NRC 
facility clearance for access to another agency's classified information 
at that agency's facilities or to store that agency's classified 
information at their facility, provided no NRC classified information is 
involved and they meet the security requirements of the other agency. If 
NRC classified information is involved, the requirements of Sec. 95.17 
apply.
    (b) The request must include the name of the facility, the location 
of the facility and an identification of any facility clearance issued 
by another government agency. If there is no existing facility 
clearance, the request must include a security Standard Practice 
Procedures Plan that outlines the facility's proposed security 
procedures and controls for the protection of classified information, a 
floor plan of the area in which the matter is to be used, processed, 
stored, reproduced, transmitted, transported or handled; and Foreign 
Ownership, Control or Influence information.
    (c) NRC will promptly inform applicants of the acceptability of the 
request for further processing and will notify the licensee or other 
person of their decision in writing.

<R05>
Sec. 95.17  Processing facility clearance.

    (a) Following the receipt of an acceptable request for facility 
clearance, the NRC will either accept an existing facility clearance 
granted by a current CSA and authorize possession of license or 
certificate related classified information, or process the facility for 
a facility clearance. Processing will include--
    (1) A determination based on review and approval of a Standard 
Practice Procedures Plan that granting of the Facility Clearance would 
not be inconsistent with the national interest, including a finding that 
the facility is not under foreign ownership, control, or influence to 
such a degree that a determination could not be made. An NRC finding of 
foreign ownership, control, or influence is based on factors concerning 
the foreign intelligence threat, risk of unauthorized technology 
transfer, type and sensitivity of the information that requires 
protection, the extent of foreign influence, record of compliance with 
pertinent laws, and the nature of international security and information 
exchange agreements. The licensee, certificate holder, or other person 
must advise the NRC within 30 days of any significant events or changes 
that may affect its status concerning foreign ownership, control, or 
influence (e.g., changes in ownership; changes that affect the company's 
answers to original FOCI questions; indebtedness; and changes in the 
required form that identifies owners, officers, directors, and executive 
personnel).
    (2) An acceptable security review conducted by the NRC;
    (3) Submitting key management personnel for personnel clearances 
(PCLs); and
    (4) Appointing a U.S. citizen employee as the facility security 
officer.

[[Page 649]]

    (b) An interim Facility Clearance may be granted by the CSA on a 
temporary basis pending completion of the full investigative 
requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 95.18  Key personnel.

    The senior management official and the Facility Security Officer 
must always be cleared to a level commensurate with the Facility 
Clearance. Other key management officials, as determined by the CSA, 
must be granted an access authorization or be excluded from classified 
access. When formal exclusion action is required, the organization's 
board of directors or similar executive body shall affirm the following, 
as appropriate.
    (a) Officers, directors, partners, regents, or trustees (designated 
by name) that are excluded may not require, may not have, and can be 
effectively excluded from access to all classified information disclosed 
to the organization. These individuals also may not occupy positions 
that would enable them to adversely affect the organization's policies 
or practices in the performance of activities involving classified 
information. This action will be made a matter of record by the 
organization's executive body. A copy of the resolution must be 
furnished to the CSA.
    (b) Officers, directors, partners, regents, or trustees (designated 
by name) that are excluded may not require, may not have, and can be 
effectively denied access to higher-level classified information 
(specify which higher level(s)). These individuals may not occupy 
positions that would enable them to adversely affect the organization's 
policies or practices in the protection of classified information. This 
action will be made a matter of record by the organization's executive 
body. A copy of the resolution must be furnished to the CSA.

Sec. 95.19  Changes to security practices and procedures.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, each 
licensee, certificate holder, or other person shall obtain prior CSA 
approval for any proposed change to the name, location, security 
procedures and controls, or floor plan of the approved facility. A 
written description of the proposed change must be furnished to the CSA 
and the NRC Regional Administrator of the cognizant Regional Office 
listed in appendix A to part 73 of this chapter, and, if the NRC is not 
the CSA, also to the Director, Division of Security Operations, Office 
of Nuclear Security and Incident Response; the communications to NRC 
personnel should be by an appropriate method listed in Sec. 95.9. These 
substantive changes to the Standard Practice Procedures Plan that affect 
the security of the facility must be submitted to the NRC Division of 
Security Operations, or CSA, at least 30 days prior to the change so 
that they may be evaluated. The CSA shall promptly respond in writing to 
all such proposals. Some examples of substantive changes requiring prior 
CSA approval include--
    (1) A change in the approved facility's classified mail address; or
    (2) A temporary or permanent change in the location of the approved 
facility (e.g., moving or relocating NRC's classified interest from one 
room or building to another). Approved changes will be reflected in a 
revised Standard Practice Procedures Plan submission within 30 days of 
approval. Page changes rather than a complete rewrite of the plan may be 
submitted.
    (b) A licensee, certificate holder, or other person may effect a 
minor, non-substantive change to an approved Standard Practice 
Procedures Plan for the safeguarding of classified information without 
receiving prior CSA approval. These minor changes that do not affect the 
security of the facility may be submitted to the addressees noted in 
paragraph (a) of this section within 30 days of the change. Page changes 
rather than a complete rewrite of the plan may be submitted. Some 
examples of minor, non-substantive changes to the Standard Practice 
Procedures Plan include--
    (1) The designation/appointment of a new facility security officer; 
or
    (2) A revision to a protective personnel patrol routine, provided 
the new

[[Page 650]]

routine continues to meet the minimum requirements of this part.
    (c) A licensee, certificate holder, or other person must update its 
NRC facility clearance every five years either by submitting a complete 
Standard Practice Procedures Plan or a certification that the existing 
plan is fully current to the Division of Security Operations.

Sec. 95.20  Grant, denial or termination of facility clearance.

    The Division of Security Operations shall provide notification in 
writing (or orally with written confirmation) to the licensee, 
certificate holder, or other person of the Commission's grant, 
acceptance of another agency's facility clearance, denial, or 
termination of facility clearance. This information must also be 
furnished to representatives of the NRC, NRC contractors, licensees, 
certificate holders, or other person, or other Federal agencies having a 
need to transmit classified information to the licensees or other 
person.

Sec. 95.21  Withdrawal of requests for facility security clearance.

    When a request for facility clearance is to be withdrawn or 
canceled, the requester shall notify the NRC Division of Security 
Operations in the most expeditious manner so that processing for this 
approval may be terminated. The notification must identify the full name 
of the individual requesting discontinuance, his or her position with 
the facility, and the full identification of the facility. The requestor 
shall confirm the telephone notification promptly in writing.

<R05>
Sec. 95.23  Termination of facility clearance.

    (a) Facility clearance will be terminated when--
    (1) There is no longer a need to use, process, store, reproduce, 
transmit, transport or handle classified matter at the facility; or
    (2) The Commission makes a determination that continued facility 
clearance is not in the interest of national security.
    (b) When facility clearance is terminated, the licensee, certificate 
holder, or other person will be notified in writing of the determination 
and the procedures outlined in Sec. 95.53 apply.

<R05>
Sec. 95.25  Protection of National Security Information and Restricted
Data in storage.

    (a) Secret matter, while unattended or not in actual use, must be 
stored in--
    (1) A safe, steel file cabinet, or safe-type steel file container 
that has an automatic unit locking mechanism. All such receptacles will 
be accorded supplemental protection during non-working hours; or
    (2) Any steel file cabinet that has four sides and a top and bottom 
(all permanently attached by welding, rivets, or peened bolts so the 
contents cannot be removed without leaving visible evidence of entry) 
and is secured by a rigid metal lock bar and an approved key operated or 
combination padlock. The keepers of the rigid metal lock bar must be 
secured to the cabinet by welding, rivets, or bolts, so they cannot be 
removed and replaced without leaving evidence of the entry. The drawers 
of the container must be held securely so their contents cannot be 
removed without forcing open the drawer. This type of cabinet will be 
accorded supplemental protection during non-working hours.
    (b) Confidential matter while unattended or not in use must be 
stored in the same manner as SECRET matter except that no supplemental 
protection is required.
    (c) Classified lock combinations. (1) A minimum number of authorized 
persons may know the combinations to authorized storage containers. 
Security containers, vaults, cabinets, and other authorized storage 
containers must be kept locked when not under

[[Page 651]]

the direct supervision of an authorized person entrusted with the 
contents.
    (2) Combinations must be changed by a person authorized access to 
the contents of the container, by the Facility Security Officer, or his 
or her designee.
    (d) Records of combinations. If a record is made of a combination, 
the record must be marked with the highest classification of material 
authorized for storage in the container. Superseded combinations must be 
destroyed.
    (e) Selections of combinations. Each combination must be randomly 
selected and require the use of at least three different numbers. In 
selecting combinations, multiples, simple arithmetical ascending or 
descending series, telephone numbers, social security numbers, car 
license numbers, and calendar dates such as birthdates and 
anniversaries, shall be avoided.
    (f) Combinations will be changed only by persons authorized access 
to Secret or Confidential National Security Information and/or 
Restricted Data depending upon the matter authorized to be stored in the 
security container.
    (g) Posted information. Containers may not bear external markings 
indicating the level of classified matter authorized for storage. A 
record of the names of persons having knowledge of the combination must 
be posted inside the container.
    (h) End of day security checks. (1) Facilities that store classified 
matter shall establish a system of security checks at the close of each 
working day to ensure that all classified matter and security 
repositories have been appropriately secured.
    (2) Facilities operating with multiple work shifts shall perform the 
security checks at the end of the last working shift in which classified 
matter had been removed from storage for use. The checks are not 
required during continuous 24-hour operations.
    (i) Unattended security container found opened. If an unattended 
security container housing classified matter is found unlocked, the 
custodian or an alternate must be notified immediately. Also, the 
container must be secured by protective personnel. An effort must be 
made to determine if the contents were compromised not later than the 
next day.
    (j) Supervision of keys and padlocks. Use of key-operated padlocks 
are subject to the following requirements:
    (1) A key and lock custodian shall be appointed to ensure proper 
custody and handling of keys and locks used for protection of classified 
matter;
    (2) A key and lock control register must be maintained to identify 
keys for each lock and their current location and custody;
    (3) Keys and locks must be audited each month;
    (4) Keys must be inventoried with each change of custody;
    (5) Keys must not be removed from the premises;
    (6) Keys and spare locks must be protected equivalent to the level 
of classified matter involved;
    (7) Locks must be changed or rotated at least every 12 months, and 
must be replaced after loss or compromise of their operable keys; and
    (8) Master keys may not be made.

Sec. 95.27  Protection while in use.

    While in use, classified matter must be under the direct control of 
an authorized individual to preclude physical, audio, and visual access 
by persons who do not have the prescribed access authorization or other 
written CSA disclosure authorization (see Sec. 95.36 for additional 
information concerning disclosure authorizations).

[64 FR 15651, Apr. 1, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 95.29  Establishment of Restricted or Closed areas.

    (a) If, because of its nature, sensitivity or importance, classified 
matter cannot otherwise be effectively controlled in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 95.25 and 95.27, a Restricted or Closed area 
must be established to protect this matter.
    (b) The following measures apply to Restricted Areas:
    (1) Restricted areas must be separated from adjacent areas by a 
physical

[[Page 652]]

barrier designed to prevent unauthorized access (physical, audio, and 
visual) into these areas.
    (2) Controls must be established to prevent unauthorized access to 
and removal of classified matter.
    (3) Access to classified matter must be limited to persons who 
possess appropriate access authorization or other written CSA disclosure 
authorization and who require access in the performance of their 
official duties or regulatory obligations.
    (4) Persons without appropriate access authorization for the area 
visited must be escorted by an appropriate CSA access authorized person 
at all times while within Restricted or Closed Areas.
    (5) Each individual authorized to enter a Restricted or Closed Area 
must be issued a distinctive form of identification (e.g., badge) when 
the number of employees assigned to the area exceeds thirty per shift.
    (6) During nonworking hours, admittance must be controlled by 
protective personnel. Protective personnel shall conduct patrols during 
nonworking hours at least every 8 hours and more frequently if necessary 
to maintain a commensurate level of protection. Entrances must be 
continuously monitored by protective personnel or by an approved alarm 
system.
    (c) Due to the size and nature of the classified material, or 
operational necessity, it may be necessary to construct Closed Areas for 
storage because GSA-approved containers or vaults are unsuitable or 
impractical. Closed Areas must be approved by the CSA. The following 
measures apply to Closed Areas:
    (1) Access to Closed Areas must be controlled to preclude 
unauthorized access. This may be accomplished through the use of a 
cleared employee or by a CSA approved access control device or system.
    (2) Access must be limited to authorized persons who have an 
appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know for the classified 
matter within the area. Persons without the appropriate level of 
clearance and/or need-to-know must be escorted at all times by an 
authorized person where inadvertent or unauthorized exposure to 
classified information cannot otherwise be effectively prevented.
    (3) The Closed Area must be accorded supplemental protection during 
non-working hours. During these hours, admittance to the area must be 
controlled by locked entrances and exits secured by either an approved 
built-in combination lock or an approved combination or key-operated 
padlock. However, doors secured from the inside with a panic bolt (for 
example, actuated by a panic bar), a dead bolt, a rigid wood or metal 
bar, or other means approved by the CSA, do not require additional 
locking devices.
    (4) Open shelf or bin storage of classified matter in Closed Areas 
requires CSA approval. Only areas protected by an approved intrusion 
detection system will qualify for approval.

Sec. 95.31  Protective personnel.

    Whenever protective personnel are used to protect classified 
information they shall:
    (a) Possess an ``L'' access authorization (or CSA equivalent) if the 
licensee, certificate holder, or other person possesses information 
classified Confidential National Security Information, Confidential 
Restricted Data or Secret National Security Information.
    (b) Possess a ``Q'' access authorization (or CSA equivalent) if the 
licensee, certificate holder, or other person possesses Secret 
Restricted Data related to nuclear weapons design, manufacturing and 
vulnerability information; and certain particularly sensitive Naval 
Nuclear Propulsion Program information (e.g., fuel manufacturing 
technology) and the protective personnel require access as part of their 
regular duties.

Sec. 95.33  Security education.

    All cleared employees must be provided with security training and 
briefings commensurate with their involvement with classified 
information. The facility may obtain defensive security, threat 
awareness, and other education

[[Page 653]]

and training information and material from their CSA or other sources.
    (a) Facility Security Officer training. Licensees and others are 
responsible for ensuring that the Facility Security Officer, and others 
performing security duties, complete security training deemed 
appropriate by the CSA. Training requirements must be based on the 
facility's involvement with classified information and may include a 
Facility Security Officer orientation course and, for Facility Security 
Officers at facilities with safeguarding capability, a Facility Security 
Officer Program Management Course. Training, if required, should be 
completed within 1 year of appointment to the position of Facility 
Security Officer.
    (b) Government-provided briefings. The CSA is responsible for 
providing initial security briefings to the Facility Security Officer, 
and for ensuring that other briefings required for special categories of 
information are provided.
    (c) Temporary help suppliers. A temporary help supplier, or other 
contractor who employs cleared individuals solely for dispatch 
elsewhere, is responsible for ensuring that required briefings are 
provided to their cleared personnel. The temporary help supplier or the 
using licensee's, certificate holder's, or other person's facility may 
conduct these briefings.
    (d) Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (SF-312). The SF-
312 is an agreement between the United States and an individual who is 
cleared for access to classified information. An employee issued an 
initial access authorization must, in accordance with the requirements 
of Sec. 25.23 of this chapter, execute an SF-312 before being granted 
access to classified information. The Facility Security Officer shall 
forward the executed SF-312 to the CSA for retention. If the employee 
refuses to execute the SF-312, the licensee or other facility shall deny 
the employee access to classified information and submit a report to the 
CSA. The SF-312 must be signed and dated by the employee and witnessed. 
The employee's and witness' signatures must bear the same date.
    (e) Initial security briefings. Before being granted access to 
classified information, an employee shall receive an initial security 
briefing that includes the following topics:
    (1) A Threat Awareness Briefing.
    (2) A Defensive Security Briefing.
    (3) An overview of the security classification system.
    (4) Employee reporting obligations and requirements.
    (5) Security procedures and duties applicable to the employee's job.
    (f) Refresher briefings. The licensee or other facility shall 
conduct refresher briefings for all cleared employees every 3 years. As 
a minimum, the refresher briefing must reinforce the information 
provided during the initial briefing and inform employees of appropriate 
changes in security regulations. This requirement may be satisfied by 
use of audio/video materials and/or by issuing written materials.
    (g) Debriefings. Licensee and other facilities shall debrief cleared 
employees at the time of termination of employment (discharge, 
resignation, or retirement); when an employee's access authorization is 
terminated, suspended, or revoked; and upon termination of the Facility 
Clearance.
    (h) Records reflecting an individual's initial and refresher 
security orientations and security termination must be maintained for 
three years after termination of the individual's access authorization.

Sec. 95.36  Access by representatives of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency or by participants in other international agreements.

    (a) Based upon written disclosure authorization from the NRC Office 
of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards that an individual is an 
authorized representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) or other international organization and that the individual is 
authorized to make visits under an established agreement with the United 
States Government, an applicant, licensee, certificate holder, or other 
person subject to this part shall permit the individual (upon 
presentation of the credentials specified in Sec. 75.8(c) of this 
chapter and any other credentials identified in the disclosure 
authorization) to have access to matter classified as National Security 
Information that is relevant to the conduct of a visit or inspection. A 
disclosure authorization under this section does not authorize a 
licensee, certificate holder, or other person subject to this part to 
provide access to Restricted Data.
    (b) For purposes of this section, classified National Security 
Information is relevant to the conduct of a visit or inspection if--
    (1) In the case of a visit, this information is needed to verify 
information according to Sec. 75.8 of this chapter; or
    (2) In the case of an inspection, an inspector is entitled to have 
access to the information under Sec. 75.8 of this chapter.
    (c) In accordance with the specific disclosure authorization 
provided by the Division of Security Operations, licensees, certificate 
holders, or other persons subject to this part are authorized to release 
(i.e., transfer possession of) copies of documents that contain 
classified National Security Information directly to IAEA inspectors and 
other representatives officially designated to request and receive 
classified National Security Information documents. These documents must 
be marked specifically for release to IAEA or other international 
organizations in accordance with instructions contained in the NRC's 
disclosure authorization letter. Licensees, certificate holders, and 
other persons subject to this part may also forward these documents

[[Page 655]]

through the NRC to the international organization's headquarters in 
accordance with the NRC disclosure authorization. Licensees, certificate 
holders, and other persons may not reproduce documents containing 
classified National Security Information except as provided in Sec. 
95.43.
    (d) Records regarding these visits and inspections must be 
maintained for 5 years beyond the date of the visit or inspection. These 
records must specifically identify each document released to an 
authorized representative and indicate the date of the release. These 
records must also identify (in such detail as the Division of Security 
Operations, by letter, may require) the categories of documents that the 
authorized representative has had access and the date of this access. A 
licensee, certificate holder, or other person subject to this part shall 
also retain Division of Security Operations disclosure authorizations 
for 5 years beyond the date of any visit or inspection when access to 
classified information was permitted.
    (e) Licensees, certificate holders, or other persons subject to this 
part shall take such measures as may be necessary to preclude access to 
classified matter by participants of other international agreements 
unless specifically provided for under the terms of a specific

Sec. 95.37  Classification and preparation of documents.

    (a) Classification. Classified information generated or possessed by 
a licensee, certificate holder, or other person must be appropriately 
marked. Classified material which is not conducive to markings (e.g., 
equipment) may be exempt from this requirement. These exemptions are 
subject to the approval of the CSA on a case-by-case basis. If a person 
or facility generates or possesses information that is believed to be 
classified based on guidance provided by the NRC or by derivation from 
classified documents, but which no authorized classifier has determined 
to be classified, the information must be protected and marked with the 
appropriate classification markings pending review and signature of an 
NRC authorized classifier. This information shall be protected as 
classified information pending final determination.
    (b) Classification consistent with content. Each document containing 
classified information shall be classified Secret or Confidential 
according to its content. NRC licensees, certificate holders, or other 
persons subject to the requirements of 10 CFR part 95 may not make 
original classification decisions.
    (c) Markings required on face of documents. (1) For derivative 
classification of classified National Security Information:
    (i) Derivative classifications of classified National Security 
Information must contain the identity of the source document or the 
classification guide, including the agency and office of origin, on the 
``Derived From'' line and its classification date. If more than one 
source is cited, the ``Derived From'' line should indicate ``Multiple 
Sources.'' The derivative classifier shall maintain the identification 
of each source with the file or record copy of the derivatively 
classified document.
    (ii) Declassification instructions. When marking derivatively 
classified documents, the ``DECLASSIFY ON'' line must carry forward the 
declassification instructions as reflected in the original document. If 
multiple sources are used, the instructions will carry forward the 
longest duration.
    (iii) An example of the marking stamp is as follows:

 Derived from___________________________________________________________
 (Source/Date)

 Reason:________________________________________________________________

 Declassify On:_________________________________________________________

 (Date/Event/Exemption)

 Classifier:____________________________________________________________
 (Name/Title/Number)
    (2) For Restricted Data documents:
    (i) Identity of the classifier. The identity of the classifier must 
be shown by completion of the ``Derivative Classifier'' line. The 
``Derivative Classifier'' line must show the name of the person 
classifying the document and the basis

[[Page 656]]

for the classification. Dates for downgrading or declassification do not 
apply.
    (ii) Classification designation (e.g., Secret, Confidential) and 
Restricted Data. NOTE: No ``Declassification'' instructions will be 
placed on documents containing Restricted Data.
    (d) Placement of markings. The highest classification marking 
assigned to a document must be placed in a conspicuous fashion in 
letters at the top and bottom of the outside of the front covers and 
title pages, if any, and first and last pages on which text appears, on 
both bound and unbound documents, and on the outside of back covers of 
bound documents. The balance of the pages must be marked at the top and 
bottom with:
    (1) The overall classification marking assigned to the document;
    (2) The highest classification marking required by content of the 
page; or
    (3) The marking UNCLASSIFIED if they have no classified content.
    (e) Additional markings. (1) If the document contains any form of 
Restricted Data, it must bear the appropriate marking on the first page 
of text, on the front cover and title page, if any. For example: ``This 
document contains Restricted Data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954. Unauthorized disclosure subject to Administrative and Criminal 
Sanctions.''
    (2) Limitation on reproduction or dissemination. If the originator 
or classifier determines that reproduction or further dissemination of a 
document should be restricted, the following additional wording may be 
placed on the face of the document:

Reproduction or Further Dissemination Requires Approval of
________________________________________________________________________
If any portion of this additional marking does not apply, it should be 
crossed out.

    (f) Portion markings. In addition to the information required on the 
face of the document, each classified document is required, by marking 
or other means, to indicate clearly which portions are classified (e.g., 
paragraphs or pages) and which portions are not classified. The symbols 
(S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, (U) for Unclassified, or (RD) for 
Restricted Data may be used immediately preceding or following the text 
to which it applies, except that the designation must follow titles or 
subjects. (Portion marking of paragraphs is not required for documents 
containing Restricted Data.) If this type of portion marking is not 
practicable, the document must contain a description sufficient to 
identify the classified information and the unclassified information.

                                 Example

Pages 1-3 Secret
Pages 4-19 Unclassified
Pages 20-26 Secret
Pages 27-32 Confidential

    (g) Transmittal document. If a document transmitting classified 
information contains no classified information or the classification 
level of the transmittal document is not as high as the highest 
classification level of its enclosures, then the document must be marked 
at the top and bottom with a classification at least as high as its 
highest classified enclosure. The classification may be higher if the 
enclosures, when combined, warrant a higher classification than any 
individual enclosure. When the contents of the transmittal document

Sec. 100.1  Purpose.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to establish approval requirements 
for proposed sites for stationary power and testing reactors subject to 
part 50 or part 52 of this chapter.
    (b) There exists a substantial base of knowledge regarding power 
reactor siting, design, construction and operation. This base reflects 
that the primary factors that determine public health and safety are the 
reactor design, construction and operation.
    (c) Siting factors and criteria are important in assuring that 
radiological doses from normal operation and postulated accidents will 
be acceptably low, that natural phenomena and potential man-made hazards 
will be appropriately accounted for in the design of the plant, that 
site characteristics are such that adequate security measures to protect 
the plant can be developed, and that physical characteristics unique to 
the proposed site that could pose a significant impediment to the 
development of emergency plans are identified.
    (d) This approach incorporates the appropriate standards and 
criteria for approval of stationary power and testing reactor sites. The 
Commission intends to carry out a traditional defense-in-depth approach 
with regard to reactor siting to ensure public safety. Siting away from 
densely populated centers has been and will continue to be an important 
factor in evaluating applications for site approval.

Sec. 100.2  Scope.

    The siting requirements contained in this part apply to applications 
for site approval for the purpose of constructing and operating 
stationary power and testing reactors pursuant to the provisions of part

[61 FR 65175, Dec. 11, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 100.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Combined license means a combined construction permit and operating 
license with conditions for a nuclear power facility issued pursuant to 
subpart C of part 52 of this chapter.
    Early Site Permit means a Commission approval, issued pursuant to 
subpart A of part 52 of this chapter, for a site or sites for one or 
more nuclear power facilities.

[[Page 662]]

    Exclusion area means that area surrounding the reactor, in which the 
reactor licensee has the authority to determine all activities including 
exclusion or removal of personnel and property from the area. This area 
may be traversed by a highway, railroad, or waterway, provided these are 
not so close to the facility as to interfere with normal operations of 
the facility and provided appropriate and effective arrangements are 
made to control traffic on the highway, railroad, or waterway, in case 
of emergency, to protect the public health and safety. Residence within 
the exclusion area shall normally be prohibited. In any event, residents 
shall be subject to ready removal in case of necessity. Activities 
unrelated to operation of the reactor may be permitted in an exclusion 
area under appropriate limitations, provided that no significant hazards 
to the public health and safety will result.
    Low population zone means the area immediately surrounding the 
exclusion area which contains residents, the total number and density of 
which are such that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate 
protective measures could be taken in their behalf in the event of a 
serious accident. These guides do not specify a permissible population 
density or total population within this zone because the situation may 
vary from case to case. Whether a specific number of people can, for 
example, be evacuated from a specific area, or instructed to take 
shelter, on a timely basis will depend on many factors such as location, 
number and size of highways, scope and extent of advance planning, and 
actual distribution of residents within the area.
    Population center distance means the distance from the reactor to 
the nearest boundary of a densely populated center containing more than 
about 25,000 residents.
    Power reactor means a nuclear reactor of a type described in Sec. 
50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22 of this chapter designed to produce electrical 
or heat energy.
    Response spectrum is a plot of the maximum responses (acceleration, 
velocity, or displacement) of idealized single-degree-of-freedom 
oscillators as a function of the natural frequencies of the oscillators 
for a given damping value. The response spectrum is calculated for a 
specified vibratory motion input at the oscillators' supports.
    Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion is the vibratory ground 
motion for which certain structures, systems, and components must be 
designed pursuant to appendix S to part 50 of this chapter to remain 
functional.
    Surface deformation is distortion of geologic strata at or near the 
ground surface by the processes of folding or faulting as a result of 
various earth forces. Tectonic surface deformation is associated with 
earthquake processes.
    Testing reactor means a testing facility as defined in Sec. 50.2 of 
this chapter.

<R04>
     Subpart A_Evaluation Factors for Stationary Power Reactor Site 
      Applications Before January 10, 1997 and for Testing Reactors


<R05>
Sec. 100.10  Factors to be considered when evaluating sites.

    Factors considered in the evaluation of sites include those relating 
both to the proposed reactor design and the characteristics peculiar to 
the site. It is expected that reactors will reflect through their 
design, construction and operation an extremely low probability for 
accidents that could result in release of significant quantities of 
radioactive fission products. In addition, the site location and the 
engineered features included as safeguards against the hazardous 
consequences of an accident, should one occur, should insure a low risk 
of public exposure. In particular, the Commission will take the 
following factors into consideration in determining the acceptability of 
a site for a power or testing reactor:
    (a) Characteristics of reactor design and proposed operation 
including:
    (1) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power 
level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials;
    (2) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are 
applied to the design of the reactor;
    (3) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique or unusual 
features having a significant bearing on the probability or consequences 
of accidental release of radioactive materials;
    (4) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility 
and those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident 
before a release of radioactive material to the environment can occur.
    (b) Population density and use characteristics of the site environs, 
including the exclusion area, low population zone, and population center 
distance.
    (c) Physical characteristics of the site, including seismology, 
meteorology, geology, and hydrology.
    (1) Appendix A, ``Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for Nuclear 
Power Plants,'' describes the nature of investigations required to 
obtain the geologic and seismic data necessary to determine site 
suitability and to provide reasonable assurance that a nuclear power 
plant can be constructed and operated at a proposed site without undue 
risk to the health and safety of the public. It describes procedures for 
determining the quantitative vibratory ground motion design basis at a 
site due to earthquakes and describes information needed to determine 
whether and to what extent a nuclear power plant need be designed to 
withstand the effects of surface faulting.
    (2) Meteorological conditions at the site and in the surrounding 
area should be considered.
    (3) Geological and hydrological characteristics of the proposed site 
may have a bearing on the consequences of an escape of radioactive 
material from the facility. Special precautions should be planned if a 
reactor is to be located at a site where a significant quantity of 
radioactive effluent might accidentally flow into nearby streams or 
rivers or might find ready access to underground water tables.
    (d) Where unfavorable physical characteristics of the site exist, 
the proposed site may nevertheless be found to

[[Page 664]]

be acceptable if the design of the facility includes appropriate and 
adequate compensating engineering safeguards.

Sec. 100.11  Determination of exclusion area, low population zone, 
and population center distance.

    (a) As an aid in evaluating a proposed site, an applicant should 
assume a fission produce release \1\ from the core, the expected 
demonstrable leak rate from the containment and the meteorological 
conditions pertinent to his site to derive an exclusion area, a low 
population zone and population center distance. For the purpose of this 
analysis, which shall set forth the basis for the numerical values used, 
the applicant should determine the following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The fission product release assumed for these calculations 
should be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site 
analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental 
events, that would result in potential hazards not exceeded by those 
from any accident considered credible. Such accidents have generally 
been assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with 
subsequent release of appreciable quantities of fission products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) An exclusion area of such size that an individual located at any 
point on its boundary for two hours immediately following onset of the 
postulated fission product release would not receive a total radiation 
dose to the whole body in excess of 25 rem \2\ or a total radiation dose 
in excess of 300 rem \2\ to the thyroid from iodine exposure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The whole body dose of 25 rem referred to above corresponds 
numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for 
radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations may be 
disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure status (see 
NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, neither its use nor that 
of the 300 rem value for thyroid exposure as set forth in these site 
criteria guides are intended to imply that these numbers constitute 
acceptable limits for emergency doses to the public under accident 
conditions. Rather, this 25 rem whole body value and the 300 rem thyroid 
value have been set forth in these guides as reference values, which can 
be used in the evaluation of reactor sites with respect to potential 
reactor accidents of exceedingly low probability of occurrence, and low 
risk of public exposure to radiation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) A low population zone of such size that an individual located at 
any point on its outer boundary who is exposed to the radioactive cloud 
resulting from the postulated fission product release (during the entire 
period of its passage) would not receive a total radiation dose to the 
whole body in excess of 25 rem or a total radiation dose in excess of 
300 rem to the thyroid from iodine exposure.
    (3) A population center distance of at least one and one-third times 
the distance from the reactor to the outer boundary of the low 
population zone. In applying this guide, the boundary of the population 
center shall be determined upon consideration of population 
distribution. Political boundaries are not controlling in the 
application of this guide. Where very large cities are involved, a 
greater distance may be necessary because of total integrated population 
dose consideration.
    (b) For sites for multiple reactor facilities consideration should 
be given to the following:
    (1) If the reactors are independent to the extent that an accident 
in one reactor would not initiate an accident in another, the size of 
the exclusion area, low population zone and population center distance 
shall be fulfilled with respect to each reactor individually. The 
envelopes of the plan overlay of the areas so calculated shall then be 
taken as their respective boundaries.
    (2) If the reactors are interconnected to the extent that an 
accident in one reactor could affect the safety of operation of any 
other, the size of the exclusion area, low population zone and 
population center distance shall be based upon the assumption that all 
interconnected reactors emit their postulated fission product releases 
simultaneously. This requirement may be reduced in relation to the 
degree of coupling between reactors, the probability of concomitant 
accidents and the probability that an individual would not be exposed to 
the radiation effects from simultaneous releases. The applicant would be 
expected to justify to the satisfaction of the Commission the basis for 
such a reduction in the source term.

[[Page 665]]

    (3) The applicant is expected to show that the simultaneous 
operation of multiple reactors at a site will not result in total 
radioactive effluent releases beyond the allowable limits of applicable 
regulations.

    Note: For further guidance in developing the exclusion area, the low 
population zone, and the population center distance, reference is made 
to Technical Information Document 14844, dated March 23, 1962, which 
contains a procedural method and a sample calculation that result in 
distances roughly reflecting current siting practices of the Commission. 
The calculations described in Technical Information Document 14844 may 
be used as a point of departure for consideration of particular site 
requirements which may result from evaluation of the characteristics of 
a particular reactor, its purpose and method of operation.

Sec. 100.20  Factors to be considered when evaluating sites.

    The Commission will take the following factors into consideration in 
determining the acceptability of a site for a stationary power reactor:
    (a) Population density and use characteristics of the site environs, 
including the exclusion area, the population distribution, and site-
related characteristics must be evaluated to determine whether 
individual as well as societal risk of potential plant accidents is low, 
and that physical characteristics unique to the proposed site that could 
pose a significant impediment to the development of emergency plans are 
identified.
    (b) The nature and proximity of man-related hazards (e.g., airports, 
dams, transportation routes, military and chemical facilities) must be 
evaluated to establish site parameters for use in determining whether a 
plant design can accommodate commonly occurring hazards, and whether the 
risk of other hazards is very low.
    (c) Physical characteristics of the site, including seismology, 
meteorology, geology, and hydrology.
    (1) Section 100.23, ``Geologic and seismic siting factors,'' 
describes the criteria and nature of investigations required to obtain 
the geologic and seismic data necessary to determine the suitability of 
the proposed site and the plant design bases.
    (2) Meteorological characteristics of the site that are necessary 
for safety analysis or that may have an impact upon plant design (such 
as maximum probable wind speed and precipitation) must be identified and 
characterized.
    (3) Factors important to hydrological radionuclide transport (such 
as soil, sediment, and rock characteristics, adsorption and retention 
coefficients, ground water velocity, and distances to the nearest 
surface body of water) must be obtained from on-site measurements. The 
maximum probable flood along with the potential for seismically induced 
floods discussed in Sec. 100.23 (d)(3) must be estimated using 
historical data.


<R05>
Sec. 100.21  Non-seismic siting criteria.

    Applications for site approval for commercial power reactors shall 
demonstrate that the proposed site meets the following criteria:
    (a) Every site must have an exclusion area and a low population 
zone, as defined in Sec. 100.3;
    (b) The population center distance, as defined in Sec. 100.3, must 
be at least one and one-third times the distance from the reactor to the 
outer boundary of the low population zone. In applying this guide, the 
boundary of the population center shall be determined upon consideration 
of population distribution. Political boundaries are not controlling in 
the application of this guide;
    (c) Site atmospheric dispersion characteristics must be evaluated 
and dispersion parameters established such that:
    (1) Radiological effluent release limits associated with normal 
operation from the type of facility proposed to be located at the site 
can be met for any individual located offsite; and

[[Page 666]]

    (2) Radiological dose consequences of postulated accidents shall 
meet the criteria set forth in Sec. 50.34(a)(1) of this chapter for the 
type of facility proposed to be located at the site;
    (d) The physical characteristics of the site, including meteorology, 
geology, seismology, and hydrology must be evaluated and site parameters 
established such that potential threats from such physical 
characteristics will pose no undue risk to the type of facility proposed 
to be located at the site;
    (e) Potential hazards associated with nearby transportation routes, 
industrial and military facilities must be evaluated and site parameters 
established such that potential hazards from such routes and facilities 
will pose no undue risk to the type of facility proposed to be located 
at the site;
    (f) Site characteristics must be such that adequate security plans 
and measures can be developed;
    (g) Physical characteristics unique to the proposed site that could 
pose a significant impediment to the development of emergency plans must 
be identified;
    (h) Reactor sites should be located away from very densely populated 
centers. Areas of low population density are, generally, preferred. 
However, in determining the acceptability of a particular site located 
away from a very densely populated center but not in an area of low 
density, consideration will be given to safety, environmental, economic, 
or other factors, which may result in the site being found acceptable 
\3\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Examples of these factors include, but are not limited to, such 
factors as the higher population density site having superior seismic 
characteristics, better access to skilled labor for construction, better 
rail and highway access, shorter transmission line requirements, or less 
environmental impact on undeveloped areas, wetlands or endangered 
species, etc. Some of these factors are included in, or impact, the 
other criteria included in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 100.23  Geologic and seismic siting criteria.

    This section sets forth the principal geologic and seismic 
considerations that guide the Commission in its evaluation of the 
suitability of a proposed site and adequacy of the design bases 
established in consideration of the geologic and seismic characteristics 
of the proposed site, such that, there is a reasonable assurance that a 
nuclear power plant can be constructed and operated at the proposed site 
without undue risk to the health and safety of the public. Applications 
to engineering design are contained in appendix S to part 50 of this 
chapter.
    (a) Applicability. The requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section apply to applicants for an early site permit or combined 
license pursuant to Part 52 of this chapter, or a construction permit or 
operating license for a nuclear power plant pursuant to Part 50 of this 
chapter on or after January 10, 1997. However, for either an operating 
license applicant or holder whose construction permit was issued prior 
to January 10, 1997, the seismic and geologic siting criteria in 
Appendix A to Part 100 of this chapter continues to apply.
    (b) Commencement of construction. The investigations required in 
paragraph (c) of this section are not considered ``construction'' as 
defined in 10 CFR 50.10(a).
    (c) Geological, seismological, and engineering characteristics. The 
geological, seismological, and engineering characteristics of a site and 
its environs must be investigated in sufficient scope and detail to 
permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed site, to provide 
sufficient information to support evaluations performed to arrive at 
estimates of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion, and to permit 
adequate engineering solutions to actual or potential geologic and 
seismic effects at the proposed site. The size of the region to be 
investigated and the type of data pertinent to the investigations must 
be determined based on the nature of the region surrounding the proposed 
site. Data on the vibratory ground motion, tectonic surface deformation, 
nontectonic deformation, earthquake recurrence rates, fault geometry and 
slip rates, site foundation material, and seismically induced floods and 
water waves must be obtained by reviewing pertinent literature and 
carrying out field investigations. However, each applicant

[[Page 667]]

shall investigate all geologic and seismic factors (for example, 
volcanic activity) that may affect the design and operation of the 
proposed nuclear power plant irrespective of whether such factors are 
explicitly included in this section.
    (d) Geologic and seismic siting factors. The geologic and seismic 
siting factors considered for design must include a determination of the 
Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion for the site, the potential for 
surface tectonic and nontectonic deformations, the design bases for 
seismically induced floods and water waves, and other design conditions 
as stated in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (1) Determination of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion. The 
Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion for the site is characterized by 
both horizontal and vertical free-field ground motion response spectra 
at the free ground surface. The Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion 
for the site is determined considering the results of the investigations 
required by paragraph (c) of this section. Uncertainties are inherent in 
such estimates. These uncertainties must be addressed through an 
appropriate analysis, such as a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis or 
suitable sensitivity analyses. Paragraph IV(a)(1) of appendix S to part 
50 of this chapter defines the minimum Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground 
Motion for design.
    (2) Determination of the potential for surface tectonic and 
nontectonic deformations. Sufficient geological, seismological, and 
geophysical data must be provided to clearly establish whether there is 
a potential for surface deformation.
    (3) Determination of design bases for seismically induced floods and 
water waves. The size of seismically induced floods and water waves that 
could affect a site from either locally or distantly generated seismic 
activity must be determined.
    (4) Determination of siting factors for other design conditions. 
Siting factors for other design conditions that must be evaluated 
include soil and rock stability, liquefaction potential, natural and 
artificial slope stability, cooling water supply, and remote safety-
related structure siting. Each applicant shall evaluate all siting 
factors and potential causes of failure, such as, the physical 
properties of the materials underlying the site, ground disruption, and 
the effects of vibratory ground motion that may affect the design and 
operation of the proposed nuclear power plant.

 Sec. Appendix A to Part 100--Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for 
                          Nuclear Power Plants

                               i. purpose

    General Design Criterion 2 of Appendix A to part 50 of this chapter 
requires that nuclear power plant structures, systems, and components 
important to safety be designed to withstand the effects of natural 
phenomena such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, tsunami, 
and seiches without loss of capability to perform their safety 
functions. It is the purpose of these criteria to set forth the 
principal seismic and geologic considerations which guide the Commission 
in its evaluation of the suitability of proposed sites for nuclear power 
plants and the suitability of the plant design bases established in 
consideration of the seismic and geologic characteristics of the 
proposed sites.
    These criteria are based on the limited geophysical and geological 
information available to date concerning faults and earthquake 
occurrence and effect. They will be revised as necessary when more 
complete information becomes available.

                                ii. scope

    These criteria, which apply to nuclear power plants, describe the 
nature of the investigations required to obtain the geologic and seismic 
data necessary to determine site suitability and provide reasonable 
assurance that a nuclear power plant can be constructed and operated at 
a proposed site without undue risk to the health and safety of the 
public. They describe procedures for determining the quantitative 
vibratory ground motion design basis at a site due to earthquakes and 
describe information needed to determine whether and to what extent a 
nuclear power plant need be designed to withstand the effects of surface 
faulting. Other geologic and seismic factors required to be taken into 
account in the siting and design of nuclear power plants are identified.
    The investigations described in this appendix are within the scope 
of investigations permitted by Sec. 50.10(c)(1) of this chapter.

[[Page 668]]

    Each applicant for a construction permit shall investigate all 
seismic and geologic factors that may affect the design and operation of 
the proposed nuclear power plant irrespective of whether such factors 
are explicitly included in these criteria. Additional investigations 
and/or more conservative determinations than those included in these 
criteria may be required for sites located in areas having complex 
geology or in areas of high seismicity. If an applicant believes that 
the particular seismology and geology of a site indicate that some of 
these criteria, or portions thereof, need not be satisfied, the specific 
sections of these criteria should be identified in the license 
application, and supporting data to justify clearly such departures 
should be presented.
    These criteria do not address investigations of volcanic phenomena 
required for sites located in areas of volcanic activity. Investigations 
of the volcanic aspects of such sites will be determined on a case-by-
case basis.

                            iii. definitions

    As used in these criteria:
    (a) The magnitude of an earthquake is a measure of the size of an 
earthquake and is related to the energy released in the form of seismic 
waves. Magnitude means the numerical value on a Richter scale.
    (b) The intensity of an earthquake is a measure of its effects on 
man, on man-built structures, and on the earth's surface at a particular 
location. Intensity means the numerical value on the Modified Mercalli 
scale.
    (c) The Safe Shutdown Earthquake \1\ is that earthquake which is 
based upon an evaluation of the maximum earthquake potential considering 
the regional and local geology and seismology and specific 
characteristics of local subsurface material. It is that earthquake 
which produces the maximum vibratory ground motion for which certain 
structures, systems, and components are designed to remain functional. 
These structures, systems, and components are those necessary to assure:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Safe Shutdown Earthquake defines that earthquake which has 
commonly been referred to as the Design Basis Earthquake.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary,
    (2) The capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a 
safe shutdown condition, or
    (3) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of 
accidents which could result in potential offsite exposures comparable 
to the guideline exposures of this part.
    (d) The Operating Basis Earthquake is that earthquake which, 
considering the regional and local geology and seismology and specific 
characteristics of local subsurface material, could reasonably be 
expected to affect the plant site during the operating life of the 
plant; it is that earthquake which produces the vibratory ground motion 
for which those features of the nuclear power plant necessary for 
continued operation without undue risk to the health and safety of the 
public are designed to remain functional.
    (e) A fault is a tectonic structure along which differential 
slippage of the adjacent earth materials has occurred parallel to the 
fracture plane. It is distinct from other types of ground disruptions 
such as landslides, fissures, and craters. A fault may have gouge or 
breccia between its two walls and includes any associated monoclinal 
flexure or other similar geologic structural feature.
    (f) Surface faulting is differential ground displacement at or near 
the surface caused directly by fault movement and is distinct from 
nontectonic types of ground disruptions, such as landslides, fissures, 
and craters.
    (g) A capable fault is a fault which has exhibited one or more of 
the following characteristics:
    (1) Movement at or near the ground surface at least once within the 
past 35,000 years or movement of a recurring nature within the past 
500,000 years.
    (2) Macro-seismicity instrumentally determined with records of 
sufficient precision to demonstrate a direct relationship with the 
fault.
    (3) A structural relationship to a capable fault according to 
characteristics (1) or (2) of this paragraph such that movement on one 
could be reasonably expected to be accompanied by movement on the other.
    In some cases, the geologic evidence of past activity at or near the 
ground surface along a particular fault may be obscured at a particular 
site. This might occur, for example, at a site having a deep overburden. 
For these cases, evidence may exist elsewhere along the fault from which 
an evaluation of its characteristics in the vicinity of the site can be 
reasonably based. Such evidence shall be used in determining whether the 
fault is a capable fault within this definition.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs III(g) (1), (2) and (3), 
structural association of a fault with geologic structural features 
which are geologically old (at least pre-Quaternary) such as many of 
those found in the Eastern region of the United States shall, in the 
absence of conflicting evidence, demonstrate that the fault is not a 
capable fault within this definition.
    (h) A tectonic province is a region of the North American continent 
characterized by a relative consistency of the geologic structural 
features contained therein.

[[Page 669]]

    (i) A tectonic structure is a large scale dislocation or distortion 
within the earth's crust. Its extent is measured in miles.
    (j) A zone requiring detailed faulting investigation is a zone 
within which a nuclear power reactor may not be located unless a 
detailed investigation of the regional and local geologic and seismic 
characteristics of the site demonstrates that the need to design for 
surface faulting has been properly determined.
    (k) The control width of a fault is the maximum width of the zone 
containing mapped fault traces, including all faults which can be 
reasonably inferred to have experienced differential movement during 
Quaternary times and which join or can reasonably be inferred to join 
the main fault trace, measured within 10 miles along the fault's trend 
in both directions from the point of nearest approach to the site. (See 
Figure 1 of this appendix.)
    (l) A response spectrum is a plot of the maximum responses 
(acceleration, velocity or displacement) of a family of idealized 
single-degree-of-freedom damped oscillators against natural frequencies 
(or periods) of the oscillators to a specified vibratory motion input at 
their supports.

                       iv. required investigations

    The geologic, seismic and engineering characteristics of a site and 
its environs shall be investigated in sufficient scope and detail to 
provide reasonable assurance that they are sufficiently well understood 
to permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed site, and to provide 
sufficient information to support the determinations required by these 
criteria and to permit adequate engineering solutions to actual or 
potential geologic and seismic effects at the proposed site. The size of 
the region to be investigated and the type of data pertinent to the 
investigations shall be determined by the nature of the region 
surrounding the proposed site. The investigations shall be carried out 
by a review of the pertinent literature and field investigations and 
shall include the steps outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section.
    (a) Required Investigation for Vibratory Ground Motion. The purpose 
of the investigations required by this paragraph is to obtain 
information needed to describe the vibratory ground motion produced by 
the Safe Shutdown Earthquake. All of the steps in paragraphs (a)(5) 
through (a)(8) of this section need not be carried out if the Safe 
Shutdown Earthquake can be clearly established by investigations and 
determinations of a lesser scope. The investigations required by this 
paragraph provide an adequate basis for selection of an Operating Basis 
Earthquake. The investigations shall include the following:
    (1) Determination of the lithologic, stratigraphic, hydrologic, and 
structural geologic conditions of the site and the region surrounding 
the site, including its geologic history;
    (2) Identification and evaluation of tectonic structures underlying 
the site and the region surrounding the site, whether buried or 
expressed at the surface. The evaluation should consider the possible 
effects caused by man's activities such as withdrawal of fluid from or 
addition of fluid to the subsurface, extraction of minerals, or the 
loading effects of dams or reservoirs;
    (3) Evaluation of physical evidence concerning the behavior during 
prior earthquakes of the surficial geologic materials and the substrata 
underlying the site from the lithologic, stratigraphic, and structural 
geologic studies;
    (4) Determination of the static and dynamic engineering properties 
of the materials underlying the site. Included should be properties 
needed to determine the behavior of the underlying material during 
earthquakes and the characteristics of the underlying material in 
transmitting earthquake-induced motions to the foundations of the plant, 
such as seismic wave velocities, density, water content, porosity, and 
strength;
    (5) Listing of all historically reported earthquakes which have 
affected or which could reasonably be expected to have affected the 
site, including the date of occurrence and the following measured or 
estimated data: magnitude or highest intensity, and a plot of the 
epicenter or location of highest intensity. Where historically reported 
earthquakes could have caused a maximum ground acceleration of at least 
one-tenth the acceleration of gravity (0.1g) at the foundations of the 
proposed nuclear power plant structures, the acceleration or intensity 
and duration of ground shaking at these foundations shall also be 
estimated. Since earthquakes have been reported in terms of various 
parameters such as magnitude, intensity at a given location, and effect 
on ground, structures, and people at a specific location, some of these 
data may have to be estimated by use of appropriate empirical 
relationships. The comparative characteristics of the material 
underlying the epicentral location or region of highest intensity and of 
the material underlying the site in transmitting earthquake vibratory 
motion shall be considered;
    (6) Correlation of epicenters or locations of highest intensity of 
historically reported earthquakes, where possible, with tectonic 
structures any part of which is located within 200 miles of the site. 
Epicenters or locations of highest intensity which cannot be reasonably 
correlated with tectonic structures shall be identified with tectonic 
provinces any part of which is located within 200 miles of the site;

[[Page 670]]

    (7) For faults, any part of which is within 200 miles \2\ of the 
site and which may be of significance in establishing the Safe Shutdown 
Earthquake, determination of whether these faults are to be considered 
as capable faults. \3,4\ This determination is required in order to 
permit appropriate consideration of the geologic history of such faults 
in establishing the Safe Shutdown Earthquake. For guidance in 
determining which faults may be of significance in determining the Safe 
Shutdown Earthquake, table 1 of this appendix presents the minimum 
length of fault to be considered versus distance from site. Capable 
faults of lesser length than those indicated in table 1 and faults which 
are not capable faults need not be considered in determining the Safe 
Shutdown Earthquake, except where unusual circumstances indicate such 
consideration is appropriate;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ If the Safe Shutdown Earthquake can be associated with a fault 
closer than 200 miles to the site, the procedures of paragraphs (a)(7) 
and (a)(8) of this section need not be carried out for successively more 
remote faults.
    \3\ In the absence of absolute dating, evidence of recency of 
movement may be obtained by applying relative dating technique to 
ruptured, offset, warped or otherwise structurally disturbed surface or 
near surface materials or geomorphic features.
    \4\ The applicant shall evaluate whether or not a fault is a capable 
fault with respect to the characteristics outlined in paragraphs 
III(g)(1), (2), and (3) by conducting a reasonable investigation using 
suitable geologic and geophysical techniques.

                                                              length \1\

Shutdown Earthquake, determination of:

    (ii) The relationship of the fault to regional tectonic structures; 
and
    (iii) The nature, amount, and geologic history of displacements 
along the fault, including particularly the estimated amount of the 
maximum Quaternary displacement related to any one earthquake along the 
fault.
    (b) Required Investigation for Surface Faulting. The purpose of the 
investigations required by this paragraph is to obtain information to 
determine whether and to what extent the nuclear power plant need be 
designed for surface faulting. If the design basis for surface faulting 
can be clearly established by investigations of a lesser scope, not all 
of the steps in paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(7) of this section need be 
carried out. The investigations shall include the following:
    (1) Determination of the lithologic, stratigraphic, hydrologic, and 
structural geologic conditions of the site and the area surrounding the 
site, including its geologic history;
    (2) Evaluation of tectonic structures underlying the site, whether 
buried or expressed at the surface, with regard to their potential for 
causing surface displacement at or near the site. The evaluation shall 
consider the possible effects caused by man's activities such as 
withdrawal of fluid from or addition of fluid to the subsurface, 
extraction of minerals, or the loading effects of dams or reservoirs;
    (3) Determination of geologic evidence of fault offset at or near 
the ground surface at or near the site;
    (4) For faults greater than 1000 feet long, any part of which is 
within 5 miles \5\ of the site, determination of whether these faults 
are to be considered as capable faults; \6,7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ If the design basis for surface faulting can be determined from 
a fault closer than 5 miles to the site, the procedures of paragraphs 
(b)(4) through (b)(7) of this section need not be carried out for 
successively more remote faults.
    \6\ In the absence of absolute dating, evidence of recency of 
movement may be obtained by applying relative dating techniques to 
ruptured, offset, warped or otherwise structurally disturbed surface of 
near-surface materials or geomorphic features.
    \7\ The applicant shall evaluate whether or not a fault is a capable 
fault with respect to the characteristics outlined in paragraphs 
III(g)(1), (2), and (3) by conducting a reasonable investigation using 
suitable geological and geophysical techniques.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) Listing of all historically reported earthquakes which can 
reasonably be associated with capable faults greater than 1000 feet 
long, any part of which is within 5 miles \5\ of the site, including the 
date of occurrence and the following measured or estimated data: 
magnitude or highest intensity, and a plot of the epicenter or region of 
highest intensity;
    (6) Correlation of epicenters or locations of highest intensity of 
historically reported earthquakes with capable faults greater than 1000 
feet long, any part of which is located within 5 miles \5\ of the site;

[[Page 671]]

    (7) For capable faults greater than 1000 feet long, any part of 
which is within 5 miles \5\ of the site, determination of:
    (i) The length of the fault;
    (ii) The relationship of the fault to regional tectonic structures;
    (iii) The nature, amount, and geologic history of displacements 
along the fault, including particularly the estimated amount of the 
maximum Quaternary displacement related to any one earthquake along the 
fault; and
    (iv) The outer limits of the fault established by mapping Quaternary 
fault traces for 10 miles along its trend in both directions from the 
point of its nearest approach to the site.
    (c) Required Investigation for Seismically Induced Floods and Water 
Waves. (1) For coastal sites, the investigations shall include the 
determination of:
    (i) Information regarding distantly and locally generated waves or 
tsunami which have affected or could have affected the site. Available 
evidence regarding the runup and drawdown associated with historic 
tsunami in the same coastal region as the site shall also be included;
    (ii) Local features of coastal topography which might tend to modify 
tsunami runup or drawdown. Appropriate available evidence regarding 
historic local modifications in tsunami runup or drawndown at coastal 
locations having topography similar to that of the site shall also be 
obtained; and
    (iii) Appropriate geologic and seismic evidence to provide 
information for establishing the design basis for seismically induced 
floods or water waves from a local offshore earthquake, from local 
offshore effects of an onshore earthquake, or from coastal subsidence. 
This evidence shall be determined, to the extent practical, by a 
procedure similar to that required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section. The probable slip characteristics of offshore faults shall also 
be considered as well as the potential for offshore slides in submarine 
material.
    (2) For sites located near lakes and rivers, investigations similar 
to those required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be carried 
out, as appropriate, to determine the potential for the nuclear power 
plant to be exposed to seismically induced floods and water waves as, 
for example, from the failure during an earthquake of an upstream dam or 
from slides of earth or debris into a nearby lake.

                  v. seismic and geologic design bases

    (a) Determination of Design Basis for Vibratory Ground Motion. The 
design of each nuclear power plant shall take into account the potential 
effects of vibratory ground motion caused by earthquakes. The design 
basis for the maximum vibratory ground motion and the expected vibratory 
ground motion should be determined through evaluation of the seismology, 
geology, and the seismic and geologic history of the site and the 
surrounding region. The most severe earthquakes associated with tectonic 
structures or tectonic provinces in the region surrounding the site 
should be identified, considering those historically reported 
earthquakes that can be associated with these structures or provinces 
and other relevant factors. If faults in the region surrounding the site 
are capable faults, the most severe earthquakes associated with these 
faults should be determined by also considering their geologic history. 
The vibratory ground motion at the site should be then determined by 
assuming that the epicenters or locations of highest intensity of the 
earthquakes are situated at the point on the tectonic structures or 
tectonic provinces nearest to the site. The earthquake which could cause 
the maximum vibratory ground motion at the site should be designated the 
Safe Shutdown Earthquake. The specific procedures for determining the 
design basis for vibratory ground motion are given in the following 
paragraphs.
    (1) Determination of Safe Shutdown Earthquake. The Safe Shutdown 
Earthquake shall be identified through evaluation of seismic and 
geologic information developed pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 
IV(a), as follows:
    (i) The historic earthquakes of greatest magnitude or intensity 
which have been correlated with tectonic structures pursuant to the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(6) of section IV shall be determined. In 
addition, for capable faults, the information required by paragraph 
(a)(8) of section IV shall also be taken into account in determining the 
earthquakes of greatest magnitude related to the faults. The magnitude 
or intensity of earthquakes based on geologic evidence may be larger 
than that of the maximum earthquakes historically recorded. The 
accelerations at the site shall be determined assuming that the 
epicenters of the earthquakes of greatest magnitude or the locations of 
highest intensity related to the tectonic structures are situated at the 
point on the structures closest to the site;
    (ii) Where epicenters or locations of highest intensity of 
historically reported earthquakes cannot be reasonably related to 
tectonic structures but are identified pursuant to the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(6) of section IV with tectonic provinces in which the site 
is located, the accelerations at the site shall be determined assuming 
that these earthquakes occur at the site;
    (iii) Where epicenters or locations of the highest intensity of 
historically reported earthquakes cannot be reasonably related to 
tectonic structures but are identified pursuant to the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(6) of section IV with tectonic provinces in

[[Page 672]]

which the site is not located, the accelerations at the site shall be 
determined assuming that the epicenters or locations of highest 
intensity of these earthquakes are at the closest point to the site on 
the boundary of the tectonic province;
    (iv) The earthquake producing the maximum vibratory acceleration at 
the site, as determined from paragraph (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this 
section shall be designated the Safe Shutdown Earthquake for vibratory 
ground motion, except as noted in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section. 
The characteristics of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake shall be derived 
from more than one earthquake determined from paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
through (iii) of this section, where necessary to assure that the 
maximum vibratory acceleration at the site throughout the frequency 
range of interest is included. In the case where a causative fault is 
near the site, the effect of proximity of an earthquake on the spectral 
characteristics of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake shall be taken into 
account. The procedures in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii) of 
this section shall be applied in a conservative manner. The 
determinations carried out in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and 
(a)(1)(iii) shall assure that the safe shutdown earthquake intensity is, 
as a minimum, equal to the maximum historic earthquake intensity 
experienced within the tectonic province in which the site is located. 
In the event that geological and seismological data warrant, the Safe 
Shutdown Earthquake shall be larger than that derived by use of the 
procedures set forth in section IV and V of the appendix. The maximum 
vibratory accelerations of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake at each of the 
various foundation locations of the nuclear power plant structures at a 
given site shall be determined taking into account the characteristics 
of the underlying soil material in transmitting the earthquake-induced 
motions, obtained pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (3), and (4) of section 
IV. The Safe Shutdown Earthquake shall be defined by response spectra 
corresponding to the maximum vibratory accelerations as outlined in 
paragraph (a) of section VI; and
    (v) Where the maximum vibratory accelerations of the Safe Shutdown 
Earthquake at the foundations of the nuclear power plant structures are 
determined to be less than one-tenth the acceleration of gravity (0.1 g) 
as a result of the steps required in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) 
of this section, it shall be assumed that the maximum vibratory 
accelerations of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake at these foundations are 
at least 0.1 g.
    (2) Determination of Operating Basis Earthquake. The Operating Basis 
Earthquake shall be specified by the applicant after considering the 
seismology and geology of the region surrounding the site. If vibratory 
ground motion exceeding that of the Operating Basis Earthquake occurs, 
shutdown of the nuclear power plant will be required. Prior to resuming 
operations, the licensee will be required to demonstrate to the 
Commission that no functional damage has occurred to those features 
necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health and 
safety of the public.
    The maximum vibratory ground acceleration of the Operating Basis 
Earthquake shall be at least one-half the maximum vibratory ground 
acceleration of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake.
    (b) Determination of Need to Design for Surface Faulting. In order 
to determine whether a nuclear power plant is required to be designed to 
withstand the effects of surface faulting, the location of the nuclear 
power plant with respect to capable faults shall be considered. The area 
over which each of these faults has caused surface faulting in the past 
is identified by mapping its fault traces in the vicinity of the site. 
The fault traces are mapped along the trend of the fault for 10 miles in 
both directions from the point of its nearest approach to the nuclear 
power plant because, for example, traces may be obscured along portions 
of the fault. The maximum width of the mapped fault traces, called the 
control width, is then determined from this map. Because surface 
faulting has sometimes occurred beyond the limit of mapped fault traces 
or where fault traces have not been previously recognized, the control 
width of the fault is increased by a factor which is dependent upon the 
largest potential earthquake related to the fault. This larger width 
delineates a zone, called the zone requiring detailed faulting 
investigation, in which the possibility of surface faulting is to be 
determined. The following paragraphs outline the specific procedures for 
determining the zone requiring detailed faulting investigation for a 
capable fault.
    (1) Determination of Zone Requiring Detailed Faulting Investigation. 
The zone requiring detailed faulting investigation for a capable fault 
which was investigated pursuant to the requirement of paragraph (b)(7) 
of section IV shall be determined through use of the following table:

Table 2--Determination of Zone Requiring Detailed Faulting Investigation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Width of zone requiring
          Magnitude of earthquake                 detailed faulting
                                             investigation (See fig. 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Less than 5.5.............................  1xcontrol width.
5.5-6.4...................................  2xcontrol width.
6.5-7.5...................................  3xcontrol width.
Greater than 7.5..........................  4xcontrol width.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The largest magnitude earthquake related to the fault shall be used 
in table 2. This

[[Page 673]]

earthquake shall be determined from the information developed pursuant 
to the requirements of paragraph (b) of Section IV for the fault, taking 
into account the information required by paragraph (b)(7) of section IV. 
The control width used in table 2 is determined by mapping the outer 
limits of the fault traces from information developed pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of section IV. The control width shall be used in 
table 2 unless the characteristics of the fault are obscured for a 
significant portion of the 10 miles on either side of the point of 
nearest approach to the nuclear power plant. In this event, the use in 
table 2 of the width of mapped fault traces more than 10 miles from the 
point of nearest approach to the nuclear power plant may be appropriate.
    The zone requiring detailed faulting investigation, as determined 
from table 2, shall be used for the fault except where:
    (i) The zone requiring detailed faulting investigation from table 2 
is less than one-half mile in width. In this case the zone shall be at 
least one-half mile in width; or
    (ii) Definitive evidence concerning the regional and local 
characteristics of the fault justifies use of a different value. For 
example, thrust or bedding-plane faults may require an increase in width 
of the zone to account for the projected dip of the fault plane; or
    (iii) More detailed three-dimensional information, such as that 
obtained from precise investigative techniques, may justify the use of a 
narrower zone. Possible examples of such techniques are the use of 
accurate records from closely spaced drill holes or from closely spaced, 
high-resolution offshore geophysical surveys.
    In delineating the zone requiring detailed faulting investigation 
for a fault, the center of the zone shall coincide with the center of 
the fault at the point of nearest approach of the fault to the nuclear 
power plant as illustrated in figure 1.
    (c) Determination of Design Bases for Seismically Induced Floods and 
Water Waves. The size of seismically induced floods and water waves 
which could affect a site from either locally or distantly generated 
seismic activity shall be determined, taking into consideration the 
results of the investigation required by paragraph (c) of section IV. 
Local topographic characteristics which might tend to modify the 
possible runup and drawdown at the site shall be considered. Adverse 
tide conditions shall also be taken into account in determining the 
effect of the floods and waves on the site. The characteristics of the 
earthquake to be used in evaluating the offshore effects of local 
earthquakes shall be determined by a procedure similar to that used to 
determine the characteristics of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake in 
paragraph V(a).
    (d) Determination of Other Design Conditions--(1) Soil Stability. 
Vibratory ground motion associated with the Safe Shutdown Earthquake can 
cause soil instability due to ground disruption such as fissuring, 
differential consolidation, liquefaction, and cratering which is not 
directly related to surface faulting. The following geologic features 
which could affect the foundations of the proposed nuclear power plant 
structures shall be evaluated, taking into account the information 
concerning the physical properties of materials underlying the site 
developed pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (3), and (4) of section IV and 
the effects of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake:
    (i) Areas of actual or potential surface or subsurface subsidence, 
uplift, or collapse resulting from:
    (a) Natural features such as tectonic depressions and cavernous or 
karst terrains, particularly those underlain by calcareous or other 
soluble deposits;
    (b) Man's activities such as withdrawal of fluid from or addition of 
fluid to the subsurface, extraction of minerals, or the loading effects 
of dams or reservoirs; and
    (c) Regional deformation.
    (ii) Deformational zones such as shears, joints, fractures, folds, 
or combinations of these features.
    (iii) Zones of alteration or irregular weathering profiles and zones 
of structural weakness composed of crushed or disturbed materials.
    (iv) Unrelieved residual stresses in bedrock.
    (v) Rocks or soils that might be unstable because of their 
mineralogy, lack of consolidation, water content, or potentially 
undesirable response to seismic or other events. Seismic response 
characteristics to be considered shall include liquefaction, thixotropy, 
differential consolidation, cratering, and fissuring.
    (2) Slope stability. Stability of all slopes, both natural and 
artificial, the failure of which could adversely affect the nuclear 
power plant, shall be considered. An assessment shall be made of the 
potential effects of erosion or deposition and of combinations of 
erosion or deposition with seismic activity, taking into account 
information concerning the physical property of the materials underlying 
the site developed pursuant to paragraph (a)(1), (3), and (4) of section 
IV and the effects of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake.
    (3) Cooling water supply. Assurance of adequate cooling water supply 
for emergency and long-term shutdown decay heat removal shall be 
considered in the design of the nuclear power plant, taking in to 
account information concerning the physical properties of the materials 
underlying the site developed pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (3), and 
(4) of section IV and the effects of the Safe

[[Page 674]]

Shutdown Earthquake and the design basis for surface faulting. 
Consideration of river blockage or diversion or other failures which may 
block the flow of cooling water, coastal uplift or subsidence, or 
tsunami runup and drawdown, and failure of dams and intake structures 
shall be included in the evaluation, where appropriate.
    (4) Distant structures. Those structures which are not located in 
the immediate vicinity of the site but which are safety related shall be 
designed to withstand the effect of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake and the 
design basis for surface faulting determined on a comparable basis to 
that of the nuclear power plant, taking into account the material 
underlying the structures and the different location with respect to 
that of the site.

                  vi. application to engineering design

    (a) Vibratory ground motion--(1) Safe Shutdown Earthquake. The 
vibratory ground motion produced by the Safe Shutdown Earthquake shall 
be defined by response spectra corresponding to the maximum vibratory 
accelerations at the elevations of the foundations of the nuclear power 
plant structures determine pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of section V. 
The response spectra shall relate the response of the foundations of the 
nuclear power plant structures to the vibratory ground motion, 
considering such foundations to be single-degree-of-freedom damped 
oscillators and neglecting soil-structure interaction effects. In view 
of the limited data available on vibratory ground motions of strong 
earthquakes, it usually will be appropriate that the response spectra be 
smoothed design spectra developed from a series of response spectra 
related to the vibratory motions caused by more than one earthquake.
    The nuclear power plant shall be designed so that, if the Safe 
Shutdown Earthquake occurs, certain structures, systems, and components 
will remain functional. These structures, systems, and components are 
those necessary to assure (i) the integrity of the reactor coolant 
pressure boundary, (ii) the capability to shut down the reactor and 
maintain it in a safe condition, or (iii) the capability to prevent or 
mitigate the consequences of accidents which could result in potential 
offsite exposures comparable to the guideline exposures of this part. In 
addition to seismic loads, including aftershocks, applicable concurrent 
functional and accident-induced loads shall be taken into account in the 
design of these safety-related structures, systems, and components. The 
design of the nuclear power plant shall also take into account the 
possible effects of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake on the facility 
foundations by ground disruption, such as fissuring, differential 
consolidation, cratering, liquefaction, and landsliding, as required in 
paragraph (d) of section V.
    The engineering method used to insure that the required safety 
functions are maintained during and after the vibratory ground motion 
associated with the Safe Shutdown Earthquake shall involve the use of 
either a suitable dynamic analysis or a suitable qualification test to 
demonstrate that structures, systems and components can withstand the 
seismic and other concurrent loads, except where it can be demonstrated 
that the use of an equivalent static load method provides adequate 
conservatism.
    The analysis or test shall take into account soil-structure 
interaction effects and the expected duration of vibratory motion. It is 
permissible to design for strain limits in excess of yield strain in 
some of these safety-related structures, systems, and components during 
the Safe Shutdown Earthquake and under the postulated concurrent 
conditions, provided that the necessary safety functions are maintained.
    (2) Operating Basis Earthquake. The Operating Basis Earthquake shall 
be defined by response spectra. All structures, systems, and components 
of the nuclear power plant necessary for continued operation without 
undue risk to the health and safety of the public shall be designed to 
remain functional and within applicable stress and deformation limits 
when subjected to the effects of the vibratory motion of the Operating 
Basis Earthquake in combination with normal operating loads. The 
engineering method used to insure that these structures, systems, and 
components are capable of withstanding the effects of the Operating 
Basis Earthquake shall involve the use of either a suitable dynamic 
analysis or a suitable qualification test to demonstrate that the 
structures, systems and components can withstand the seismic and other 
concurrent loads, except where it can be demonstrated that the use of an 
equivalent static load method provides adequate conservatism. The 
analysis or test shall take into account soil-structure interaction 
effects and the expected duration of vibratory motion.
    (3) Required Seismic instrumentation. Suitable instrumentation shall 
be provided so that the seismic response of nuclear power plant features 
important to safety can be determined promptly to permit comparison of 
such response with that used as the design basis. Such a comparison is 
needed to decide whether the plant can continue to be operated safely 
and to permit such timely action as may be appropriate.
    These criteria do not address the need for instrumentation that 
would automatically shut down a nuclear power plant when an earthquake 
occurs which exceeds a predetermined intensity. The need for such 
instrumentation is under consideration.

[[Page 675]]

    (b) Surface Faulting. (1) If the nuclear power plant is to be 
located within the zone requiring detailed faulting investigation, a 
detailed investigation of the regional and local geologic and seismic 
characteristics of the site shall be carried out to determine the need 
to take into account surface faulting in the design of the nuclear power 
plant. Where it is determined that surface faulting need not be taken 
into account, sufficient data to clearly justify the determination shall 
be presented in the license application.
    (2) Where it is determined that surface faulting must be taken into 
account, the applicant shall, in establishing the design basis for 
surface faulting on a site take into account evidence concerning the 
regional and local geologic and seismic characteristics of the site and 
from any other relevant data.
    (3) The design basis for surface faulting shall be taken into 
account in the design of the nuclear power plant by providing reasonable 
assurance that in the event of such displacement during faulting certain 
structures, systems, and components will remain functional. These 
structures, systems, and components are those necessary to assure (i) 
the integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, (ii) the 
capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown 
condition, or (iii) the capability to prevent or mitigate the 
consequences of accidents which could result in potential offsite 
exposures comparable to the guideline exposures of this part. In 
addition to seismic loads, including aftershocks, applicable concurrent 
functional and accident-induced loads shall be taken into account in the 
design of such safety features. The design provisions shall be based on 
an assumption that the design basis for surface faulting can occur in 
any direction and azimuth and under any part of the nuclear power plant 
unless evidence indicates this assumption is not appropriate, and shall 
take into account the estimated rate at which the surface faulting may 
occur.
    (c) Seismically Induced Floods and Water Waves and Other Design 
Conditions. The design basis for seismically induced floods and water 
waves from either locally or distantly generated seismic activity and 
other design conditions determined pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
section V, shall be taken into account in the design of the nuclear 
power plant so as to prevent undue risk to the health and safety of the 
public.

Sec. 110.20  General license information.

    (a) A person may use an NRC general license as authority to export 
or import nuclear equipment or material, if the nuclear equipment or 
material to be exported or imported is covered by the NRC general 
licenses described in

[[Page 687]]

Sec. Sec. 110.21 through 110.27. If an export or import is not covered 
by the NRC general licenses described in Sec. Sec. 110.21 through 
110.27, a person must file an application with the Commission for a 
specific license in accordance with Sec. Sec. 110.31 through 110.32.
    (b) In response to a petition or on its own initiative, the 
Commission may issue a general license for export or import if it 
determines that any exports or imports made under the general license 
will not be inimical to the common defense and security or constitute an 
unreasonable risk to the public health and safety and otherwise meet 
applicable statutory requirements. A general license is issued as a 
regulation after a rulemaking proceeding under subpart K of this part. 
Issuance of a general license is coordinated with the Executive Branch.
    (c) A general license does not relieve a person from complying with 
the regulations of other Government agencies applicable to exports or 
imports under their authority.
    (d) A general license for export may not be used if the exporter 
knows, or has reason to believe, that the material will be used in any 
illegal activity or any activity related to isotope separation, chemical 
reprocessing, heavy water production or the fabrication of nuclear fuel 
containing plutonium, unless these activities are generically authorized 
under an appropriate agreement for cooperation.
    (e) A person who uses an NRC general license as the authority to 
export or import may cite on the shipping documents the section of this 
part which authorizes the described export or import under general 
license, as a means of expediting U.S. Customs Service's processing of 
the shipment.
    (f) As specified in Sec. Sec. 110.21 through 110.26, 110.28, 
110.29, and 110.30 only certain countries are eligible recipients of 
equipment or material under NRC general licenses to export. The 
Commission will closely monitor these countries and may at any time 
remove a country from a general license in response to significant 
adverse developments in the country involved. A key factor in this 
regard is the nonproliferation credentials of the importing country.

Sec. 110.42  Export licensing criteria.

    (a) The review of license applications for export for peaceful 
nuclear uses of production or utilization facilities \1\ or for export 
for peaceful nuclear uses of special nuclear or source material 
requiring a specific license under this part is governed by the 
following criteria:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Exports of nuclear reactors, reactor pressure vessels, reactor 
primary coolant pumps, ``on-line'' reactor fuel charging and discharging 
machines, and complete reactor control rod systems, as specified in 
paragraphs (1) through (4) of appendix A to this part, are subject to 
the export licensing criteria in Sec. 110.42(a). Exports of nuclear 
reactor components, as specified in paragraphs (5) through (9) of 
appendix A to this part, when exported separately from the items 
described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of appendix A of this part, are 
subject to the export licensing criteria in Sec. 110.42(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) IAEA safeguards as required by Article III (2) of the NPT will 
be applied with respect to any such facilities or material proposed to 
be exported, to any such material or facilities previously exported and 
subject to the applicable agreement for cooperation, and to any special 
nuclear material used in or produced through the use thereof.
    (2) No such material or facilities proposed to be exported or 
previously exported and subject to the applicable agreement for 
cooperation, and no special nuclear material produced through the use of 
such material or facilities, will be used for any nuclear explosive 
device or for research on or development of any nuclear explosive 
device.
    (3) Adequate physical security measures will be maintained with 
respect to such material or facilities proposed to be exported and to 
any special nuclear material used in or produced through the use 
thereof. Physical security measures will be deemed adequate if such 
measures provide a level of protection equivalent to that set forth in 
Sec. 110.44.
    (4) No such material or facilities proposed to be exported, and no 
special nuclear material produced through the use of such material, will 
be retransferred to the jurisdiction of any other country or group of 
countries unless the prior approval of the United States is obtained for 
such retransfer.
    (5) No such material proposed to be exported and no special nuclear 
material produced through the use of such material will be reprocessed, 
and no irradiated fuel elements containing such material removed from a 
reactor will be altered in form or content, unless the prior approval of 
the United States is obtained for such reprocessing or alteration.
    (6) With respect to exports of such material or facilities to 
nonnuclear weapon states, IAEA safeguards will be maintained with 
respect to all peaceful activities in, under the jurisdiction of, or 
carried out under the control of such state at the time of export. This 
criterion will not be applied if the Commission has been notified by the 
President in writing that failure to approve an export because this 
criterion has not been met would be seriously prejudicial to the 
achievement of United States nonproliferation objectives or otherwise 
jeopardize the common defense and security, in which case the provisions 
of section 128 of the Atomic Energy Act regarding Congressional review 
will apply.
    (7) The proposed export of a facility or of more than 0.003 
effective kilograms of special nuclear material, other than plutonium 
containing 80 percent or more by weight of plutonium-238, would be under 
the terms of an agreement for cooperation.
    (8) The proposed export is not inimical to the common defense and 
security and, in the case of facility exports, does not constitute an 
unreasonable risk to the public health and safety in the United States.
    (9)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section, 
with respect to exports of high-enriched uranium to be used as a fuel or 
target in a nuclear research or test reactor, the Commission determines 
that:
    (A) There is no alternative nuclear reactor fuel or target enriched 
to less than 20 percent in the isotope U-235 that can be used in that 
reactor;
    (B) The proposed recipient of the uranium has provided assurances 
that, whenever an alternative nuclear reactor fuel or target can be used 
in that reactor, it will use that alternative

[[Page 695]]

fuel or target in lieu of highly-enriched uranium; and
    (C) The United States Government is actively developing an 
alternative nuclear reactor fuel or target that can be used in that 
reactor.
    (ii) With regard to a Recipient Country, the Commission may issue a 
license authorizing the export of high-enriched uranium for medical 
isotope production, including shipment to and use at intermediate and 
ultimate consignees, if the Commission determines that:
    (A) The Recipient Country that supplies an assurance letter to the 
United States Government in connection with the consideration by the 
Commission of the export license application has informed the United 
States Government that any intermediate consignees and the ultimate 
consignee specified in the export license application are required to 
use the high-enriched uranium solely for the production of medical 
isotopes; and
    (B) The high-enriched uranium will be irradiated only in a reactor 
in the Recipient Country that--
    (1) Uses an alternative nuclear fuel; or
    (2) Is the subject of an agreement with the United States Government 
to convert to an alternative nuclear reactor fuel when alternative 
nuclear reactor fuel can be used in the reactor.
    (iii) A fuel or target ``can be used'' in a nuclear research or test 
reactor if--
    (A) The fuel or target has been qualified by the Reduced Enrichment 
Research and Test Reactor Program of the Department of Energy; and
    (B) Use of the fuel or target will permit the large majority of 
ongoing and planned experiments and isotope production to be conducted 
in the reactor without a large percentage increase in the total cost of 
operating the reactor.
    (b) The review of license applications for the export of nuclear 
equipment, other than a production or utilization facility, and for 
deuterium and nuclear grade graphite for nuclear end use, is governed by 
the following criteria:
    (1) IAEA safeguards as required by Article III (2) of the NPT will 
be applied with respect to such equipment or material.
    (2) No such equipment or material will be used for any nuclear 
explosive device or for research on or development of any nuclear 
explosive device.
    (3) No such equipment or material will be retransferred to the 
jurisdiction of any other country or group of countries without the 
prior consent of the United States.
    (4) The proposed export is not inimical to the common defense and 
security.
    (c) Except where paragraph (d) is applicable, the review of license 
applications for export of byproduct material or for export of source 
material for non-nuclear end uses requiring a specific license under 
this part is governed by the criterion that the proposed export is not 
inimical to the common defense and security.
    (d) The review of license applications for the export of radioactive 
waste requiring a specific license under this part is governed by the 
following criteria:
    (1) The proposed export is not inimical to the common defense and 
security.
    (2) The receiving country, after being advised of the information 
required by Sec. 110.32(f)(5), finds that it has the administrative and 
technical capacity and regulatory structure to manage and dispose of the 
waste and consents to the receipt of the radioactive waste. In the case 
of radioactive waste containing a nuclear material to which paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this section is applicable, the criteria in this paragraph 
(d) shall be in addition to the criteria provided in paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this section.
    (e) In making its findings under paragraphs (a)(8) and (c) of this 
section for proposed exports of radioactive material listed in Appendix 
P to this part, the NRC shall consider:
    (1) Whether the foreign recipient is authorized based on the 
authorization or confirmation required by Sec. 110.32(h) to receive and 
possess the material under the laws and regulations of the importing 
country;
    (2) Whether the importing country has the appropriate technical and 
administrative capability, resources and regulatory structure to manage 
the material in a safe and secure manner;

[[Page 696]]

    (3) For proposed exports of Category 1 amounts of radioactive 
material listed in Table 1 of Appendix P to this part, whether the 
government of the importing country provides consent to the United 
States Government for the import of the material;
    (4) In cases where the importing country does not have the technical 
and administrative capability described in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, and in cases where there is insufficient evidence of the 
recipient's authorization to receive and possess the material to be 
exported, described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, whether 
exceptional circumstances exist, and if so, whether the export should be 
licensed in light of those exceptional circumstances and the risks, if 
any, to the common defense and security of the proposed export;
    (5) For proposed exports under exceptional circumstances of Category 
1 or Category 2 amounts of radioactive material listed in Table 1 of 
Appendix P to this part, whether the government of the importing country 
provides consent to the United States Government for the import of the 
material;
    (6) For proposed exports of radioactive material listed in Table 1 
of Appendix P to this part under the exceptional circumstance in which 
there is a considerable health or medical need as acknowledged by the 
U.S. Government and the importing country, whether the United States and 
the importing country have, to the extent practicable, made arrangements 
for the safe and secure management of the radioactive sources during and 
at the end of their useful life;
    (7) Based upon the available information, whether the foreign 
recipient has engaged in clandestine or illegal procurement of 
radioactive material listed in Table 1 of Appendix P to the part;
    (8) Based upon available information, whether an import or export

Sec. 110.45  Issuance or denial of licenses.

    (a) The Commission will issue an export license if it has been 
notified by the State Department that it is the judgment of the 
Executive Branch that the proposed export will not be inimical to the 
common defense and security, and:
    (1) Finds, based upon a reasonable judgment of the assurances 
provided and other information available to the Federal government, that 
the applicable criteria in Sec. 110.42, or their equivalent, are met.
    (2) Finds that there are no material changed circumstances 
associated with an export license application (except for byproduct 
material applications) from those existing at the time of issuance of a 
prior license to export to the same country, if the prior license was 
issued under the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) The Commission will issue an import license if it finds that:
    (1) The proposed import will not be inimical to the common defense 
and security;
    (2) The proposed import will not constitute an unreasonable risk to 
the public health and safety;
    (3) The requirements of subpart A of part 51 of this chapter (to the 
extent applicable to the proposed import) have been satisfied; and
    (4) With respect to a proposed import of radioactive waste, an 
appropriate facility has agreed to accept and is authorized to posses 
the waste for management or disposal as confirmed by NRC consultations 
with, as applicable, the Agreement State(s) in which the facility is 
located and the low-level waste compact commission(s).
    (c) With respect to a proposed import of radioactive material listed 
in Table 1 of Appendix P to this part:
    (1) If the Commission authorizes a proposed import of Category 1 or 
Category 2 amounts of radioactive material, it will take appropriate 
steps to ensure that a copy of the recipient authorization, or 
confirmation by the U.S. Government that the recipient is authorized to 
receive and possess the source or sources to be exported, is provided to 
the Government of the exporting country or to the exporting facility.
    (2) If the Commission authorizes a proposed import of Category 1 
amounts of radioactive material, it will take appropriate steps to 
ensure that a copy of the consent of the United States Government to the 
import is provided to the government of the exporting country in cases 
where it is requested by such government.
    (d) If, after receiving the Executive Branch judgment that the 
issuance of a proposed export license will not be inimical to the common 
defense and security, the Commission does not issue the proposed license 
on a timely basis because it is unable to make the statutory 
determinations required under the Atomic Energy Act, the Commission will 
publicly issue a decision to that effect and will submit the license 
application to the President. The Commission's decision will include an 
explanation of the basis for the decision and any dissenting or separate 
views. The provisions in this paragraph do not

[[Page 698]]

apply to Commission decisions regarding applications for specific 
licenses to export byproduct material, including radioactive material 
listed in Table 1 of appendix P to this part, or radioactive waste.
    (e) The Commission will deny: (1) Any export license application for 
which the Executive Branch judgment does not recommend approval; (2) any 
byproduct material export license application for which the Commission 
is unable to make the finding in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or 
(3) any import license application for which the Commission is unable to 
make the finding in paragraph (b) of this section. The applicant will be 
notified in writing of the reason for denial.

Sec. 110.84  Commission action on a hearing request or intervention 
petition.

    (a) In an export licensing proceeding, or in an import licensing 
proceeding in which a hearing request or intervention petition does not 
assert or establish an interest which may be affected, the Commission 
will consider:
    (1) Whether a hearing would be in the public interest; and
    (2) Whether a hearing would assist the Commission in making the 
statutory determinations required by the Atomic Energy Act.
    (b) If a hearing request or intervention petition asserts an 
interest which may be affected, the Commission will consider:
    (1) The nature of the alleged interest;
    (2) How that interest relates to issuance or denial; and
    (3) The possible effect of any order on that interest, including 
whether the relief requested is within the Commission's authority, and, 
if so, whether granting relief would redress the alleged injury.
    (c) Untimely hearing requests or intervention petitions may be 
denied unless good cause for failure to file on time is established. In 
reviewing untimely requests or petitions, the Commission will also 
consider:
    (1) The availability of other means by which the requestor's or 
petitioner's interest, if any, will be protected or represented by other 
participants in a hearing; and
    (2) The extent to which the issues will be broadened or action on 
the application delayed.
    (d) Before granting or denying a hearing request or intervention 
petition, the Commission will review the Executive Branch's views on the 
license application and may request further information from the 
petitioner, requester, the Commission staff, the Executive Branch or 
others.
    (e) The Commission will deny a request or petition that pertains 
solely to matters outside its jurisdiction.
    (f) If an issue has been adequately explored in a previous licensing 
hearing conducted pursuant to this part, a request for a new hearing in 
connection with that issue will be denied unless:
    (1) A hearing request or intervention petition establishes that an 
interest may be affected; or
    (2) The Commission determines that changed circumstances or new 
information warrant a new hearing.
    (g) After consideration of the factors covered by paragraphs (a) 
through (f), the Commission will issue a notice or order granting or 
denying a hearing request or intervention petition. Upon the affirmative 
vote of two Commissioners a hearing will be ordered. A notice granting a 
hearing will be published in the Federal Register and will specify 
whether the hearing will be oral or consist of written comments. A 
denial notice will set forth the reasons for denial.

   Subpart J_Special Procedures for Classified Information in Hearings


<R05>
Sec. 110.120  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart contains special procedures concerning access to, 
and introduction of, classified information into hearings under this 
part.
    (b) These procedures do not in any way apply to classified 
information exchanged between the Executive Branch and the Commission 
not introduced into a hearing. Such information will be declassified to 
the maximum extent feasible. The public statements of the Commission 
staff and Executive Branch will, to the extent consistent with 
classification requirements, reflect consideration of any such 
classified information.


<R05>
Sec. 110.121  Security clearances and access to classified information.

    (a) No person without a security clearance will have access to 
classified information.
    (b) Only the Commission will act upon an application for access to 
classified information.
    (c) To the extent practicable, applications for access to classified 
information shall describe the information to which access is desired 
and its level of classification (confidential, secret or other); the 
reasons for requesting access; the names of individuals for whom access 
is requested; and the reasons why access is requested for those 
individuals.
    (d) The Commission will consider requests for appropriate security 
clearances in reasonable numbers; conduct its review and grant or deny 
these in accordance with part 10 of this chapter; and make a reasonable 
charge to cover costs.
    (e) The Commission will not grant security clearances for access to 
classified information, unless it determines that the available 
unclassified information is inadequate on the subject matter involved.
    (f) When an application demonstrates that access to classified 
information not introduced into a hearing may be needed to prepare a 
participant's position on the hearing issues, the Commission may issue 
an order granting access to this information to the participant, his 
authorized representative or other persons. Access will be subject to 
the conditions in paragraphs (e) and (j) and will not be granted unless 
required security clearances have been obtained.
    (g) Once classified information has been introduced into a hearing, 
the Commission will grant access to a participant, his authorized 
representative or such other persons as the Commission determines may be 
needed by the participant to prepare his position on the hearing issues. 
Access will be subject to the conditions in paragraphs (e) and (j) of 
this section and will not be granted unless required security clearances 
have been obtained.
    (h) For good cause, the Commission may postpone action upon an 
application for access to classified information.
    (i) The Commission will grant access to classified information only 
up to the level for which the persons described in paragraphs (f) and 
(g) of this section

[[Page 711]]

are cleared and only upon an adequate commitment by them not to disclose 
such information subject to penalties as provided by law.
    (j) The Commission will not in any circumstances grant access to 
classified information:
    (1) Unless it determines that the grant is not inimical to the 
common defense and security; and
    (2) Which it has received from another Government agency, without 
the prior consent of the originating agency.
    (k) Upon completion of a hearing, the Commission will terminate all 
security clearances granted pursuant to the hearing and may require the 
disposal of classified information to which access has been granted or 
the observance of other procedures to safeguard this information.


<R05>
Sec. 110.122  Classification assistance.

    On the request of any hearing participant or the presiding officer 
(if other than the Commission), the Commission will designate a 
representative to advise and assist the presiding officer or the 
participants with respect to security classification of information and 
the protective requirements to be observed.


<R05>
Sec. 110.123  Notice of intent to introduce classified information.

    (a) A participant shall seek the required security clearances, where 
necessary, and file with the Secretary a notice of intent to introduce 
classified information into a hearing at the earliest possible time 
after the notice of hearing.
    (b) If a participant has not filed a notice of intent in accordance 
with this section, he may introduce classified information only if he 
gives to the other participants and the Commission prompt written notice 
of intent and only as permitted by the Commission when it determines 
that the public interest will not be prejudiced.
    (c) The notice of intent shall be unclassified and, to the extent 
consistent with classification requirements, state:
    (1) The subject matter of the classified information, which it is 
anticipated will be involved;
    (2) The highest level of classification of the information 
(confidential, secret or other);
    (3) When it is anticipated that the information would be introduced; 
and
    (4) The relevance and materiality of the information to the hearing 
issues.


<R05>
Sec. 110.124  Rearrangement or suspension of a hearing.

    When a participant gives notice of intent to introduce classified 
information and other participants do not have the required security 
clearances, subject to Sec. 110.121, the Commission may:
    (a) Suspend or rearrange the normal order of the hearing to give 
other participants an opportunity to obtain the required security 
clearances with minimum delay in the conduct of the hearing; or
    (b) Take such other action as it determines to be in the public 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 110.125  Unclassified statements required.

    (a) It is the obligation of hearing participants to introduce 
information in unclassified form wherever possible, and to declassify, 
to the maximum extent feasible, any classified information introduced 
into the hearing. This obligation rests on each participant whether or 
not any other participant has the required security clearances.
    (b) When classified information is offered for introduction into a 
hearing:
    (1) The participant offering it shall, to the extent consistent with 
classification requirements, submit to the presiding officer and other 
participants an unclassified statement describing the substance of the 
classified information as accurately and completely as possible;
    (2) In accordance with procedures agreed upon by the participants or 
prescribed by the presiding officer, and after notice to all 
participants and opportunity to be heard on the notice, the presiding 
officer will determine whether an unclassified statement may be 
substituted for the classified information in the hearing record without 
prejudice to the interest of any participant or the public;

[[Page 712]]

    (3) If the Commission determines that the unclassified statement 
(together with such unclassified modifications as it finds are necessary 
or appropriate to protect the interest of other participants and the 
public) adequately sets forth information in the classified matter which 
is relevant and material to the issues in the hearing, it will direct 
that the classified matter be excluded from the record of the hearing; 
and
    (4) The Commission may postpone any of the procedures in this 
section until all other evidence has been received. However, a 
participant shall not postpone service of any unclassified statement 
required in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 110.126  Protection of classified information.

    Nothing in this subpart shall relieve any person from safeguarding 
classified information as required by law and rules, regulations or 
orders of any Government agency.

<R05>
    Sec. Appendix B to Part 110--Illustrative List of Gas Centrifuge 
   Enrichment Plant Components Under NRC's Export Licensing Authority

    1. Assemblies and components especially designed or prepared for use 
in gas centrifuges.

    Note: The gas centrifuge normally consists of a thin-walled 
cylinder(s) of between 75mm (3 ins.) and 400 mm (16 ins.) diameter 
contained in a vacuum environment and spun at high peripheral speed (of 
the order of 300 m/per second and more) with the central axis vertical. 
In order to achieve high speed, the materials of construction for the 
rotating rotor assembly, and hence its individual components, have to be 
manufactured to very close tolerances in order to minimize the 
unbalance. In contrast to other centrifuges, the gas centrifuge for 
uranium enrichment is characterized by having within the rotor chamber a 
rotating disc-shaped baffle(s) and a stationary tube arrangement for 
feeding and extracting UF<INF>6</INF> gas and featuring at least 3 
separate channels of which 2 are connected to scoops extending from the 
rotor axis towards the periphery of the rotor chamber. Also contained 
within the vacuum environment are a number of critical items which do 
not rotate and which, although they are especially designed, are not 
difficult to fabricate nor are they fabricated out of unique materials. 
A centrifuge facility, however, requires a large number of these 
components so that quantities can provide an important indication of end 
use.

    1.1 Rotating Components.

[[Page 714]]

    (a) Complete Rotor Assemblies: Thin-walled cylinders, or a number of 
interconnected thin-walled cylinders, manufactured from one of the high 
strength-to-density ratio materials described in the Footnote to this 
Section.
    If interconnected, the cylinders are joined together by flexible 
bellows or rings as described in Sec. 1.1(c). The rotor is fitted with 
an internal baffle(s) and end caps, as described in Sec. 1.1 (d) and 
(e), if in final form. However, the complete assembly may be delivered 
only partly assembled.
    (b) Rotor Tubes: Especially designed or prepared thin-walled 
cylinders with thickness of 12mm (.50 in.) or less, a diameter of 
between 75mm (3 ins.) and 400mm (16 ins.), and manufactured from one of 
the high strength-to-density ratio materials described in the Footnote 
to this Section.
    (c) Rings or Bellows: Components especially designed or prepared to 
give localized support to the rotor tube or to join together a number of 
rotor tubes. The bellows in a short cylinder of wall thickness 3mm (.125 
in.) or less, a diameter of between 75mm (3 ins.) and 400mm (16 ins.), 
having a convolute, and manufactured from one of the high strength-to-
density ratio materials described in the footnote to this section.
    (d) Baffles: Disc shaped components of between 75mm (3 ins.) and 
400mm (16 ins.) diameter especially designed or prepared to be mounted 
inside the centrifuge rotor tube, in order to isolate the take-off 
chamber from the main separation chamber and, in some cases, to assist 
the UF<INF>6</INF> gas circulation within the main separation chamber of 
the rotor tube, and manufactured from one of the high strength-to-
density ratio materials described in the Footnote to this Section.
    (e) Top Caps/Bottom Caps: Disc shaped components of between 75mm (3 
ins.) and 400mm (16 ins.) diameter especially designed or prepared to 
fit to the ends of the rotor tube, and so contain the UF<INF>6</INF> 
within the rotor tube, and in some cases to support, retain or contain 
as an integrated part, an element of the upper bearing (top cap) or to 
carry the rotating elements of the motor and lower bearing (bottom cap), 
and manufactured from one of the high strength-to-density ratio 
materials described in the Footnote to this Section.

                                Footnote

    The materials used for centrifuge rotating components are:
    (a) Maraging steel capable of an ultimate tensile strength of 
2.050x10\9\ N/m\2\ (300,000 lb/in.\2\ ) or more.
    (b) Aluminium alloys capable of an ultimate tensile strength of 
0.460x10\9\ N/m\2\ (67,000 lb/in.\2\ ) or more.
    (c) Filamentary materials suitable for use in composite structures 
and having a specific modulus of 3.18 x 10\6\ m or greater and a 
specific ultimate tensile strength of 7.62 x 10\4\ m or greater.

(``Specific Modulus'' is the Young's modulus in N/m \2\ divided by the 
specific weight in N/m \3\ when measured at a temperature of 23<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>20C and a relative humidity of 50<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5%. ``Specific tensile strength'' is the ultimate 
tensile strength in N/m \2\ divided by the specific weight in N/m \3\ 
when measured at a temperature of 23<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>20C and a 
relative humidity of 50<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5%.)
    1.2 Static Components.
    (a) Magnetic Suspension Bearings: Especially designed or prepared 
bearing assemblies consisting of an annular magnet suspended within a 
housing containing a damping medium. The housing will be manufactured 
from a UF<INF>6</INF> resistant material (see footnote to section 2). 
The magnet couples with a pole piece or a second magnet fitted to the 
top cap described in Section 1.1(e). The magnet may be ring-shaped with 
a relation between outer and inner diameter smaller or equal to 1.6:1. 
The magnet may be in a form having an initial permeability of 0.15 
Henry/meter (120,000 in CGS units) or more, or a remanence of 98.5 
percent or more, or an energy product of greater than 80,000 joules/m\3\ 
(10x10\6\ gauss-oersteds.) In addition to the usual material properties, 
it is a prerequisite that the deviation of the magnetic axes from the 
geometrical axes is limited to very small tolerances (lower than 0.1mm) 
or that homogeneity of the material of the magnet is specially called 
for.
    (b) Bearings/Dampers: Especially designed or prepared bearings 
comprising a pivot/cup assembly mounted on a damper. The pivot is 
normally a hardened steel shaft polished into a hemisphere at one end 
with a means of attachment to the bottom cap described in Section 1.1(e) 
at the other. The shaft may, however, have a hydrodynamic bearing 
attached. The cup is pellet-shaped with hemispherical indentation in one 
surface. These components are often supplied separately to the damper.
    (c) Molecular Pumps: Especially designed or prepared cylinders 
having internally machined or extruded helical grooves and internally 
machined bores. Typical dimensions are as follows: 7mm (0.3 ins.) to 
400mm (16 ins.) internal diameter, 10mm (0.4 ins.) or more wall 
thickness, 1 to 1 length to diameter ratio. The grooves are typically 
rectangular in cross-section and 2mm (0.08 in.) or more in depth.
    (d) Motor Stators: Especially designed or prepared ring shaped 
stators for high speed multi-phase AC hysteresis (or reluctance) motors 
for synchronous operation within a vacuum in the frequency range of 600-
2000 Hz and a power range of 50-1000 volts amps. The stators consist of 
multi-phase windings on a laminated low loss iron core comprised of thin 
layers typically 2.0mm (0.08 in.) thick or less.

[[Page 715]]

    (e) Centrifuge housing/recipients: Components especially designed or 
prepared to contain the rotor tube assembly of a gas centrifuge. The 
housing consists of a rigid cylinder of wall thickness up to 30 mm 
(1.2in) with precision machined ends to locate the bearings and with one 
or more flanges for mounting. The machined ends are parallel to each 
other and perpendicular to the cylinder's longitudinal axis to within 
0.05 degrees or less. The housing may also be a honeycomb type structure 
to accommodate several rotor tubes. The housings are made of or 
protected by materials resistant to corrosion by UF6.
    (f) Scoops: Especially designed or prepared tubes of up to 12 mm 
(0.5in) internal diameter for the extraction of UF6 gas from within the 
rotor tube by a Pitot tube action (that is, with an aperture facing into 
the circumferential gas flow within the rotor tube, for example by 
bending the end of a radially disposed tube) and capable of being fixed 
to the central gas extraction system. The tubes are made of or protected 
by materials resistant to corrosion by UF6.
    2. Especially designed or prepared auxiliary systems, equipment and 
components for gas centrifuge enrichment plants.

    Note: The auxiliary systems, equipment and components for a gas 
centrifuge enrichment plant are the systems of the plant needed to feed 
UF<INF>6</INF> to the centrifuges to link the individual centrifuges to 
each other to form cascades (or stages) to allow for progressively 
higher enrichments and to extract the product and tails of 
UF<INF>6</INF> from the centrifuges, together with the equipment 
required to drive the centrifuges or to control the plant.

    Normally UF<INF>6</INF> is evaporated from the solid using heated 
autoclaves and is distributed in gaseous form to the centrifuges by way 
of cascade header pipework. The ``product'' and ``tails'' of 
UF<INF>6</INF> gaseous streams flowing from the centrifuges are also 
passed by way of cascade header pipework to cold traps (operating at 
about -70 [deg]C) where they are condensed prior to onward transfer into 
suitable containers for transportation or storage. Because an enrichment 
plant consists of many thousands of centrifuges arranged in cascades, 
there are many kilometers of cascade header pipework incorporating 
thousands of welds with a substantial amount of repetition of layout. 
The equipment, component and piping systems are fabricated to very high 
vacuum and cleanliness standards.
    The following items either come into direct contact with 
UF<INF>6</INF> process gas or directly control the centrifuge and the 
passage of the gas from centrifuge to centrifuge and cascade to cascade.
    (a) Feed Systems/Product and Tails Withdrawal Systems:
    Especially designed or prepared process systems including:
    1. Feed autoclaves (or stations), used for passing UF<INF>6</INF> to 
the centrifuge cascades at up to 100 KN/m\2\ (15 psi) and at a rate of 1 
kg/h or more.
    2. Desublimers (or cold traps) used to remove UF<INF>6</INF> from 
the cascades at up to 3 kN/m\2\ (0.5 lb/in\2\) pressure. The desublimers 
are capable of being chilled to -70 [deg]C and heated to 70 [deg]C.
    3. Product and tails stations used for trapping UF<INF>6</INF> into 
containers.
    This plant equipment and pipework are wholly made of or lined with 
UF<INF>6</INF> resistant materials (see Footnote to this Section) and 
are fabricated to very high vacuum and cleanliness standards.
    (b) Machine Header Piping Systems:
    Especially designed or prepared piping systems and header systems 
for handling UF<INF>6</INF> within the centrifuge cascades.
    This piping network is normally of the ``triple'' header system with 
each centrifuge connected to each of the headers. There is thus a 
substantial amount of repetition in its form. It is wholly made of 
UF<INF>6</INF> resistant materials (see Note to this Section) and is 
fabricated to very high vacuum and cleanliness standards.
    (c) UF<INF>6</INF> Mass Spectrometers/Ion Sources: Especially 
designed or prepared magnetic or quadrapole mass spectrometers capable 
of taking ``on-line'' sample of feed, product or tails from 
UF<INF>6</INF> gas streams and having all of the following 
characteristics:
    1. Unit resolution for mass greater than 320.
    2. Ion sources constructed of or lined with nichrome, monel or 
nickel-plate.
    3. Electron bombardment ionization sources.
    4. Having a collector system suitable for isotope analysis.
    (d) Frequency Changers: Frequency changers (also known as converters 
or invertors) especially designed or prepared to supply motor stators as 
defined under Section 1.2(d), or parts, components and subassemblies of 
such frequency changers having all of the following characteristics:
    1. A multiphase output of 600 Hz to 2000Hz.
    2. High stability (with frequency control better than 0.1%).
    3. Low harmonic distortion (less than 2%).
    4. An efficiency of greater than 80%.

                                Footnote

    Materials resistant to corrosion by UF<INF>6</INF> include stainless 
steel, aluminum, aluminum alloys, nickel or alloys containing 60% or 
more nickel.

  Sec. Appendix C to Part 110--Illustrative List of Gaseous Diffusion 
 Enrichment Plant Assemblies and Components Under NRC Export Licensing 
                                Authority

    Note--In the gaseous diffusion method of uranium isotope separation, 
the main technological assembly is a special porous gaseous diffusion 
barrier, heat exchanger for cooling the gas (which is heated by the 
process of compression), seal valves and control valves, and pipelines. 
Inasmuch as gaseous diffusion technology uses uranium hexafluoride 
(UF<INF>6</INF>), all equipment, pipeline and instrumentation surfaces 
(that come in contact with the gas) must be made of materials that 
remain stable in contact with UF<INF>6</INF>. A gaseous diffusion 
facility requires a number of these assemblies, so that quantities can 
provide an important indication of end use.
    The auxiliary systems, equipment and components for gaseous 
diffusion enrichment plants are the systems of plant needed to feed 
UF<INF>6</INF> to the gaseous diffusion assembly to link the individual 
assemblies to each other to form cascades (or stages) to allow for 
progressively higher enrichments and to extract the ``product'' and 
``tails'' UF<INF>6</INF> from the diffusion cascades. Because of the 
high inertial properties of diffusion cascades, any interruption in 
their operation, and especially their shut-down, leads to serious 
consequences. Therefore, a strict and constant maintenance of vacuum in 
all technological systems, automatic protection for accidents, and 
precise automated regulation of the gas flow is of importance in a 
gaseous diffusion plant. All this leads to a need to equip the plant 
with a large number of special measuring, regulating, and controlling 
systems.
    Normally UF<INF>6</INF> is evaporated from cylinders placed within 
autoclaves and is distributed in gaseous form to the entry point by way 
of cascade header pipework. The ``product'' and ``tails'' UF<INF>6</INF> 
gaseous streams flowing from exit points are passed by way of cascade 
header pipework to either cold traps or to compression stations where 
the UF<INF>6</INF> gas is liquified prior to onward transfer into 
suitable containers for transportation or storage. Because a gaseous 
diffusion enrichment plant consists of a large number of gaseous 
diffusion assemblies arranged in cascades, there are many kilometers of 
cascade header pipework, incorporating thousands of welds with 
substantial amounts of repetition of layout. The equipment, components 
and piping systems are fabricated to very high vacuum and cleanliness 
standards.
    The items listed below either come into direct contact with the 
UF<INF>6</INF> process gas or directly control the flow within the 
cascade. All surfaces which come into contact with the process gas are 
wholly made of, or lined with, UF<INF>6</INF>-resistant materials. For 
the purposes of this appendix the materials resistant to corrosion by 
UF<INF>6</INF> include stainless steel, aluminum, aluminum alloys, 
aluminum oxide, nickel or alloys containing 60 percent or more nickel, 
and UF<INF>6</INF>-resistant fully fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers.

Sec. Appendix D to Part 110--Illustrative List of Aerodynamic Enrichment 
   Plant Equipment and Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority

    Note--In aerodynamic enrichment processes, a mixture of gaseous UF6 
and light gas (hydrogen or helium) is compressed and then passed through 
separating elements wherein isotopic separation is accomplished by the 
generation of high centrifugal forces over a curved-wall geometry. Two 
processes of this type have been successfully developed: the separation 
nozzle process and the vortex tube process. For both processes the main 
components of a separation stage included cylindrical vessels housing 
the special separation elements (nozzles or vortex tubes), gas 
compressors and heat exchangers to remove the heat of compression. An 
aerodynamic plant requires a number of these stages, so that quantities 
can provide an important indication of end use. Because aerodynamic 
processes use UF6, all equipment, pipeline and instrumentation surfaces 
(that come in contact with the gas) must be made of materials that 
remain stable in contact with UF6. All surfaces which come into contact 
with the process gas are made of or protected by UF6-resistant 
materials; including copper, stainless steel, aluminum, aluminum alloys, 
nickel or alloys containing 60% or more nickel and UF6-resistant fully 
fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers.

[[Page 718]]

or less and with one or more tangential inlets. The tubes may be 
equipped with nozzle-type appendages at either or both ends.
    The feed gas enters the vortex tube tangentially at one end or 
through swirl vanes or at numerous tangential positions along the 
periphery of the tube.
    (3) Compressors and gas blowers.
    Especially designed or prepared axial, centrifugal, or positive

 Sec. Appendix E to Part 110--Illustrative List of Chemical Exchange or 
Ion Exchange Enrichment Plant Equipment and Components Under NRC Export 
                           Licensing Authority

    Note--The slight difference in mass between the isotopes of uranium 
causes small changes in chemical reaction equilibria that can be used as 
a basis for separation of the

[[Page 719]]

isotopes. Two processes have been successfully developed: liquid-liquid 
chemical exchange and solid-liquid ion exchange.

    A. In the liquid-liquid chemical exchange process, immiscible liquid 
phases (aqueous and organic) are countercurrently contacted to give the 
cascading effect of thousands of separation stages. The aqueous phase 
consists of uranium chloride in hydrochloric acid solution; the organic 
phase consists of an extractant containing uranium chloride in an 
organic solvent. The contactors employed in the separation cascade can 
be liquid-liquid exchange columns (such as pulsed columns with sieve 
plates) or liquid centrifugal contactors. Chemical conversions 
(oxidation and reduction) are required at both ends of the separation 
cascade in order to provide for the reflux requirements at each end. A 
major design concern is to avoid contamination of the process streams 
with certain metal ions. Plastic, plastic-lined (including use of 
fluorocarbon polymers) and/or glass-lined columns and piping are 
therefore used.
    (1) Liquid-liquid exchange columns.
    Countercurrent liquid-liquid exchange columns having mechanical 
power input (i.e., pulsed columns with sieve plates, reciprocating plate 
columns, and columns with internal turbine mixers), especially designed 
or prepared for uranium enrichment using the chemical exchange process. 
For corrosion resistance to concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions, 
these columns and their internals are made of or protected by suitable 
plastic materials (such as fluorocarbon polymers) or glass. The stage 
residence time of the columns is designed to be short (30 seconds or 
less).
    (2) Liquid-liquid centrifugal contactors.
    Especially designed or prepared for uranium enrichment using the 
chemical exchange process. These contactors use rotation to achieve 
dispersion of the organic and aqueous streams and then centrifugal force 
to separate the phases. For corrosion resistance to concentrated 
hydrochloric acid solutions, the contactors are made of or are lined 
with suitable plastic materials (such as fluorocarbon polymers) or are 
lined with glass. The stage residence time of the centrifugal contactors 
is designed to be short (30 seconds or less).
    (3) Uranium reduction systems and equipment.
    (i) Especially designed or prepared electrochemical reduction cells 
to reduce uranium from one valence state to another for uranium 
enrichment using the chemical exchange process. The cell materials in 
contact with process solutions must be corrosion resistant to 
concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions.
    The cell cathodic compartment must be designed to prevent re-
oxidation of uranium to its higher valence state. To keep the uranium in 
the cathodic compartment, the cell may have an impervious diaphragm 
membrane constructed of special cation exchange material. The cathode 
consists of a suitable solid conductor such as graphite.
    These systems consist of solvent extraction equipment for stripping 
the U+4 from the organic stream into an aqueous solution, evaporation 
and/or other equipment to accomplish solution pH adjustment and control, 
and pumps or other transfer devices for feeding to the electrochemical 
reduction cells. A major design concern is to avoid contamination of the 
aqueous stream with certain metal ions. For those parts in contact with 
the process stream, the system is constructed of equipment made of or 
protected by materials such as glass, fluorocarbon polymers, polyphenyl 
sulfate, polyether sulfone, and resin-impregnated graphite.
    (ii) Especially designed or prepared systems at the product end of 
the cascade for taking the U+4 out of the organic stream, adjusting the 
acid concentration and feeding to the electrochemical reduction cells.
    These systems consist of solvent extraction equipment for stripping 
the U+4 from the organic stream into an aqueous solution, evaporation 
and/or other equipment to accomplish solution pH adjustment and control, 
and pumps or other transfer devices for feeding to the electrochemical 
reduction cells. A major design concern is to avoid contamination of the 
aqueous stream with certain metal ions. For those parts in contact with 
the process stream, the system is constructed of equipment made of or 
protected by materials such as glass, fluorocarbon polymers, polyphenyl 
sulfate, polyether sulfone, and resin-impregnated graphite.
    (4) Feed preparation systems.
    Especially designed or prepared systems for producing high-purity 
uranium chloride feed solutions for chemical exchange uranium isotope 
separation plants.
    These systems consist of dissolution, solvent extraction and/or ion 
exchange equipment for purification and electrolytic cells for reducing 
the uranium U+6 or U+4 to U+3. These systems produce uranium chloride 
solutions having only a few parts per million of metallic impurities 
such as chromium, iron, vanadium, molybdenum and other bivalent or 
higher multi-valent cations. Materials of construction for portions of 
the system processing high-purity U+3 include glass, fluorocarbon 
polymers, polyphenyl sulfate or polyether sulfone plastic-lined and 
resin-impregnated graphite.
    (5) Uranium oxidation systems.
    Especially designed or prepared systems for oxidation of U+3 to U+4 
for return to the uranium isotope separation cascade in the chemical 
exchange enrichment process.
    These systems may incorporate equipment such as:

[[Page 720]]

    (i) Equipment for contacting chlorine and oxygen with the aqueous 
effluent from the isotope separation equipment and extracting the 
resultant U+4 into the stripped organic stream returning from the 
product end of the cascade; and
    (ii) Equipment that separates water from hydrochloric acid so that 
the water and the concentrated hydrochloric acid may be reintroduced to 
the process at the proper locations.
    B. In the solid-liquid ion-exchange process, enrichment is 
accomplished by uranium adsorption/desorption on a special, fast-acting, 
ion-exchange resin or adsorbent. A solution of uranium in hydrochloric 
acid and other chemical agents is passed through cylindrical enrichment 
columns containing packed beds of the adsorbent. For a continuous 
process, a reflux system is necessary to release the uranium from the 
adsorbent back in the liquid flow so that ``product'' and ``tails'' can 
be collected. This is accomplished with the use of suitable reduction/
oxidation chemical agents that are fully regenerated in separate 
external circuits and that may be partially regenerated within the 
isotopic separation columns themselves. The presence of hot concentrated 
hydrochloric acid solutions in the process requires that the equipment 
be made of or protected by special corrosion-resistant materials.
    (1) Fast reacting ion exchange resins/adsorbents.
    Especially designed or prepared for uranium enrichment using the ion 
exchange process, including porous macroreticular resins, and/or 
pellicular structures in which the active chemical exchange groups are 
limited to a coating on the surface of an inactive porous support 
structure, and other composite structures in any suitable form including 
particles or fibers. These ion exchange resins/adsorbents have diameters 
of 0.2 mm or less and must be chemically resistant to concentrated 
hydrochloric acid solutions as well as physically strong enough so as 
not to degrade in the exchange columns. The resins/adsorbents are 
especially designed to achieve very fast uranium isotope exchange 
kinetics (exchange rate half-time of less than 10 seconds) and are 
capable of operating at a temperature in the range of 100 [deg]C to 200 
[deg]C.
    (2) Ion exchange columns.
    Cylindrical columns greater than 1000 mm in diameter for containing 
and supporting packed beds of ion exchange resin/adsorbent, especially 
designed or prepared for uranium enrichment using the ion exchange 
process. These columns are made of or protected by materials (such as 
titanium or fluorocarbon plastics) resistant to corrosion by 
concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions and are capable of operating at 
a temperature in the range of 100[deg]C to 200[deg]C and pressures above 
0.7 MPa (102 psia).
    (3) Ion exchange reflux systems.
    (i) Especially designed or prepared chemical or electrochemical 
reduction systems for regeneration of the chemical reducing agent(s) 
used in ion exchange uranium enrichment cascades.
    The ion exchange enrichment process may use, for example, trivalent 
titanium (Ti+3) as a reducing cation in which case the reduction system 
would regenerate Ti+3 by reducing Ti+4.
    (ii) Especially designed or prepared chemical or electrochemical 
oxidation systems for regeneration of the chemical oxidizing agent(s) 
used in ion exchange uranium enrichment cascades.
    The ion exchange enrichment process may use, for example, trivalent 
iron (Fe+3) as an oxidant in which case the oxidation system would 
regenerate Fe+3 by oxidizing Fe+2.

Sec. Appendix F to Part 110--Illustrative List of Laser-Based
Enrichment Plant Equipment and Components Under NRC Export 
Licensing Authority

    Note--Present systems for enrichment processes using lasers fall 
into two categories: the process medium is atomic uranium vapor and the 
process medium is the vapor of a uranium compound. Common nomenclature 
for these processes include: first category-atomic vapor laser isotope 
separation (AVLIS or SILVA); second category-molecular laser isotope 
separation (MLIS or MOLIS) and chemical reaction by isotope selective 
laser activation (CRISLA). The systems, equipment and components for 
laser enrichment plants include: (a) Devices to feed uranium-metal vapor 
for selective photo-ionization or devices to feed the vapor of a uranium 
compound for photo-dissociation or chemical activation; (b) devices to 
collect enriched and depleted uranium metal as ``product'' and ``tails'' 
in the first category, and devices to collect dissociated or reacted 
compounds as ``product'' and unaffected material as 'tails' in the 
second category; (c) process laser systems to selectively excite the 
uranium-235 species; and (d) feed preparation and product conversion 
equipment. The complexity of the spectroscopy of uranium atoms and 
compounds may require incorporation of a number of available laser 
technologies.

    All surfaces that come into contact with the uranium or UF6 are 
wholly made of or protected by corrosion-resistant materials. For laser-
based enrichment items, the materials resistant to corrosion by the 
vapor or liquid of uranium metal or uranium alloys include yttria-coated 
graphite and tantalum; and the materials resistant to corrosion by UF6 
include copper, stainless steel, aluminum, aluminum alloys, nickel or 
alloys

[[Page 721]]

hydrocarbon polymers.
    Many of the following items come into direct contact with uranium

collector plates for magnetic, electrostatic or other separation 
methods.
    (4) Separator module housings (AVLIS).
    Especially designed or prepared cylindrical or rectangular vessels

mixture.
    (9) Fluorination systems (MLIS).

fluorination reaction may be accomplished within the isotope separation 
system to react and recover directly off the ``product'' collectors. In 
another approach, the UF5 powder may be removed/transferred from the 
``product'' collectors into a suitable reaction vessel (e.g., fluidized-
bed reactor, screw reactor or flame tower) for fluorination. In both 
approaches equipment is used for storage and transfer of fluorine (or

lasers: a copper vapor laser and a dye laser. The laser system for MLIS 
usually consists of a CO<INF>2</INF> or excimer laser and a multi-pass 
optical cell with revolving mirrors at both ends. Lasers or laser

                                Authority

    Note--In the plasma separation process, a plasma of uranium ions 
passes through an electric field tuned to the 235U ion resonance 
frequency so that they preferentially absorb energy and increase the 
diameter of their corkscrew-like orbits. Ions with a large-diameter path 
are trapped to produce a product enriched in 235U. The plasma, made by 
ionizing uranium vapor, is contained in a vacuum chamber with a high-
strength magnetic field produced by a superconducting magnet. The main 
technological systems of the process include the uranium plasma 
generation system, the separator module with superconducting magnet, and 
metal removal systems for the collection of ``product'' and ``tails''.

    Note--In the electromagnetic process, uranium metal ions produced by 
ionization of a salt feed material (typically UCL4) are accelerated and

  Sec. Appendix I to Part 110--Illustrative List of Reprocessing Plant 
             Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority

    Note--Reprocessing irradiated nuclear fuel separates plutonium and 
uranium from intensely radioactive fission products and other 
transuranic elements. Different technical processes can accomplish this 
separation. However, over the years Purex has become the most commonly 
used and accepted process. Purex involves the dissolution of irradiated 
nuclear fuel in nitric acid, followed by separation of the uranium, 
plutonium, and fission products by solvent extraction using a mixture of 
tributyl phosphate in an organic diluent.
    Purex facilities have process functions similar to each other, 
including: irradiated fuel element chopping, fuel dissolution, solvent 
extraction, and process liquor storage. There may also be equipment for 
thermal denitration of uranium nitrate, conversion of plutonium nitrate 
to oxide metal, and treatment of fission product waste liquor to a form 
suitable for long term storage or disposal. However, the specific type 
and configuration of the equipment performing these functions may differ 
between Purex facilities for several reasons, including the type and 
quantity of irradiated nuclear fuel to be reprocessed and the intended 
disposition of the recovered materials, and the safety and maintenance 
philosophy incorporated into the design of the facility. A plant of the 
reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements, includes the equipment and 
components which normally come in direct contact with and directly 
control the irradiated fuel and the major nuclear material and fission 
product processing streams.
    (1) Fuel element chopping machines, i.e., remotely operated 
equipment specially designed or prepared to cut, chop, or shear 
irradiated nuclear reactor fuel assemblies, bundles, or rods.
    (2) Critically safe tanks, i.e., small diameter, annular or slab 
tanks specially designed or prepared for the dissolution of irradiated 
nuclear reactor fuel.
    (3) Solvent extraction equipment.
    Especially designed or prepared solvent extractors such as packed or 
pulse columns, mixer settlers or centrifugal contactors for use in a 
plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. Because solvent 
extractors must be resistant to the corrosive effect of nitric acid, 
they are normally fabricated to extremely high standards (including 
special welding and inspection and quality assurance and quality control 
techniques) out of low carbon stainless steels, titanium, zirconium or 
other high quality materials.
    (4) Chemical holding or storage vessels.

[[Page 724]]

    Especially designed or prepared holding or storage vessels for use 
in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. Because holding or 
storage vessels must be resistant to the corrosive effect of nitric 
acid, they are normally fabricated of materials such as low carbon 
stainless steels, titanium or zirconium, or other high quality 
materials. Holding or storage vessels may be designed for remote 
operation and maintenance and may have the following features for 
control of nuclear criticality:
    (i) Walls or internal structures with a boron equivalent of at least 
2 percent, or
    (ii) A maximum diameter of 7 inches (17.78 cm) for cylindrical 
vessels, or

  Sec. Appendix J to Part 110--Illustrative List of Uranium Conversion 
   Plant Equipment and Plutonium Conversion Plant Equipment Under NRC 
                       Export Licensing Authority

    Note--Uranium conversion plants and systems may perform one or more 
transformations from one uranium chemical species to another, including: 
conversion of uranium ore concentrates to UO3, conversion of UO3 to UO2, 
conversion of uranium oxides to UF4 or UF6, conversion of UF4 to UF6, 
conversion of UF6 to UF4, conversion of UF4 to uranium metal, and 
conversion of uranium fluorides to UO2. Many key equipment items for 
uranium conversion plants are common to several segments of the chemical 
process industry, including furnaces, rotary kilns, fluidized bed 
reactors, flame tower reactors, liquid centrifuges, distillation columns 
and liquid-liquid extraction columns. However, few of the items are 
available ``off-the-shelf''; most would be prepared according to 
customer requirements and specifications. Some require special design 
and construction considerations to address the corrosive properties of 
the chemicals handled (HF, F2, CLF3, and uranium fluorides). In all of 
the uranium conversion processes, equipment which individually is not 
especially designed or prepared for uranium conversion can be assembled 
into systems which are especially designed or prepared for uranium 
conversion.

    (a) Uranium Conversion Plant Equipment.
    (1) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of 
uranium ore concentrates to UO3.
    Conversion of uranium ore concentrates to UO3 can be performed by 
first dissolving the ore in nitric acid and extracting purified uranyl 
nitrate using a solvent such as tributyl phosphate. Next, the uranyl 
nitrate is converted to UO3 either by concentration and denitration or 
by neutralization with gaseous ammonia to produce ammonium diuranate 
with subsequent filtering, drying, and calcining.
    (2) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of 
UO3 to UF6.
    Conversion of UO3 to UF6 can be performed directly by fluorination. 
The process requires a source of fluorine gas or chlorine trifluoride.
    (3) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of 
UO3 to UO2.
    Conversion of UO3 to UO2 can be performed through reduction of UO3 
with cracked ammonia gas or hydrogen.
    (4) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of 
UO2 to UF4.
    Conversion of UO2 to UF4 can be performed by reacting UO2 with 
hydrogen fluoride gas (HF) at 300-500 [deg]C.
    (5) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of 
UF4 to UF6.
    Conversion of UF4 to UF6 is performed by exothermic reaction with 
fluorine in a tower reactor. UF6 is condensed from the hot effluent 
gases by passing the effluent stream through a cold trap cooled to -
10[deg]C. The process requires a source of fluorine gas.
    (6) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of 
UF4 to U metal.
    Conversion of UF4 to U metal is performed by reduction with 
magnesium (large batches) or calcium (small batches). The reaction is 
carried out at temperatures above the melting point of uranium (1130 
[deg]C).
    (7) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of 
UF6 to UO2.
    Conversion of UF6 to UO2 can be performed by one of three processes. 
In the first, UF6 is reduced and hydrolyzed to UO2 using hydrogen and 
steam. In the second, UF6 is hydrolyzed by solution in water, ammonia is 
added to precipitate ammonium diuranate, and the diuranate is reduced to 
UO2 with hydrogen at 820 [deg]C. In the third process, gaseous UF6, CO2, 
and NH3 are combined in water, precipitating ammonium uranyl carbonate. 
The ammonium uranyl carbonate is combined with steam and hydrogen at 
500-

[[Page 725]]

600 [deg]C to yield UO2. UF6 to UO2 conversion is often performed as the 
first stage of a fuel fabrication plant.
    (8) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of 
UF6 to UF4. Conversion of UF6 to UF4 is performed by reduction with 
hydrogen.
    (9) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of 
UO<INF>2</INF> to UCl<INF>4</INF> as feed for electromagnetic 
enrichment.

    Note: Plutonium conversion plants and systems may perform one or 
more transformations from one plutonium chemical species to another, 
including: conversion of plutonium nitrate to PuO<INF>2</INF>, 
conversion of PuO<INF>2</INF> to PuF<INF>4</INF> and conversion of 
PuF<INF>4</INF> to plutonium metal. Plutonium conversion plants are 
usually associated with reprocessing facilities, but may also be 
associated with plutonium fuel fabrication facilities. Many of the key 
equipment items for plutonium conversion plants are common to several 
segments of the chemical process industry. For example, the types of 
equipment employed in these processes may include the following items: 
furnaces, rotary kilns, fluidized bed reactors, flame tower reactors, 
liquid centrifuges, distillation columns and liquid-liquid extraction 
columns. Hot cells, glove boxes and remote manipulators may also be 
required. However, few of the items are available off-the-shelf; most 
would be prepared according to the requirements and specifications of 
the customer. Particular care is essential in designing for the special 
radiological, toxicity and criticality hazards associated with 
plutonium. In some circumstances, special design and construction 
considerations are required to address the corrosive properties of some 
of the chemicals handled (e.g., HF). Finally, it should be noted that, 
for all plutonium conversion processes, items of equipment which 
individually are not especially designed or prepared for plutonium 
conversion can be assembled into systems that are especially designed or 
prepared for use in plutonium conversion.

    (b) Plutonium Conversion Plant Equipment
    (1) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of 
plutonium nitrate to oxide.
    The main functions involved in this process are: process feed 
storage and adjustment, precipitation and solid/liquor separation, 
calcination, product handling, ventilation, waste management, and 
process control. The process systems are particularly adapted so as to 
avoid criticality and radiation effects and to minimize toxicity 
hazards. In most reprocessing facilities, this process involves the 
conversion of plutonium nitrate to plutonium dioxide. Other processes 
can involve the precipitation of plutonium oxalate or plutonium 
peroxide.
    (2) Especially designed or prepared systems for plutonium metal 
production.
    This process usually involves the fluorination of plutonium dioxide, 
normally with highly corrosive hydrogen fluoride, to produce plutonium 
fluoride, which is subsequently reduced using high purity calcium metal 
to produce metallic plutonium and a calcium fluoride slag. The main 
functions involved in this process are the following: fluorination 
(e.g., involving equipment fabricated or lined with a precious metal), 
metal reduction (e.g., employing ceramic crucibles), slag recovery, 
product handling, ventilation, waste management and process control. The 
process systems are particularly adapted so as to avoid criticality and 
radiation effects and to minimize toxicity hazards. Other processes 
include the fluorination of plutonium oxalate or plutonium peroxide 
followed by reduction to metal.

    Sec. Appendix K to Part 110--Illustrative List of Equipment and 
 Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority for Use in a Plant for 
    the Production of Heavy Water, Deuterium and Deuterium Compounds

    Note: Heavy water can be produced by a variety of processes. 
However, two processes have proven to be commercially viable: the water-
hydrogen sulphide exchange process (GS process) and the ammonia-hydrogen 
exchange process.
    A. The water-hydrogen sulphide exchange process (GS process) is 
based upon the exchange of hydrogen and deuterium between water and 
hydrogen sulphide within a series of towers which are operated with the 
top section cold and the bottom section hot. Water flows down the towers 
while the hydrogen sulphide gas circulates from the bottom to the top of 
the towers. A series of perforated trays are used to promote mixing 
between the gas and the water. Deuterium migrates to the water at low 
temperatures and to the hydrogen sulphide at high temperatures. Gas or 
water, enriched in deuterium, is removed from the first stage towers at 
the junction of the hot and cold sections and the process is repeated in 
subsequent stage towers. The product of the last stage, water enriched 
up to 30 percent in deuterium, is sent to a distillation unit to produce 
reactor grade heavy water; i.e., 99.75 percent deuterium oxide.
    B. The ammonia-hydrogen exchange process can extract deuterium from 
synthesis gas through contact with liquid ammonia in the presence of a 
catalyst. The systhesis gas is

[[Page 726]]

fed into exchange towers and then to an ammonia converter. Inside the 
towers the gas flows from the bottom to the top while the liquid ammonia 
flows from the top to the bottom. The deuterium is stripped from the 
hydrogen in the systhesis gas and concentrated in the ammonia. The 
ammonia then flows into an ammonia cracker at the bottom of the tower 
while the gas flows into an ammonia converter at the top. Further 
enrichment takes place in subsequent stages and reactor-grade heavy 
water is produced through final distillation. The synthesis gas feed can 
be provided by an ammonia plant that can be constructed in association 
with a heavy water ammonia-hydrogen exchange plant. The ammonia-hydrogen 
exchange process can also use ordinary water as a feed source of 
deuterium.
    C.1. Much of the key equipment for heavy water production plants 
using either the water-hydrogen sulphide exchange process (GS process) 
or the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process are common to several segments 
of the chemical and petroleum industries; particularly in small plants 
using the GS process. However, few items are available ``off-the-
shelf.'' Both processes require the handling of large quantities of 
flammable, corrosive and toxic fluids at elevated pressures. Thus, in 
establishing the design and operating standards for plants and equipment 
using these processes, careful attention to materials selection and 
specifications is required to ensure long service life with high safety 
and reliability factors. The choice is primarily a function of economics 
and need. Most equipment, therefore, is prepared to customer 
requirements.
    In both processes, equipment which individually is not especially 
designed or prepared for heavy water production can be assembled into 
especially designed or prepared systems for producing heavy water. 
Examples of such systems are the catalyst production system used in the 
ammonia-hydrogen exchange process and the water distillation systems 
used for the final concentration of heavy water to reactor-grade in 
either process.
    C.2. Equipment especially designed or prepared for the production of 
heavy water utilizing either the water-hydrogen sulphide exchange 
process or the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process:
    (i) Water-hydrogen Sulphide Exchange Towers
    Exchange towers fabricated from carbon steel (such as ASTM A516) 
with diameters of 6 m (20 ft) to 9 m (30 ft), capable of operating at

allowance of 6mm or greater.
    (ii) Blowers and Compressors
    Single stage, low head (i.e., 0.2 MPa or 30 psi) centrifugal blowers 
or compressors for hydrogen-sulphide gas circulation (i.e., gas 
containing more than 70 percent H<INF>2</INF> S). The blowers or 
compressors have a throughput capacity greater than or equal to 56 m\3\/
second (120,000 SCFM) while operating at pressures greater than or equal 
to 1.8 MPa (260 psi) suction and have seals designed for wet 
H<INF>2</INF> S service.
    (iii) Ammonia-Hydrogen Exchange Towers
    Ammonia-hydrogen exchange towers greater than or equal to 35 m 
(114.3 ft) in height with diameters of 1.5 m (4.9 ft) to 2.5 m (8.2 ft) 
capable of operating at pressures greater than 15 MPa (2225 psi). The 
towers have at least one flanged, axial opening of the same diameter as 
the cylindrical part through which the tower internals can be inserted 
or withdrawn.
    (iv) Tower Internals and Stage Pumps Used in the Ammonia-hydrogen 
Exchange Process.
    Tower internals include especially designed stage contactors which 
promote intimate gas/liquid contact. Stage pumps include especially 
designed submersible pumps for circulation of liquid ammonia within a 
contacting stage internal to the stage towers.
    (v) Ammonia Crackers Utilizing the Ammonia-hydrogen Exchange 
Process.
    Ammonia crackers with operating pressures greater than or equal to 3 
MPa (450 psi).
    (vi) Infrared Absorption Analyzers
    Infrared absorption analyzers capable of ``on-line'' hydrogen/
deuterium ratio analysis where deuterium concentrations are equal to or 
greater than 90 percent.
    (vii) Catalytic Burners Used in the Ammonia-hydrogen Exchange 
Process.
    Catalytic burners for the conversion of enriched deuterium gas into 
heavy water.
    (viii) Complete Heavy Water Upgrade Systems or Columns.
    Complete heavy water upgrade systems or columns especially designed 
or prepared for the upgrade of heavy water to reactor-grade deuterium 
concentration. These systems, which usually employ water distillation to 
separate heavy water from light water, are especially designed or 
prepared to produce reactor-grade heavy water (i.e., typically 99.75% 
deuterium oxide) from heavy water feedstock of lesser concentration.

    Note: Nuclear fuel elements are manufactured from source or special 
nuclear material. For oxide fuels, the most common type of fuel 
equipment for pressing pellets, sintering, grinding and grading will be 
present. Mixed oxide fuels are handled in glove boxes (or equivalent 
containment) until they are

[[Page 729]]

sealed in the cladding. In all cases the fuel is hermetically sealed 
inside a suitable cladding which is designed to be the primary envelope 
encasing the fuel so as to provide suitable performance and safety 
during reactor operation. Also, in all cases precise control of 
processes, procedures and equipment to extremely high standards is 
necessary in order to ensure predictable and safe fuel performance.
    (a) Items that are considered especially designed or prepared for 
the fabrication of fuel elements include equipment that:
    (1) Normally comes in direct contact with, or directly processes or 
controls, the production flow of nuclear material;
    (2) Seals the nuclear material within the cladding;
    (3) Checks the integrity of the cladding or the seal; and
    (4) Checks the finished treatment of the sealed fuel.
    (b) This equipment or systems of equipment may include, for example:
    (1) Fully automatic pellet inspection stations especially designed 
or prepared for checking final dimensions and surface defects of fuel 
pellets;
    (2) Automatic welding machines especially designed or prepared for 
welding end caps onto the fuel pins (or rods);
    (3) Automatic test and inspection stations especially designed or 
prepared for checking the integrity of completed fuel pins (or rods). 
This item typically includes equipment for:
    (i) X-ray examination of pin (or rod) end cap welds;
    (ii) Helium leak detection from pressurized pins (or rods); and
    (iii) Gamma-ray scanning of the pins (or rods) to check for correct 
loading of the fuel pellets inside.

  Calculation of Shipments Containing Multiple Sources or Radionuclides

    The ``sum of fractions'' methodology for evaluating combinations of 
radionuclides being transported, is to be used when import or export 
shipments contain multiple sources or multiple radionuclides. The 
threshold limit values used in a sum of the fractions calculation must 
be the metric values (i.e., TBq).
    I. If multiple sources and/or multiple radionuclides are present in 
an import or export shipment, the sum of the fractions of the activity 
of each radionuclides must be determined to verify the shipment is less 
than the Category 1 or 2 limits of Table 1, as appropriate. If the 
calculated sum of the fractions ratio, using the following equation, is 
greater than or equal to 1.0, then the import or export shipment exceeds 
the threshold limits of Table 1 and the applicable security provisions 
of this part apply.
    II. Use the equation below to calculate the sum of the fractions 
ratio by inserting the actual activity of the applicable radionuclides 
or of the individual sources (of the same radionuclides) in the 
numerator of the equation and the corresponding threshold activity limit 
from the Table 1 in the denominator of the equation. Ensure the 
numerator

[[Page 730]]

and denominator values are in the same units and all calculations must 
be performed using the TBq (i.e., metric) values of Table 1.

R<INF>1</INF> = activity for radionuclides or source number 1
R<INF>2</INF> = activity for radionuclides or source number 2
R<INF>N</INF> = activity for radionuclides or source number n
AR<INF>1</INF> = activity limit for radionuclides or source number 1
AR<INF>2</INF> = activity limit for radionuclides or source number 2
AR<INF>N</INF> = activity limit for radionuclides or source number n

Sec. 140.2  Scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part apply:
    (1) To each person who is an applicant for or holder of a license 
issued under 10 CFR parts 50, 52, or 54 to operate a nuclear reactor, 
and
    (2) With respect to an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, to each 
person who is an applicant for or holder of a license to operate a 
production facility or a utilization facility (including an operating 
license issued under part 50 of this chapter and a combined license 
under part 52 of this chapter), and to other persons indemnified with 
respect to the involved facilities.
    (3) To each person licensed pursuant to part 70 of this chapter to 
possess and use plutonium in a plutonium processing and fuel fabrication 
plant.
    (4) To each person licensed pursuant to parts 40 and 70 of this 
chapter to construct and operate a uranium enrichment facility.
    (b)(1) Subpart B of this part does not apply to any person subject 
to subparts C or D of this part. Subpart C of this part applies only to 
persons found by the Commission to be Federal agencies. Subpart D of 
this part applies only to persons found by the Commission to be 
nonprofit educational institutions with respect to licenses and 
applications for licenses for the conduct of educational activities.
    (2) Any applicant or licensee subject to this part may apply for a 
finding that such applicant or licensee is subject to the provisions of 
subparts C or D of this part. The application should state the grounds 
for the requested finding. Any application for a finding pursuant to 
this paragraph may be included in an application for license.
    (c) Subpart E of this part sets forth the procedures the Commission 
will follow and the criteria the Commission will apply in making a 
determination as to whether or not there has been an extraordinary 
nuclear occurrence. The form of nuclear energy liability policy for 
facilities (appendix A) and the forms of indemnity agreements with 
licensees (appendices B, C, D, and E) include provisions requiring the 
waiver of certain defenses with respect to an extraordinary nuclear 
occurrence. These provisions and subpart E are incorporated in this part 
pursuant to Pub. L. 89-645 (80 Stat. 891). They provide additional 
assurance of prompt compensation under available indemnity and 
underlying financial protection for injury or damage resulting from the 
hazardous properties of radioactive materials or radiation, and they in 
no way detract from the protection to the public otherwise provided 
under this part.

<R05>
Sec. 140.7  Fees.

    (a)(1) Each reactor licensee shall pay a fee to the Commission based 
on the following schedule:
    (i) For indemnification from $500 million to $400 million inclusive, 
a fee of $30 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal capacity 
authorized in the license;
    (ii) For indemnification from $399 million to $300 million 
inclusive, a fee of $24 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal 
capacity authorized in the license;
    (iii) For indemnification from $299 million to $200 million 
inclusive, a fee of $18 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal 
capacity authorized in the license;
    (iv) For indemnification from $199 million to $100 million 
inclusive, a fee of $12 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal 
capacity authorized in the license; and
    (v) For indemnification from $99 million to $1 million inclusive, a 
fee of $6 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal capacity authorized 
in the license.
    (2) No fee will be less than $100 per annum for any nuclear reactor. 
This fee is for the period beginning with the date on which the 
applicable indemnity agreement is effective. The various levels of 
indemnity fees are set forth in the schedule in this paragraph. The 
amount of indemnification for determining indemnity fees will be 
computed by subtracting from the statutory limit of liability the amount 
of financial protection required of the licensee. In the case of 
licensees subject to the provision of Sec. 140.11(a)(4), this total 
amount will be the amount, as determined by the Commission, of the 
financial protection available to licensees at the close of the calendar 
year preceding the one in which the fee becomes due. For those instances 
in which a certified financial statement is provided as a guarantee of 
payment of deferred premiums in accordance with Sec. 140.21(e), a fee 
of $1,000 or the indemnity fee, whichever is greater, is required.
    (b) Where a licensee manufactures a number of nuclear reactors each 
having a power level not exceeding 3\1/3\ megawatts, for sale to others 
and operates them at the licensee's location temporarily prior to 
delivery, the licensee shall report to the Commission the maximum number 
of such reactors to be operated at that location at any one time. In 
such cases, the fee shall equal $100 multiplied by the number of 
reactors reported by the licensee. In the event the number of reactors 
operated at any one time exceed the estimate so reported, the licensee 
shall report the additional number of reactors to the Commission and 
additional charges will be made. If experience shows that less than the 
estimated number of reactors have been operated, appropriate adjustment 
in subsequent bills will be made by the Commission.
    (c) Each person licensed to possess and use plutonium in a plutonium 
processing and fuel fabrication plant shall pay to the Commission a fee 
of $5,000 per year for indemnification. This fee is for the period 
beginning with the date on which the applicable indemnity agreement is 
effective.
    (d) Indemnity fee payments, made payable to the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, are to be made in U.S. funds by check, draft, 
money order, credit card, or electronic funds transfer such as ACH 
(Automated Clearing House) using EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). 
Federal agencies may also make payments by the On-Line Payment and 
Collections System (OPAC's). Where specific payment instructions are 
provided on the invoices, payment should be made accordingly, e.g. 
invoices of $5,000 or more should be paid via ACH through NRC's Lockbox 
Bank at the address indicated on the invoice. Credit card payments 
should be made up to the limit established by the credit card bank, in 
accordance

[[Page 735]]

with specific instructions provided with the invoices, to the Lockbox 
Bank designated for credit card payments.

Sec. 140.11  Amounts of financial protection for certain reactors.

    (a) Each licensee is required to have and maintain financial 
protection:
    (1) In the amount of $1,000,000 for each nuclear reactor he is 
authorized to operate at a thermal power level not exceeding ten 
kilowatts;
    (2) In the amount of $1,500,000 for each nuclear reactor he is 
authorized to operate at a thermal power level in excess of ten 
kilowatts but not in excess of one megawatt;
    (3) In the amount of $2,500,000 for each nuclear reactor other than 
a testing reactor or a reactor licensed under section 104b of the Act 
which he is authorized to operate at a thermal power level exceeding one 
megawatt but not in excess of ten megawatts; and
    (4) In an amount equal to the sum of $375,000,000 and the amount 
available as secondary financial protection (in the form of private 
liability insurance available under an industry retrospective rating 
plan providing for deferred premium charges equal to the pro rata share 
of the aggregate public liability claims and costs, excluding costs 
payment of which is not authorized by Section 170o.(1)(D), in excess of 
that covered by primary financial protection) for each nuclear reactor 
which is

[[Page 736]]

licensed to operate and which is designed for the production of 
electrical energy and has a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical 
kilowatts or more: Provided, however, that under such a plan for 
deferred premium charges for each nuclear reactor which is licensed to 
operate, no more than $111,900,000 with respect to any nuclear incident 
(plus any surcharge assessed under Subsection 170o.(1)(E) of the Act) 
and no more than $17,500,000 per incident within one calendar year shall 
be charged. Except that, where a person is authorized to operate a 
combination of 2 or more nuclear reactors located at a single site, each 
of which has a rated capacity of 100,000 or more electrical kilowatts 
but not more than 300,000 electrical kilowatts with a combined rated 
capacity of not more than 1,300,000 electrical kilowatts, each such 
combination of reactors shall be considered to be a single nuclear 
reactor for the sole purpose of assessing the applicable financial 
protection required under this section.
    (b) In any case where a person is authorized under parts 50, 52, or 
54 of this chapter to operate two or more nuclear reactors at the same 
location, the total primary financial protection required of the 
licensee for all such reactors is the highest amount which would 
otherwise be required for any one of those reactors; provided, that such 
primary financial protection covers all reactors at the location.

<R05>
Sec. 140.12  Amount of financial protection required for
other reactors.

    (a) Each licensee is required to have and maintain financial 
protection for each nuclear reactor for which the amount of financial 
protection is not determined in Sec. 140.11, in an amount determined 
pursuant to the formula and other provisions of this section: Provided, 
That in no event shall the amount of financial protection required for 
any nuclear reactor under this section be less than $4,500,000 or more 
than $74,000,000.
    (b)(1) The formula is:

x=B times P

    (2) In the formula:

x=Amount of financial protection in dollars.
B=Base amount of financial protection.
P=Population factor.

    (3) The base amount of financial protection is equal to $185 times 
the maximum power level, expressed in thermal kilowatts, as authorized 
by the applicable license.
    (4) The population factor (P) shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Step 1. The area to be considered includes all minor civil 
divisions (as shown in the 1950 Census of Population, Bureau of the 
Census, or later data available from the Bureau) which are wholly or 
partly within a circle with the facility at its center and having a 
radius in miles equal to the square root of the maximum authorized power 
level in thermal megawatts.
    (ii) Step 2. Identify all minor civil divisions according to the 
same census which are in whole or in part within the circle determined 
in Step 1. Determine the population of each such minor civil division 
(according to the same census or later data available from the Bureau of 
the Census). For each minor civil division, divide its population by the 
square of the estimated distance to the nearest mile from the reactor to 
the geographic center of the minor civil division: Provided, That no 
such distance shall be deemed to be less than one mile. If the sum of 
the quotients thus obtained for all minor civil divisions wholly or 
partly within the circle is 1,000 or less, the population factor is 1. 
If the sum of these quotients is more than 1,000 but not more than 
3,000, the population factor is 1.2. If the sum of these quotients is 
more than 3,000 but not more than 5,000, the population factor is 1.4. 
If the sum of these quotients is more than 5,000 but not more than 
7,000, the population factor is 1.6. If the sum of these quotients is 
more than 7,000 but not more than 9,000, the population factor is 1.8. 
If the sum of these quotients is more than 9,000 the population factor 
is 2.0.

[[Page 737]]

    (c) In any case where a person is authorized under parts 50, 52, or 
54 of this chapter to operate two or more nuclear reactors at the same 
location, the total financial protection required of the licensee for 
all such reactors is the highest amount which would otherwise be 
required for any one of those reactors; provided, that such financial 
protection covers all reactors at the location.
    (d) Except in cases where the amount of financial protection 
calculated under this section is a multiple of $100,000, amounts 
determined pursuant to this section shall be adjusted to the next 
highest multiple of $100,000.

Sec. 140.13b  Amount of liability insurance required for uranium 
enrichment facilities.

    Each holder of a license issued under Parts 40 or 70 of this chapter 
for a uranium enrichment facility that involves the use of source 
material or special nuclear material is required to have and maintain 
liability insurance. The liability insurance must be the type and in the 
amounts the Commission considers appropriate to cover liability claims 
arising out of any occurrence within the United States that causes, 
within or outside the United States, bodily injury, sickness, disease, 
death, loss of or damage to property, or loss of use of property arising 
out of or resulting from the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other 
hazardous properties of chemical compounds containing source material or 
special nuclear material. Proof of liability insurance must be filed 
with the Commission as required by Sec. 140.15 before issuance of a 
license for a uranium enrichment facility under parts 40 and 70 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 140.14  Types of financial protection.

    (a) The amounts of financial protection required under this part may 
be furnished and maintained in the form of:

[[Page 738]]

    (1) An effective policy of liability insurance from private sources; 
or
    (2) Adequate resources to provide the financial protection required 
by Sec. Sec. 140.11, 140.12; 140.13 or Sec. 140.13a; or
    (3) Such other type of financial protection as the Commission may 
approve; or
    (4) Any combination of the foregoing.

<R05>
Sec. 140.15  Proof of financial protection.

    (a)(1) Licensees who maintain financial protection in whole or in 
part in the form of liability insurance shall provide proof of financial 
protection that consists of a copy of the liability policy (or policies) 
together with a certificate by the insurers issuing the policy stating 
that the copy is a true copy of the currently effective policy issued to 
the licensee. The licensee may furnish proof of financial protection in 
the form of the nuclear energy liability insurance policy set forth in 
Sec. 140.91 or in any other form acceptable to the Commission.
    (2) Such proof may alternatively, consist of a copy of the 
declarations page of a nuclear energy liability policy in the form set 
forth in Sec. 140.91 and issued to the licensee: Provided, That such 
policy form has been filed by the insurers with the Commission. The 
declarations page shall be accompanied by a certificate by the insurers 
stating that said copy is a true copy of the declarations page of a 
currently effective policy and identifying the policy (including 
endorsements) by reference to the policy form which has been filed by 
them with the Commission.
    (3) The Commission will accept any other form of nuclear energy 
liability insurance as proof of financial protection if it determines 
that the provisions of such insurance provide financial protection under 
the requirements of the Commission's regulations and the Act.
    (b) Proof of financial protection in the case of licensees who 
maintain financial protection in whole or in part in the form specified 
in Sec. 140.14(a)(2) shall consist of a showing that the licensee 
clearly has adequate resources to provide the financial protection 
required under this part. For this purpose the applicant or licensee 
shall file with the Commission:
    (1) Annual financial statements for the three complete calendar or 
fiscal years preceding the date of filing, together with an opinion 
thereon by a certified public accountant. The financial statements shall 
include balance sheets, operating statements and such supporting 
schedules as may be needed for interpretation of the balance sheets and 
operating statements.
    (2) If the most recent statements required under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section have been prepared as of a date more than 90 days prior to 
the date of filing, similar financial statements, prepared as of a date 
not more than 90 days prior to the date of filing, should be included. 
These statements need not be reviewed by a certified public accountant.
    (c) The Commission may require any licensee to file with the 
Commission such additional proof of financial protection or other 
financial information as the Commission determines to be appropriate for 
the purpose of determining whether the licensee is maintaining financial 
protection as required under this part.
    (d) Proof of financial protection shall be subject to the approval 
of the Commission.
    (e) The licensee shall promptly notify the Commission of any 
material change in proof of financial protection or in other financial 
information filed with the Commission under this part.

    In any case where a licensee undertakes to maintain financial 
protection in the form of liability insurance for all or part of the 
financial protection required by this part,
    (a) The Commission may require proof that the organization or 
organizations which have issued such policies are legally authorized to 
issue them and do business in the United States and have clear ability 
to meet their obligations; and
    (b) At least 30 days prior to the termination of any such policy, 
the licensee shall notify the Commission of the renewal of such policy 
or shall file other proof of financial protection.


<R05>
Sec. 140.18  Special provisions applicable to licensees furnishing 
financial protection in whole or in part in the form of 
adequate resources.

    In any case where a licensee undertakes to maintain financial 
protection in the form specified in Sec. 140.14(a)(2) for all or part

<R05>
Sec. 140.20  Indemnity agreements and liens.

    (a) The Commission will execute and issue agreements of indemnity 
pursuant to the regulations in this part or such other regulations as 
may be issued by the Commission. Such agreements, as to any licensee, 
shall be effective on:
    (1)(i) The effective date of the license (issued pursuant to part 50 
of this chapter) authorizing the licensee to operate the nuclear reactor 
involved; or
    (ii) The date that the Commission makes the finding under Sec. 
52.103(g) of this chapter; or
    (iii) The effective date of the license (issued under part 70 of 
this chapter) authorizing the licensee to possess and store special 
nuclear material at the site of the nuclear reactor for use as fuel in 
operation of the nuclear reactor after issuance of an operating license 
for the reactor, whichever is earlier. No such agreement, however, shall 
be effective prior to September 26, 1957; or
    (2) August 1, 1977 or the effective date of the license (issued 
pursuant to part 70 of this chapter) authorizing the licensee to possess 
and use plutonium at the site of the plutonium processing and fuel 
fabrication plant for processing in that plant, whichever date is later.
    (b) If the licensee fails to pay assessed deferred premiums, the 
Commission reserves the right to pay those premiums on behalf of the 
licensee and to recover the amount of such premiums from the licensee.
    (c) The Commission shall require the immediate submission of 
financial statements by those licensees who indicate, after an 
assessment of the retrospective premium by the insurance pools, that 
they will not pay the assessment. Such financial statements shall 
include, as a minimum, exhibits indicating internally generated funds 
from operations and accumulated retained earnings. Subsequent submission 
of financial statements by such licensees may be requested by the 
Commission, as required.
    (d) If premiums are paid by the Commission as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section, payment by the Commission shall create a lien in 
the amount paid in favor of the United States upon

[[Page 740]]

all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging 
to such licensee. The lien shall arise at the time payment is made by 
the Commission and shall continue until the liability for the amount (or 
a judgment against the licensee arising out of such liability) is 
satisfied or becomes unenforceable. The Commission will issue a 
certificate of release of any such lien if it finds that the liability 
for the amount has been fully satisfied or has become legally 
unenforceable.
    (e) If the Commission determines that the licensee is financially 
able to reimburse the Commission for a deferred premium payment made in 
its behalf, and the licensee, after notice of such determination by the 
Commission fails to make such reimbursement within 120 days, the 
Commission will take appropriate steps to suspend the license for 30 
days. The Commission may take such further action as is necessary if 
reimbursement is not made within the 30-day suspension period including 
but not limited to termination of the operating license.
    (f)(1)(i) The general form of indemnity agreement to be entered into 
by the Commission with reactor licensees who furnish financial 
protection in the form of the nuclear energy liability insurance policy 
set forth in appendix A is contained in Sec. 140.92, appendix B. The 
general form of indemnity agreement to be entered into by the Commission 
with reactor licensees who furnish financial protection in the form

    \2\ The form of the nuclear energy liability insurance policy for 
these licensees will be the subject of pertinent endorsements after 
discussion with the insurance pools.

<R04>
               Subpart E_Extraordinary Nuclear Occurrences


<R05>
Sec. 140.81  Scope and purpose.

    (a) Scope. This subpart applies to applicants for and holders of 
licenses authorizing operation of production facilities and utilization 
facilities, including combined licenses under part 52 of this chapter, 
and to other persons indemnified with respect to such facilities.
    (b) Purpose. One purpose of this subpart is to set forth the 
criteria which the Commission proposes to follow in order to determine 
whether there has been an ``extraordinary nuclear occurrence.'' The 
other purpose is to establish the conditions of the waivers of defenses 
proposed for incorporation in indemnity agreements and insurance 
policies or contracts furnished as proof of financial protection.
    (1) The system is to come into effect only where the discharge or 
dispersal constitutes a substantial amount of source, special nuclear or 
byproduct material, or has caused substantial radiation levels offsite. 
The various limits in present NRC regulations are not appropriate for 
direct application in the determination of an ``extraordinary nuclear 
occurrence,'' for they were arrived at with other purposes in mind, and 
those limits have been set at a level which is conservatively arrived at 
by incorporating a significant safety factor. Thus, a discharge or 
dispersal which exceeds the limits in NRC regulations, or in license 
conditions, although possible cause for concern, is not one which would 
be expected to cause substantial injury or damage unless it exceeds by 
some significant multiple the appropriate regulatory limit. Accordingly, 
in arriving at the values in the criteria to be deemed ``substantial'' 
it is more appropriate to adopt values separate from NRC health and 
safety regulations, and, of course, the selection of these values will 
not in any way affect such regulations. A substantial discharge, for 
purposes of the criteria, represents a perturbation of the environment 
which is clearly above that which could be anticipated from the conduct 
of normal activities. The criteria are intended solely for the purposes 
of administration of the Commission's statutory responsibilities under 
Pub. L. 89-645, and are not intended to indicate a level of discharge or 
dispersal at which damage to persons or property necessarily will occur, 
or a level at which damage is likely to occur, or even a level at which 
some type of protective action is indicated. It should be clearly 
understood that the criteria in no way establish or indicate that there 
is a specific threshold of exposure at which biological damage from 
radiation will take place. It cannot be emphasized too frequently that 
the levels set to be used as criteria for the first part of the 
determination, that is, the criteria for amounts offsite or radiation 
levels offsite which are substantial, are not meant to indicate that, 
because such amounts or levels are determined to be substantial for 
purposes of administration, they are ``substantial'' in terms of their 
propensity for causing injury or damage.
    (2) It is the purpose of the second part of the determination that 
the Commission decide whether there have in fact been or will probably 
be substantial damages to persons offsite or property offsite. The 
criteria for substantial damages were formulated, and the numerical 
values selected, on a wholly different basis from that on which the 
criteria used for the first part of the determination with respect to 
substantial discharge were derived.

[[Page 743]]

The only interrelation between the values selected for the discharge 
criteria and the damage criteria is that the discharge values are set so 
low that it is extremely unlikely the damage criteria could be satisfied 
unless the discharge values have been exceeded.
    (3) The first part of the test is designed so that the Commission 
can assure itself that something exceptional has occurred; that 
something untoward and unexpected has in fact taken place and that this 
event is of sufficient significance to raise the possibility that some 
damage to persons or property offsite has resulted or may result. If 
there appears to be no damage, the waivers will not apply because the 
Commission will be unable, under the second part of the test, to make a 
determination that ``substantial damages'' have resulted or will 
probably result. If damages have resulted or will probably result, they 
could vary from de minimis to serious, and the waivers will not apply 
until the damages, both actual and probable, are determined to be 
``substantial'' within the second part of the test.
    (4) The presence or absence of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence 
determination does not concomitantly determine whether or not a 
particular claimant will recover on his claim. In effect, it is intended 
primarily to determine whether certain potential obstacles to recovery 
are to be removed from the route the claimant would ordinarily follow to 
seek compensation for his injury or damage. If there has not been an 
extraordinary nuclear occurrence determination, the claimant must 
proceed (in the absence of settlement) with a tort action subject to 
whatever issues must be met, and whatever defenses are available to the 
defendant, under the law applicable in the relevant jurisdiction. If 
there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence determination, the 
claimant must still proceed (in the absence of settlement) with a tort 
action, but the claimant's burden is substantially eased by the 
elimination of certain issues which may be involved and certain defenses 
which may be available to the defendant. In either case the defendant 
may defend with respect to such of the following matters as are in issue 
in any given claim: The nature of the claimant's alleged damages, the 
causal relationship between the event and the alleged damages, and the 
amount of the alleged damages.

<R05>
Sec. 140.82  Procedures.

    (a) The Commission may initiate, on its own motion, the making of a 
determination as to whether or not there has been an extraordinary 
nuclear occurrence. In the event the Commission does not so initiate the 
making of a determination, any affected person, or any licensee or 
person with whom an indemnity agreement is executed or a person 
providing financial protection may petition the Commission for a 
determination of whether or not there has been an extraordinary nuclear 
occurrence. If the Commission does not have, or does not expect to have, 
within 7 days after it has received notification of an alleged event, 
enough information available to make a determination that there has been 
an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, the Commission will publish a 
notice in the Federal Register setting forth the date and place of the 
alleged event and requesting any persons having knowledge thereof to 
submit their information to the Commission.
    (b) When a procedure is initiated under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Commission will designate members of the principal staff to 
begin immediately to assemble the relevant information and prepare a 
report on which the Commission can make its determination.

    If the Commission determines that both of the criteria set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 140.84 and 140.85 have been met, it will make the 
determination that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. 
If the Commission publishes a notice in the Federal Register in 
accordance with Sec. 140.82(a) and does not make a determination within 
90 days thereafter that there has been an extraordinary

Sec. 140.84  Criterion I--Substantial discharge of radioactive 
material or substantial radiation levels offsite.

    The Commission will determine that there has been a substantial 
discharge or dispersal of radioactive material offsite, or that there 
have been substantial levels of radiation offsite, when, as a result of 
an event comprised of one or more related happenings, radioactive 
material is released from its intended place of confinement or radiation 
levels occur offsite and either of the following findings are also made:
    (a) The Commission finds that one or more persons offsite were, 
could have been, or might be exposed to radiation or to radioactive 
material, resulting in a dose or in a projected dose in excess of one of 
the levels in the following table:

    (2) Radioactive material that may be taken into the body from its 
occurrence in air or water; and
    (3) Radioactive material that may be taken into the body from its 
occurrence in food or on terrestrial surfaces.
    (b) The Commission finds that:
    (1) Surface contamination of at least a total of any 100 square 
meters of offsite property has occurred as the result of a release of 
radioactive material from a production or utilization facility and such 
contamination is characterized by levels of radiation in excess of one 
of the values listed in Column 1 or Column 2 of the following table, or
    (2) Surface contamination of any offsite property has occurred as 
the result of a release of radioactive material in the course of 
transportation and such contamination is characterized by levels of 
radiation in excess of one of the values listed in column 2 of the 
following table:

Sec. 140.85  Criterion II--Substantial damages to persons offsite
or property offsite.

    (a) After the Commission has determined that an event has satisfied 
Criterion I, the Commission will determine that the event has resulted 
or will probably result in substantial damages to persons offsite or 
property offsite if any of the following findings are made:
    (1) The Commission finds that such event has resulted in the death 
or hospitalization, within 30 days of the event, of five or more people 
located offsite showing objective clinical evidence of physical injury 
from exposure to the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous 
properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material; or
    (2) The Commission finds that $2,500,000 or more of damage offsite 
has been or will probably be sustained by any one person, or $5 million 
or more of such damage in the aggregate has been or will probably be 
sustained, as the result of such event; or

[[Page 745]]

    (3) The Commission finds that $5,000 or more of damage offsite has 
been or will probably be sustained by each of 50 or more persons, 
provided that $1 million or more of such damage in the aggregate has 
been or will probably be sustained, as the result of such event.
    (b) As used in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section, 
``damage'' shall be that arising out of or resulting from the 
radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of source, 
special nuclear, or byproduct material, and shall be based upon 
estimates of one or more of the following:
    (1) Total cost necessary to put affected property back into use,
    (2) Loss of use of affected property,
    (3) Value of affected property where not practical to restore to 
use,
    (4) Financial loss resulting from protective actions appropriate to 
reduce or avoid exposure to radiation or to radioactive materials.

                               Conditions

    1. Premium--(1) Definitions. With reference to the premium for this 
policy: advance premium, for any calendar year, is the estimated 
standard premium for that calendar year;
    Standard premium, for any calendar year, is the premium for that 
calendar year computed in accordance with the companies' rules, rates, 
rating plans (other than the Industry Credit Rating Plan), premiums and 
minimum premiums applicable to this insurance;
    Reserve premium means that portion of the standard premium paid to 
the companies and specifically allocated under the Industry Credit 
Rating Plan for incurred losses. The amount of the reserve premium for 
this policy

[[Page 748]]

for any calendar year during which this policy is in force is the amount 
designated as such in the Standard Premium Endorsement for that calendar 
year;
    Industry reserve premium, for any calendar year, is the sum of the 
reserve premiums for that calendar year for all Nuclear Energy Liability 
Policies issued by the Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association 
and Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters and subject to the 
Industry Credit Rating Plan;
    Policy refund ratio, for any calendar year, is the ratio of the 
named insured's reserve premium for that calendar year to the industry 
reserve premium for that calendar year;
    Incurred losses means the sum of:
    (1) All losses and expenses by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance 
Association and Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters, and
    (2) All reserves for unpaid losses and expenses as estimated by 
Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association and Mutual Atomic Energy 
Liability Underwriters because of obligations assumed and the expenses 
incurred in connection with such obligations by members of Nuclear 
Energy Liability Insurance Association and Mutual Atomic Energy 
Liability Underwriters under all Nuclear Energy Liability Policies 
issued by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association and Mutual 
Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters and subject to the Industry Credit 
Rating Plan;
    Reserve for refunds, at the end of any calendar year, is the amount 
by which (1) the sum of all industry reserve premiums for the period 
from January 1, 1957 through the end of such calendar year exceeds (2) 
the total for the same period of (a) all incurred losses, valued as of 
the next following July 1, and (b) all reserve premium refunds made 
under the Industry Credit Rating Plan by members of Nuclear Energy 
Liability Insurance Association and Mutual Atomic Energy Liability 
Underwriters;
    Industry reserve premium refund, for any calendar year, is 
determined by multiplying the reserve for refunds at the end of the 
ninth calendar year thereafter by the ratio of the industry reserve 
premium for the calendar year for which the premium refund is being 
determined to the sum of such amount and the total industry reserve 
premiums for the next nine calendar years thereafter, provided that the 
industry reserve premium refund for any calendar year shall in no event 
be greater than the industry reserve premium for such calendar year.
    (2) Payment of advance and standard premiums. The named insured 
shall pay the companies the advance premium stated in the declarations, 
for the period from the effective date of this policy through December 
31 following. Thereafter, at the beginning of each calendar year while 
this policy is in force, the named insured shall pay the advance premium 
for such year to the companies. The advance premium for each calendar 
year shall be stated in the Advance Premium Endorsement for such 
calendar year issued to the named insured as soon as practicable prior 
to or after the beginning of such year.
    As soon as practicable after each December 31 and after the 
termination of this policy, the standard premium for the preceding 
calendar year shall be finally determined and stated in the Standard 
Premium Endorsement for that calendar year. If the standard premium so 
determined exceeds the advance premium previously paid for such calendar 
year, the named insured shall pay the excess to the companies; if less, 
the companies shall return to the named insured the excess portion paid 
by such insured.
    The named insured shall maintain records of the information 
necessary for premium computation and shall send copies of such records 
to the companies as directed, at the end of each calendar year, at the 
end of the policy period and at such other times during the policy 
period as the companies may direct.
    (3) Use of reserve premiums. All reserve premiums paid or payable 
for this policy may be used by the members of Nuclear Energy Liability 
Insurance Association or Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters to 
discharge their obligations with respect to incurred losses whether such 
losses are incurred under this policy or under any other policy issued 
by the Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or Mutual Atomic 
Energy Liability Underwriters.
    (4) Reserve premium refunds. A portion of the reserve premium for 
this policy for the first calendar year of any group of ten consecutive 
calendar years shall be returnable to the named insured provided there 
is a reserve for refunds at the end of the tenth calendar year.
    (5) Computation of reserve premium refunds. The reserve premium 
refund due the named insured for any calendar year shall be determined 
by multiplying any industry reserve premium refund for such calendar 
year by the policy refund ratio for such calendar year. The reserve 
premium refund for any calendar year shall be finally determined as soon 
as practicable after July 1 of the tenth calendar year thereafter.
    (6) Final premium. The final premium for this policy shall be the 
sum of the standard premiums for each calendar year, or portion thereof, 
during which this policy remains in force less the sum of all refunds of 
reserve premiums due the named insured under the provisions of this 
Condition 1.
    (7) Reserve premium refund agreement. Each member of Nuclear Energy 
Liability Insurance Association or Mutual Atomic Energy Liability 
Underwriters subscribing this policy for any calendar year, or portion 
thereof, thereby agrees for itself, severally and not

[[Page 749]]

jointly, and in the respective proportion of its liability assumed under 
this policy for that calendar year, to return to the named insured that 
portion of any reserve premium refund due the named insured for that 
calendar year, determined in accordance with the provisions of this 
Condition 1.
    2. Inspection; suspension. The companies shall be permitted to 
inspect the facility and to examine the insured's books and records at 
any time, as far as they relate to the subject-matter of this insurance.
    If a representative of the companies discovers a condition which he 
believes to be unduly dangerous with respect to the nuclear energy 
hazard, a representative of the companies may request that such 
condition be corrected without delay. In the event of noncompliance with 
such request, a representative of the companies may, by notice to the 
named insured, to any other person or organization considered by the 
companies to be responsible for the continuance of such dangerous 
condition, and to the United States Atomic Energy Commission, suspend 
the insurance with respect to the named insured and such other person or 
organization effective 12:00 midnight of the next business day of such 
Commission following the date that such Commission receives such notice. 
The period of such suspension shall terminate as of the time stated in a 
written notice from the companies to the named insured and to each such 
person or organization that such condition has been corrected.
    3. Limit of liability; termination of policy upon exhaustion of 
limit. Regardless of the number of persons and organizations who are 
insureds under this policy, and regardless of the number of claims made 
and suits brought against any or all insureds because of one or more 
occurrences resulting in bodily injury or property damage caused during 
the policy period by the nuclear energy hazard, the limit of the 
companies' liability stated in the declarations is the total liability 
of the companies for their obligations under this policy and the 
expenses incurred by the companies in connection with such obligations, 
including.
    (a) Payments in settlement of claims and in satisfaction of 
judgments against the insureds for damages because of bodily injury or 
property damage, payments made under parts (2), (3) and (4) of Coverage 
A and payments made in settlement of claims under Coverages B and C;
    (b) Payments for expenses incurred in the investigation, 
negotiation, settlement and defense of any claim or suit, including, but 
not limited to, the cost of such services by salaried employees of the 
companies, fees and expenses of independent adjusters, attorneys' fees 
and disbursements, expenses for expert testimony, inspection and 
appraisal of property, examination, X-ray or autopsy or medical expenses 
of any kind;
    (c) Payments for expenses incurred by the companies in investigating 
an occurrence resulting in bodily injury or property damage or in 
minimizing its effects.

Each payment made by the companies in discharge of their obligations 
under this policy or for expenses incurred in connection with such 
obligations shall reduce by the amount of such payment the limit of the 
companies' liability under this policy.
    If, during the policy period or subsequent thereto, the total of 
such payments made by the companies shall exhaust the limit of the 
companies' liability under this policy, all liability and obligations of 
the companies under this policy shall thereupon terminate and shall be 
conclusively presumed to have been discharged. This policy, if not 
theretofore canceled, shall thereupon automatically terminate.
    Regardless of the number of years this policy shall continue in 
force and the number of premiums which shall be payable or paid, the 
limit of the companies' liability stated in the declarations shall not 
be cumulative from year to year.
    4. Limitation of liability; common occurrence. Any occurrence or 
series of occurrences resulting in bodily injury or property damage 
arising out of the radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous 
properties of
    (a) Nuclear material discharged or dispersed from the facility over 
a period of days, weeks, months or longer and also arising out of such 
properties of other nuclear material so discharged or dispersed from one 
or more other nuclear facilities insured by the companies under a 
Nuclear Energy Liability Policy (Facility Form), or
    (b) Source material, special nuclear material, spent fuel or waste 
in the course of transportation for which insurance is afforded under 
this policy and also arising out of such properties of other source 
material, special nuclear material, spent fuel or waste in the course of 
transportation for which insurance is afforded under one or more other 
Nuclear Energy Liability Policies (Facility Form) issued by the 
companies, shall be deemed to be a common occurrence resulting in bodily 
injury or property damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard.
    With respect to such bodily injury and property damage (1) the total 
aggregate liability of the companies under all Nuclear Energy Liability 
Policies (Facility Form), including this policy, applicable to such 
common occurrence shall be the sum of the limits of liability of all 
such policies, the limit of liability of each such policy being as 
determined by Condition 3 thereof, but in no event shall such total 
aggregate liability of

[[Page 750]]

the companies exceed $--------------;\1\ (2) the total liability of the 
companies under this policy shall not exceed that proportion of the 
total aggregate liability of the companies, as stated in clause (1) 
above, which (a) the limit of liability of this policy, as determined by 
Condition 3, bears to (b) the sum of the limits of liability of all such 
policies issued by the companies, the limit of liability of each such 
policy being as determined by Condition 3, thereof.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For policies issued by Nuclear Energy Liability-Property 
Insurance Association the amount will be ``$124,000,000,'' for policies 
issued by Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters, the amount will 
be ``$36,000,000.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The provisions of this condition shall not operate to increase the 
limit of the companies' liability under this policy.
    5. Notice of occurrence, claim, or suit. In the event of bodily 
injury or property damage to which this policy applies or of an 
occurrence which may give rise to claims therefor, written notice 
containing particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also 
reasonably obtainable information with respect to the time, place and 
circumstances thereof, and the names and addresses of the injured and of 
available witnesses, shall be given by or for the insured to ----------
--or the companies as soon as practicable. If claim is made or suit is 
brought against the insured, he shall immediately forward to ---------- 
or the companies every demand, notice, summons or other process received 
by him or his representative.
    6. Assistance and cooperation of the insured. The insured shall 
cooperate with the companies and, upon the companies' request, attend 
hearings and trials and assist in making settlements, securing and 
giving evidence, obtaining the attendance of witnesses and in the 
conduct of any legal proceedings in connection with the subject matter 
of this insurance. The insured shall not, except at his own cost, make 
any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense.
    7. Action against companies--Coverages A and C. No action shall lie 
against the companies or any of them unless, as a condition precedent 
thereto, the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of 
this policy, nor until the amount of the insured's obligation to pay 
shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the 
insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the 
claimant and the companies.
    Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who 
has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be 
entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance 
afforded by this policy. No person or organization shall have any right 
under this policy to join the companies or any of them as parties to any 
action against the insured to determine the insured's liability, nor 
shall the companies or any of them be impleaded by the insured or his 
legal representative. Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the 
insured's estate shall not relieve the companies of any of their 
obligations hereunder.
    8. Action against companies--Coverage B. No suit or action on this 
policy for the recovery of any claim for property damage to which 
Coverage B applies shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity 
unless all the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with 
and unless commenced within two years after the occurrence resulting in 
such property damage.
    9. Insured's duties when loss occurs--Coverage B. In the event of 
property damage to which Coverage B applies, the insured shall furnish a 
complete inventory of the property damage claimed, showing in detail the 
amount thereof. Within ninety-one days after the occurrence resulting in 
such property damage, unless such time is extended in writing by the 
companies, the insured shall render to the companies a proof of loss, 
signed and sworn to by the insured, stating the knowledge and belief of 
the insured as to the following: identification of such occurrence; the 
interest of the insured in the property destroyed or damaged, and the 
amount of each item of property damage claimed; all encumbrances on such 
property; and all other contracts of insurance, whether valid or not, 
covering any of such property. The insured shall include in the proof of 
loss a copy of all descriptions and schedules in all policies. Upon the 
companies' request, the insured shall furnish verified plans and 
specifications of any such property. The insured, as often as may be 
reasonably required, shall exhibit to any person designated by the 
companies any of such property, and submit to examinations under oath by 
any person named by the companies and subscribe the same; and, as often 
as may be reasonably required, shall produce for examination all books 
of account, records, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified 
copies thereof if originals be lost, at such reasonable time and place 
as may be designated by the companies or their representatives, and 
shall permit extracts and copies thereof to be made.
    10. Appraisal--Coverage B. In case the insured and the companies 
shall fail to agree as to the amount of property damage, then, on the 
written demand of either, each shall select a competent and 
disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected 
within twenty days of such demand. The appraisers shall first select a 
competent and disinterested umpire and, failing for fifteen days to 
agree upon such umpire, then, on request of the insured or the 
companies,

[[Page 751]]

such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the 
state in which the property is located. The appraisers shall then 
appraise each item of property damage and, failing to agree, shall 
submit their differences only to the umpire. An award in writing, so 
itemized, of any two when filed with the companies shall determine the 
amount of property damage. Each appraiser shall be paid by the party 
selecting him and the expenses of the appraisal and umpire shall be paid 
by the parties equally. The companies shall not be held to have waived 
any of their rights by any act relating to appraisal.
    11. Subrogation. In the event of any payment under this policy, the 
companies shall be subrogated to all the insured's rights of recovery 
therefor against any person or organization, and the insured shall 
execute and deliver instruments and papers and do whatever else is 
necessary to secure such rights. Prior to knowledge of bodily injury or 
property damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard the insured may 
waive in writing any right or recovery against any person or 
organization, but after such knowledge the insured shall not waive or 
otherwise prejudice any such right of recovery.
    The companies hereby waive any rights of subrogation acquired 
against the United States of America or any of its agencies by reason of 
any payment under this policy.
    The companies do not relinquish, by the foregoing provisions, any 
right to restitution from the insured out of any recoveries made by the 
insured on account of a loss covered by this policy of any amounts to 
which the companies would be entitled had such provisions, or any of 
them, not been included in this policy.
    12. Other insurance. If the insurance afforded by this policy for 
loss or expense is concurrent with insurance afforded for such loss or 
expense by a Nuclear Energy Liability Policy (Facility Form) issued to 
the named insured by ---------- hereinafter called ``concurrent 
insurance,'' the companies shall not be liable under this policy for a 
greater proportion of such loss or expense than the limit of liability 
stated in the declarations of this policy bears to the sum of such limit 
and the limit of liability stated in the declarations of such concurrent 
policy.
    If the insured has other valid and collectible insurance (other than 
such concurrent insurance or any other nuclear energy liability 
insurance issued by the companies or ---------- to any person or 
organization) applicable to loss or expense covered by this policy, the 
insurance afforded by this policy shall be excess insurance over such 
other insurance; provided, with respect to any person who is not 
employed at and in connection with the facility, such insurance as is 
afforded by this policy for bodily injury to an employee of the insured 
arising out of and in the course of his employment shall be primary 
insurance under such other insurance.
    13. Changes. Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any agent 
or by any other person shall not effect a waiver or a change in any part 
of this policy or stop the companies from asserting any right under the 
terms of this policy; nor shall the terms of this policy be waived or 
changed except by endorsement issued to form a part of this policy 
executed by ---------- on behalf of the companies.
    14. Assignment. Assignment of interest by the named insured shall 
not bind the companies until their consent is endorsed hereon; if, 
however, the named insured shall die or be declared bankrupt or 
insolvent, this policy shall cover such insured's legal representative, 
receiver or trustee as an insured under this policy, but only with 
respect to his liability as such, and then only provided written notice 
of his appointment as legal representative, receiver or trustee is given 
to the companies within ten days after such appointment.
    15. Cancellation. This policy may be canceled by the named insured 
by mailing to the companies and the United States Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission written notice stating when, not less than thirty days 
thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective. This policy may be 
canceled by the companies by mailing to the named insured at the address 
shown in this policy and to the United States Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission written notice stating when, not less than ninety days 
thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; provided in the event 
of non-payment of premium or if the operator of the facility, as 
designated in the declarations, is replaced by another person or 
organization, this policy may be canceled by the companies by mailing to 
the named insured at the address shown in this policy and to the United 
States Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice stating when, not 
less than thirty days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective. 
The mailing of notice as aforesaid shall be sufficient proof of notice. 
The effective date and hour of cancellation stated in the notice shall 
become the end of the policy period. Delivery of such written notice 
either by the named insured or by the companies shall be equivalent to 
mailing.
    Upon termination or cancellation of this policy, other than as of 
the end of December 31 in any year, the earned premium for the period 
this policy has been in force since the preceding December 31 shall be 
computed in accordance with the following provisions:
    (a) If this policy is terminated, pursuant to Condition 3, by reason 
of the exhaustion of the limit of the companies' liability, all premium 
theretofore paid or payable shall be fully earned;

[[Page 752]]

    (b) If the named insured cancels, the earned premium for such period 
shall be computed in accordance with the customary annual short rate 
table and procedure, provided if the named insured cancels after 
knowledge of bodily injury or property damage caused by the nuclear 
energy hazard, all premiums theretofore paid or payable shall be fully 
earned;
    (c) If the companies cancel, the earned premium for such period 
shall be computed pro rata.

Premium adjustment, if any, may be made either at the time cancellation 
is effected or as soon as practicable after cancellation becomes 
effective, but payment or tender of unearned premium is not a condition 
of cancellation.
    16. Company representation. (a) Any notice, sworn statement or proof 
of loss which may be required by the provisions of this policy may be 
given to any one of the companies, and such notice, statement or proof 
of loss so given shall be valid and binding as to all companies.
    (b) In any action or suit against the companies, service of process 
may be made on any one of them, and such service shall be deemed valid 
and binding service on all companies.
    (c) ---------- is the agent of the companies with respect to all 
matters pertaining to this insurance. All notices or other 
communications required by this policy to be given to the companies may 
be given to such agent, at its office at ---------- with the same force 
and effect as if given directly to the companies. Any requests, demands 
or agreements made by such agent shall be deemed to have been made 
directly by the companies.
    17. Authorization of named insured. Except with respect to 
compliance with the obligations imposed on the insured by Conditions 5, 
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of this policy, the named insured is authorized to 
act for every other insured in all matters pertaining to this insurance.
    18. Changes in subscribing companies and in their proportionate 
liability. By acceptance of this policy the named insured agrees that 
the members of ---------- liable under this policy, and the 
proportionate liability of each such member, may change from year to 
year, and further agrees that regardless of such changes:
    (1) Each company subscribing this policy upon its issuance shall be 
liable only for its stated proportion of any obligation assumed or 
expense incurred under this policy because of bodily injury or property 
damage caused, during the period from the effective date of this policy 
to the close of December 31 next following, by the nuclear energy 
hazard; for each subsequent calendar year, beginning January 1 next 
following the effective date of this policy, the subscribing companies 
and the proportionate liability of each such company shall be stated in 
an endorsement issued to form a part of this policy, duly executed and 
attested by the ---------- of ------------------------ on behalf of each 
such company, and mailed or delivered to the named insured;
    (2) This policy shall remain continuously in effect from the 
effective date stated in the declarations until terminated in accordance 
with Condition 3 or Condition 15;
    (3) Neither the liability of any company nor the limit of liability 
stated in the declarations shall be cumulative from year to year.
    19. Declarations. By acceptance of this policy the named insured 
agrees that the statements in the declarations are the agreements and 
representations of the named insured, that this policy is issued in 
reliance upon the truth of such representations and that this policy 
embodies all agreements between the named insured and the companies or 
any of their agents relating to this insurance.
    In Witness Whereof, each of the subscribing companies has caused 
this policy to be executed and attested on its behalf by the -------- of 
-------------------- and duly countersigned on the declarations page by 
an authorized representative.
    For the subscribing companies.

(Facility Form) issued by -------- or by -------- or
    (2) any other nuclear facility,

if financial protection is required pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of

operations conducted thereat:
    III. Condition 4 is replaced by the following:
    Limitation of liability; common occurrence. Any occurrence or series 
of occurrences resulting in bodily injury or property damage arising out 
of the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of
    (a) nuclear material discharged or dispersed from the facility over 
a period of days, weeks, months or longer and also arising out of such 
properties of other nuclear material so discharged or dispersed from one 
or more other nuclear facilities insured under any Nuclear Energy 
Liability Policy (Facility Form) issued by ------------ or,
    (b) source material, special nuclear material, spent fuel or waste 
in the course of transportation for which insurance is afforded under

transportation for which insurance is afforded under one or more other 
Nuclear Energy Liability Policies (Facility Form) issued by ------------
----.

shall be deemed to be a common occurrence resulting in bodily injury or 
property damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard.
    With respect to such bodily injury and property damage (1) the total 
aggregate liability of the members of --------, under all Nuclear Energy 
Liability Policies (Facility Form), including this policy, applicable to 
such common occurrence shall be the sum of the limits of liability of

of and in the course of his employment shall be primary insurance under 
such other insurance.

expenses incurred because of bodily injury or property damage caused 
during the period from the effective date of this endorsement to the 
termination of the policy, by the nuclear energy hazard.

    Note: When the reduction of the limit of liability results from a

    (b) Arises out of or results from or occurs in the course of the 
transportation of nuclear material to or from the facility, the insureds 
and the companies agree to waive
    (1) Any issue or defense as to the conduct of the claimant or the 
fault of the insureds, including, but not limited to:
    (i) Negligence,
    (ii) Contributory negligence,
    (iii) Assumption of risk, and
    (iv) Unforeseeable intervening causes whether involving the conduct 
of a third person or an act of God,
    (2) Any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity, 
and
    (3) Any issue or defense based on any statue of limitations if suit 
is instituted within 3 years from the date on which the claimant first 
knew, or reasonably could have known, of his bodily injury or property 
damage and the cause thereof, but in no event more than 10 years after 
the date of the nuclear incident.

The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective regardless of 
whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or 
relating to an element in the cause of action.
    2. The waivers set forth in paragraph 1 above do not apply to
    (a) Bodily injury or property damage which is intentionally 
sustained by the claimant or

[[Page 755]]

which results from a nuclear incident intentionally and wrongfully 
caused by the claimant;
    (b) Bodily injury sustained by any claimant who is employed at the 
site of and in connection with the activity where the extraordinary 
nuclear occurrence takes place if benefits therefor are either payable 
or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation or 
occupational disease law;
    (c) Any claim for punitive or exemplary damages, provided, with 
respect to any claim for wrongful death under any State law which 
provides for damages only punitive in nature, this exclusion does not

exceed the maximum amount otherwise recoverable under such law.
    3. The waivers set forth in paragraph 1 above shall be effective 
only with respect to bodily injury or property damage to which the 
policy applies under its terms other than this endorsement.
    Such waivers shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or 
defense of any claim or portion of claim which is not within the 
protection afforded under--
    (1) The provisions of the policy applicable to the financial 
protection required of the named insured,
    (2) The agreement of indemnification between the named insured and 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission made pursuant to section 170 of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
    (3) The limit of liability provisions of subsection 170 e. of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

Such waivers shall not preclude a defense based upon the failure of the 
claimant to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages.
    4. Subject to all of the limitations stated in this endorsement and 
in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the waivers set forth in 
paragraph 1 above shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with 
their terms against any insured in an action to recover damages because 
of bodily injury or property damage to which the policy applies as proof 
of financial protection.
    5. As used herein:
    Extraordinary nuclear occurrence means an event which the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission has determined to be an extraordinary nuclear 
occurrence as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 
financial protection and nuclear incident have the meanings given them 
in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    Claimant means the person or organization actually sustaining the 
bodily injury or property damage and also includes his assignees, legal 
representatives and other persons or organizations entitled to bring an 
action for damages on account of such injury or damage.

however, that with respect to bodily injury or property damage resulting 
from an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. Insuring Agreement IV, 
``Application of Policy,'' shall not operate to bar coverage for bodily 
injury or property damage (a) which is caused during the policy period 
by the nuclear energy hazard and (b) which is discovered and for which 
written claim is made against the insured not later than twenty (20) 
years after the date of the extraordinary nuclear occurrence.

protection required of the named insured;
    (b) The agreement of indemnification between the named insured and 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission made pursuant to section 170 of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; and
    (c) The limit of liability provisions of Subsection 170e. of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    Such waivers shall not preclude a defense based upon the failure of 
the claimant to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages.
    4. Subject to all of the limitations stated in this endorsement and 
in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the waivers set forth in 
paragraph 1. above shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with 
their terms against any insured in an action to recover damages because 
of bodily injury or property damage to which the policy applies as proof 
of financial protection.
    5. As used herein:
    Extraordinary nuclear occurrence means an event which the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission has determined to be an extraordinary nuclear 
occurrence as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    Financial protection and nuclear incident have the meanings given 
them in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    Claimant means the person or organization actually sustaining the 
bodily injury or property damage and also includes his assignees, legal 
representatives and other persons or organizations entitled to bring an 
action for damages on account of such injury or damage.

deviations in the course of the transportation for the purpose of going 
to any other country, state or nation, except a deviation in the course

the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    II. Insuring Agreement IV is replaced by the following:
    IV. APPLICATION OF POLICY. This policy applies only to bodily injury 
or property damage (1) which is caused during the policy period by the 
nuclear energy hazard and (2) which is discovered and for which written 
claim is made against the insured, not later than ten years after the 
end of the policy period.
    III. Condition 2 is replaced by the following:
    2. INSPECTION: SUSPENSION. The companies shall at any time be 
permitted but not obligated to inspect the facility and all operations 
relating thereto and to examine the insured's books and records as far 
as they relate to the subject of this insurance and any property 
insurance afforded the insured through American Nuclear Insurers. If a 
representative of the companies discovers a condition which he believes 
to be unduly dangerous with respect to the nuclear energy hazard, a 
representative of the companies may request that such condition be 
corrected without delay. In the event of noncompliance with such 
request, a representative of the companies may, by notice to the named 
insured, to any other person or organization considered by the companies 
to be responsible for the continuation of such dangerous condition, and 
to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, suspend this 
insurance with respect to named insured and such other person or 
organization effective 12:00 midnight of the next business day of such 
Commission following the date that such Commission receives such notice. 
The period of such suspension shall terminate as of the time stated in a 
written notice from the companies to the named insured and to each such 
person or organization that such condition has been corrected.
    Neither the right to make such inspections and examinations nor the 
making thereof nor any advice or report resulting therefrom shall 
constitute an undertaking, on behalf of or for the benefit of the 
insured or others, to determine or warrant that such facility or 
operations are safe or healthful, or are in compliance with any law, 
rule or regulation. In consideration of the issuance or continuation of 
this policy, the insured agrees that neither the companies nor any 
pesons or organizations making such inspections or exminations on their 
behalf shall be liable with respect to injury to or destruction of 
property at the facility, or any consequential loss or expense resulting 
therefrom, or any loss resulting from interruption of business or 
manufacture, arising out of the making of or a failure to make any such 
inspection or examination, or any report thereon, or any such suspension 
of insurance, but this

[[Page 759]]

provision does not limit the contractual obligations of the companies 
under this policy or any policy affording the insured property insurance 
through American Nuclear Insurers.
    IV. Condition 4 is replaced by the following:
    4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: COMMON OCCURRENCE. Any occurrence or 
series of occurrences resulting in bodily injury or property damage 
arising out of the radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous 
properties of
    (a) nuclear material discharged or dispersed from the facility over 
a period of days, weeks, months or longer and also arising out of the 
properties of other nuclear material so discharged or dispersed from one 
or more other nuclear facilities insured under any Nuclear Energy 
Liability Policy (Facility Form) issued by Nuclear Energy Liability 
Insurance Association, or
    (b) source material, special nuclear material, spent fuel or waste 
in the course of transportation for which insurance is afforded under 
this policy and also arising out of such properties of other source 
material, special nuclear material, spent fuel or waste in the course of 
transportation for which insurance is afforded under one or more other 
Nuclear Energy Liability Policies (Facility Form) issued by Nuclear 
Energy Liability Insurance Association, shall be deemed to be a common 
occurrence resulting in bodily injury or property damage caused by the 
nuclear energy hazard.
    With respect to such bodily injury and property damage (1) the total 
aggregate liability of the members of the Nuclear Energy Liability 
Insurance Association under all Nuclear Energy Liability Policies 
(Facility Form), including this policy, applicable to such common 
occurrence shall be the sum of the limits of liability of all such 
policies, the limit of liability of each such policy being as determined 
by Condition 3 thereof, but in no event shall such total aggregate 
liability of such members exceed $124,000,000; (2) the total liability 
of the companies under this policy shall not exceed that proportion of 
the total aggregate liability of the members of Nuclear Energy Liability 
Insurance Association, as stated in clause (1) above, which (a) the 
limit of liability of this policy, as determined by Condition 3, bears 
to (b) the sum of the limits of liability of all such policies issued by 
such members, the limit of liability of each such policy being as 
determined by Condition 3 thereof.
    The provisions of this condition shall not operate to increase the 
limit of the companies' liability under this policy.
    V. The second paragraph of Condition 12, Other Insurance, is amended 
to read:
    If the insured has other valid and collectible insurance (other than 
such concurrent insurance or any other nuclear energy liability 
insurance issued by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or 
Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters to any person or 
organization) applicable to loss or expense covered by this policy, the 
insurance afforded by this policy shall be excess insurance over such 
other insurance; provided, with respect to any person who is not 
employed at and in connection with the facility, such insurance as is 
afforded by this policy for bodily injury to an employee of the insured 
arising out of and in the course of his employment shall be primary 
insurance under such other insurance.
    VI. Paragraph (c) of Condition 16, Company Representation, is 
amended to read:
    (c) Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association is the agent of 
the companies with respect to all matters pertaining to this insurance. 
All notices or other communications required by this policy to be given 
to the companies may be given to such agent, at its office at the 
Exchange, Suite 245, 270 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, Connecticut 
06032, with the same force and effect as if given directly to the

          Amendment of Coverage Endorsement for Workers Claims

                             (Facility Form)

                              NE-64(1/1/88)

                                Preamble

    1. The insurance and rating plan presently used by Nuclear Energy 
Liability Insurance Association (NELIA) and Mutual Atomic Energy 
Liability Underwriters (MAELU) do not make a distinction between workers 
claims arising from catastrophic events and those arising from lesser 
events;
    2. NELIA and MAELU believe that the lack of such a distinction will 
adversely affect their ability to continue to attract from world markets 
very large amounts of nuclear energy liability insurance for the nuclear 
industry;
    3. NELIA and MAELU want to avoid this potential loss of capacity and 
to continue to provide nuclear energy liability insurance for workers 
claims. Accordingly NELIA and MAELU desire to restructure their present 
insurance programs, including this policy, effective January 1, 1988.
    Now, Therefore, the Named Insured and the companies do hereby agree 
as follows:

                             1. Definitions

    When used in reference to this endorsement:
    This policy means the policy of which this endorsement forms a part;
    Nuclear related employment means all work performed at one or more 
than one nuclear facility in the United States of America or in 
connection with the transportation of nuclear material to or from any 
such facility. All of a worker's nuclear related employment shall be 
considered as having begun on the first day of such employment, 
regardless of the number of employers involved or interruptions in such 
employment;
    Worker refers to a person who is or was engaged in nuclear related 
employment;
    Workers claims means claims for damages because of bodily injury to 
a worker caused by the radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous 
properties of nuclear material and arising out of or in the course of 
the worker's nuclear related employment;
    Extraordinary nuclear occurrence means an event which the United 
States Nuclear Regulatory Commission has determined to be an 
extraordinary nuclear occurrence as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, or in any law amendatory thereof.

                   2. Application of This Endorsement

    This endorsement applies only to such insurance as is afforded by 
this policy for workers claims which do not arise in whole or in part 
out of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence.

[[Page 761]]

                   3. Exclusion of New Workers Claims

    This policy does not apply to bodily injury to a worker which arises 
in whole or in part out of nuclear related employment that begins on or 
after January 1, 1988.

         4. Application of Policy to Workers Claims Not Excluded

    With respect to such insurance as is afforded by this policy for 
workers claims which are not excluded, Insuring Agreement IV does not 
apply and the following Insuring Agreement IV-A does apply:
    IV-A Application of Policy to Workers Claims. This policy applies 
only to bodily injury (1) which is caused during the policy period by 
the nuclear energy hazard and (2) which is discovered and for which 
written claim is made against the insured not later than the close of 
December 31, 1997.

                5. Availability of Supplemental Insurance

    NELIA and MAELU are offering to make insurance under one or more 
Master Worker Policies available to all holders of Nuclear Energy 
Liability Policies (Facility Form). This offer is contingent on 
sufficient support from policy holders, and may be withdrawn or modified 
by Nelia or Maelu as they deem necessary or appropriate.
    The Master Workers Policies will provide, under their separate terms 
and conditions, coverage for new workers claims. Premiums will be 
subject to a separate Industry Retrospective Rating Plan.
    Coverage under the new master worker policies is not automatic. A 
written request must be submitted to Nelia or Maelu through regular 
market channels.
    It is understood and agreed that all of the provisions of this 
endorsement shall remain in full force and effect without regard to this 
section 5, and without regard to whether or not the Named Insureds 
become insureds under the Master Worker Policies, or whether or not 
NELIA or MAELU terminate such policies or withdraw or modify their offer 
to underwrite such policies.

    The policy period of this policy begins at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 
1988 and ends at the close of December 31, 1992, Eastern Standard Time, 
or when all Certificates issued to form a part hereof have been

    The discovery period for claims made under this policy begins at

1997, Eastern Standard Time.

                        C. Application of Policy

    This policy applies only to bodily injury to a new worker (1) which 
is caused during the policy period by the nuclear energy hazard and (2) 
which is discovered and for which written claim is first made against 
the insured within the discovery period.

                          VII--Other Insurance

    A. This insurance is primary insurance under any insurance afforded 
by a Master Policy-Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance (Secondary 
Financial Protection) issued by NELIA or MAELU.

[[Page 765]]

    B. If an insured has other valid and collectible insurance, except 
under a MAELU Policy, for loss or expense covered by this policy, this 
shall be excess insurance over such other insurance. If the insured has 
insurance under a MAELU Policy, whether the insurance is collectible or 
not, the companies shall then be liable under this policy only for such 
proportion of loss or expense as the amount stated as the Policy 
Aggregate Limit in Section VIII of this policy bears to the sum of such 
amount and the corresponding amount stated in the MAELU Policy.

                   VIII--Amount of Insurance Available

                        A. Policy Aggregate Limit

    1. The Policy Aggregate Limit is $124 million. This limit is not 
cumulative from year to year. The limit applies to all new worker's 
claims that qualify for coverage under this policy (herein called 
qualified claims).
    2. The Policy Aggregate Limit applies collectively to all new 
worker's claims. Such claims may be paid by NELIA on behalf of the 
companies as the claims, in NELIA's discretion, become ready for 
disposition, and claims costs may be paid as they become due, all 
without regard to the order in which such claims were made and without 
any obligation to maintain, reserve or use any portion of the Policy 
Aggregate Limit for claims reported under any particular Certificate.

                B. Limitation of the Companies' Liability

    1. Regardless of the number of (a) Certificates issued to form a 
part of this policy, (b) persons and organizations who are insureds 
under such Certificates, (c) qualified claims, or (d) years this policy 
or any such Certificates shall continue in force, the Policy Aggregate 
Limit is the total liability of the companies for all of their 
obligations under this policy, including the defense of suits and the 
payment of damages and claims costs.
    2. This policy provides for certain automatic reinstatements of the 
Policy Aggregate Limit. Regardless of such provision, if, during the 
policy period or thereafter, the total payments of the companies for
    (a) Non-ratable incurred losses, and
    (b) Those ratable incurred losses for which the companies have not 
been reimbursed under the Industry Retrospective Rating Plan Premium 
Endorsement described in Attachment 1 to this policy,

equal $124 million, the Policy Aggregate Limit shall be deemed to be 
exhausted, and shall not be further reinstated except by an endorsement 
issued to form a part of this policy for additional premium as 
determined by the companies.
    C. Reduction and Reinstatement of the Policy Aggregate Limit
    1. Each payment made by the companies in discharge of their 
obligations under this policy shall reduce the Policy Aggregate Limit by 
the amount of such payment.
    2. The companies shall, however, automatically reinstate the policy 
aggregate limit until the total amount of such reinstatements equals 
$124 million, but in no event shall there be any automatic 
reinstatements after the Policy Aggregate Limit is exhausted pursuant to 
the provisions of subsection B.2. above. Thereafter, there shall be no 
further reinstatement of the Policy Aggregate Limit except by an 
endorsement issued to form a part of this policy for additional premium 
as determined by the companies.
    3. It is a condition of this insurance that the companies shall have 
the right to reimburse themselves, as a matter of first priority, from 
funds held by NELIA in the Special Reserve Account described in 
Attachment 1 to this policy or from retrospective premiums received by 
NELIA for this insurance. The amount of reimbursement shall be equal to 
95% of each payment made by the companies with respect to their 
obligations under this policy.

             IX--Insured's Duties in Case of Claims or Suits

    A. Notice of Claims or Suits
    In the event of any claim or suit involving bodily injury to which a 
Certificate issued to form a part of this policy applies, written notice 
containing particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also 
reasonably obtainable information with respect to the time, place and 
circumstances thereof shall be given by or for the insured to the 
companies as soon as practicable. The insured shall immediately forward 
to the companies every demand, notice, summons or other process received 
relating to claims or suits against the insured.
    B. Assistance and Cooperation
    The insured shall cooperate with the companies and, upon their 
request, shall:
    (1) Attend hearings and trials; and
    (2) Assist in making settlements, securing and giving evidence, 
obtaining the attendance of witnesses and in the conduct of any legal 
proceedings in connection with the subject matter of this insurance.
    The insured shall not, except at the insured's own cost, make any 
payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense.

                             X--Subrogation

    In the event of any payment through a Certificate to form a part of 
this policy, the companies shall be subrogated to all the insured's 
rights of recovery therefor against any person or organization, and the 
insured shall execute and deliver instruments and papers, and so 
whatever else is necessary to secure such rights. Prior to knowledge of

[[Page 766]]

bodily injury caused by the nuclear energy hazard the insured may waive 
in writing any or all right of recovery against any person or 
organization, but after such knowledge the insured shall not waive or 
otherwise prejudice any such right of recovery.
    The companies hereby waive any right of subrogation against (1) any 
other insured of (2) the United States of America or any of its agencies 
acquired by reason of any payment under this policy.
    It is a condition of this policy that if an insured makes a recovery 
on account of any such injury, the insured shall repay to the companies 
the amount to which the companies would have been entitled had the 
foregoing provisions, or any of them, not been included in the policy.

                      XI--Inspection and Suspension

    The companies shall be permitted, but not obligated, to inspect at 
any time the facility as described in any Certificate and all books, 
records and operation relating thereto, both with respect to this 
insurance, and any other nuclear energy liability insurance and property 
insurance also afford with respect thereto by members of NELIA, American 
Nuclear Insurers, MAELU or MAERP Reinsurance Association.
    If a representative of the companies discovers a condition which he 
or she believes to be unduly dangerous with respect to the risks insured 
under the Certificate, a representative of the companies may request 
such condition to be corrected without delay. In the event of 
noncompliance with the request, an officer of NELIA may, by written 
notice mailed or delivered to the first Named Insured, with similar 
notice to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, suspend the 
insurance afforded by a Certificate issued by NELIA effective 12:00 
midnight of the next business day of such Commission following the date 
that such Commission receives such notice. The period of such suspension 
shall terminate as of the time stated in a written notice from NELIA to 
the first Named Insured that such condition has been corrected.
    Neither the right to make such inspections or suspensions nor the 
making thereof nor any advice or report resulting therefrom shall 
constitute an undertaking, on behalf of or for the benefit of the Named 
Insureds or others to determine or warrant that the facility or 
operations relating thereto are safe or healthful, or are in compliance 
with any law, rule or regulation.
    In consideration of the issuance or continuation of a Certificate, 
the Named Insureds agree that neither the companies nor any persons or 
organizations making such inspections on their behalf shall be liable 
for damage to the facility or any consequential damage or cost resulting 
therefrom, including but not limited to any such damage or cost relating 
to interruption of business or manufacture, arising out of the making of 
or failure to make any such inspection of the facility, any report 
thereon, or any such suspension of insurance, but this provision does 
not limit the companies' contractual obligations under a Certificate 
issued by NELIA or any policy issued by NELIA or American Nuclear 
Insurers affording the insured nuclear energy liability or property 
insurance.

                    XII--Cancellation of Certificates

    The first Named Insured designated in a Certificate issued to from a 
part of this policy any cancel such Certificate by mailing to the 
companies and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission written 
notice stating when, not less than 30 days thereafter, such cancellation 
shall be effective.
    The companies may cancel any such Certificate by mailing to the 
first Named Insured designated therein at the address shown in such 
Certificate and to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
written notice, stating when, not less than 90 days thereafter, such 
cancellation shall be effective; provided in the event of non-payment of 
premium, or if the operator of the facility, as designated in the 
Declarations of the Certificate, is replaced by another person or 
organization, such Certificate may be cancelled by the companies by 
mailing to the first Named Insured at the address shown therein and to 
the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice, stating 
when, not less than 30 days thereafter, such cancellation shall be 
effective.
    The mailing of notice as aforesaid shall be sufficient proof of 
notice. The effective date and hour of cancellation stated in the notice 
shall become the end of the Certificate period. Delivery of such written 
notice either by the first Named Insured or the companies shall be 
equivalent to mailing.
    Upon cancellation of a Certificate, other than as of the end of 
December 31 in any year, the earned standard premium for the period such 
Certificate has been in force since the preceding December 31 shall be 
computed in accordance with the following provisions:
    (1) If the first Named Insured cancels, the earned standard premium 
for such period shall be computed in accordance with the customary 
annual short rate table and procedure; provided, however, that if the 
first Named Insured cancels after knowledge of bodily injury caused by 
the nuclear energy hazard, all premiums theretofore paid or payable 
shall be fully earned;
    (2) If the companies cancel, the earned standard premium for such 
period shall be computed pro rata.
    Premium adjustment, if any, may be made either at the time of 
cancellation or as soon

[[Page 767]]

as practicable after cancellation becomes effective, but payment of 
tender of unearned premium is not a condition of cancellation.
    Cancellation of a Certificate shall not affect the rights and 
obligations of the Named Insureds under the Insureds under the Industry 
Retrospective Rating Plan Premium Endorsement forming a part of the 
Certificate.

                        XIII--General Conditions

                               A. Premium

    The Named Insureds designated in a Certificate issued by NELIA shall

the provisions of the Industry Retrospective Rating Plan Premium 
Endorsement described in Attachment 1 to this policy.

                        B. Modifications, Waiver

    The provisions of this policy or a Certificate issued to form a part 
hereof shall not be changed or waived except by an endorsement issued by 
the companies to form a part of the policy or Certificate.

                              C. Assignment

    Assignment of interest under a Certificate issued to form a part of 
this policy shall not bind the companies until their consent is endorsed 
thereon. If, however, a Named Insured shall die or be declared bankrupt 
or insolvent, the Certificate shall cover the Named Insured's legal 
representative, receiver or trustee as an insured, but only with respect 
to liability as such, and then only provided written notice of the 
appointment as legal representative, receiver or trustee is given to the 
companies within 10 days after such appointment.

                                 D. Suit

    No suit or action on a Certificate issued to form a part of this 
policy shall lie against the companies or any of them unless, as a 
condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have fully complied with 
all the terms of the policy, nor until the amount of the insured's 
obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment 
against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the 
insured, the claimant and the companies.
    Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who 
has secured such judgment of written agreement shall thereafter be 
entitled to recover under the Certificate to the extent of the insurance 
afforded by this policy through the Certificate. No person or 
organization shall have any right under the Certificate to join the 
companies or any of them as parties to any action against the insured to 
determine the insured's liability, nor shall the companies or any of 
them be impleaded by the insured or the insured's legal representative.
    Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or the insured's estate 
shall not relieve the companies of any of their obligations under this 
policy.

               E. Authorization of The First Named Insured

    Except with respect to compliance with the obligations imposed on 
the insured by the Sections of this policy entitled Insured's Duties in

by the provisions of this policy may be given to any one of the 
companies specified in the Schedule of Subscribing Companies attached 
hereto. Such notice, statement or proof of Loss so given shall be valid 
and binding on all such companies.
    In any action or suit against such companies, service of process may 
be made on any one of them and such service shall be valid and binding 
service on all such companies.
    Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association is the agent of the 
companies with respect to all matters pertaining to this insurance. All

shall be deemed to have been made directly by the companies.

  G. Changes in Subscribing Companies and Their Proportionate Liability

    By acceptance of this policy the Named Insureds agree that the 
members of Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association liable under 
this policy, and the proportionate liability of each such member, may 
change from year to year, and further agree that regardless of such 
changes:
    (1) Each company subscribing this policy upon its issuance shall be 
liable only for its stated proportion of any obligation assumed or 
expense incurred under this policy because of bodily injury to new 
workers caused, during the period from the effective date of this policy 
to the close of December 31 next following, by the nuclear energy 
hazard; for each subsequent calendar year, beginning January 1 next

designated in a Certificate agree that the statements in such 
Certificate are their agreements and representations, that this Master 
Worker Policy and such Certificate are issued in reliance upon the truth 
of such representations and that this Master Worker Policy and such 
Certificate embody all agreements between such Named Insureds and the

                             1. Definitions

    With reference to the premium for the Certificate of which this 
endorsement forms a part:
    Master Worker Policy means the Master Worker Policy issued by NELIA;
    Certificate Holder means the first Named Insured in a Certificate 
issued to form a part of the Master Worker Policy;
    Advance premium, for any calendar year, is the estimated standard 
premium for that calendar year;
    Standard premium, for any calendar year, is the premium for that 
calendar year computed in accordance with the companies' rules, rates, 
rating plans (other than the Industry Retrospective Rating Plan), 
premiums and minimum premiums applicable to this insurance. Standard 
premium includes elements for premium taxes, expenses, profit and 
contingencies, guaranteed cost insurance and estimated reserve premium. 
The elements of standard premium, other than for premium taxes and 
estimated reserve premium, are not subject to retrospective adjustment;
    Reserve premium means that portion of the premium for a Certificate 
(including reserve premium charges paid) that is specifically allocated 
under the Industry Retrospective Rating Plan for ratable incurred 
losses;
    Industry reserve premium, for any period, is the sum of the reserve 
premiums for that period for all Certificates issued to form a part of

of obligations assumed and expenses incurred in connection with such 
obligations by the members of NELIA under the Master Worker Policy;

incurred losses are the portion of incurred losses which are not covered 
by the guaranteed cost insurance element of standard premiums;
    Non-ratable incurred losses means 5% of incurred losses. Nonratable 
incurred losses are the portion of incurred losses which are covered by 
the guaranteed cost insurance element of standard premiums;
    Reserve for refunds, as of any date, is the algebraic difference 
between:
    (1) All industry reserve premium for the period from January 1, 1988 
through such date, minus
    (2) The total for the same period of (a) all ratable incurred losses 
and (b) all industry reserve premium refunds made under the Industry 
Retrospective Rating Plan by members of NELIA;
    Industry reserve premium charge, for any period, means the amount 
determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of this endorsement

    Reserve premium charge means the portion of an industry reserve 
premium charge payable by the Named Insureds under Certificates;
    Industry reserve premium refund for any period, means the amount 
determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of this endorsement 
for return to the Named Insureds under Certificates;
    Reserve premium refund means the portion of an industry reserve 
premium refund returnable to the Named Insureds under this Certificate.

               2. Payment of Advance and Standard Premiums

    The Named Insureds shall pay the companies the advance premium 
stated in the declarations, for the period from the effective date of 
this Certificate through December 31 following. Thereafter, at the 
beginning of each calendar year while this Certificate is in force, the 
Named Insureds shall pay the advance premium for such year to the 
companies.
    The advance premium for each calendar year shall be stated in the 
Advance and Standard Premium Endorsement for the year issued by the 
companies as soon as practicable prior to or after the beginning of the 
year.
    As soon as practicable after the end of a calendar year or the 
Certificate Coverage Period, the standard premium for the preceding year 
shall be finally determined and stated in the Advance and Standard 
Premium Endorsement for that year. If the Standard Premium exceeds the 
Advance Premium paid for that year, the Named Insureds shall pay the 
excess to the companies; if less, the companies shall return to the 
Named Insureds the excess portion paid.
    The Named Insureds shall maintain records of the information 
necessary for premium computation and shall send copies of such records 
to the companies as directed, at the end of each calendar year, at the 
end of the Certificate Coverage Period and at such other times as the 
companies may direct.

[[Page 770]]

           3. Special Reserve Account; Use of Reserve Premiums

    NELIA shall maintain on behalf of its members a Special Reserve 
Account for holding collectively all reserve premiums paid for all 
Certificates issued to form a part of the Master Worker Policy. Such 
premiums, together with any undistributed net income realized thereon 
after taxes and investment expenses, shall be used for the following 
purposes only:
    (1) To pay ratable incurred losses or, in the event ratable incurred 
losses are paid under the Master Worker Policy from funds advanced by 
the members of NELIA subscribing the policy, to reimburse such members 
as a matter of first priority for the funds advanced;
    (2) To refund any amounts so held to the Named Insureds, as provided 
in Section 4.
    No members of NELIA and no Named Insureds shall have any individual 
interest in or claim upon amounts held in the special Reserve Account, 
except to participate proportionally in any refund or reimbursement 
provided for above.
    All reserve premiums paid or payable for this certificate may be 
used by NELIA to discharge the obligations of its members under the 
Master Worker Policy with respect to the above purposes and arising out 
of claims made under any Certificate issued to form a part of the Master 
Worker Policy.

            4. Payment of Reserve Premium Charges and Refunds

    As soon as practicable after each December 31 the companies will 
review the status of the reserve for refunds and report their findings 
to all Certificate Holders.
    If, at any time, the companies find that there is negative balance 
in the reserve for refunds and that such condition is likely to prevail, 
they shall determine an appropriate industry reserve premium charge. 
Similarly, if the companies find that there is a surplus positive 
balance, they shall determine an appropriate industry reserve premium 
refund.
    The portion of an industry reserve premium charge or an industry 
reserve premium refund that is:
    (1) Payable by the Named Insureds as a reserve premium charge, or
    (2) Due such insureds as reserve premium refund, shall be determined 
by multiplying the industry reserve premium charge or the industry 
reserve premium refund by the retrospective adjustment ratio applicable 
to this Certificate.
    The amount of any reserve premium charge shall be stated in a 
Retrospective Reserve Premium Charge Endorsement. The charge shall be 
paid promptly after receipt of the endorsement.
    When all claims covered by the Master Worker Policy are closed the 
companies shall make a final review and report, and shall determine a 
final industry reserve premium charge or industry reserve premium refund 
equal to the amount of the balance.

                            5. Final Premium

    The final premium for this Certificate shall be (a) the sum of the 
standard premiums for each calendar year, or portion thereof, during 
which the Certificate remains in force plus (b) the sum of all reserve 
premiums, including all reserve premium charges, minus (c) the sum of 
all reserve premium refunds.

                   6. Reserve Premium Charge Agreement

    In consideration of (a) the participation of Named Insureds in other 
Certificates subject to the Industry Retrospective Rating Plan, (b) the 
undertaking of such Named Insureds to pay their appropriate share of any 
industry reserve premium charge and (c) the obligations assumed by the 
members of NELIA under the Master Worker Policy, the Named Insureds, by 
acceptance of the Master Worker Policy, agree:
    (1) That the insurance provided by the Master Policy applies 
collectively to all claims covered by the policy through any and all 
Certificates issued to form a part of the policy.
    (2) That the right of each Named Insured under a Certificate to 
receive reserve premium refunds and the obligation of each such insured 
to pay reserve premiums charges applies to all claims covered by the 
Master Worker Policy and continues until all such claims are closed, 
whether or not such claims were before the inception of the Certificate 
or after its termination.
    (3) To pay all reserve premium charges due promptly after receipt of 
the Retrospective Reserve Premium Charge Endorsement, whether or not the 
Certificate is terminated. Any reserve premium charge shall be overdue 
if not paid within 60 days of the date of the invoice for the charge.
    Overdue reserve premium charges shall bear interest from the due 
date until paid at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) 3% plus (b) a 
rate of interest equal to Moody's Average Public Utility Bond Yield 
described in the issue of Moody's Bond Survey current on the due date. 
Any reserve premium refund due to Named Insureds under a Certificate 
shall be used to pay any overdue reserve premium charges to such Named 
Insureds.

                   7. Reserve Premium Refund Agreement

    Each member of NELIA subscribing the Master Worker Policy for any 
calendar year, or portion thereof, with respect to which an industry 
reserve premium refund is determined to be payable thereby agrees for 
itself, severally and not jointly, and in the respective proportion of 
its liability assumed under

[[Page 771]]

the Master Worker Policy for that calendar year, to return promptly to 
the Named Insureds that portion of such refund due such Insureds, as 
determined in accordance with the provisions of this endorsement.
    Accepted and agreed by the first Named Insured in behalf of itself 
and every other Named Insured stated in the Declarations of the 
Certificate of which this endorsement forms a part.

Rico and all territories and possessions of the United States.

                               Article II

    1. At all times during the term of the license or licenses 
designated in Item 3 of the Attachment hereto, the licensee will 
maintain financial protection in the amount specified in Item 2 of the 
Attachment and in the form of the nuclear energy liability insurance 
policy designated in the Attachment. If more than one license is 
designated in Item 3 of the Attachment, the licensee agrees to maintain 
such financial protection until the end of the term of that license 
which will be the last to expire. The licensee shall, notwithstanding 
the expiration, termination, modification, amendment, suspension or 
revocation of any license or licenses designated in Item 3 of the 
Attachment, maintain such financial protection in effect until all the 
radioactive material has been removed from the location and 
transportation of the radioactive material from the location has ended 
as defined in paragraph 5(b), Article I of this section, or until the 
Commission authorizes the termination or the modification of such 
financial protection. The Commission will not unreasonably withhold such 
authorization.
    2. In the event of any payment by the insurer or insurers under a 
policy or policies specified in Item 5 of the Attachment hereto which 
reduces the aggregate limit of such policy or policies below the amount 
of financial protection, the licensee will promptly apply to his 
insurers for reinstatement of the amount specified in Item 2a of the 
Attachment (without reference to paragraph b of Item 2) and will make 
all reasonable efforts to obtain such reinstatement. In the event that 
the licensee has not obtained reinstatement of such amount within ninety 
days after the date of such reduction, and in the absence of good cause 
shown to the contrary, the Commission may issue an order requiring the 
licensee to furnish financial protection for such amount in another 
form.
    3. Any obligations of the licensee under subsection 53e(8) of the 
Act to indemnify the United States and the Commission from public 
liability, together with any public liability satisfied by the insurers 
under the policy or policies designated in the Attachment hereto, shall 
not in the aggregate exceed the amount of financial protection with 
respect to any nuclear incident, including the reasonable costs of 
investigating and settling claims and defending suits for damage.
    4. With respect to any extraordinary nuclear occurrence to which 
this agreement applies, the Commission, and the licensee on behalf of 
itself and other persons indemnified, insofar as their interests appear, 
each agree to waive:

[[Page 774]]

    (a) Any issue or defense as to the conduct of the claimant or fault 
of persons indemnified, including, but not limited to:
    (1) Negligence;
    (2) Contributory negligence;
    (3) Assumption of the risk;
    (4) Unforeseeable intervening causes, whether involving the conduct 
of a third person or an act of God.

As used herein, conduct of the claimant includes conduct of persons 
through whom the claimant derives his cause of action;
    (b) Any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity;
    (c) Any issue or defense based on any statute of limitations if suit 
is instituted within 3 years from the date on which the claimant first 
knew, or reasonably could have known, of his injury or damage and the 
cause thereof.
    The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective 
regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed 
jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. The 
waivers shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with their terms 
by the claimant against the person indemnified.
    5. The waivers set forth in paragraph 4 of this article:
    (a) Shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take 
reasonable steps to mitigate damages;
    (b) Shall not apply to injury or damage to a claimant or to a 
claimant's property which is intentionally sustained by the claimant or 
which results from a nuclear incident intentionally and wrongfully 
caused by the claimant;
    (c) Shall not apply to injury to a claimant who is employed at the 
site of and in connection with the activity where the extraordinary 
nuclear occurrence takes place if benefits therefore are either payable 
or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation or 
occupational disease law: Provided, however, That with respect to an 
extraordinary nuclear occurrence occurring at the facility, a claimant 
who is employed at the facility in connection with the construction of a 
nuclear reactor with respect to which no operating license has been 
issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall not be considered as 
employed in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear 
occurrence takes place if:
    (1) The claimant is employed exclusively in connection with the 
construction of a nuclear reactor, including all related equipment and 
installations at the facility, and
    (2) No operating license has been issued by the NRC with respect to 
the nuclear reactor, and
    (3) The claimant is not employed in connection with the possession, 
storage, use or transfer of nuclear material at the facility;
    (d) Shall not apply to any claim for punitive or exemplary damages, 
provided, with respect to any claim for wrongful death under any State 
law which provides for damages only punitive in nature, this exclusion 
does not apply to the extent that the claimant has sustained actual 
damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death 
but not to exceed the maximum amount otherwise recoverable under such 
law;
    (e) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set 
forth in this agreement;
    (f) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, 
any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection 
afforded under (1) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 
170(e) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and (2) the terms 
of this agreement and the terms of the nuclear energy liability 
insurance policy or policies designated in the attachment hereto.
    6. The obligations of the licensee under this agreement shall apply 
only with respect to nuclear incidents occurring during the term of this 
agreement.
    7. Upon the expiration or revocation of any license designated in 
Item 3 of the Attachment, the Commission will enter into an appropriate 
amendment of this agreement with the licensee reducing the amount of 
financial protection required under this Article; provided, that the 
licensee is then entitled to a reduction in the amount of financial 
protection under applicable Commission regulations and orders.
    8. With respect to any common occurrence,
    (a) If the sum of limit of liability of any Nuclear Energy Liability 
Insurance Association policy designated in Item 5 of the Attachment and 
the limits of liability of all other nuclear energy liability insurance 
policies (facility form) applicable to such common occurrence and issued 
by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association exceeds $155,000,000 
the amount of financial protection specified in Item 2 a and b of the 
Attachment shall be deemed to be reduced by that proportion of the 
difference between said sum and $155,000,000 as the limit of liability 
of the Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association policy designated

Liability Underwriters policy designated in Item 5 of the Attachment and 
the limits of liability of all

[[Page 775]]

other nuclear energy liability insurance policies (facility form) 
applicable to such common occurrence and issued by Mutual Atomic Energy 
Liability Underwriters exceeds $45,000,000, the amount of financial 
protection specified in Item 2 a and b of the Attachment shall be deemed 
to be reduced by that proportion of the difference between said sum and 
$45,000,000 as the limit of liability of the Mutual Atomic Energy 
Liability Underwriters policy designated in Item 5 of the Attachment 
bears to the sum of the limits of liability of all nuclear energy 
liability insurance policies (facility form) applicable to such common 
occurrence and issued by Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters;
    (c) If any of the other applicable agreements is with a person who 
has furnished financial protection in a form other than a nuclear energy 
liability insurance policy (facility form) issued by Nuclear Energy 
Liability Insurance Association or Mutual Atomic Energy Liability 
Underwriters, and if also the sum of the amount of financial protection 
established under this agreement and the amounts of financial protection 
established under all other applicable agreements exceeds an amount 
equal to the sum of $200,000,000 and the amount available as secondary 
financial protection, the obligations of the licensee shall not exceed a 
greater proportion of an amount equal to the sum of $200,000,000 and the 
amount available as secondary financial protection, than the amount of 
financial protection established under this agreement bears to the sum 
of such amount and the amounts of financial protection established under 
all other applicable agreements.
    (d) As used in this paragraph 8., Article II, and in Article III, 
other applicable agreements means each other agreement entered into by 
the Commission pursuant to subsection 170(c) of the Act in which 
agreement the nuclear incident is defined as a common occurrence. As 
used in this paragraph 8., Article II, the obligations of the licensee

together with any public liability satisfied by the insurers under the 
policy or policies designated in the Attachment, and the reasonable 
costs incurred by the insurers in investigating and settling claims and 
defending suits for damage.
    9. The obligations of the licensee under this Article shall not be 
affected by any failure or default on the part of the Commission or the 
Government of the United States to fulfill any or all of its obligations 
under this agreement. Bankruptcy or insolvency of any person indemnified 
other than the licensee, or the estate of any person indemnified other

has been removed from the location and transportation of the radioactive 
material from the location has ended as defined in paragraph 5(b), 
Article I of this section. Termination of the term of this agreement 
shall not affect any obligation of the licensee or any obligation of the 
Commission under this agreement with respect to any nuclear incident 
occurring during the term of this agreement.

                              Article VIII

    The following provisions are applicable to each licensee operating a 
facility designed for producing substantial amounts of electricity and 
having a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more;
    1. Each licensee is required to have and maintain financial 
protection in an amount specified in Item 2 a and b of the Attachment 
annexed hereto, and the amount available as secondary financial 
protection (in the form of private liability insurance available under 
an industry retrospective rating plan providing for deferred premium 
charges); Provided, however, That under such a plan for deferred premium 
charges, such charges for each nuclear reactor which is licensed to 
operate shall not exceed $63,000,000 with respect to any single nuclear 
incident (plus any surcharge assessed under subsection 170o.(1)(E) of 
the Act) nor exceed $10,000,000 per incident within one calendar year. 
If the licensee fails to pay assessed deferred premiums, the Commission 
reserves the right to pay those premiums on behalf of the licensee and 
to recover the amount of such premiums from the licensee.
    2. The Commission shall require the immediate submission of 
financial statements by those licensees who indicate, after an 
assessment of the retrospective premium by the insurance pools, that 
they will not pay the assessment. Such financial statements shall 
include, as a minimum, exhibits indicating internally generated funds 
from operations and accumulated retained earnings. Subsequent submission 
of financial statements by such licensees may be requested by the 
Commission, as required.
    3. If premiums are paid by the Commission as provided in paragraph 
1, payment by the Commission shall create a lien in the amount paid in 
favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, 
whether real or personal, belonging to such licensee. The lien shall 
arise at the time payment is made by the Commission and shall continue 
until the liability for the amount (or a judgment against the licensee 
arising out of such liability) is satisfied or becomes

[[Page 777]]

unenforceable. The Commission will issue a certificate of release of any 
such lien if it finds that the liability for the amount has been fully 
satisfied or has become legally unenforceable.
    4. If the Commission determines that the licensee is financially 
able to reimburse the Commission for a deferred premium payment made in 
its behalf, and the licensee, after notice of such determination by the 
Commission fails to make such reimbursement within 120 days, the 
Commission will take appropriate steps to suspend the license for 30 
days. The Commission may take any further action as necessary if 
reimbursement is not made within the 30-day suspension period including, 
but not limited to termination of the operating license.

    (b) Any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity;
    (c) Any issue or defense based on any statute of limitations if suit 
is instituted within 3 years from the date on which the claimant first 
knew, or reasonably could have known, of his injury or damage and the 
cause thereof.
    The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective 
regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed 
jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. The 
waivers shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with their terms 
by the claimant against the person indemnified.
    5. The waivers set forth in paragraph 4, of this article:
    (a) Shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take 
reasonable steps to mitigate damages;

extraordinary nuclear occurrence occurring at the facility, a claimant 
who is employed at the facility in connection with the construction of a 
nuclear reactor with respect to which no operating license has been 
issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall not be considered as 
employed in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear 
occurrence takes place if:
    (1) The claimant is employed exclusively in connection with the 
construction of a nuclear reactor, including all related equipment and 
installations at the facility, and
    (2) No operating license has been issued by the NRC with respect to 
the nuclear reactor, and
    (3) The claimant is not employed in connection with the possession, 
storage, use or transfer of nuclear material at the facility;
    (d) Shall not apply to any claim for punitive or exemplary damages, 
provided, with respect to any claim for wrongful death under any State 
law which provides for damages only punitive in nature, this exclusion 
does not apply to the extent that the claimant has sustained actual 
damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death 
but not to exceed the maximum amount otherwise recoverable under such 
law;
    (e) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set 
forth in this agreement and in contracts or other proof of financial 
protection;
    (f) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, 
any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection 
afforded under (1) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 
170(e), of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and (2) the terms 
of this agreement and the terms of contracts or other proof of financial 
protection.
    6. The obligations of the licensee under this agreement shall apply 
only with respect to nuclear incidents occurring during the term of this 
agreement.
    7. Upon the expiration or revocation of any license designated in 
Item 3 of the Attachment, the Commission will enter into an appropriate 
amendment of this agreement with the licensee reducing the amount of 
financial protection required under this Article; provided, that the 
licensee is then entitled to a reduction in the amount of financial 
protection under applicable Commission regulations and orders.
    8. With respect to a common occurrence, if the sum of the amount of 
financial protection established under this agreement and the amount of 
financial protection established under all other applicable agreements 
exceeds an amount equal to the sum of $200,000,000 and the amount 
available as secondary financial protection, the obligations of the 
licensee described in paragraph 3 of this Article shall not exceed a 
greater proportion of an amount equal to the sum of $200,000,000 and the 
amount available as secondary financial protection than the amount of 
financial protection established under this agreement bears to the sum 
of such amount and the amounts of financial protection established under 
all other applicable agreements. As used in this paragraph, and in 
Article III, other applicable agreements means each other agreement 
entered into by the Commission pursuant to subsection 170(c) or

[[Page 780]]

(k) of the Act in which agreement the nuclear incident is defined as a

affected by any failure or default on the part of the Commission or the 
Government of the United States to fulfill any or all of its obligations 
under this agreement. Bankruptcy or insolvency of any person indemnified 
other than the licensee, or the estate of any person indemnified other 
than the licensee, shall not relieve the licensee of any of his 
obligations hereunder.

the amount of financial protection required under this agreement; or (c) 
with respect to a common occurrence, $560,000,000 less the sum of the 
amounts of financial protection established under this agreement and all 
other applicable agreements.
    7. The obligations of the Commission under this agreement, except to 
the licensee for damage to property of the licensee, shall not be 
affected by any failure on the part of the licensee to fulfill its 
obligations under this agreement. Bankruptcy or insolvency of the

Commission of any of its obligations hereunder.

                               Article IV

    1. When the Commission determines that the United States will 
probably be required to make indemnity payments under the provisions of 
this agreement, the Commission shall have the right to collaborate with 
the licensee and other persons indemnified in the settlement and defense 
of any claim (provided that no government indemnity that would otherwise 
be available to pay public liability claims is used for these purposes) 
and shall have the right (a) to require the prior approval of the 
Commission for the settlement or payment of any claim or action asserted 
against the licensee or other person indemnified for public liability or 
damage to property of persons legally liable for the nuclear incident 
which claim or action the licensee or the Commission may be required to 
indemnify under this agreement; and (b) to appear through the Attorney 
General of the United States on behalf of the licensee or other person

thereunder may be assigned or transferred without the approval of the 
Commission.

                                Article V

    The parties agree that they will enter into appropriate amendments 
of this agreement to the extent that such amendments are required 
pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or licenses, 
regulations or orders of the Commission.

[[Page 781]]

                               Article VI

    The licensee agrees to pay to the Commission such fees as are 
established by the Commission pursuant to regulations or orders of the 
Commission.

                               Article VII

    The term of this agreement shall commence as of the date and time 
specified in Item 6 of the attachment and shall terminate at the time of 
expiration of that license specified in Item 3 of the attachment, which 
is last to expire; provided that, except as may otherwise be provided in 
applicable regulations or orders of the Commission, the term of this 
agreement shall not terminate until all the radioactive material has 
been removed from the location and transportation of the radioactive 
material from the location has ended as defined in subparagraph 5(b), 
Article I. Termination of the term of this agreement shall not affect 
any obligation of the licensee or any obligation of the Commission under 
this agreement with respect to any nuclear incident occurring during the 
term of this agreement.

                              Article VIII

    The following provisions are applicable to each licensee operating a 
facility designed for producing substantial amounts of electricity and 
having a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more:
    1. Each licensee is required to have and maintain financial 
protection in an amount specified in Item 2 annexed hereto, and the 
amount available as secondary financial protection (in the form of 
private liability insurance available under an industry retrospective 
rating plan providing for deferred premium charges): Provided, however, 
That under such a plan for deferred premium charges, such charges for 
each nuclear reactor which is licensed to operate shall not exceed 
$63,000,000 with respect to any single nuclear incident (plus any 
surcharge assessed under subsection 170o.(1)(E) of the Act) nor exceed 
$10,000,000 per incident within one calendar year. If the licensee fails 
to pay assessed deferred premiums, the Commission reserves the right to 
pay those premiums on behalf of the licensee and to recover the amount 
of such premiums from the licensee.
    2. The Commission shall require the immediate submission of 
financial statements by those licensees who indicate, after an 
assessment of the restrospective premium by the insurance pools, that 
they will not pay the assessment. Such financial statements shall 
include, as a minimum, exhibits indicating internally generated funds 
from operations and accumulated retained earnings. Subsequent submission 
of financial statements by such licensees may be requested by the 
Commission, as required.
    3. If premiums are paid by the Commission as provided in paragraph 
1, payment by the Commission shall create a lien in the amount paid in 
favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, 
whether real or personal, belonging to such licensee. The lien shall 
arise at the time payment is made by the Commission and shall continue 
until the liability for the amount (or a judgment against the licensee 
arising out of such liability) is satisfied or becomes unenforceable. 
The Commission will issue a certificate of release of any such lien if 
it finds that the liability for the amount has been fully satisfied or 
has become legally unenforceable.
    4. If the Commission determines that the licensee is financially 
able to reimburse the Commission for a deferred premium payment made in 
its behalf, and the licensee, after notice of such determination by the 
Commission fails to make such reimbursement within 120 days, the 
Commission will take appropriate steps to suspend the license for 30 
days. The Commission may take any further action as necessary if 
reimbursement is not made within the 30-day suspension period including, 
but not limited to, termination of the operating license or combined 
license.

jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. The 
waivers shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with their terms 
by the claimant against the person indemnified.
    5. The waivers set forth in paragraph 4 of this article:
    (a) Shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take

storage, use or transfer of nuclear material at the facility;
    (d) Shall not apply to any claim for punitive or exemplary damages, 
provided, with respect to any claim for wrongful death under any State 
law which provides for damages only punitive in nature, this exclusion 
does not apply to the extent that the claimant has sustained actual 
damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death 
but not to exceed the maximum amount otherwise recoverable under such 
law;
    (e) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set 
forth in this agreement;
    (f) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, 
any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection 
afforded under (1) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 
170(e), of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and (2) the terms 
of this agreement.
    6. With respect to a common occurrence, the obligations of the

for the nuclear incident (other than such property described in

[[Page 784]]

the proviso to paragraph 2 of this Article) as in the aggregate exceed 
whichever of the following is lower: (1) The sum of the amount of 
financial protection established under all applicable agreements; or (2) 
an amount equal to the sum of $200,000,000 and the amount available as 
secondary financial protection. As used in this Article applicable 
agreements means each agreement entered into by the Commission pursuant 
to subsection 170(c) or (k) of the Act in which agreement the nuclear 
incident is defined as common occurrence.
    7. The obligations of the Commission under this agreement shall 
apply only with respect to nuclear incidents occurring during the term 
of this agreement.
    8. The obligations of the Commission under this and all other 
agreements and contracts to which the Commission is a party shall not 
with respect to any nuclear incident, in the aggregate exceed whichever 
of the following is the lower: (a) $500,000,000 or (b) with respect to a 
common occurrence, $560,000,000 less the sum of the amounts of financial 
protection established under all applicable agreements.
    9. Bankruptcy or insolvency of any person indemnified or of the 
estate of any person indemnified shall not relieve the Commission of any 
of its obligations hereunder.

                               Article III

    1. When the Commission determines that the United States will 
probably be required to make indemnity payments under the provisions of 
this agreement, the Commission shall have the right to collaborate with 
the licensee and other persons indemnified in the settlement and defense 
of any claim (provided that no government indemnity that would otherwise 
be available to pay public liability claims is used for these purposes) 
and shall have the right (a) to require the prior approval of the 
Commission for the settlement or payment of any claim or action asserted 
against the licensee or other persons indemnified for public liability 
or damage to property of persons legally liable for the nuclear incident 
which claim or action the licensee or the Commission may be required to 
indemnify under this agreement; and (b) to appear through the Attorney 
General of the United States on behalf of the licensee or other person 
indemnified, take charge of such action and settle or defend any such 
action. If the settlement or defense of any such action or claim is 
undertaken by the Commission, the licensee shall furnish all reasonable 
assistance in effecting a settlement or asserting a defense.
    2. Neither this agreement nor any interest therein nor claim 
thereunder may be assigned or transferred without the approval of the 
Commission.

                               Article IV

    The parties agree that they will enter into appropriate amendments 
of this agreement to the extent that such amendments are required 
pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or licenses, 
regulations or orders of the Commission.

                                Article V

    The licensee agrees to pay to the Commission such fees as are 
established by the Commission pursuant to regulations or orders of the 
Commission.

                               Article VI

    The term of this agreement shall commence as of the date and time 
specified in Item 4 of the attachment and shall terminate at the time of 
expiration of that license specified in Item 2 of the Attachment, which 
is the last to expire; provided that, except as may otherwise be 
provided in applicable regulations or orders of the Commission, the term 
of this agreement shall not terminate until all the radioactive material 
has been removed from the location and transportation of the radioactive 
material from the location has ended as defined in paragraph 4(b), 
Article I of this section. Termination of the term of this agreement 
shall not affect any obligation of the licensee or any obligation of the 
Commission under this agreement with respect to any nuclear incident 
occurring during the term of this agreement.

As used herein, conduct of the claimant includes conduct of persons 
through whom the claimant derives his cause of action;
    (b) Any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity:
    (c) Any issue or defense based on any statute of limitations if suit 
is instituted within 3 years from the date on which the claimant first 
knew, or reasonably could have known, of his injury or damage and the 
cause thereof.
    The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective 
regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed 
jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. The 
waivers shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with their terms 
by the claimant against the person indemnified.
    3. The waivers set forth in paragraph 2 of this article:
    (a) Shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take 
reasonable steps to mitigate damages;
    (b) Shall not apply to injury or damage to a claimant or to a 
claimant's property which is intentionally sustained by the claimant or 
which results from a nuclear incident intentionally and wrongfully 
caused by the claimant;

site of and in connection with the activity where the extraordinary 
nuclear occurrence takes place if benefits therefor are either payable 
or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation or 
occupational disease law: Provided, however, That with respect to an 
extraordinary nuclear occurrence occurring at the facility, a claimant 
who is employed at the facility in connection with the construction of a 
nuclear reactor with respect to which no operating license has been 
issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall not be considered as 
employed in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear 
occurrence takes place if:
    (1) The claimant is employed exclusively in connection with the 
construction of a nuclear reactor, including all related equipment and 
installations at the facility, and
    (2) No operating license has been issued by the NRC with respect to 
the nuclear reactor, and
    (3) The claimant is not employed in connection with the possession, 
storage, use, or transfer of nuclear material at the facility;
    (d) Shall not apply to any claim for punitive or exemplary damages, 
provided, with respect to any claim for wrongful death under any State 
law which provides for damages only punitive in nature, this exclusion 
does not apply to the extent that the claimant has sustained actual 
damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death 
but not to exceed the maximum amount otherwise recoverable under such 
law;
    (e) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set 
forth in this agreement;
    (f) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, 
any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection 
afforded under (1) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 
170(e) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and (b) the terms 
of this agreement.

                               Article III

    1. The Commission undertakes and agrees to indemnify and hold 
harmless the licensee and other persons indemnified, as their interest 
may appear, from public liability.
    2. With respect to damage caused by a nuclear incident to property 
of any person legally liable for the nuclear incident, the Commission 
agrees to pay to such person those sums which such person would have 
been obligated to pay if such property had belonged to another; 
provided, that the obligation of the Commission under this paragraph 2 
does not apply with respect to:
    (a) Property which is located at the location and used in connection 
with the licensee's possession, use or transfer of the radioactive 
material;
    (b) Property damage due to the neglect of the person indemnified to 
use all reasonable means to save and preserve the property after 
knowledge of a nuclear incident;

common occurrence, $560,000,000 less the sum of the amounts of financial 
protection established under all applicable agreements.
    7. If the licensee is immune from public liability because it is a 
state agency, the Commission shall make payments under the agreement in 
the same manner and to the same extent as the Commission would be 
required to do if the licensee were not such a state agency.
    8. The obligations of the Commission under this agreement, except to 
the licensee for damage to property of the licensee, shall not be 
affected by any failure on the part of the licensee to fulfill its 
obligations under this agreement. Bankruptcy or insolvency of the 
licensee or any other person indemnified or of the estate of the 
licensee or any other person indemnified shall not relieve the 
Commission of any of its obligations hereunder.

                               Article IV

    1. When the Commission determines that the United States will 
probably be required to make indemnity payments under the provisions of

reasonable assistance in effecting a settlement or asserting a defense.
    2. Neither this agreement nor any interest therein nor claim 
thereunder may be assigned or transferred without the approval of the 
Commission.

                                Article V

Rico and all territories and possessions of the United States.

                               Article II

    1. At all times during the term of the license or licenses 
designated in Item 3 of the Attachment hereto, the licensee will 
maintain financial protection in the amount specified in Item 2 of the 
Attachment and in the form of the nuclear energy liability insurance 
policy designated in the Attachment. If more than one license is 
designated in Item 3 of the Attachment, the licensee agrees to maintain 
such financial protection until the end of the term of that license 
which will be the last to expire. The licensee shall, notwithstanding 
the expiration, termination, modification, amendment, suspension of 
revocation of any license or licenses designated in Item 3 of the 
Attachment, maintain such financial protection in effect until all the 
radioactive material has been removed from the location and 
transportation of the radioactive material from the location has ended 
as defined in subparagraph 4(b), Article I, or until the Commission 
authorizes the termination or the modification of such financial 
protection. The Commission will not unreasonably withhold such 
authorization.
    2. In the event of any payment by the insurer or insurers under a 
policy or policies specified in Item 5 of the Attachment hereto which 
reduces the aggregate limit of such policy or policies below the amount 
of financial protection, the licensee will promptly apply to his 
insurers for reinstatement of the amount specified in Item 2a of the 
Attachment (without reference to paragraph b of Item 2) and will make 
all reasonable efforts to obtain such reinstatement. In the event that 
the licensee has not obtained reinstatement of such amount within ninety 
days

[[Page 790]]

after the date of such reduction, and in the absence of good cause shown 
to the contrary, the Commission may issue an order requiring the 
licensee to furnish financial protection for such amount in another 
form.
    3. Any obligations of the licensee under subsection 53e(8) of the 
Act to indemnify the United States and the Commission from public 
liability, together with any public liability satisfied by the insurers 
under the policy or policies designated in the Attachment hereto, shall 
not in the aggregate exceed the amount of financial protection with 
respect to any nuclear incident, including the reasonable costs of 
investigating and settling claims and defending suits for damage.
    4. The obligations of the licensee under this agreement shall apply 
only with respect to nuclear incidents occurring during the term of this 
agreement.
    5. Upon the expiration or revocation of any license designated in 
Item 3 of the Attachment, the Commission will enter into an appropriate 
amendment of this agreement with the licensee reducing the amount of 
financial protection required under this Article: provided, that the 
licensee is then entitled to a reduction in the amount of financial 
protection under applicable Commission regulations and orders.
    6. With respect to any common occurrence,
    (a) If the sum of the limit of liability of any Nuclear Energy 
Liability-Property Insurance Association policy designated in Item 5 of 
the Attachment and the limits of liability of all other nuclear energy 
liability insurance policies (facility form) applicable to such common 
occurrence and issued by Nuclear Energy Liability-Property Insurance 
Association exceeds $155,000,000, the amount of financial protection 
specified in Item 2 a and b of the Attachment shall be deemed to be 
reduced by that proportion of the difference between said sum and 
$155,000,000 as the limit of liability of the Nuclear Energy Liability-
Property Insurance Association policy designated in Item 5 of the 
Attachment bears to the sum of the limits of liability of all nuclear 
energy liability insurance policies (facility form) applicable to such 
common occurrence and issued by Nuclear Energy Liability-Property 
Insurance Association;
    (b) If the sum of the limit of liability of any Mutual Atomic Energy 
Liability Underwriters policy designated in Item 5 of the Attachment and 
the limits of liability of all other nuclear energy liability insurance 
policies (facility form) applicable to such common occurrence and issued 
by Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters exceeds $45,000,000, the 
amount of financial protection specified in Item 2 a and b of the 
Attachment shall be deemed to be reduced by that proportion of the 
difference between said sum and $45,000,000 as the limit of liability of 
the Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters policy designated in 
Item 5 of the Attachment bears to the sum of the limits of liability of 
all nuclear energy liability insurance policies (facility form) 
applicable to such common occurrence and issued by Mutual Atomic Energy 
Liability Underwriters;
    (c) If any of the other applicable agreements is with a person who 
has furnished financial protection in a form other than a nuclear energy 
liability insurance policy (facility form) issued by Nuclear Energy 
Liability-Property Insurance Association or Mutual Atomic Energy 
Liability Underwriters, and if also the sum of the amount of financial 
protection established under this agreement and the amounts of financial 
protection established under all other applicable agreements exceeds an 
amount equal to the sum of $200,000,000 and the amount available as 
secondary financial protection, the obligations of the licensee shall 
not exceed a greater proportion of an amount equal to the sum of 
$200,000,000 and the amount available as secondary financial protection 
than the amount of financial protection established under this agreement 
bears to the sum of such amount and the amounts of financial protection 
established under all other applicable agreements.
    (d) As used in this paragraph 6., Article II and in Article III, 
other applicable agreements means each other agreement entered into by 
the Commission pursuant to subsection 170(c). of the Act in which 
agreement the nuclear incident is defined as a common occurrence. As 
used in this paragraph 6., Article II, the obligations of the licensee 
means the obligations of the licensee under subsection 53e(8) of the Act 
to indemnify the United States and the Commission from public liability, 
together with any public liability satisfied by the insurers under the 
policy or policies designated in the Attachment, and the reasonable 
costs incurred by the insurers in investigating and settling claims and 
defending suits for damage.
    7. The obligations of the licensee under this Article shall not be 
affected by any failure or default on the part of the Commission or the 
Government of the United States to fulfill any or all of its obligations 
under this agreement. Bankruptcy or insolvency of any person indemnified 
other than the licensee, or of the estate of any person indemnified 
other than the licensee, shall not relieve the licensee of any of its 
obligations hereunder.

                               Article III

    1. The Commission undertakes and agrees to indemnify and hold 
harmless the licensee and other persons indemnified, as their interest 
may appear, from public liability.

agrees to pay to such person

[[Page 791]]

those sums which such person would have been obligated to pay if such 
property had belonged to another; provided, that the obligation of the 
Commission under this paragraph 2 does not apply with respect to:
    (a) Property which is located at the location described in Item 4 of 
the Attachment or at the location described in Item 3 of the

such property described in the proviso to paragraph 2 of this Article) 
as in the aggregate exceed the amount of financial protection.
    (b) With respect to a common occurrence, the obligations of the 
Commission under this agreement shall apply only with respect to such 
public liability and such damage to property of persons legally liable 
for the nuclear incident (other than such property described in the 
proviso to paragraph 2 of this Article) as in the aggregate exceed 
$200,000,000.
    5. The obligations of the Commission under this agreement shall 
apply only with respect to nuclear incidents occurring during the term 
of this agreement.

agreements and contracts to which the Commission is a party shall not, 
with respect to any nuclear incident, in the aggregate exceed whichever 
of the following is the lowest: (a) $500,000,000; (b) $560,000,000 less 
the amount of financial protection required under this agreement; or (c) 
with respect to a common occurrence, $560,000,000 less the sum of the 
amounts of financial protection established under this agreement and all 
other applicable agreements.
    7. The obligations of the Commission under this agreement, except to 
the licensee for damage to property of the licensee, shall not be 
affected by any failure on the part of the licensee to fulfill its 
obligations under this agreement. Bankruptcy or insolvency of the 
licensee or any other person indemnified, or of the estate of the 
licensee or any other person indemnified, shall not relieve the 
Commission of any of its obligations hereunder.

    Insurance is provided by this Master Policy only through a 
certificate. No insurance is afforded with respect to bodily injury or 
property damage caused prior to August 1, 1977 by a nuclear incident.

                               Conditions

                            1. annual premium

    The named insureds designated in a certificate shall pay to the 
companies the annual premium for each calendar year or part thereof.
    Such annual premium shall be determined by the companies and stated 
in a written notice mailed to the first named insured shown in Item 1 of 
a certificate, and shall be due and payable as stated in such notice.

                        2. retrospective premium

    The named insureds designated in a certificate shall pay to the 
companies retrospective premium in the event of excess losses due to 
bodily injury or property damage caused during their certificate period 
by a nuclear incident arising out of or in connection with a nuclear 
reactor described in Item 3 of the certificate or in Item 3 of any other 
certificate. The amount of retrospective premium-due under each 
certificate shall be determined by multiplying such excess losses by the 
ratio of the maximum retrospective premium payable with respect to the 
nuclear incident under the certificate to the total of the maximum 
retrospective premiums payable with respect to the nuclear incident 
under all such certificates.

[[Page 797]]

    If any portion of the bodily injury or property damage to which this 
Master Policy applies is caused during any portion of a certificate 
period by a nuclear incident, the retrospective premium the named 
insureds designated in such certificate are obligated to pay shall be 
determined as if all bodily injury or property damage to which this 
Master Policy applies caused by the nuclear incident had been caused 
during the certificate period of such certificate.
    The maximum retrospective premium that the named insureds designated 
in a certificate shall pay to the companies for all excess losses 
arising out of any one nuclear incident is the amount stated in Item 7 
of their certificate.
    In the event of two more nuclear incidents, the maximum amount of 
retrospective premium that shall be due from and payable by the named 
insureds in one calendar year shall not exceed twice the amount stated 
in Item 7 of their certificate. Any amount in excess thereof shall be 
paid in subsequent calendar years as billed by the companies.
    In addition, an allowance for applicable premium taxes shall be 
determined by the companies and paid to them by the named insureds at 
the time retrospective premiums are due and payable.
    After a nuclear incident resulting in excess losses, the companies 
shall mail to the first named insured designated in Item 1 of a 
certificate written notice of the retrospective premium and allowance 
for premium taxes then due under such certificate. Such notice shall 
also constitute notice to all other named insureds designated in such 
certificate. The named insureds shall pay directly to the Nuclear Energy 
Liability Insurance Association the retrospective premium and allowance 
for premium taxes stated in the notice. The notice shall specify a date 
no earlier than 60 days after mailing by which time payment is to be 
received by the Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association.
    The companies shall at least annually review their estimate of 
excess losses arising out of the nuclear incident and shall adjust the 
retrospective premium and allowance for premium taxes accordingly. If 
the amount due from the named insureds is increased, written notice 
shall be mailed to the first named insured in accordance with the 
foregoing paragraph; if deceased the companies shall return the excess 
to the first named insured.
    The obligation of the named insureds to pay retrospective premium 
and the allowance for premium taxes for excess losses arising out of a 
nuclear incident shall continue until the named insureds have paid the 
maximum retrospective premium stated in Item 7 of their certificate plus 
allowance for premium taxes.
    The companies shall send to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
summaries of their estimates of excess losses arising out of the nuclear 
incident and their computations of retrospective premium and the 
allowance for premium taxes due.
    All retrospective premium (but not the allowance for premium taxes) 
received by the companies is to be held by the companies separate from 
the companies' other assets and is to be used by the companies only for 
the purpose of paying excess losses. Any investment income received by 
the companies from such retrospective premium shall accrue to the 
benefit of the named insureds. This paragraph shall not apply to any 
retrospective premium received by the companies as reimbursement for any 
funds expended pursuant to Condition 4.
    No commission will be paid with respect to retrospective premium and 
allowance for premium taxes.

                          3. limit of liability

    Regardless of the number of
    (a) Persons or organizations who are insureds under this Master 
Policy, or
    (b) Claims made and suits brought against any and all insureds, or
    (c) Policies or contracts of primary financial protection or 
certificates which apply to the nuclear incident, or
    (d) Years this Master Policy and any certificate shall continue in 
force,

The total liability of the companies under this Master Policy for all 
excess losses arising out of any nuclear incident shall not exceed the 
amount of retrospective premium actually received by the companies 
pursuant to Condition 2 with respect to such nuclear incident plus the 
companies' contingent liability, if any, as determined by Condition 4. 
Reimbursement of the companies for funds expended pursuant to Condition 
4 shall not operate to increase the total liability of the companies.

                4. contingent liability of the companies

    The companies have a contingent liability under this Master Policy 
for payment of excess losses but only if, and to the extent that, the 
retrospective premium due under one or more certificates is not paid. In 
the event of any such failure to pay retrospective premiums, the 
companies' obligations under this Condition 4 are limited as follows:
    Regardless of the number of nuclear incidents which cause bodily 
injury or property damage to which this Master Policy applies, the 
number of years this Master Policy is in force, the number of 
certificates issued or in effect, or the number of annual premiums paid 
or payable.
    (a) The total contingent liability of the companies for all excess 
losses arising out of two or more nuclear incidents shall not exceed 
$46,500,000;

[[Page 798]]

    (b) Subject to the above provision (a), the total contingent 
liability of the companies for all excess losses arising out of any one 
nuclear incident shall not exceed $23,250,000;
    (c) Subject to the above provisions (a) and (b), the maximum amount 
to be paid by the companies in any one calendar year because of 
contingent liability for excess losses shall not exceed $23,250,000.
    If a named insured designated in a certificate shall become 
insolvent or be adjudged bankrupt, the companies' obligation under this 
Condition 4 shall not apply to the failure of any named insured 
designated in such certificate to pay retrospective premium with respect 
to excess losses because of bodily injury or property damage caused 
after the date of such insolvency or bankruptcy.

       5. investigation, defense or settlement of claims or suits

    Subject to the provisions of any written agreement between the 
companies and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the companies shall 
defend any claim or suit alleging bodily injury or property damage 
caused by a nuclear incident and seeking damages which are payable under 
this Master Policy, and may make such investigation and settlement of 
any claim or suit as they deem expedient. In no event shall the 
companies be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any 
claim or suit after the companies have paid the amount of retrospective 
premium actually received for excess losses arising out of the nuclear 
incident plus the amount of their contingent liability, if any.

                     6. primary financial protection

    Regardless of the number of policies or contracts of primary 
financial protection applicable to a nuclear incident, the limit of 
liability of all such policies or contracts shall be deemed to be 
exhausted when the sums paid under all such policies or contracts are 
equal to the lesser of (1) the sum of the limits of liability available 
under all such primary financial protection or (2) one hundred forty 
million dollars.
    The named insured designated in a certificate shall maintain in full 
effect during the currency of such certificate the primary financial 
protection described therein, except for any reduction of the limit of 
liability of such primary financial protection solely as the result of 
sums paid thereunder. Failure of the named insureds to comply with the 
foregoing shall not invalidate this Master Policy, but in the event of 
such failure the companies shall be liable only to the extent that they 
would have been liable and the named insureds complied therewith.
    In the event that the limit of liability of the primary financial 
protection is reduced, such names insureds shall immediately inform the 
companies thereof and make all reasonable efforts to reinstate such 
limit.
    Upon the companies' request the named insureds shall provide the 
companies with a certified copy of any policy or other contract of 
primary financial protection. No amendment of the primary financial 
protection shall increase, extend or broaden the insurance provided by 
this Master Policy unless the companies agree to the amendment by an 
endorsement issued to form a part of this Master Policy.

  7. interest to be paid by named insured on retrospective premium and 
                 allowance for premium taxes in default

    If retrospective premium or allowance for premium taxes is not paid 
when due by the named insureds designated in Item 1 of a certificate, 
such named insureds shall be obligated to pay, in addition to the amount 
in default, interest thereon during the period of default. Such interest 
shall be computed at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) three 
percent plus (b) a rate of interest equal to Moody's Average Public 
Utility Bond Yield described in the issue of Moody's Bond Survey current 
on the date that the retrospective premium and allowance for premium 
taxes were due. The annual rate of interest shall be adjusted monthly 
during the period of default to reflect any revisions of Moody's Average 
Public Utility Bond Yield described in the issue of Moody's Bond Survey 
current on the first business day of each such month.
    The interest so received shall be used to pay to the companies 
interest at the annual rate described above for any funds the companies 
have paid pursuant to Condition 4. Any balance remaining shall accrue to 
the benefit of named insureds not in default as if it were investment 
income on retrospective premium.

              8. notice of nuclear incident, claim or suit

    In the event of bodily injury or property damage to which this 
Master Policy applies or of a nuclear incident which may give rise to 
claims therefor, written notice containing particulars sufficient to 
identify the insured and also reasonably obtainable information with 
respect to the time, place and circumstances thereof, and the names and 
addresses of the injured and of available witnesses, shall be given by 
or for the insured to Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or 
the companies as soon as practicable. If claim is made or suit is 
brought against the insured, the insured shall immediately forward to 
Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or the companies every 
demand, notice, summons or other process received by or on behalf of the 
insured.

[[Page 799]]

              9. assistance and cooperation of the insured

    The insured shall cooperate with the companies and, upon the 
companies' request, attend hearings and trials and assist in making 
settlements, in securing and giving evidence, in obtaining the 
attendance of witnesses and in the conduct of any legal proceedings in 
connection with the subject matter of this insurance. The insured shall 
not, except at the insured's own cost, make any payment, assume any 
obligation or incur any expense.

                      10. action against companies

    No action shall lie against the companies or any of them unless, as 
a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have fully complied 
with all the terms of this Master Policy, nor until the amount of the 
insured's obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by 
judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement 
of the insured, the claimant and the companies.
    Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who 
has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be 
entitled to recover under this Master Policy to the extent of the 
insurance afforded by this Master Policy. No person or organization 
shall have any right under this Master Policy to join the companies or 
any of them as parties to any action against the insured to determine 
the insured's liability, nor shall the companies or any of them be 
impleaded by the insured or the insured's legal representative. Except 
as provided in Condition 4, bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or 
of the insured's estate shall not relieve the companies of any of their 
obligations hereunder.

                             11. subrogation

    In the event of any payment under this Master Policy, the companies 
may participate with the insured and any underlying insurer in the 
exercise of all the insured's rights of recovery against any person or 
organization liable therefor. Prior to knowledge of bodiliy injury or 
property damage to which this Master Policy applies or of a nuclear 
incident which may give rise to claims therefor, the insured may waive 
in writing any right of recovery against any person or organization. 
After such knowledge, the insured shall not waive or otherwise prejudice 
any such right of recovery but shall do everything necessary to secure 
such rights. Recoveries shall be applied first to reimburse any person 
or organization (including the insured) that may have paid any amount 
with respect to liability in excess of the limit of the companies' 
liability hereunder; then to reimburse the companies up to the amount 
paid hereunder; and lastly to reimburse anyone entitiled to claim the 
residue, if any. A different apportionment maybe made by agreement 
signed by all parties affected.
    Reasonable expenses incurred in the exercise of rights of recovery 
shall be apportioned in the ratio of the respective losses for which 
recovery is sought. The companies shall, after deducting all of their 
expenses in securing recovery, apply the net amount of recoveries made 
by the companies as a credit in determining the amount of excess losses.

                           12. other insurance

    This insurance shall be excess insurance over primary financial 
protection.
    This insurance is concurrent with insurance afforded by a Master 
Policy--Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance (Secondary Financial 
Protection) issued to the named insured by Mutual Atomic Energy 
Liability Underwriters, hereinafter called concurrent insurance. The 
companies shall not be liable under this Master Policy for a greater 
proportion of excess losses than the applicable limit of liability 
described in Condition 3 bears to the sum of (a) such limit plus (b) the 
applicable limit of liability of such concurrent insurance.
    If the insured has other valid and collectible insurance (other than 
primary financial protection or concurrent insurance) applicable to 
excess losses covered by this Master Policy, the insurance afforded by 
this Master Policy shall be primary insurance under such other 
insurance.

                               13. changes

    Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any agent or by any 
other person shall not effect a waiver or a change in any part of this 
Master Policy or estop the companies from asserting any right under the 
terms of this Master Policy; nor shall the terms of this Master Policy 
be waived or changed, except by endorsement executed by Nuclear Energy 
Liability Insurance Association on behalf of the companies and issued to 
form a part of this Master Policy.

                             14. assignment

    Assignment of interest by the named insured shall not bind the 
companies until their consent is endorsed hereon; if, however, the named 
insured shall die or be declared bankrupt or insolvent, this Master 
Policy shall cover such named insured's legal representative, receiver 
or trustee as an insured under this Master Policy, but only with respect 
to such legal representative's, receiver's or trustee's liability as 
such, and then only provided written notice of the legal 
representative's, receiver's or trustee's appointment as such is given 
to the companies within ten days after such appointment.

[[Page 800]]

       15. custodian of the policy--nuclear regulatory commission

    The named insureds have designated the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
as the custodian of this Master Policy and any endorsements thereto.

                            16. cancellation

    The first named insured designated in Item 1 of a certificate may 
cancel such certificate by mailing to the companies and the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission written notice stating when, not less than thirty 
days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective.
    The companies may cancel any certificate by mailing to the first 
named insured designated in Item 1 of such certificate written notice 
stating when, not less than ninety days thereafter, such cancellation 
shall be effective; provided that in the event of non-payment of any 
annual premium, retrospective premium or allowance for premium taxes due 
under a certificate, such certificate may be canceled by the companies 
by mailing to the first named insured designated therein written notice 
stating when, not less than thirty days thereafter, such cancellation 
shall be effective.
    The mailing of notice as aforesaid shall be sufficient proof of 
notice. The effective date and time of cancellation stated in the notice 
shall become the end of the certificate period. Delivery of such written 
notice, either by the first named insured designated in Item 1 of a 
certificate or by the companies, shall be equivalent to mailing.
    A copy of the companies' cancellation notice shall be mailed to the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but mailing such copy is not a condition 
of cancellation.
    If a certificate is canceled, the earned portion of the annual 
premium shall be computed pro-rata. Adjustment of the annual premium, if 
any, may be made either at the time cancellation is effective or as soon 
as practicable after cancellation becomes effective, but payment or 
tender of unearned premium is not a condition of cancellation.
    Cancellation or termination of any certificate shall not terminate 
the obligation of a named insured to pay retrospective premium and the 
allowance for premium taxes as provided in such named insured's 
certificate and Condition 2 of this Master Policy.
    This Master Policy shall terminate automatically on the effective 
date and time of cancellation or termination of the last certificate in 
effect.

required by the provisions of this Master Policy may be given to any one 
of the companies, and such notice, statement or proof of loss so given 
shall be valid and binding as to all companies.
    (b) In any action or suit against the companies, service of process 
may be made on any one of them and such service shall be deemed valid 
and binding service on all companies.
    (c) Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association is the agent of 
the companies with respect to all matters pertaining to this insurance. 
All notices or other communications required by this Master Policy to be 
given to the companies may be given to such agent, at its office at The 
Exchange, Suite 245, 270 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, Connecticut--
06032 with the same force and effect as if given directly to the 
companies. Any requests, demands or agreements made by such agent shall 
be deemed to have been made directly by the companies.

                18. authorization of first named insured

    Except with respect to compliance with the obligations imposed on 
the insured by Conditions 8, 9, 10 and 11 of this Master Policy, the 
first named insured designated in Item 1 of a certificate is authorized 
to act for every other person and organization insured under such 
certificate in all matters pertaining to this insurance.

    19. changes in subscribing companies and in their proportionate 
                                liability

    The members of Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association

section, the State may adopt alternatives (including, where appropriate, 
site-specific alternatives) to the requirements adopted and enforced by 
the Commission for the same purpose if, after notice and opportunity for 
public hearing, the Commission determines that the alternatives will 
achieve a level of stabilization and containment of the sites concerned, 
and a level of protection for public health, safety and the environment 
from radiological and nonradiological hazards associated with the sites, 
which is equivalent to, to the extent practicable, or more stringent 
than the level which would be achieved by standards and requirements 
adopted and enforced by the Commission for the same purpose and any 
final standards promulgated by the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency in accordance with section 275. Alternative State 
requirements may take into account local or regional conditions, 
including geology, topography, hydrology and meteorology.

    (a) Application and registration fees. Each application or 
registration for which a fee is prescribed must be accompanied by a 
remittance for the full amount of the fee. The NRC will not issue a new 
license or an amendment increasing the scope of an existing license to a 
higher fee category before receiving the prescribed application fee. The 
application or registration fee(s) is charged whether the Commission 
approves the application or not. The application or registration fee(s) 
is also charged if the applicant withdraws the application or 
registration.
    (b) Licensing fees. (1) Licensing fees will be assessed to recover 
full costs for--
    (i) The review of applications for new licenses and approvals;
    (ii) The review of applications for amendments to and renewal of 
existing licenses or approvals;
    (iii) Preapplication consultations and reviews; and
    (iv) The full cost for project managers assigned to a specific plant 
or facility, excluding leave time and time spent on generic activities 
(such as rulemaking).
    (2) Full cost fees will be determined based on the professional 
staff time and appropriate contractual support services expended. The 
full cost fees for professional staff time will be determined at the 
professional hourly rates in effect the time the service was provided. 
The full cost fees are payable upon notification by the Commission.
    (3) The NRC intends to bill each applicant or licensee at quarterly 
intervals for all accumulated costs for each application the applicant 
or licensee has on file for NRC review, until the review is completed, 
except for costs that were deferred before August 9, 1991. The deferred 
costs will be billed as described in paragraphs (b)(5), (b)(6) and 
(b)(7) of this section. Each bill will identify the applications and 
documents submitted for review and the costs related to each.
    (4) The NRC intends to bill each applicant or licensee for costs 
related to project manager time on a quarterly basis. Each bill will 
identify the costs related to project manager time.
    (5) Costs for review of an application for renewal of a standard 
design certification which have been deferred prior to the effective 
date of this rule must be paid as follows: The full cost of review for a 
renewed standard design certification must be paid by the applicant for 
renewal or other entity supplying the design to an applicant for a 
construction permit, combined license issued under 10 CFR Part 52, or 
operating license, as appropriate, in five (5) equal installments. An 
installment is payable each of the first five times the renewed 
certification is referenced in an application for a construction permit, 
combined license, or operating license. The applicant for renewal shall 
pay the installment, unless another entity is supplying the design to 
the applicant for the construction permit, combined license, or 
operating license,

[[Page 824]]

in which case the entity shall pay the installment. If the design is not 
referenced, or if all of the costs are not recovered, within fifteen 
years after the date of renewal of the certification, the applicant for 
renewal shall pay the costs for the renewal, or remainder of those 
costs, at that time.
    (6) Costs for the review of an application for renewal of an early 
site permit which have been deferred prior to the effective date of this 
rule will continue to be deferred as follows: The holder of the renewed 
permit shall pay the applicable fees for the renewed permit at the time 
an application for a construction permit or combined license referencing 
the permit is filed. If, at the end of the renewal period of the permit, 
no facility application referencing the early site permit has been 
docketed, the permit holder shall pay any outstanding fees for the 
permit.
    (7)(i) The full cost of review for a standardized design approval or 
certification that has been deferred prior to the effective date of the 
rule must be paid by the holder of the design approval, the applicant 
for certification, or other entity supplying the design to an applicant 
for a construction permit, combined license issued under 10 CFR Part 52, 
or operating license, as appropriate, in five (5) equal installments. An 
installment is payable each of the first five times the approved/
certified design is referenced in an application for a construction 
permit, combined license issued under 10 CFR Part 52, or operating 
license. In the case of a standard design certification, the applicant 
for certification shall pay the installment, unless another entity is 
supplying the design to the applicant for the construction permit, 
combined license, or operating license, in which case the other entity 
shall pay the installment.
    (ii)(A) In the case of a design which has been approved but not 
certified and for which no application is pending, if the design is not 
referenced, or if all costs are not recovered within five years after 
the date of the preliminary design approval (PDA), or the final design 
approval (FDA), the applicant shall pay the costs, or the remainder of 
those costs, or remainder of those costs, at that time.
    (B) In the case of a design which has been approved and for which an 
application for certification is pending, no fees are due until after 
the certification is granted. If the design is not referenced, or if all 
costs are not recovered, within fifteen years after the date of 
certification, the applicant shall pay the costs, or remainder of those, 
at the time.
    (C) In the case of a design for which a certification has been 
granted, if the design is not referenced, or if all costs are not 
recovered, within fifteen years after the date of the certification, the 
applicant shall pay the costs for the review of the application, or 
remainder of those costs, at that time.
    (c) Inspection fees. (1) Inspection fees will be assessed to recover 
full cost for each resident inspector (including the senior resident 
inspector), assigned to a specific plant or facility. The fees assessed 
will be based on the number of hours that each inspector assigned to the 
plant or facility is in an official duty status (i.e., all time in a 
non-leave status), excluding time spent by a resident inspector in 
support of activities at another site. The hours will be billed at the 
appropriate hourly rate established in 10 CFR 170.20. Resident 
inspectors' time related to a specific inspection will be included in 
the fee assessed for the specific inspection in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Inspection fees will be assessed to recover the full cost for 
each specific inspection, including plant- or licensee-specific 
performance reviews and assessments, evaluations, and incident 
investigations. For inspections that result in the issuance of an 
inspection report, fees will be assessed for costs incurred up to 
approximately 30 days after the inspection report is issued. The costs 
for these inspections include preparation time, time on site, 
documentation time, and follow-up activities and any associated 
contractual service costs, but exclude the time involved in the 
processing and issuance of a notice of violation or civil penalty.
    (3) The NRC intends to bill for resident inspectors' time and for 
specific inspections subject to full cost recovery on a quarterly basis. 
The fees are

[[Page 825]]

payable upon notification by the Commission.
    (d) Special project fees. (1) All special projects performed by the 
Commission, unless otherwise exempt from fees or for which fees are 
otherwise specified in this part, will be assessed fees to recover the 
full cost of the service provided. Special projects means specific 
services provided by the Commission, including but not limited to--
    (i) Topical reports;
    (ii) Financial assurance submittals that do not require a license 
amendment;
    (iii) Responses to Confirmatory Action Letters;
    (iv) Uranium recovery licensees' land-use survey reports;
    (v) 10 CFR 50.71 final safety analysis reports; and
    (vi) Contested hearings on licensing actions directly involving U.S. 
Government national security initiatives, as determined by the NRC.
    (2) The NRC intends to bill each applicant or licensee at quarterly 
intervals until the special project is completed. Each bill will 
identify the special project, including any documents submitted for 
review or the specific contested hearing, and the related costs. The 
fees are payable upon notification by the Commission.
    (e) Part 55 review fees. Fees for Part 55 review services are based 
on NRC time spent in administering the examinations and tests and any 
related contractual costs. The fees assessed will also include related 
activities such as preparing, reviewing, and grading of the examinations 
and tests. The NRC intends to bill the costs at quarterly intervals to 
the licensee employing the operators.
    (f) Method of payment. All license fee payments are to be made 
payable to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The payments are to 
be made in U.S. funds by electronic funds transfer such as ACH 
(Automated Clearing House) using E.D.I. (Electronic Data Interchange), 
check, draft, money order, or credit card. Payment of invoices of $5,000 
or more should be paid via ACH through NRC's Lockbox Bank at the address 
indicated on the invoice. Credit card payments should be made up to the 
limit established by the credit card bank at the address indicated on 
the invoice. Specific written instructions for making electronic 
payments and credit card payments may be obtained by contacting the 
License Fee and Accounts Receivable Branch at 301-415-7554. In 
accordance with Department of the Treasury requirements, refunds will 
only be made upon receipt of information on the payee's financial 
institution and bank accounts.

\1\ Fees will not be charged for orders related to civil penalties or
  other civil sanctions issued by the Commission under Sec. 2.202 of
  this chapter or for amendments resulting specifically from the
  requirements of these orders. For orders unrelated to civil penalties
  or other civil sanctions, fees will be charged for any resulting
  licensee-specific activities not otherwise exempted from fees under
  this chapter. Fees will be charged for approvals issued under a
  specific exemption provision of the Commission's regulations under
  Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (e.g., 10 CFR 50.12, 73.5)
  and any other sections in effect now or in the future, regardless of
  whether the approval is in the form of a license amendment, letter of
  approval, safety evaluation report, or other form.
\2\ Full cost fees will be determined based on the professional staff
  time and appropriate contractual support services expended. For
  applications currently on file and for which fees are determined based
  on the full cost expended for the review, the professional staff hours
  expended for the review of the application up to the effective date of
  the final rule will be determined at the professional rates in effect
  at the time the service was provided. For those applications currently
  on file for which review costs have reached an applicable fee ceiling
  established by the June 20, 1984, and July 2, 1990, rules but are
  still pending completion of the review, the cost incurred after any
  applicable ceiling was reached through January 29, 1989, will not be
  billed to the applicant. Any professional staff-hours expended above
  those ceilings on or after January 30, 1989, will be assessed at the
  applicable rates established by Sec. 170.20, as appropriate, except
  for topical reports whose costs exceed $50,000. Costs which exceed
  $50,000 for any topical report, amendment, revision or supplement to a
  topical report completed or under review from January 30, 1989,
  through August 8, 1991, will not be billed to the applicant. Any
  professional hours expended on or after August 9, 1991, will be
  assessed at the applicable rate established in Sec. 170.20.
\3\ Inspections covered by this schedule are both routine and non-
  routine safety and safeguards inspections performed by NRC for the
  purpose of review or follow-up of a licensed program. Inspections are
  performed through the full term of the license to ensure that the
  authorized activities are being conducted in accordance with the
  Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, other legislation, Commission
  regulations or orders, and the terms and conditions of the license.
  Non-routine inspections that result from third-party allegations will
  not be subject to fees.
\4\ Imports only of major components for end-use at NRC-licensed
  reactors are now authorized under NRC general import license.

\1\ Types of fees--Separate charges, as shown in the schedule, will be
  assessed for preapplication consultations and reviews; applications
  for new licenses, approvals, or license terminations; possession-only
  licenses; issuances of new licenses and approvals; certain amendments
  and renewals to existing licenses and approvals; safety evaluations of
  sealed sources and devices; generally licensed device registrations;
  and certain inspections. The following guidelines apply to these
  charges:
(a) Application and registration fees. Applications for new materials
  licenses and export and import licenses; applications to reinstate
  expired, terminated, or inactive licenses, except those subject to
  fees assessed at full costs; applications filed by Agreement State
  licensees to register under the general license provisions of 10 CFR
  150.20; and applications for amendments to materials licenses that
  would place the license in a higher fee category or add a new fee
  category must be accompanied by the prescribed application fee for
  each category.
(1) Applications for licenses covering more than one fee category of
  special nuclear material or source material must be accompanied by the
  prescribed application fee for the highest fee category.
(2) Applications for new licenses that cover both byproduct material and
  special nuclear material in sealed sources for use in gauging devices
  will pay the appropriate application fee for fee Category 1.C. only.
(b) Licensing fees. Fees for reviews of applications for new licenses,
  renewals, and amendments to existing licenses, preapplication
  consultations and other documents submitted to the NRC for review, and
  project manager time for fee categories subject to full cost fees are
  due upon notification by the Commission in accordance with Sec.
  170.12(b).
(c) Amendment fees. Applications for amendments to export and import
  licenses must be accompanied by the prescribed amendment fee for each
  license affected. An application for an amendment to an export or
  import license or approval classified in more than one fee category
  must be accompanied by the prescribed amendment fee for the category
  affected by the amendment, unless the amendment is applicable to two
  or more fee categories, in which case the amendment fee for the
  highest fee category would apply.
(d) Inspection fees. Inspections resulting from investigations conducted
  by the Office of Investigations and nonroutine inspections that result
  from third-party allegations are not subject to fees. Inspection fees
  are due upon notification by the Commission in accordance with Sec.
  170.12(c).
(e) Generally licensed device registrations under 10 CFR 31.5.
  Submittals of registration information must be accompanied by the
  prescribed fee.
\2\ Fees will not be charged for orders related to civil penalties or
  other civil sanctions issued by the Commission under 10 CFR 2.202 or
  for amendments resulting specifically from the requirements of these
  orders. For orders unrelated to civil penalties or other civil
  sanctions, fees will be charged for any resulting licensee-specific
  activities not otherwise exempted from fees under this chapter. Fees
  will be charged for approvals issued under a specific exemption
  provision of the Commission's regulations under Title 10 of the Code
  of Federal Regulations (e.g., 10 CFR 30.11, 40.14, 70.14, 73.5, and
  any other sections in effect now or in the future), regardless of
  whether the approval is in the form of a license amendment, letter of
  approval, safety evaluation report, or other form. In addition to the
  fee shown, an applicant may be assessed an additional fee for sealed
  source and device evaluations as shown in Categories 9.A. through 9.D.
\3\ Full cost fees will be determined based on the professional staff
  time multiplied by the appropriate professional hourly rate
  established in Sec. 170.20 in effect when the service is provided,
  and the appropriate contractual support services expended. For
  applications currently on file for which review costs have reached an
  applicable fee ceiling established by the June 20, 1984, and July 2,
  1990, rules, but are still pending completion of the review, the cost
  incurred after any applicable ceiling was reached through January 29,
  1989, will not be billed to the applicant. Any professional staff-
  hours expended above those ceilings on or after January 30, 1989, will
  be assessed at the applicable rates established by ' 170.20, as
  appropriate, except for topical reports for which costs exceed
  $50,000. Costs which exceed $50,000 for each topical report,
  amendment, revision, or supplement to a topical report completed or
  under review from January 30, 1989, through August 8, 1991, will not

Sec. 171.11  Exemptions.

    (a) An annual fee is not required for:
    (1) A construction permit or license applied for by, or issued to, a 
nonprofit educational institution for a production or utilization 
facility, other than a power reactor, or for the possession and use of 
byproduct material, source material, or special nuclear material. This 
exemption does not apply to those byproduct, source, or special nuclear 
material licenses which authorize:
    (i) Human use;
    (ii) Remunerated services to other persons;
    (iii) Distribution of byproduct material, source material, or 
special nuclear material or products containing byproduct material, 
source material, or special nuclear material; or
    (iv) Activities performed under a Government contract.
    (2) Federally-owned and State-owned research reactors used primarily 
for educational training and academic research purposes. For purposes of 
this exemption, the term research reactor means a nuclear reactor that--
    (i) Is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under section 
104c. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2134(c)) for operation 
at a thermal power level of 10 megawatts or less; and
    (ii) If so licensed for operation at a thermal power level of more 
than 1 megawatt, does not contain--
    (A) A circulating loop through the core in which the licensee 
conducts fuel experiments;
    (B) A liquid fuel loading; or
    (C) An experimental facility in the core in excess of 16 square 
inches in cross-section.
    (b) The Commission may, upon application by an interested person or 
on its own initiative, grant an exemption from the requirements of this 
part that it determines is authorized by law or otherwise in the public 
interest. Requests for exemption must be filed with the NRC within 90 
days from the effective date of the final rule establishing the annual 
fees for which the exemption is sought in order to be considered. Absent 
extraordinary circumstances, any exemption requests filed beyond that 
date will not be considered. The filing of an exemption request does not 
extend the date on which the bill is payable. Only timely payment in 
full ensures avoidance of interest and penalty charges. If a partial or 
full exemption is granted, any overpayment will be refunded. Requests 
for clarification of or questions relating to an annual fee bill must 
also be filed within 90 days from the date of the initial invoice to be 
considered.
    (c) An exemption for reactors licensed to operate may be granted by 
the Commission taking into consideration each of the following factors:
    (1) Age of the reactor;
    (2) Number of customers in rate base;
    (3) Net increase in KWh cost for each customer directly related to 
the annual fee assessed under this part; and
    (4) Any other relevant matter which the licensee believes justifies 
the reduction of the annual fee.
    (d) The Commission may grant a materials licensee an exemption from 
the annual fee if it determines that the annual fee is not based on a 
fair and equitable allocation of the NRC costs. The following factors 
must be fulfilled as determined by the Commission for an exemption to be 
granted:
    (1) There are data specifically indicating that the assessment of 
the annual fee will result in a significantly disproportionate 
allocation of costs to the licensee, or class of licensees; or
    (2) There is clear and convincing evidence that the budgeted generic 
costs attributable to the class of licensees are neither directly or 
indirectly related to the specific class of licensee nor explicitly 
allocated to the licensee by Commission policy decisions; or
    (3) Any other relevant matter that the licensee believes shows that 
the annual fee was not based on a fair and equitable allocation of NRC 
costs.

Sec. 171.13  Notice.

    The annual fees applicable to any NRC licensee subject to this part 
and calculated in accordance with Sec. Sec. 171.15 and 171.16, will be 
published as a notice in the Federal Register as soon as possible but no 
later than the third quarter of the fiscal year. The annual fees will 
become due and payable to the NRC as indicated in Sec. 171.19. 
Quarterly payments of the annual fee of $100,000 or more will continue 
during the fiscal year and be based on the applicable annual fees as 
shown in Sec. Sec. 171.15 and 171.16 until a notice concerning the 
revised amount of the fees for the fiscal year is published by the NRC. 
If the NRC is unable to publish a final fee rule that becomes effective 
during the current fiscal year, fees would be assessed based on the 
rates in effect for the previous fiscal year.

[64 FR 31475, June 10, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 171.15  Annual fees: Reactor licenses and independent spent fuel
storage licenses.

    (a) Each person holding an operating license for a power, test, or 
research reactor; each person holding a combined license under part 52 
of this chapter after the Commission has made the finding under Sec. 
52.103(g); each person holding a part 50 or part 52 power reactor 
license that is in decommissioning or possession only status, except 
those that have no spent fuel onsite; and each person holding a part 72 
license who does not hold a part 50 or part 52 license shall pay the 
annual fee for each license held at any time during the Federal fiscal 
year in which the fee is due. This paragraph does not apply to test and 
research reactors exempted under Sec. 171.11(a).
    (b)(1) The FY 2011 annual fee for each operating power reactor which 
must be collected by September 30, 2011, is $4,673,000.
    (2) The FY 2011 annual fee is comprised of a base annual fee for 
power reactors licensed to operate, a base spent fuel storage/reactor 
decommissioning annual fee, and associated additional charges (fee-
relief adjustment). The activities comprising the spent storage/reactor 
decommissioning base annual fee are shown in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and 
(ii) of this section. The activities comprising the FY 2011 fee-relief 
adjustment are shown in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The activities 
comprising the FY 2011 base annual fee for operating power reactors are 
as follows:
    (i) Power reactor safety and safeguards regulation except licensing 
and inspection activities recovered under part 170 of this chapter and 
generic reactor decommissioning activities.
    (ii) Research activities directly related to the regulation of power 
reactors, except those activities specifically related to reactor 
decommissioning.
    (iii) Generic activities required largely for NRC to regulate power 
reactors (e.g., updating part 50 or 52 of this chapter, operating the 
Incident Response Center, new reactor regulatory infrastructure). The 
base annual fee for operating power reactors does not include generic 
activities specifically related to reactor decommissioning.
    (c)(1) The FY 2011 annual fee for each power reactor holding a 10 
CFR part 50 license that is in a decommissioning or possession-only 
status and has spent fuel onsite, and for each independent spent fuel 
storage 10 CFR part 72 licensee who does not hold a 10 CFR part 50 
license, is $241,000.
    (2) The FY 2011 annual fee is comprised of a base spent fuel 
storage/reactor decommissioning annual fee (which is also included in 
the operating power reactor annual fee shown in paragraph (b) of this 
section) and an additional charge (fee-relief adjustment). The 
activities comprising the FY 2011 fee-relief adjustment are shown in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The activities comprising the FY 2011 
spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning rebaselined annual fee are:
    (i) Generic and other research activities directly related to 
reactor decommissioning and spent fuel storage; and
    (ii) Other safety, environmental, and safeguards activities related 
to reactor decommissioning and spent fuel storage, except costs for 
licensing and inspection activities that are recovered under part 170 of 
this chapter.

[[Page 838]]

    (d)(1) The fee-relief adjustment allocated to annual fees includes a 
surcharge for the activities listed in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section, plus the amount remaining after total budgeted resources for 
the activities included in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii) of this 
section are reduced by the appropriations the NRC receives for these 
types of activities. If the NRC's appropriations for these types of 
activities are greater than the budgeted resources for the activities 
included in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii) of this section for a 
given FY, annual fees will be reduced. The activities comprising the FY 
2011 fee-relief adjustment are as follows:
    (i) Low-level waste disposal generic activities;
    (ii) Activities not attributable to an existing NRC licensee or 
class of licenses (e.g., international cooperative safety program and 
international safeguards activities, support for the Agreement State 
program); and
    (iii) Activities not currently subject to 10 CFR part 170 licensing 
and inspection fees based on existing law or Commission policy (e.g., 
reviews and inspections conducted of nonprofit educational institutions, 
costs that would not be collected from small entities based on 
Commission policy in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq., regulatory support for Agreement States, generic 
decommissioning/reclamation activities for fee classes other than power 
reactors and spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning, the in-situ 
leach rulemaking, activities for unregistered general licensees).
    (2) The total FY 2011 fee-relief adjustment allocated to the 
operating power reactor class of licenses is -$3.4 million, not 
including the amount allocated to the spent fuel storage/reactor 
decommissioning class. The FY 2011 operating power reactor fee-relief 
adjustment to be assessed to each operating power reactor is 
approximately -$32,313. This amount is calculated by dividing the total 
operating power reactor fee-relief adjustment (-$3.4 million) by the 
number of operating power reactors (104).
    (3) The FY 2011 fee-relief adjustment allocated to the spent fuel 
storage/reactor decommissioning class of licenses is -$236,916. The FY 
2011 spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning fee-relief adjustment to 
be assessed to each operating power reactor, each power reactor in 
decommissioning or possession-only status that has spent fuel onsite, 
and to each independent spent fuel storage 10 CFR part 72 licensee who 
does not hold a 10 CFR part 50 license, is approximately -$1,926. This 
amount is calculated by dividing the total fee-relief adjustment costs 
allocated to this class by the total number of power reactor licenses, 
except those that permanently ceased operations and have no fuel onsite, 
and 10 CFR part 72 licensees who do not hold a 10 CFR part 50 license.
    (e) The FY 2011 annual fees for licensees authorized to operate a 
research and test (nonpower) reactor licensed under part 50 of this 
chapter, unless the reactor is exempted from fees under Sec. 171.11(a), 
are as follows:

    Research reactor--$86,300.
    Test reactor--$86,300.

Sec. 171.16  Annual fees: Materials licensees, holders of certificates
of compliance, holders of sealed source and device registrations, 
holders of quality assurance program approvals, and government 
agencies licensed  by the NRC.

    (a)(1) The provisions of this section apply to person(s) who are 
authorized to conduct activities under--
    (i) 10 CFR part 30 for byproduct material;
    (ii) 10 CFR part 40 for source material;
    (iii) 10 CFR part 70 for special nuclear material;
    (iv) 10 CFR part 71 for packaging and transportation of radioactive 
material; and
    (v) 10 CFR part 76 for uranium enrichment.
    (2) Notwithstanding the other provisions in this section, the 
regulations in this part do not apply to uranium enrichment facilities 
until after the Commission verifies through inspection that the facility 
has been constructed in accordance with the requirements of

[[Page 839]]

the license, as required in 10 CFR parts 40 and 70.
    (3) In accordance with Sec. 171.17, each person identified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall pay the applicable annual fee for 
each license the person holds during the FY. Annual fees will be 
prorated for new licenses issued and for licenses for which termination 
is requested and activities permanently ceased during the FY as provided 
in Sec. 171.17. If a single license authorizes more than one activity 
(e.g., human use and irradiator activities), annual fees will be 
assessed for each fee category applicable to the license. If a person 
holds more than one license, the total annual fee assessed will be the 
cumulative total of the annual fees applicable to each license held.
    (b) The annual fee is comprised of a base annual fee and an 
allocation for fee-relief adjustment. The activities comprising the fee-
relief adjustment are shown in paragraph (e) of this section. The base 
annual fee is the sum of budgeted costs for the following activities:
    (1) Generic and other research activities directly related to the 
regulation of materials licenses as defined in this part; and
    (2) Other safety, environmental, and safeguards activities for 
materials licenses, except costs for licensing and inspection activities 
that are recovered under Part 170 of this chapter.
    (c) A licensee who is required to pay an annual fee under this 
section may qualify as a small entity. If a licensee qualifies as a 
small entity and provides the Commission with the proper certification 
along with its annual fee payment, the licensee may pay reduced annual 
fees as shown in the following table. Failure to file a small entity 
certification in a timely manner could result in the receipt of a 
delinquent invoice requesting the outstanding balance due and/or denial 
of any refund that might otherwise be due. The small entity fees are as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Annual fees will be assessed based on whether a licensee held a
  valid license with the NRC authorizing possession and use of
  radioactive material during the current FY. The annual fee is waived
  for those materials licenses and holders of certificates,
  registrations, and approvals who either filed for termination of their
  licenses or approvals or filed for possession only/storage licenses
  before October 1, 2010, and permanently ceased licensed activities
  entirely before this date. Annual fees for licensees who filed for
  termination of a license, downgrade of a license, or for a possession-
  only license during the FY and for new licenses issued during the FY
  will be prorated in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 171.17.
  If a person holds more than one license, certificate, registration, or
  approval, the annual fee(s) will be assessed for each license,
  certificate, registration, or approval held by that person. For
  licenses that authorize more than one activity on a single license
  (e.g., human use and irradiator activities), annual fees will be
  assessed for each category applicable to the license. Licensees paying
  annual fees under Category 1.A.(1) are not subject to the annual fees
  for Categories 1.C. and 1.D. for sealed sources authorized in the
  license.
\2\ Payment of the prescribed annual fee does not automatically renew
  the license, certificate, registration, or approval for which the fee
  is paid. Renewal applications must be filed in accordance with the
  requirements of parts 30, 40, 70, 71, 72, or 76 of this chapter.
\3\ Each FY, fees for these materials licenses will be calculated and
  assessed in accordance with Sec. 171.13 and will be published in the
  Federal Register for notice and comment.
\4\ Other facilities include licenses for extraction of metals, heavy
  metals, and rare earths.
\5\ There are no existing NRC licenses in these fee categories. If NRC
  issues a license for these categories, the Commission will consider
  establishing an annual fee for this type of license.
\6\ Standardized spent fuel facilities, 10 CFR parts 71 and 72
  Certificates of Compliance and related Quality Assurance program
  approvals, and special reviews, such as topical reports, are not
  assessed an annual fee because the generic costs of regulating these
  activities are primarily attributable to users of the designs,
  certificates, and topical reports.
\7\ Licensees in this category are not assessed an annual fee because
  they are charged an annual fee in other categories while they are
  licensed to operate.
\8\ No annual fee is charged because it is not practical to administer
  due to the relatively short life or temporary nature of the license.
\9\ Separate annual fees will not be assessed for pacemaker licenses
  issued to medical institutions that also hold nuclear medicine
  licenses under Categories 7.B. or 7.C.
\10\ This includes Certificates of Compliance issued to the Department
  of Energy that are not funded from the Nuclear Waste Fund.
\11\ See Sec. 171.15(c).
\12\ See Sec. 171.15(c).
\13\ No annual fee is charged for this category because the cost of the
  general license registration program applicable to licenses in this
  category will be recovered through 10 CFR part 170 fees.
\14\ Persons who possess radium sources that are used for operational
  purposes in another fee category are not also subject to the fees in
  this category. (This exception does not apply if the radium sources
  are possessed for storage only.)

    (e) The fee-relief adjustment allocated to annual fees includes the 
budgeted resources for the activities listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, plus the total budgeted resources for the activities included 
in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, as reduced by the 
appropriations NRC receives for these types of activities. If the NRC's 
appropriations for these types of activities are greater than the 
budgeted resources for the activities included in paragraphs (e)(2) and 
(e)(3) of this section for a given FY, a negative fee-relief adjustment 
(or annual fee reduction) will be allocated to annual fees. The 
activities comprising the FY 2011 fee-relief adjustment are as follows:
    (1) Low-level waste disposal generic activities;
    (2) Activities not attributable to an existing NRC licensee or class 
of licenses (e.g., international cooperative safety program and 
international safeguards activities, support for the Agreement State 
program); and
    (3) Activities not currently subject to 10 CFR part 170 licensing 
and inspection fees based on existing law or Commission policy (e.g., 
reviews and inspections conducted of nonprofit educational institutions, 
costs that would not be collected from small entities based on 
Commission policy in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq., regulatory support for Agreement States, generic 
decommissioning/reclamation activities for fee classes other than power 
reactors and spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning, the in-situ 
leach rulemaking, and activities for unregistered general licensees).

<R05>
Sec. 171.17  Proration.

    Annual fees will be prorated for NRC licensees as follows:
    (a) Reactors, 10 CFR part 72 licensees who do not hold 10 CFR part 
50 licenses, and materials licenses with annual fees of $100,000 or 
greater for a single fee category.
    (1) New licenses. The annual fees for new licenses for power 
reactors, non-power reactors, 10 CFR part 72 licensees who do not hold a 
10 CFR part 50 license, and materials licenses with annual fees of 
$100,000 or greater for a single fee category for the current FY, that 
are subject to fees under this part and are granted a license to operate 
on or after October 1 of a FY, are prorated on the basis of the number 
of days remaining in the FY. Thereafter, the full annual fee is due and 
payable each subsequent FY.
    (2) Terminations. The base operating power reactor annual fee for 
operating reactor licensees who have requested amendment to withdraw 
operating authority permanently during the FY will be prorated based on 
the number of days during the FY the license was in effect before 
docketing of the certifications for permanent cessation of operations 
and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel or when a final 
legally effective order to permanently cease operations has come into 
effect. The spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning annual fee for 
reactor licensees who permanently cease operations and have permanently 
removed fuel from the site during the FY will be prorated on the basis 
of the number of days remaining in the FY after docketing of both the 
certifications of permanent cessation of operations and permanent 
removal of fuel from the site. The spent fuel storage/reactor 
decommissioning annual fee will be prorated for those 10 CFR part 72 
licensees who do not hold a 10 CFR part 50 license who request 
termination of the 10 CFR part 72 license and permanently cease 
activities authorized by the license during the FY based on the number 
of days the license was in effect before receipt of the termination 
request. The annual fee for materials licenses with annual fees of 
$100,000 or greater for a single fee category for the current FY will be 
prorated based on the number of days remaining in the FY when a 
termination request or a request for a POL is received by the NRC, 
provided the licensee permanently ceased licensed activities during the 
specified period.
    (3) Downgraded licenses. The annual fee for a materials license with 
an annual fee of $100,000 or greater for a single fee category for the 
current FY, that is subject to fees under this part and downgraded on or 
after October 1 of a FY, is prorated upon request by the licensee on the 
basis of the number of days remaining in the FY when the application for 
downgrade is received by the NRC provided the licensee permanently 
ceased the stated activities during the specified period. Requests for 
proration must be filed with the NRC within 90 days from the effective 
date of the final rule establishing the annual fees for which a 
proration is sought. Absent extraordinary circumstances, any request for 
proration of the annual fee for a downgraded license filed beyond that 
date will not be considered.
    (b) Materials licenses (excluding 10 CFR part 72 licenses and 
materials license with annual fees of $100,000 or greater for a single 
fee category, included in Sec. 171.17(a)).
    (1) New licenses. The annual fee for a materials license that is 
subject to fees under this part and issued on or after October 1 of the 
FY is prorated on the basis of when the NRC issues the new license. New 
licenses issued during the period October 1 through March 31 of the FY 
will be assessed one-half the annual fee for that FY. New licenses 
issued on or after April 1 of the FY will not be assessed an annual fee 
for that FY. Thereafter, the full fee is due and payable each subsequent 
FY.
    (2) Terminations. The annual fee will be prorated for licenses for 
which a termination request or a request for a POL has been received on 
or after October 1 of a FY on the basis of when the application for 
termination or POL is received by the NRC provided the licensee 
permanently ceased licensed activities during the specified period. 
Licenses for which applications for termination or POL are filed during 
the period October 1 through March 31 of

[[Page 845]]

the FY are assessed one-half the annual fee for the applicable 
category(ies) for that FY. Licenses for which applications for 
termination or POL are filed on or after April 1 of the FY are assessed 
the full annual fee for that FY. Materials licenses transferred to a new 
Agreement State during the FY are considered terminated by the NRC, for 
annual fee purposes, on the date that the Agreement with the State 
becomes effective; therefore, the same proration provisions will apply 
as if the licenses were terminated.
    (3) Downgraded licenses. (i) The annual fee for a materials license 
that is subject to fees under this part and downgraded on or after 
October 1 of a FY is prorated upon request by the licensee on the basis 
of when the application for downgrade is received by the NRC provided 
the licensee permanently ceased the stated activities during the 
specified period. Requests for proration must be filed with the NRC 
within 90 days from the effective date of the final rule establishing 
the annual fees for which a proration is sought. Absent extraordinary 
circumstances, any request for proration of the annual fee for a 
downgraded license filed beyond that date will not be considered.
    (ii) Annual fees for licenses for which applications to downgrade 
are filed during the period October 1 through March 31 of the FY will be 
prorated as follows:
    (A) Licenses for which applications have been filed to reduce the 
scope of the license from a higher fee category(ies) to a lower fee 
category(ies) will be assessed one-half the annual fee for the higher 
fee category and one-half the annual fee for the lower fee 
category(ies), and, if applicable, the full annual fee for fee 
categories not affected by the downgrade; and
    (B) Licenses with multiple fee categories for which applications 
have been filed to downgrade by deleting a fee category will be assessed 
one-half the annual fee for the fee category being deleted and the full 
annual fee for the remaining categories.
    (iii) Licenses for which applications to downgrade are filed on or 
after April 1 of the FY are assessed the full fee for that FY.

Sec. 171.19  Payment.

    (a) Method of payment. Annual fee payments, made payable to the U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, are to be made in U.S. funds by 
electronic funds transfer such as ACH (Automated Clearing House) using 
EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), check, draft, money order, or credit 
card. Federal agencies may also make payment by the On-line Payment and 
Collection System (OPAC's). Where specific payment instructions are 
provided on the invoices to applicants and licensees, payment should be 
made accordingly, e.g. invoices of $5,000 or more should be paid via ACH 
through NRC's Lockbox Bank at the address indicated on the invoice. 
Credit card payments should be made up to the limit established by the 
credit card bank, in accordance with specific instructions provided with 
the invoices, to the Lockbox Bank designated for credit card payments. 
In accordance with Department of the Treasury requirements, refunds will 
only be made upon receipt of information on the payee's financial 
institution and bank accounts.
    (b) Annual fees in the amount of $100,000 or more and described in 
the Federal Register document issued under Sec. 171.13, must be paid in 
quarterly installments of 25 percent as billed by the NRC. The quarters 
begin on October 1, January 1, April 1, and July 1 of each fiscal year. 
The NRC will adjust the fourth quarterly invoice to recover the full 
amount of the revised annual fee. If the amounts collected in the first 
three quarters exceed the amount of the revised annual fee, the 
overpayment will be refunded. Licensees whose annual fee for the 
previous fiscal year was less than $100,000 (billed on the anniversary 
date of the license), and whose revised annual fee for the current 
fiscal year is $100,000 or greater (subject to quarterly billing), will 
be issued a bill upon publication of the final rule for the full amount 
of the revised annual fee for the current fiscal year, less any payments 
received for the current fiscal year based on the anniversary date 
billing process.
    (c) Annual fees that are less than $100,000 are billed on the 
anniversary

[[Page 846]]

date of the license. For annual fee purposes, the anniversary date of 
the license is considered to be the first day of the month in which the 
original license was issued by the NRC. Licensees that are billed on the 
license anniversary date will be assessed the annual fee in effect on 
the anniversary date of the license. Materials licenses subject to the 
annual fee that are terminated during the fiscal year but before the 
anniversary month of the license will be billed upon termination for the 
fee in effect at the time of the billing. New materials licenses subject 
to the annual fee will be billed in the month the license is issued or 
in the next available monthly billing for the fee in effect on the 
anniversary date of the license. Thereafter, annual fees for new 
licenses will be assessed in the anniversary month of the license.
    (d) Annual fees of less than $100,000 must be paid as billed by the 
NRC. Materials license annual fees that are less than $100,000 are 
billed on the anniversary date of the license. The materials licensees 
that are billed on the anniversary date of the license are those covered 
by fee categories 1.C., 1.D., 2.A.(2) through 2.A.(5), 2.B., 2.C., and 
3.A. through 9.D.
    (e) Payment is due on the invoice date and interest accrues from the 
date of the invoice. However, interest will be waived if payment is 
received within 30 days from the invoice date.

Sec. 171.23  Enforcement.

    If any person required to pay the annual fee fails to pay when the 
fee is due, or files a false certification with respect to qualifying as 
a small entity under the Regulatory Flexibility Criteria, the Commission 
may refuse to process any application submitted by or on behalf of the 
person with respect to any license issued to the person and may suspend 
or revoke any licenses held by the person. The filing of a false 
certification to qualify as a small entity under Sec. 171.16(c) of this 
part may also result in punitive action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.

[56 FR 31510, July 10, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 171.25  Collection, interest, penalties, and administrative
costs.

    All annual fees in Sec. Sec. 171.15 and 171.16 will be collected 
pursuant to the procedures of 10 CFR part 15. Interest, penalties and 
administrative costs for late payments will be assessed in accordance 
with 10 CFR part 15, of this chapter, 4 CFR part 102, and other relevant 
regulations of the United States Government, as appropriate. In the 
event a quarterly installment is not made by the appropriate due date 
specified in Sec. 171.19, the full fee becomes due and payable, with 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs of collection calculated 
from the date that quarterly installment was due.
