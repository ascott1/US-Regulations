                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1999), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 1910.1000  Air contaminants.

    An employee's exposure to any substance listed in Tables Z-1, Z-2, 
or Z-3 of this section shall be limited in accordance with the 
requirements of the following paragraphs of this section.
    (a) Table Z-1--(1) Substances with limits preceded by ``C''--Ceiling 
Values. An employee's exposure to any substance in Table Z-1, the 
exposure limit of which is preceded by a ``C'', shall at no time exceed 
the exposure limit given for that substance. If instantaneous monitoring 
is not feasible, then the ceiling shall be assessed as a 15-minute time 
weighted average exposure which shall not be exceeded at any time during 
the working day.
    (2) Other substances--8-hour Time Weighted Averages. An employee's 
exposure to any substance in Table Z-1, the exposure limit of which is 
not preceded by a ``C'', shall not exceed the 8-hour Time Weighted 
Average given for that substance in any 8-hour work shift of a 40-hour 
work week.
    (b) Table Z-2. An employee's exposure to any substance listed in 
Table Z-2 shall not exceed the exposure limits specified as follows:
    (1) 8-hour time weighted averages. An employee's exposure to any 
substance listed in Table Z-2, in any 8-hour work shift of a 40-hour 
work week, shall not exceed the 8-hour time weighted average limit given 
for that substance in Table Z-2.

[[Page 8]]

    (2) Acceptable ceiling concentrations. An employee's exposure to a 
substance listed in Table Z-2 shall not exceed at any time during an 8-
hour shift the acceptable ceiling concentration limit given for the 
substance in the table, except for a time period, and up to a 
concentration not exceeding the maximum duration and concentration 
allowed in the column under ``acceptable maximum peak above the 
acceptable ceiling concentration for an 8-hour shift.''
    (3) Example. During an 8-hour work shift, an employee may be exposed 
to a concentration of Substance A (with a 10 ppm TWA, 25 ppm ceiling and 
50 ppm peak) above 25 ppm (but never above 50 ppm) only for a maximum 
period of 10 minutes. Such exposure must be compensated by exposures to 
concentrations less than 10 ppm so that the cumulative exposure for the 
entire 8-hour work shift does not exceed a weighted average of 10 ppm.
    (c) Table Z-3. An employee's exposure to any substance listed in 
Table Z-3, in any 8-hour work shift of a 40-hour work week, shall not 
exceed the 8-hour time weighted average limit given for that substance 
in the table.
    (d) Computation formulae. The computation formula which shall apply 
to employee exposure to more than one substance for which 8-hour time 
weighted averages are listed in subpart Z of 29 CFR part 1910 in order 
to determine whether an employee is exposed over the regulatory limit is 
as follows:
    (1)(i) The cumulative exposure for an 8-hour work shift shall be 
computed as follows:

E = (C<INF>a</INF> T<INF>a</INF>+C<INF>b</INF> T<INF>b</INF>+. . 
    .C<INF>n</INF> T<INF>n</INF>)<divide>8

Where:

E is the equivalent exposure for the working shift.
C is the concentration during any period of time T where the 
concentration remains constant.
T is the duration in hours of the exposure at the concentration C.

The value of E shall not exceed the 8-hour time weighted average 
specified in subpart Z of 29 CFR part 1910 for the substance involved.

    (ii) To illustrate the formula prescribed in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of 
this section, assume that Substance A has an 8-hour time weighted 
average limit of 100 ppm noted in Table Z-1. Assume that an employee is 
subject to the following exposure:

Two hours exposure at 150 ppm
Two hours exposure at 75 ppm
Four hours exposure at 50 ppm

    Substituting this information in the formula, we have

(2 x 150+2 x 75+4 x 50)<divide>8=81.25 ppm

    Since 81.25 ppm is less than 100 ppm, the 8-hour time weighted 
average limit, the exposure is acceptable.

    (2)(i) In case of a mixture of air contaminants an employer shall 
compute the equivalent exposure as follows:

E<INF>m</INF>=(C<INF>1</INF><divide>L<INF>1</INF>+C<INF>2</INF><divide>L<INF>2</INF>
    )+. . .(C<INF>n</INF><divide>L<INF>n</INF>)

Where:

E<INF>m</INF> is the equivalent exposure for the mixture.
C is the concentration of a particular contaminant.
L is the exposure limit for that substance specified in subpart Z of 29 
CFR part 1910.

The value of E<INF>m</INF> shall not exceed unity (1).

    (ii) To illustrate the formula prescribed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of 
this section, consider the following exposures:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Actual
                                              concentration
                  Substance                     of 8-hour     8-hour TWA
                                                 exposure     PEL (ppm)
                                                  (ppm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
B...........................................           500         1,000
C...........................................            45           200
D...........................................            40           200
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Substituting in the formula, we have:

E<INF>m</INF>=500<divide>1,000+45<divide>200+40<divide>200
E<INF>m</INF>=0.500+0.225+0.200
E<INF>m</INF>=0.925

Since E<INF>m</INF> is less than unity (1), the exposure combination is 
within acceptable limits.

    (e) To achieve compliance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of this 
section, administrative or engineering controls must first be determined 
and implemented whenever feasible. When such controls are not feasible 
to achieve full compliance, protective equipment or any other protective 
measures shall be used to keep the exposure of employees to air 
contaminants within the limits prescribed in this section. Any equipment 
and/or technical measures used for this purpose must be approved for 
each particular use by a competent industrial hygienist or other 
technically qualified person. Whenever respirators

[[Page 9]]

are used, their use shall comply with 1910.134.
    (f) Effective dates. The exposure limits specified have been in

\1\ The PELs are 8-hour TWAs unless otherwise noted; a (C) designation denotes a ceiling limit. They are to be
  determined from breathing-zone air samples.
(a) Parts of vapor or gas per million parts of contaminated air by volume at 25  C and 760 torr.
(b) Milligrams of substance per cubic meter of air. When entry is in this column only, the value is exact; when
  listed with a ppm entry, it is approximate.
(c) The CAS number is for information only. Enforcement is based on the substance name. For an entry covering
  more than one metal compound, measured as the metal, the CAS number for the metal is given--not CAS numbers
  for the individual compounds.
(d) The final benzene standard in 1910.1028 applies to all occupational exposures to benzene except in some
  circumstances the distribution and sale of fuels, sealed containers and pipelines, coke production, oil and
  gas drilling and production, natural gas processing, and the percentage exclusion for liquid mixtures; for the
  excepted subsegments, the benzene limits in Table Z-2 apply. See 1910.1028 for specific circumstances.
(e) This 8-hour TWA applies to respirable dust as measured by a vertical elutriator cotton dust sampler or
  equivalent instrument. The time-weighted average applies to the cottom waste processing operations of waste
  recycling (sorting, blending, cleaning and willowing) and garnetting. See also 1910.1043 for cotton dust
  limits applicable to other sectors.
(f) All inert or nuisance dusts, whether mineral, inorganic, or organic, not listed specifically by substance
  name are covered by the Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR) limit which is the same as the inert or
  nuisance dust limit of Table Z-3.
\2\ See Table Z-2.
\3\ See Table Z-3.
\4\ Varies with compound.

Sec. 1910.1001  Asbestos.

    (a) Scope and application. (1) This section applies to all 
occupational exposures to asbestos in all industries covered by the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act, except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (2) This section does not apply to construction work as defined in 
29 CFR 1910.12(b). (Exposure to asbestos in construction work is covered 
by 29 CFR 1926.1101).
    (3) This section does not apply to ship repairing, shipbuilding and 
shipbreaking employments and related employments as defined in 29 CFR 
1915.4. (Exposure to asbestos in these employments is covered by 29 CFR 
1915.1001).
    (b) Definitions.
    Asbestos includes chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite, tremolite 
asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, actinolite asbestos, and any of these 
minerals that have been chemically treated and/or altered.
    Asbestos-containing material (ACM) means any material containing

    (c) Permissible exposure limit (PELS)--(1) Time-weighted average 
limit (TWA). The employer shall ensure that no employee is exposed to an 
airborne concentration of asbestos in excess of 0.1 fiber per cubic 
centimeter of air as an eight (8)-hour time-weighted average (TWA) as 
determined by the method prescribed in Appendix A to this section, or by 
an equivalent method.
    (2) Excursion limit. The employer shall ensure that no employee is 
exposed to an airborne concentration of asbestos in excess of 1.0 fiber 
per cubic centimeter of air (1 f/cc) as averaged over a sampling period 
of thirty (30) minutes as determined by the method prescribed in

    (d) Exposure monitoring--(1) General. (i) Determinations of employee 
exposure shall be made from breathing zone air samples that are 
representative of the 8-hour TWA and 30-minute short-term exposures of 
each employee.
    (ii) Representative 8-hour TWA employee exposures shall be 
determined on the basis of one or more samples representing full-shift 
exposures for each shift for each employee in each job classification in 
each work area. Representative 30-minute short-term employee exposures 
shall be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing 30 
minute exposures associated with operations that are most likely to 
produce exposures above the excursion limit for each shift for each job 
classification in each work area.
    (2) Initial monitoring. (i) Each employer who has a workplace or 
work operation covered by this standard, except as provided for in 
paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section, shall perform 
initial monitoring of employees who are, or may reasonably be expected 
to be exposed to airborne concentrations at or above the TWA permissible 
exposure limit and/or excursion limit.
    (ii) Where the employer has monitored after March 31, 1992, for the 
TWA permissible exposure limit and/or the excursion limit, and the 
monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the 
employer may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Where the employer has relied upon objective data that 
demonstrate that asbestos is not capable of being released in airborne 
concentrations at or above the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or 
excursion limit under the expected conditions of processing, use,

[[Page 21]]

or handling, then no initial monitoring is required.
    (3) Monitoring frequency (periodic monitoring) and patterns. After 
the initial determinations required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section, samples shall be of such frequency and pattern as to represent 
with reasonable accuracy the levels of exposure of the employees. In no 
case shall sampling be at intervals greater than six months for 
employees whose exposures may reasonably be foreseen to exceed the TWA 
permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit.
    (4) Changes in monitoring frequency. If either the initial or the 
periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section statistically indicates that employee exposures are below the 
TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit, the employer may 
discontinue the monitoring for those employees whose exposures are 
represented by such monitoring.
    (5) Additional monitoring. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(4) of this section, the employer shall 
institute the exposure monitoring required under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) 
and (d)(3) of this section whenever there has been a change in the 
production, process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that 
may result in new or additional exposures above the TWA permissible 
exposure limit and/or excursion limit or when the employer has any 
reason to suspect that a change may result in new or additional 
exposures above the PEL and/or excursion limit.
    (6) Method of monitoring. (i) All samples taken to satisfy the 
monitoring requirements of paragraph (d) of this section shall be 
personal samples collected following the procedures specified in 
Appendix A.
    (ii) All samples taken to satisfy the monitoring requirements of 
paragraph (d) of this section shall be evaluated using the OSHA 
Reference Method (ORM) specified in Appendix A of this section, or an 
equivalent counting method.
    (iii) If an equivalent method to the ORM is used, the employer shall 
ensure that the method meets the following criteria:
    (A) Replicate exposure data used to establish equivalency are 
collected in side-by-side field and laboratory comparisons; and
    (B) The comparison indicates that 90% of the samples collected in 
the range 0.5 to 2.0 times the permissible limit have an accuracy range 
of plus or minus 25 percent of the ORM results at a 95% confidence level 
as demonstrated by a statistically valid protocol; and
    (C) The equivalent method is documented and the results of the 
comparison testing are maintained.
    (iv) To satisfy the monitoring requirements of paragraph (d) of this 
section, employers must use the results of monitoring analysis performed 
by laboratories which have instituted quality assurance programs that 
include the elements as prescribed in Appendix A of this section.
    (7) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) The employer 
shall, within 15 working days after the receipt of the results of any 
monitoring performed under the standard, notify the affected employees 
of these results in writing either individually or by posting of results 
in an appropriate location that is accessible to affected employees.
    (ii) The written notification required by paragraph (d)(7)(i) of 
this section shall contain the corrective action being taken by the 
employer to reduce employee exposure to or below the TWA and/or 
excursion limit, wherever monitoring results indicated that the TWA and/
or excursion limit had been exceeded.
    (e) Regulated Areas--(1) Establishment. The employer shall establish 
regulated areas wherever airborne concentrations of asbestos and/or PACM 
are in excess of the TWA and/or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (2) Demarcation. Regulated areas shall be demarcated from the rest 
of the workplace in any manner that minimizes the number of persons who 
will be exposed to asbestos.
    (3) Access. Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons or to persons authorized by the Act or regulations issued 
pursuant thereto.
    (4) Provision of respirators. Each person entering a regulated area 
shall be

[[Page 22]]

supplied with and required to use a respirator, selected in accordance 
with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (5) Prohibited activities. The employer shall ensure that employees 
do not eat, drink, smoke, chew tobacco or gum, or apply cosmetics in the 
regulated areas.
    (f) Methods of compliance--(1) Engineering controls and work 
practices. (i) The employer shall institute engineering controls and 
work practices to reduce and maintain employee exposure to or below the 
TWA and/or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, 
except to the extent that such controls are not feasible.
    (ii) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work practices 
that can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to 
or below the TWA and/or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of 
this section, the employer shall use them to reduce employee exposure to 
the lowest levels achievable by these controls and shall supplement them 
by the use of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements 
of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (iii) For the following operations, wherever feasible engineering 
controls and work practices that can be instituted are not sufficient to 
reduce the employee exposure to or below the TWA and/or excursion limit 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, the employer shall use them 
to reduce employee exposure to or below 0.5 fiber per cubic centimeter 
of air (as an eight-hour time-weighted average) or 2.5 fibers/cc for 30 
minutes (short-term exposure) and shall supplement them by the use of 
any combination of respiratory protection that complies with the 
requirements of paragraph (g) of this section, work practices and 
feasible engineering controls that will reduce employee exposure to or 
below the TWA and to or below the excursion limit permissible prescribed 
in paragraph (c) of this section: Coupling cutoff in primary asbestos 
cement pipe manufacturing; sanding in primary and secondary asbestos 
cement sheet manufacturing; grinding in primary and secondary friction 
product manufacturing; carding and spinning in dry textile processes; 
and grinding and sanding in primary plastics manufacturing.
    (iv) Local exhaust ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation and dust 
collection systems shall be designed, constructed, installed, and 
maintained in accordance with good practices such as those found in the 
American National Standard Fundamentals Governing the Design and 
Operation of Local Exhaust Systems, ANSI Z9.2-1979.
    (v) Particular tools. All hand-operated and power-operated tools 
which would produce or release fibers of asbestos, such as, but not 
limited to, saws, scorers, abrasive wheels, and drills, shall be 
provided with local exhaust ventilation systems which comply with 
paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (vi) Wet methods. Insofar as practicable, asbestos shall be handled, 
mixed, applied, removed, cut, scored, or otherwise worked in a wet state 
sufficient to prevent the emission of airborne fibers so as to expose 
employees to levels in excess of the TWA and/or excursion limit, 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, unless the usefulness of 
the product would be diminished thereby.
    (vii) [Reserved]
    (viii) Particular products and operations. No asbestos cement, 
mortar, coating, grout, plaster, or similar material containing 
asbestos, shall be removed from bags, cartons, or other containers in 
which they are shipped, without being either wetted, or enclosed, or 
ventilated so as to prevent effectively the release of airborne fibers.
    (ix) Compressed air. Compressed air shall not be used to remove 
asbestos or materials containing asbestos unless the compressed air is 
used in conjunction with a ventilation system which effectively captures 
the dust cloud created by the compressed air.
    (x) Flooring. Sanding of asbestos-containing flooring material is 
prohibited.
    (2) Compliance program. (i) Where the TWA and/or excursion limit is 
exceeded, the employer shall establish and implement a written program 
to reduce employee exposure to or below the TWA and to or below the 
excursion limit by means of engineering and work practice controls as 
required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and by the use of 
respiratory protection where

[[Page 23]]

required or permitted under this section.
    (ii) Such programs shall be reviewed and updated as necessary to 
reflect significant changes in the status of the employer's compliance 
program.
    (iii) Written programs shall be submitted upon request for 
examination and copying to the Assistant Secretary, the Director, 
affected employees and designated employee representatives.
    (iv) The employer shall not use employee rotation as a means of 
compliance with the TWA and/or excursion limit.
    (3) Specific compliance methods for brake and clutch repair:
    (i) Engineering controls and work practices for brake and clutch 
repair and service. During automotive brake and clutch inspection, 
disassembly, repair and assembly operations, the employer shall 
institute engineering controls and work practices to reduce employee 
exposure to materials containing asbestos using a negative pressure 
enclosure/HEPA vacuum system method or low pressure/wet cleaning method, 
which meets the detailed requirements set out in Appendix F to this 
section. The employer may also comply using an equivalent method which 
follows written procedures which the employer demonstrates can achieve 
results equivalent to Method A in Appendix F to this section. For 
facilities in which no more than 5 pair of brakes or 5 clutches are 
inspected, disassembled, repaired, or assembled per week, the method set 
forth in paragraph [D] of Appendix F to this section may be used.
    (ii) The employer may also comply by using an equivalent method 
which follows written procedures, which the employer demonstrates can 
achieve equivalent exposure reductions as do the two ``preferred 
methods.'' Such demonstration must include monitoring data conducted 
under workplace conditions closely resembling the process, type of 
asbestos containing materials, control method, work practices and 
environmental conditions which the equivalent method will be used, or 
objective data, which document that under all reasonably foreseeable 
conditions of brake and clutch repair applications, the method results 
in exposures which are equivalent to the methods set out in Appendix F 
to this section.
    (g) Respiratory protection--(1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering 
and work-practice controls.
    (ii) Work operations, such as maintenance and repair activities, for 
which engineering and work-practice controls are not feasible.
    (iii) Work operations for which feasible engineering and work-
practice controls are not yet sufficient to reduce employee exposure to 
or below the TWA and/or excursion limit.
    (iv) Emergencies.
    (2) Respirator program. (i) The employer must implement a 
respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b) 
through (d) (except (d)(1)(iii)), and (f) through (m).
    (ii) The employer must provide a tight-fitting, powered, air-
purifying respirator instead of any negative-pressure respirator 
specified in Table 1 of this section when an employee chooses to use 
this type of respirator and the respirator provides adequate protection 
to the employee.
    (iii) No employee must be assigned to tasks requiring the use of 
respirators if, based on their most recent medical examination, the 
examining physician determines that the employee will be unable to 
function normally using a respirator, or that the safety or health of 
the employee or other employees will be impaired by the use of a 
respirator. Such employees must be assigned to another job or given the 
opportunity to transfer to a different position, the duties of which 
they can perform. If such a transfer position is available, the position 
must be with the same employer, in the same geographical area, and with 
the same seniority, status, and rate of pay the employee had just prior 
to such transfer.

[[Page 24]]

    (3) Respirator selection. The employer must select and provide the 
appropriate respirator from Table 1 of this section.

do not smoke in work areas where they are occupationally exposed to 
asbestos because of activities in that work area.
    (j) Communication of hazards to employees--Introduction. This 
section applies to the communication of information concerning asbestos 
hazards in general industry to facilitate compliance with this standard. 
Asbestos exposure in general industry occurs in a wide variety of 
industrial and commercial settings. Employees who manufacture asbestos-
containing products may be exposed to asbestos fibers. Employees who 
repair and replace automotive brakes and clutches may be exposed to 
asbestos fibers. In addition, employees engaged in housekeeping 
activities in industrial facilities with asbestos product manufacturing 
operations, and in public and commercial buildings with installed 
asbestos containing materials may be exposed to asbestos fibers. Most of 
these workers are covered by this general industry standard, with the 
exception of state or local governmental employees in non-state plan 
states. It should be noted that employees who perform housekeeping 
activities during and after construction activities are covered by the 
asbestos construction standard, 29 CFR 1926.1101, formerly 1926.58. 
However, housekeeping employees, regardless of industry designation, 
should know whether building components they maintain may expose them to 
asbestos. The same hazard communication provisions will protect 
employees who perform housekeeping operations in all three asbestos 
standards; general industry, construction, and shipyard employment. As 
noted in the construction standard, building owners are often the only 
and/or best source of information concerning the presence of previously 
installed asbestos containing building materials. Therefore they, along 
with employers of potentially exposed employees, are assigned specific 
information conveying and retention duties under this section.
    (1) Installed Asbestos Containing Material. Employers and building 
owners are required to treat installed TSI and sprayed on and troweled-
on surfacing materials as ACM in buildings constructed no later than 
1980 for purposes of this standard. These materials are designated 
``presumed ACM or PACM'', and are defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Asphalt and vinyl flooring material installed no later than 
1980 also must be treated as asbestos-containing. The employer or 
building owner may demonstrate that PACM and flooring material do not 
contain asbestos by complying with paragraph (j)(8)(iii) of this 
section.

[[Page 26]]

    (2) Duties of employers and building and facility owners. (i) 
Building and facility owners shall determine the presence, location, and 
quantity of ACM and/or PACM at the work site. Employers and building and 
facility owners shall exercise due diligence in complying with these 
requirements to inform employers and employees about the presence and 
location of ACM and PACM.
    (ii) Building and facility owners shall maintain records of all 
information required to be provided pursuant to this section and/or 
otherwise known to the building owner concerning the presence, location 
and quantity of ACM and PACM in the building/facility. Such records 
shall be kept for the duration of ownership and shall be transferred to 
successive owners.
    (iii) Building and facility owners shall inform employers of 
employees, and employers shall inform employees who will perform 
housekeeping activities in areas which contain ACM and/or PACM of the 
presence and location of ACM and/or PACM in such areas which may be 
contacted during such activities.
    (3) Warning signs--(i) Posting. Warning signs shall be provided and 
displayed at each regulated area. In addition, warning signs shall be 
posted at all approaches to regulated areas so that an employee may read 
the signs and take necessary protective steps before entering the area.
    (ii) Sign specifications. (A) The warning signs required by 
paragraph (j)(3) of this section shall bear the following information:

                                 DANGER

                                ASBESTOS

                     CANCER AND LUNG DISEASE HAZARD

                        AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

    (B) In addition, where the use of respirators and protective 
clothing is required in the regulated area under this section, the 
warning signs shall include the following:

                   RESPIRATORS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING

                        ARE REQUIRED IN THIS AREA

    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) The employer shall ensure that employees working in and 
contiguous to regulated areas comprehend the warning signs required to 
be posted by paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section. Means to ensure 
employee comprehension may include the use of foreign languages, 
pictographs and graphics.
    (v) At the entrance to mechanical rooms/areas in which employees 
reasonably can be expected to enter and which contain ACM and/or PACM, 
the building owner shall post signs which identify the material which is 
present, its location, and appropriate work practices which, if 
followed, will ensure that ACM and/or PACM will not be disturbed. The 
employer shall ensure, to the extent feasible, that employees who come 
in contact with these signs can comprehend them. Means to ensure 
employee comprehension may include the use of foreign languages, 
pictographs, graphics, and awareness training.
    (4) Warning labels--(i) Labeling. Warning labels shall be affixed to 
all raw materials, mixtures, scrap, waste, debris, and other products 
containing asbestos fibers, or to their containers.When a building owner 
or employer identifies previously installed ACM and/or PACM, labels or 
signs shall be affixed or posted so that employees will be notified of 
what materials contain ACM and/or PACM. The employer shall attach such 
labels in areas where they will clearly be noticed by employees who are 
likely to be exposed, such as at the entrance to mechanical room/areas. 
Signs required by paragraph (j)(3) of this section may be posted in lieu 
of labels so long as they contain information required for labelling.
    (ii) Label specifications. The labels shall comply with the 
requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(f) of OSHA's Hazard Communication 
standard, and shall include the following information:

                                 DANGER

                        CONTAINS ASBESTOS FIBERS

                           AVOID CREATING DUST

                     CANCER AND LUNG DISEASE HAZARD

    (5) Material safety data sheets. Employers who are manufacturers or 
importers of asbestos or asbestos products

[[Page 27]]

shall comply with the requirements regarding development of material 
safety data sheets as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) of OSHA's Hazard 
Communication standard, except as provided by paragraph (j)(6) of this 
section.
    (6) The provisions for labels required by paragraph (j)(4) of this 
section or for material safety data sheets required by paragraph (j)(5) 
of this section do not apply where:
    (i) Asbestos fibers have been modified by a bonding agent, coating, 
binder, or other material provided that the manufacturer can demonstrate

[[Page 28]]

a public health organization listed in Appendix I to this section.
    (8) Criteria to rebut the designation of installed material as PACM. 
(i) At any time, an employer and/or building owner may demonstrate, for 
purposes of this standard, that PACM does not contain asbestos. Building 
owners and/or employers are not required to communicate information 
about the presence of building material for which such a demonstration 
pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (j)(8)(ii) of this section has 
been made. However, in all such cases, the information, data and 
analysis supporting the determination that PACM does not contain 
asbestos, shall be retained pursuant to paragraph (m) of this section.
    (ii) An employer or owner may demonstrate that PACM does not contain 
asbestos by the following:
    (A) Having a completed inspection conducted pursuant to the 
requirements of AHERA (40 CFR 763, Subpart E) which demonstrates that no 
ACM is present in the material; or
    (B) Performing tests of the material containing PACM which 
demonstrate that no ACM is present in the material. Such tests shall 
include analysis of bulk samples collected in the manner described in 40 
CFR 763.86. The tests, evaluation and sample collection shall be 
conducted by an accredited inspector or by a CIH. Analysis of samples 
shall be performed by persons or laboratories with proficiency 
demonstrated by current successful participation in a nationally 
recognized testing program such as the National Voluntary Laboratory 
Accreditation Program (NVLAP) or the National Institute for Standards 
and Technology (NIST) or the Round Robin for bulk samples administered 
by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or an equivalent 
nationally-recognized round robin testing program.
    (iii) The employer and/or building owner may demonstrate that 
flooring material including associated mastic and backing does not 
contain asbestos, by a determination of an industrial hygienist based 
upon recognized analytical techniques showing that the material is not 
ACM.
    (k) Housekeeping. (1) All surfaces shall be maintained as free as 
practicable of ACM waste and debris and accompanying dust.
    (2) All spills and sudden releases of material containing asbestos 
shall be cleaned up as soon as possible.

vacuuming asbestos containing waste and debris. The equipment shall be 
used and emptied in a manner which minimizes the reentry of asbestos 
into the workplace.
    (5) Shoveling, dry sweeping and dry clean-up of asbestos may be used 
only where vacuuming and/or wet cleaning are not feasible.
    (6) Waste disposal. Waste, scrap, debris, bags, containers, 
equipment, and clothing contaminated with asbestos consigned for 
disposal, shall be collected, recycled and disposed of in sealed 
impermeable bags, or other closed, impermeable containers.

    (i) Sanding of asbestos-containing floor material is prohibited.
    (ii) Stripping of finishes shall be conducted using low abrasion 
pads at speeds lower than 300 rpm and wet methods.
    (iii) Burnishing or dry buffing may be performed only on asbestos-
containing flooring which has sufficient finish so that the pad cannot 
contact the asbestos-containing material.
    (8) Waste and debris and accompanying dust in an area containing 
accessible ACM and/or PACM or visibly deteriorated ACM, shall not be 
dusted or swept dry, or vacuumed without using a HEPA filter.

     Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1001--OSHA Reference Method--Mandatory

    This mandatory appendix specifies the procedure for analyzing air 
samples for asbestos and specifies quality control procedures that must 
be implemented by laboratories performing the analysis. The sampling and 
analytical methods described below represent the elements of the 
available monitoring methods (such as Appendix B of their regulation, 
the most current version of the OSHA method ID-160, or the most current 
version of the NIOSH Method 7400). All employers who are required to 
conduct air monitoring under paragraph (d) of the standard are required 
to utilize analytical laboratories that use this procedure, or an 
equivalent method, for collecting and analyzing samples.

                    Sampling and Analytical Procedure

    1. The sampling medium for air samples shall be mixed cellulose 
ester filter membranes. These shall be designated by the manufacturer as 
suitable for asbestos counting. See below for rejection of blanks.
    2. The preferred collection device shall be the 25-mm diameter 
cassette with an open-faced 50-mm electrically conductive extension 
cowl. The 37-mm cassette may be used if necessary but only if written 
justification for the need to use the 37-mm filter cassette accompanies 
the sample results in the employee's exposure monitoring record. Do not 
reuse or reload cassettes for asbestos sample collection.
    3. An air flow rate between 0.5 liter/min and 2.5 liters/min shall 
be selected for the 25-mm cassette. If the 37-mm cassette is used, an 
air flow rate between 1 liter/min and 2.5 liters/min shall be selected.
    4. Where possible, a sufficient air volume for each air sample shall 
be collected to yield between 100 and 1,300 fibers per square millimeter 
on the membrane filter. If a filter darkens in appearance or if loose 
dust is seen on the filter, a second sample shall be started.
    5. Ship the samples in a rigid container with sufficient packing 
material to prevent dislodging the collected fibers. Packing material 
that has a high electrostatic charge on its surface (e.g., expanded 
polystyrene) cannot be used because such material can cause loss of 
fibers to the sides of the cassette.
    6. Calibrate each personal sampling pump before and after use with a 
representative filter cassette installed between the pump and the 
calibration devices.
    7. Personal samples shall be taken in the ``breathing zone'' of the 
employee (i.e., attached to or near the collar or lapel near the 
worker's face).
    8. Fiber counts shall be made by positive phase contrast using a 
microscope with an 8 to 10 X eyepiece and a 40 to 45 X objective for a 
total magnification of approximately 400 X and a numerical aperture of 
0.65 to 0.75. The microscope shall also be fitted with a green or blue 
filter.
    9. The microscope shall be fitted with a Walton-Beckett eyepiece 
graticule calibrated for a field diameter of 100 micrometers (+/-2 
micrometers).
    10. The phase-shift detection limit of the microscope shall be about 
3 degrees measured using the HSE phase shift test slide as outlined 
below.
    a. Place the test slide on the microscope stage and center it under 
the phase objective.
    b. Bring the blocks of grooved lines into focus.
    Note: The slide consists of seven sets of grooved lines (ca. 20 
grooves to each block) in descending order of visibility from sets 1 to 
7, seven being the least visible. The requirements for asbestos counting 
are that the microscope optics must resolve the grooved lines in set 3 
completely, although they may appear somewhat faint, and that the 
grooved lines in sets 6 and 7 must be invisible. Sets 4 and 5 must be at 
least partially visible but may vary slightly in visibility between 
microscopes. A microscope that fails to meet these requirements has 
either too low or too high a resolution to be used for asbestos 
counting.
    c. If the image deteriorates, clean and adjust the microscope 
optics. If the problem persists, consult the microscope manufacturer.
    11. Each set of samples taken will include 10% field blanks or a 
minimum of 2 field blanks. These blanks must come from the same lot as 
the filters used for sample collection. The field blank results shall be 
averaged and subtracted from the analytical results before reporting. A 
set consists of any sample or group of samples for which an evaluation 
for this standard must be made. Any samples represented by a field blank 
having a fiber count in excess of the detection limit of the method 
being used shall be rejected.
    12. The samples shall be mounted by the acetone/triacetin method or 
a method with an equivalent index of refraction and similar clarity.
    13. Observe the following counting rules.
    a. Count only fibers equal to or longer than 5 micrometers. Measure 
the length of curved fibers along the curve.
    b. In the absence of other information, count all particles as 
asbesto that have a length-to-width ratio (aspect ratio) of 3:1 or 
greater.
    c. Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the Walton-Beckett 
graticule field shall receive a count of 1. Fibers crossing the boundary 
once, having one end within the circle, shall receive the count of one 
half (\1/2\). Do not count any fiber that crosses the graticule boundary 
more than once. Reject

[[Page 33]]

and do not count any other fibers even though they may be visible 
outside the graticule area.
    d. Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual fibers can 
be identified by observing both ends of an individual fiber.
    e. Count enough graticule fields to yield 100 fibers. Count a 
minimum of 20 fields; stop counting at 100 fields regardless of fiber 
count.
    14. Blind recounts shall be conducted at the rate of 10 percent.

                       Quality Control Procedures

    1. Intralaboratory program. Each laboratory and/or each company with 
more than one microscopist counting slides shall establish a 
statistically designed quality assurance program involving blind 
recounts and comparisons between microscopists to monitor the 
variability of counting by each microscopist and between microscopists. 
In a company with more than one laboratory, the program shall include 
all laboratories and shall also evaluate the laboratory-to-laboratory 
variability.
    2.a. Interlaboratory program. Each laboratory analyzing asbestos 
samples for compliance determination shall implement an interlaboratory 
quality assurance program that as a minimum includes participation of at 
least two other independent laboratories. Each laboratory shall 
participate in round robin testing at least once every 6 months with at 
least all the other laboratories in its interlaboratory quality 
assurance group. Each laboratory shall submit slides typical of its own 
work load for use in this program. The round robin shall be designed and 
results analyzed using appropriate statistical methodology.
    2.b. All laboratories should also participate in a national sample 
testing scheme such as the Proficiency Analytical Testing Program (PAT), 
or the Asbestos Registry sponsored by the American Industrial Hygiene 
Association (AIHA).
    3. All individuals performing asbestos analysis must have taken the 
NIOSH course for sampling and evaluating airborne asbestos dust or an 
equalivalent course.
    4. When the use of different microscopes contributes to differences 
between counters and laboratories, the effect of the different 
microscope shall be evaluated and the microscope shall be replaced, as 
necessary.
    5. Current results of these quality assurance programs shall be 
posted in each laboratory to keep the microscopists informed.

    Asbestos Fiber: A fiber of asbestos which meets the criteria 
specified below for a fiber.
    Aspect Ratio: The ratio of the length of a fiber to it's diameter 
(e.g. 3:1, 5:1 aspect ratios).
    Cleavage Fragments: Mineral particles formed by comminution of 
minerals, especially those characterized by parallel sides and a 
moderate aspect ratio (usually less than 20:1).
    Detection Limit: The number of fibers necessary to be 95% certain 
that the result is greater than zero.

[[Page 34]]

    Differential Counting: The term applied to the practice of excluding 
certain kinds of fibers from the fiber count because they do not appear 
to be asbestos.
    Fiber: A particle that is 5 <greek-m> m or longer, with a length-to-
width ratio of 3 to 1 or longer.
    Field: The area within the graticule circle that is superimposed on 
the microscope image.
    Set: The samples which are taken, submitted to the laboratory, 
analyzed, and for which, interim or final result reports are generated.
    Tremolite, Anthophyllite, and Actinolite: The non-asbestos form of 
these minerals which meet the definition of a fiber. It includes any of 
these minerals that have been chemically treated and/or altered.
    Walton-Beckett Graticule: An eyepiece graticule specifically 
designed for asbestos fiber counting. It consists of a circle with a 
projected diameter of 100 2 <greek-m>m (area of about 0.00785 
mm<SUP>2</SUP>) with a crosshair having tic-marks at 3-<greek-m>m 
intervals in one direction and 5-<greek-m>m in the orthogonal direction. 
There are marks around the periphery of the circle to demonstrate the 
proper sizes and shapes of fibers. This design is reproduced in Figure 
1. The disk is placed in one of the microscope eyepieces so that the 
design is superimposed on the field of view.

                              1.1. History

    Early surveys to determine asbestos exposures were conducted using 
impinger counts of total dust with the counts expressed as million 
particles per cubic foot. The British Asbestos Research Council 
recommended filter membrane counting in 1969. In July 1969, the Bureau 
of Occupational Safety and Health published a filter membrane method for 
counting asbestos fibers in the United States. This method was refined 
by NIOSH and published as P CAM 239. On May 29, 1971, OSHA specified 
filter membrane sampling with phase contrast counting for evaluation of 
asbestos exposures at work sites in the United States. The use of this 
technique was again required by OSHA in 1986. Phase contrast microscopy 
has continued to be the method of choice for the measurement of 
occupational exposure to asbestos.

                             1.2. Principle

    Air is drawn through a MCE filter to capture airborne asbestos 
fibers. A wedge shaped portion of the filter is removed, placed on a 
glass microscope slide and made transparent. A measured area (field) is 
viewed by PCM. All the fibers meeting defined criteria for asbestos are 
counted and considered a measure of the airborne asbestos concentration.

                    1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages

    There are four main advantages of PCM over other methods:
    (1) The technique is specific for fibers. Phase contrast is a fiber 
counting technique which excludes non-fibrous particles from the 
analysis.
    (2) The technique is inexpensive and does not require specialized 
knowledge to carry out the analysis for total fiber counts.
    (3) The analysis is quick and can be performed on-site for rapid 
determination of air concentrations of asbestos fibers.
    (4) The technique has continuity with historical epidemiological 
studies so that estimates of expected disease can be inferred from long-
term determinations of asbestos exposures.
    The main disadvantage of PCM is that it does not positively identify 
asbestos fibers. Other fibers which are not asbestos may be included in 
the count unless differential counting is performed. This requires a 
great deal of experience to adequately differentiate asbestos from non-
asbestos fibers. Positive identification of asbestos must be performed 
by polarized light or electron microscopy techniques. A further 
disadvantage of PCM is that the smallest visible fibers are about 0.2 
<greek-m>m in diameter while the finest asbestos fibers may be as small 
as 0.02 <greek-m>m in diameter. For some exposures, substantially more 
fibers may be present than are actually counted.

                         1.4. Workplace Exposure

    Asbestos is used by the construction industry in such products as 
shingles, floor tiles, asbestos cement, roofing felts, insulation and 
acoustical products. Non-construction uses include brakes, clutch 
facings, paper, paints, plastics, and fabrics. One of the most 
significant exposures in the workplace is the removal and encapsulation 
of asbestos in schools, public buildings, and homes. Many workers have 
the potential to be exposed to asbestos during these operations.
    About 95% of the asbestos in commercial use in the United States is 
chrysotile. Crocidolite and amosite make up most of the remainder. 
Anthophyllite and tremolite or actinolite are likely to be encountered 
as contaminants in various industrial products.

                        1.5. Physical Properties

    Asbestos fiber possesses a high tensile strength along its axis, is 
chemically inert, non-combustible, and heat resistant. It has a high 
electrical resistance and good sound absorbing properties. It can be 
weaved into cables, fabrics or other textiles, and also matted into 
asbestos papers, felts, or mats.

                      2. Range and Detection Limit

    2.1. The ideal counting range on the filter is 100 to 1,300 fibers/
mm\2\. With a Walton-

[[Page 35]]

Beckett graticule this range is equivalent to 0.8 to 10 fibers/field. 
Using NIOSH counting statistics, a count of 0.8 fibers/field would give 
an approximate coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.13.
    2.2. The detection limit for this method is 4.0 fibers per 100 
fields or 5.5 fibers/mm\2\. This was determined using an equation to 
estimate the maximum CV possible at a specific concentration (95% 
confidence) and a Lower Control Limit of zero. The CV value was then 
used to determine a corresponding concentration from historical CV vs 
fiber relationships. As an example:

Lower Control Limit (95% Confidence) = AC - 1.645(CV)(AC)
Where:

AC = Estimate of the airborne fiber concentration (fibers/cc) Setting 
the Lower Control Limit = 0 and solving for CV:
0 = AC - 1.645(CV)(AC)
CV = 0.61

    This value was compared with CV vs. count curves. The count at which 
CV = 0.61 for Leidel-Busch counting statistics or for an OSHA Salt Lake 
Technical Center (OSHA-SLTC) CV curve (see Appendix A for further 
information) was 4.4 fibers or 3.9 fibers per 100 fields, respectively. 
Although a lower detection limit of 4 fibers per 100 fields is supported 
by the OSHA-SLTC data, both data sets support the 4.5 fibers per 100 
fields value.

              3. Method Performance--Precision and Accuracy

    Precision is dependent upon the total number of fibers counted and 
the uniformity of the fiber distribution on the filter. A general rule 
is to count at least 20 and not more than 100 fields. The count is 
discontinued when 100 fibers are counted, provided that 20 fields have 
already been counted. Counting more than 100 fibers results in only a 
small gain in precision. As the total count drops below 10 fibers, an 
accelerated loss of precision is noted.
    At this time, there is no known method to determine the absolute 
accuracy of the asbestos analysis. Results of samples prepared through 
the Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) Program and analyzed by the 
OSHA-SLTC showed no significant bias when compared to PAT reference 
values. The PAT samples were analyzed from 1987 to 1989 (N=36) and the 
concentration range was from 120 to 1,300 fibers/mm\2\.

                            4. Interferences

    Fibrous substances, if present, may interfere with asbestos 
analysis.
    Some common fibers are:
fiberglass
anhydrite
plant fibers
perlite veins
gypsum
some synthetic fibers
membrane structures
sponge spicules
diatoms
microorganisms
wollastonite
    The use of electron microscopy or optical tests such as polarized 
light, and dispersion staining may be used to differentiate these 
materials from asbestos when necessary.

                               5. Sampling

                             5.1. Equipment

    5.1.1. Sample assembly (The assembly is shown in Figure 3). 
Conductive filter holder consisting of a 25-mm diameter, 3-piece 
cassette having a 50-mm long electrically conductive extension cowl. 
Backup pad, 25-mm, cellulose. Membrane filter, mixed-cellulose ester 
(MCE), 25-mm, plain, white, 0.4 to 1.2-<greek-m>m pore size.
    Notes: (a) Do not re-use cassettes.
    (b) Fully conductive cassettes are required to reduce fiber loss to 
the sides of the cassette due to electrostatic attraction.
    (c) Purchase filters which have been selected by the manufacturer 
for asbestos counting or analyze representative filters for fiber 
background before use. Discard the filter lot if more than 4 fibers/100 
fields are found.
    (d) To decrease the possibility of contamination, the sampling 
system (filter-backup pad-cassette) for asbestos is usually preassembled 
by the manufacturer.
    (e) Other cassettes, such as the Bell-mouth, may be used within the 
limits of their validation.
    5.1.2. Gel bands for sealing cassettes.
    5.1.3. Sampling pump.
    Each pump must be a battery operated, self-contained unit small 
enough to be placed on the monitored employee and not interfere with the 
work being performed. The pump must be capable of sampling at the 
collection rate for the required sampling time.
    5.1.4. Flexible tubing, 6-mm bore.
    5.1.5. Pump calibration.
    Stopwatch and bubble tube/burette or electronic meter.
    5.2. Sampling Procedure
    5.2.1. Seal the point where the base and cowl of each cassette meet 
with a gel band or tape.
    5.2.2. Charge the pumps completely before beginning.
    5.2.3. Connect each pump to a calibration cassette with an 
appropriate length of 6-mm bore plastic tubing. Do not use luer 
connectors--the type of cassette specified above has built-in adapters.
    5.2.4. Select an appropriate flow rate for the situation being 
monitored. The sampling flow rate must be between 0.5 and 5.0 L/min for 
personal sampling and is commonly set

[[Page 36]]

between 1 and 2 L/min. Always choose a flow rate that will not produce 
overloaded filters.
    5.2.5. Calibrate each sampling pump before and after sampling with a 
calibration cassette in-line (Note: This calibration cassette should be 
from the same lot of cassettes used for sampling). Use a primary 
standard (e.g. bubble burette) to calibrate each pump. If possible, 
calibrate at the sampling site.

    Note: If sampling site calibration is not possible, environmental 
influences may affect the flow rate. The extent is dependent on the type 
of pump used. Consult with the pump manufacturer to determine dependence 
on environmental influences. If the pump is affected by temperature and 
pressure changes, correct the flow rate using the formula shown in the 
section ``Sampling Pump Flow Rate Corrections'' at the end of this 
appendix.

    5.2.6. Connect each pump to the base of each sampling cassette with 
flexible tubing. Remove the end cap of each cassette and take each air 
sample open face. Assure that each sample cassette is held open side 
down in the employee's breathing zone during sampling. The distance from 
the nose/mouth of the employee to the cassette should be about 10 cm. 
Secure the cassette on the collar or lapel of the employee using spring 
clips or other similar devices.
    5.2.7. A suggested minimum air volume when sampling to determine TWA 
compliance is 25 L. For Excursion Limit (30 min sampling time) 
evaluations, a minimum air volume of 48 L is recommended.
    5.2.8. The most significant problem when sampling for asbestos is 
overloading the filter with non-asbestos dust. Suggested maximum air 
sample volumes for specific environments are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Environment                         Air vol. (L)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asbestos removal operations (visible dust)..  100
Asbestos removal operations (little dust)...  240
Office environments.........................  400
                                              to
                                              2,400
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Caution: Do not overload the filter with dust. High levels of non-
fibrous dust particles may obscure fibers on the filter and lower the 
count or make counting impossible. If more than about 25 to 30% of the 
field area is obscured with dust, the result may be biased low. Smaller 
air volumes may be necessary when there is excessive non-asbestos dust 
in the air.
    While sampling, observe the filter with a small flashlight. If there 
is a visible layer of dust on the filter, stop sampling, remove and seal 
the cassette, and replace with a new sampling assembly. The total dust 
loading should not exceed 1 mg.
    5.2.9. Blank samples are used to determine if any contamination has 
occurred during sample handling. Prepare two blanks for the first 1 to 
20 samples. For sets containing greater than 20 samples, prepare blanks 
as 10% of the samples. Handle blank samples in the same manner as air 
samples with one exception: Do not draw any air through the blank 
samples. Open the blank cassette in the place where the sample cassettes 
are mounted on the employee. Hold it open for about 30 seconds. Close 
and seal the cassette appropriately. Store blanks for shipment with the 
sample cassettes.
    5.2.10. Immediately after sampling, close and seal each cassette 
with the base and plastic plugs. Do not touch or puncture the filter 
membrane as this will invalidate the analysis.
    5.2.11  Attach and secure a sample seal around each sample cassette 
in such a way as to assure that the end cap and base plugs cannot be 
removed without destroying the seal. Tape the ends of the seal together 
since the seal is not long enough to be wrapped end-to-end. Also wrap 
tape around the cassette at each joint to keep the seal secure.

                          5.3. Sample Shipment

    5.3.1. Send the samples to the laboratory with paperwork requesting 
asbestos analysis. List any known fibrous interferences present during 
sampling on the paperwork. Also, note the workplace operation(s) 
sampled.
    5.3.2. Secure and handle the samples in such that they will not 
rattle during shipment nor be exposed to static electricity. Do not ship 
samples in expanded polystyrene peanuts, vermiculite, paper shreds, or 
excelsior. Tape sample cassettes to sheet bubbles and place in a 
container that will cushion the samples in such a manner that they will 
not rattle.
    5.3.3. To avoid the possibility of sample contamination, always ship 
bulk samples in separate mailing containers.

                               6. Analysis

                         6.1. Safety Precautions

    6.1.1. Acetone is extremely flammable and precautions must be taken 
not to ignite it. Avoid using large containers or quantities of acetone. 
Transfer the solvent in a ventilated laboratory hood. Do not use acetone 
near any open flame. For generation of acetone vapor, use a spark free 
heat source.
    6.1.2. Any asbestos spills should be cleaned up immediately to 
prevent dispersal of fibers. Prudence should be exercised to avoid 
contamination of laboratory facilities or exposure of personnel to 
asbestos. Asbestos spills should be cleaned up with wet methods and/or a 
High Efficiency Particulate-Air (HEPA) filtered vacuum.
    Caution: Do not use a vacuum without a HEPA filter--It will disperse 
fine asbestos fibers in the air.

[[Page 37]]

    6.2.1. Phase contrast microscope with binocular or trinocular head.
    6.2.2. Widefield or Huygenian 10X eyepieces (Note: The eyepiece 
containing the graticule must be a focusing eyepiece. Use a 40X phase 
objective with a numerical aperture of 0.65 to 0.75).
    6.2.3. Kohler illumination (if possible) with green or blue filter.
    6.2.4. Walton-Beckett Graticule, type G-22 with 100 <plus-minus> 2 
<greek-m>m projected diameter.

    A rotating mechanical stage is convenient for use with polarized 
light.
    6.2.6. Phase telescope.
    6.2.7. Stage micrometer with 0.01-mm subdivisions.
    6.2.8. Phase-shift test slide, mark II (Available from PTR optics 
Ltd., and also McCrone).
    6.2.9. Precleaned glass slides, 25 mm X 75 mm. One end can be 
frosted for convenience in writing sample numbers, etc., or paste-on 
labels can be used.

Figure 4).
    6.2.14. Automatic adjustable pipette, 100- to 500-<greek-m> L.
    6.2.15. Micropipette, 5 <greek-m> L.

                              6.3. Reagents

    6.3.1. Acetone (HPLC grade).
    6.3.2. Triacetin (glycerol triacetate).
    6.3.3. Lacquer or nail polish.

                        6.4. Standard Preparation

    A way to prepare standard asbestos samples of known concentration 
has not been developed. It is possible to prepare replicate samples of 
nearly equal concentration. This has been performed through the PAT 
program. These asbestos samples are distributed by the AIHA to 
participating laboratories.
    Since only about one-fourth of a 25-mm sample membrane is required 
for an asbestos count, any PAT sample can serve as a ``standard'' for 
replicate counting.

                          6.5. Sample Mounting

    Note: See Safety Precautions in Section 6.1. before proceeding. The 
objective is to produce samples with a smooth (non-grainy) background in 
a medium with a refractive index of approximately 1.46. The technique 
below collapses the filter for easier focusing and produces permanent 
mounts which are useful for quality control and interlaboratory 
comparison.
    An aluminum block or similar device is required for sample 
preparation.
    6.5.1. Heat the aluminum block to about 70  deg.C. The hot block 
should not be used on any surface that can be damaged by either the heat 
or from exposure to acetone.
    6.5.2. Ensure that the glass slides and cover glasses are free of 
dust and fibers.
    6.5.3. Remove the top plug to prevent a vacuum when the cassette is 
opened. Clean the outside of the cassette if necessary. Cut the seal 
and/or tape on the cassette with a razor blade. Very carefully separate 
the base from the extension cowl, leaving the filter and backup pad in 
the base.
    6.5.4. With a rocking motion cut a triangular wedge from the filter 
using the scalpel. This wedge should be one-sixth to one-fourth of the 
filter. Grasp the filter wedge with the forceps on the perimeter of the 
filter which was clamped between the cassette pieces. DO NOT TOUCH the 
filter with your finger. Place the filter on the glass slide sample side 
up. Static electricity will usually keep the filter on the slide until 
it is cleared.
    6.5.5. Place the tip of the micropipette containing about 200 
<greek-m> L acetone into the aluminum block. Insert the glass slide into 
the receiving slot in the aluminum block. Inject the acetone into the 
block with slow, steady pressure on the plunger while holding the 
pipette firmly in place. Wait 3 to 5 seconds for the filter to clear, 
then remove the pipette and slide from the aluminum block.
    6.5.6. Immediately (less than 30 seconds) place 2.5 to 3.5 <greek-m> 
L of triacetin on the filter (Note: Waiting longer than 30 seconds will 
result in increased index of refraction and decreased contrast between 
the fibers and the preparation. This may also lead to separation of the 
cover slip from the slide).
    6.5.7. Lower a cover slip gently onto the filter at a slight angle 
to reduce the possibility of forming air bubbles. If more than 30 
seconds have elapsed between acetone exposure and triacetin application, 
glue the edges of the cover slip to the slide with lacquer or nail 
polish.
    6.5.8. If clearing is slow, warm the slide for 15 min on a hot plate 
having a surface temperature of about 50  deg.C to hasten clearing. The 
top of the hot block can be used if the slide is not heated too long.
    6.5.9. Counting may proceed immediately after clearing and mounting 
are completed.

                          6.6. Sample Analysis

    Completely align the microscope according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. Then, align the microscope using the following general 
alignment routine at the beginning of every counting session and more 
often if necessary.

                            6.6.1. Alignment

    (1) Clean all optical surfaces. Even a small amount of dirt can 
significantly degrade the image.
    (2) Rough focus the objective on a sample.

[[Page 38]]

    (3) Close down the field iris so that it is visible in the field of 
view. Focus the image of the iris with the condenser focus. Center the 
image of the iris in the field of view.
    (4) Install the phase telescope and focus on the phase rings. 
Critically center the rings. Misalignment of the rings results in 
astigmatism which will degrade the image.
    (5) Place the phase-shift test slide on the microscope stage and 
focus on the lines. The analyst must see line set 3 and should see at 
least parts of 4 and 5 but, not see line set 6 or 6. A microscope/
microscopist combination which does not pass this test may not be used.

                         6.6.2. Counting Fibers

    (1) Place the prepared sample slide on the mechanical stage of the 
microscope. Position the center of the wedge under the objective lens 
and focus upon the sample.
    (2) Start counting from one end of the wedge and progress along a 
radial line to the other end (count in either direction from perimeter 
to wedge tip). Select fields randomly, without looking into the 
eyepieces, by slightly advancing the slide in one direction with the 
mechanical stage control.
    (3) Continually scan over a range of focal planes (generally the 
upper 10 to 15 <greek-m> m of the filter surface) with the fine focus 
control during each field count. Spend at least 5 to 15 seconds per 
field.
    (4) Most samples will contain asbestos fibers with fiber diameters 
less than 1 <greek-m> m. Look carefully for faint fiber images. The 
small diameter fibers will be very hard to see. However, they are an 
important contribution to the total count.
    (5) Count only fibers equal to or longer than 5 <greek-m> m. Measure 
the length of curved fibers along the curve.
    (6) Count fibers which have a length to width ratio of 3:1 or 
greater.
    (7) Count all the fibers in at least 20 fields. Continue counting 
until either 100 fibers are counted or 100 fields have been viewed; 
whichever occurs first. Count all the fibers in the final field.
    (8) Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the Walton-Beckett 
graticule field shall receive a count of 1. Fibers crossing the boundary 
once, having one end within the circle shall receive a count of \1/2\. 
Do not count any fiber that crosses the graticule boundary more than 
once. Reject and do not count any other fibers even though they may be 
visible outside the graticule area. If a fiber touches the circle, it is 
considered to cross the line.
    (9) Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual fibers 
can be clearly identified and each individual fiber is clearly not 
connected to another counted fiber. See Figure 1 for counting 
conventions.
    (10) Record the number of fibers in each field in a consistent way 
such that filter non-uniformity can be assessed.
    (11) Regularly check phase ring alignment.
    (12) When an agglomerate (mass of material) covers more than 25% of 
the field of view, reject the field and select another. Do not include 
it in the number of fields counted.
    (13) Perform a ``blind recount'' of 1 in every 10 filter wedges 
(slides). Re-label the slides using a person other than the original 
counter.

                        6.7. Fiber Identification

    As previously mentioned in Section 1.3., PCM does not provide 
positive confirmation of asbestos fibers. Alternate differential 
counting techniques should be used if discrimination is desirable. 
Differential counting may include primary discrimination based on 
morphology, polarized light analysis of fibers, or modification of PCM 
data by Scanning Electron or Transmission Electron Microscopy.
    A great deal of experience is required to routinely and correctly 
perform differential counting. It is discouraged unless it is legally 
necessary. Then, only if a fiber is obviously not asbestos should it be 
excluded from the count. Further discussion of this technique can be 
found in reference 8.10.
    If there is a question whether a fiber is asbestos or not, follow 
the rule:
    ``WHEN IN DOUBT, COUNT.''
    6.8. Analytical Recommendations--Quality Control System
    6.8.1. All individuals performing asbestos analysis must have taken 
the NIOSH course for sampling and evaluating airborne asbestos or an 
equivalent course.
    6.8.2. Each laboratory engaged in asbestos counting shall set up a 
slide trading arrangement with at least two other laboratories in order 
to compare performance and eliminate inbreeding of error. The slide 
exchange occurs at least semiannually. The round robin results shall be 
posted where all analysts can view individual analyst's results.
    6.8.3. Each laboratory engaged in asbestos counting shall 
participate in the Proficiency Analytical Testing Program, the Asbestos 
Analyst Registry or equivalent.
    6.8.4. Each analyst shall select and count prepared slides from a 
``slide bank''. These are quality assurance counts. The slide bank shall 
be prepared using uniformly distributed samples taken from the workload. 
Fiber densities should cover the entire range routinely analyzed by the 
laboratory. These slides are counted blind by all counters to establish 
an original standard deviation. This historical distribution is compared 
with the quality assurance counts. A counter must have 95% of all 
quality control samples counted within three standard deviations of the 
historical mean. This count is then integrated into a

[[Page 39]]

new historical mean and standard deviation for the slide.
    The analyses done by the counters to establish the slide bank may be 
used for an interim quality control program if the data are treated in a 
proper statistical fashion.

                             7. Calculations

    7.1. Calculate the estimated airborne asbestos fiber concentration 
on the filter sample using the following formula:
where:

AC = Airborne fiber concentration
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.000

FB = Total number of fibers greater than 5 <greek-m> m counted
FL = Total number of fields counted on the filter
BFB = Total number of fibers greater than 5 <greek-m> m counted in the 
blank
BFL = Total number of fields counted on the blank
ECA = Effective collecting area of filter (385 mm\2\ nominal for a 25-mm 
filter.)
FR = Pump flow rate (L/min)
MFA = Microscope count field area (mm\2\). This is 0.00785 mm\2\ for a 
Walton-Beckett Graticule.
T = Sample collection time (min)
1,000 = Conversion of L to cc
    Note: The collection area of a filter is seldom equal to 385 mm\2\. 
It is appropriate for laboratories to routinely monitor the exact 
diameter using an inside micrometer. The collection area is calculated 
according to the formula:

Area = <greek-p>(d/2)\2\

                       7.2. Short-cut Calculation

    Since a given analyst always has the same interpupillary distance, 
the number of fields per filter for a particular analyst will remain 
constant for a given size filter. The field size for that analyst is 
constant (i.e. the analyst is using an assigned microscope and is not 
changing the reticle).
    For example, if the exposed area of the filter is always 385 mm\2\ 
and the size of the field is always 0.00785 mm\2\, the number of fields 
per filter will always be 49,000. In addition it is necessary to convert 
liters of air to cc. These three constants can then be combined such 
that ECA/(1,000 X MFA)=49. The previous equation simplifies to:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.001

                        7.3. Recount Calculations

    As mentioned in step 13 of Section 6.6.2., a ``blind recount'' of 
10% of the slides is performed. In all cases, differences will be 
observed between the first and second counts of the same filter wedge. 
Most of these differences will be due to chance alone, that is, due to 
the random variability (precision) of the count method. Statistical 
recount criteria enables one to decide whether observed differences can 
be explained due to chance alone or are probably due to systematic 
differences between analysts, microscopes, or other biasing factors.
    The following recount criterion is for a pair of counts that 
estimate AC in fibers/cc. The criterion is given at the type-I error 
level. That is, there is 5% maximum risk that we will reject a pair of 
counts for the reason that one might be biased, when the large observed 
difference is really due to chance.
    Reject a pair of counts if:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN95.000
    
    Where:
    AC1=lower estimated airborne fiber concentration
    AC2=higher estimated airborne fiber concentration
    ACavg=average of the two concentration estimates
    CV<INF>FB</INF>=CV for the average of the two concentration 
estimates
    If a pair of counts are rejected by this criterion then, recount the 
rest of the filters in the submitted set. Apply the test and reject any 
other pairs failing the test. Rejection shall include a memo to the 
industrial hygienist stating that the sample failed a statistical test 
for homogeneity and the true air concentration may be significantly 
different than the reported value.

                         7.4. Reporting Results

    Report results to the industrial hygienist as fibers/cc. Use two 
significant figures. If multiple analyses are performed on a sample, an 
average of the results is to be reported unless any of the results can 
be rejected for cause.

                             Quality Control

    The OSHA asbestos regulations require each laboratory to establish a 
quality control program. The following is presented as an example of how 
the OSHA-SLTC constructed its internal CV curve as part of meeting this 
requirement. Data is from 395 samples collected during OSHA compliance 
inspections and analyzed from October 1980 through April 1986.
    Each sample was counted by 2 to 5 different counters independently 
of one another. The standard deviation and the CV statistic was 
calculated for each sample. This data was then plotted on a graph of CV 
vs. fibers/mm<SUP>2</SUP>. A least squares regression was performed 
using the following equation:

CV = 
antilog1<INF>10</INF>[A(log<INF>10</INF>(x))<SUP>2</SUP>+B(log<INF>10</INF>
(x))+C]

where:
    x = the number of fibers/mm<SUP>2</SUP>
Application of least squares gave:
    A = 0.182205
    B = -0.973343
    C = 0.327499
Using these values, the equation becomes:
    CV = antilog<INF>10</INF> [0.182205(log<INF>10</INF> 
(x))<SUP>2</SUP>-0.973343(log<INF>10</INF> (x))+0.327499]

                   Sampling Pump Flow Rate Corrections

    This correction is used if a difference greater than 5% in ambient 
temperature and/or pressure is noted between calibration and sampling 
sites and the pump does not compensate for the differences.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.003

Where:
Q<INF>act</INF> = actual flow rate
Q<INF>cal</INF> = calibrated flow rate (if a rotameter was used, the 
rotameter value)
P<INF>cal</INF> = uncorrected air pressure at calibration
P<INF>act</INF> = uncorrected air pressure at sampling site
T<INF>act</INF> = temperature at sampling site (K)
T<INF>cal</INF> = temperature at calibration (K)

                        Walton-Beckett Graticule

    When ordering the Graticule for asbestos counting, specify the exact 
disc diameter needed to fit the ocular of the microscope and the 
diameter (mm) of the circular counting area. Instructions for measuring 
the dimensions necessary are listed:
    (1) Insert any available graticule into the focusing eyepiece and 
focus so that the graticule lines are sharp and clear.
    (2) Align the microscope.
    (3) Place a stage micrometer on the microscope object stage and 
focus the microscope on the graduated lines.
    (4) Measure the magnified grid length, PL (<greek-m> m), using the 
stage micrometer.
    (5) Remove the graticule from the microscope and measure its actual 
grid length, AL (mm). This can be accomplished by using a mechanical 
stage fitted with verniers, or a jeweler's loupe with a direct reading 
scale.
    (6) Let D=100 <greek-m> m. Calculate the circle diameter, 
d<INF>c</INF> (mm), for the Walton-Beckett graticule and specify the 
diameter when making a purchase:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.004

Example: If PL=108 <greek-m> m, AL=2.93 mm and D=100 <greek-m> m, then,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.005

    (7) Each eyepiece-objective-reticle combination on the microscope 
must be calibrated. Should any of the three be changed

[[Page 41]]

(by zoom adjustment, disassembly, replacement, etc.), the combination 
must be recalibrated. Calibration may change if interpupillary distance 
is changed. Measure the field diameter, D (acceptable range: 
100<plus-minus>2 <greek-m> m) with a stage micrometer upon receipt of 
the graticule from the manufacturer. Determine the field area 
(mm<SUP>2</SUP>).

Field Area = <triangle>(D/2)<SUP>2</SUP>
If D=100 <greek-m> m=0.1 mm, then
Field Area=<triangle>(0.1 mm/2)<SUP>2</SUP>=0.00785 mm<SUP>2</SUP>

 Appendix F to Sec. 1910.1001--Work Practices and Engineering Controls 
  for Automotive Brake and Clutch Inspection, Disassembly, Repair and 
                           Assembly--Mandatory

    This mandatory appendix specifies engineering controls and work 
practices that must be implemented by the employer during automotive 
brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly 
operations. Proper use of these engineering controls and work practices 
by trained employees will reduce employees' asbestos exposure below the 
permissible exposure level during clutch and brake inspection, 
disassembly, repair, and assembly operations. The employer shall 
institute engineering controls and work practices using either the 
method set forth in paragraph [A] or paragraph [B] of this appendix, or 
any other method which the employer can demonstrate to be equivalent in 
terms of reducing employee exposure to asbestos as defined and which 
meets the

[[Page 55]]

requirements described in paragraph [C] of this appendix, for those 
facilities in which no more than 5 pairs of brakes or 5 clutches are 
inspected, disassembled, reassembled and/or repaired per week, the 
method set forth in paragraph [D] of this appendix may be used:

        [A] Negative Pressure Enclosure/HEPA Vacuum System Method

    (1) The brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair, and 
assembly operations shall be enclosed to cover and contain the clutch or 
brake assembly and to prevent the release of asbestos fibers into the 
worker's breathing zone.
    (2) The enclosure shall be sealed tightly and thoroughly inspected 
for leaks before work begins on brake and clutch inspection, 
disassembly, repair, and assembly.
    (3) The enclosure shall be such that the worker can clearly see the 
operation and shall provide impermeable sleeves through which the worker 
can handle the brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair and 
assembly. The integrity of the sleeves and ports shall be examined 
before work begins.
    (4) A HEPA-filtered vacuum shall be employed to maintain the 
enclosure under negative pressure throughout the operation. Compressed-
air may be used to remove asbestos fibers or particles from the 
enclosure.
    (5) The HEPA vacuum shall be used first to loosen the asbestos 
containing residue from the brake and clutch parts and then to evacuate 
the loosened asbestos containing material from the enclosure and capture 
the material in the vacuum filter.
    (6) The vacuum's filter, when full, shall be first wetted with a 
fine mist of water, then removed and placed immediately in an 
impermeable container, labeled according to paragraph (j)(4) of this 
section and disposed of according to paragraph (k) of this section.
    (7) Any spills or releases of asbestos containing waste material 
from inside of the enclosure or vacuum hose or vacuum filter shall be 
immediately cleaned up and disposed of according to paragraph (k) of 
this section.

                  [B] Low Pressure/Wet Cleaning Method

    (1) A catch basin shall be placed under the brake assembly, 
positioned to avoid splashes and spills.
    (2) The reservoir shall contain water containing an organic solvent 
or wetting agent. The flow of liquid shall be controlled such that the 
brake assembly is gently flooded to prevent the asbestos-containing 
brake dust from becoming airborne.
    (3) The aqueous solution shall be allowed to flow between the brake 
drum and brake support before the drum is removed.
    (4) After removing the brake drum, the wheel hub and back of the 
brake assembly shall be thoroughly wetted to suppress dust.
    (5) The brake support plate, brake shoes and brake components used 
to attach the brake shoes shall be thoroughly washed before removing the 
old shoes.
    (6) In systems using filters, the filters, when full, shall be first 
wetted with a fine mist of water, then removed and placed immediately in 
an impermeable container, labeled according to paragraph (j)(4) of this 
section and disposed of according to paragraph (k) of this section.
    (7) Any spills of asbestos-containing aqueous solution or any 
asbestos-containing waste material shall be cleaned up immediately and 
disposed of according to paragraph (k) of this section.
    (8) The use of dry brushing during low pressure/wet cleaning 
operations is prohibited.

                         [C] Equivalent Methods

    An equivalent method is one which has sufficient written detail so 
that it can be reproduced and has been demonstrated that the exposures 
resulting from the equivalent method are equal to or less than the 
exposures which would result from the use of the method described in 
paragraph [A] of this appendix. For purposes of making this comparison, 
the employer shall assume that exposures resulting from the use of the 
method described in paragraph [A] of this appendix shall not exceed 
0.016 f/cc, as measured by the OSHA reference method and as averaged 
over at least 18 personal samples.

                             [D] Wet Method.

    (1) A spray bottle, hose nozzle, or other implement capable of 
delivering a fine mist of water or amended water or other delivery 
system capable of delivering water at low pressure, shall be used to 
first thoroughly wet the brake and clutch parts. Brake and clutch 
components shall then be wiped clean with a cloth.
    (2) The cloth shall be placed in an impermeable container, labelled 
according to paragraph (j)(4) of this section and then disposed of 
according to paragraph (k) of this section, or the cloth shall be 
laundered in a way to prevent the release of asbestos fibers in excess 
of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air.
    (3) Any spills of solvent or any asbestos containing waste material 
shall be cleaned up immediately according to paragraph (k) of this 
section.
    (4) The use of dry brushing during the wet method operations is 
prohibited.

   Appendix G to Sec. 1910.1001--Substance Technical Information for 
                         Asbestos--Non-Mandatory

                       I. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: ``Asbestos'' is the name of a class of magnesium-
silicate minerals that

[[Page 56]]

occur in fibrous form. Minerals that are included in this group are 
chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, tremolite asbestos, anthophyllite 
asbestos, and actinolite asbestos.
    B. Asbestos is used in the manufacture of heat-resistant clothing, 
automative brake and clutch linings, and a variety of building materials 
including floor tiles, roofing felts, ceiling tiles, asbestos-cement 
pipe and sheet, and fire-resistant drywall. Asbestos is also present in 
pipe and boiler insulation materials, and in sprayed-on materials 
located on beams, in crawlspaces, and between walls.
    C. The potential for a product containing asbestos to release 
breatheable fibers depends on its degree of friability. Friable means 
that the material can be crumbled with hand pressure and is therefore 
likely to emit fibers. The fibrous or fluffy sprayed-on materials used 
for fireproofing, insulation, or sound proofing are considered to be 
friable, and they readily release airborne fibers if disturbed. 
Materials such as vinyl-asbestos floor tile or roofing felts are 
considered nonfriable and generally do not emit airborne fibers unless 
subjected to sanding or sawing operations. Asbestos-cement pipe or sheet 
can emit airborne fibers if the materials are cut or sawed, or if they 
are broken during demolition operations.
    D. Permissible exposure: Exposure to airborne asbestos fibers may 
not exceed 0.2 fibers per cubic centimeter of air (0.1 f/cc) averaged 
over the 8-hour workday.

                         II. Health Hazard Data

    A. Asbestos can cause disabling respiratory disease and various 
types of cancers if the fibers are inhaled. Inhaling or ingesting fibers 
from contaminated clothing or skin can also result in these diseases. 
The symptoms of these diseases generally do not appear for 20 or more 
years after initial exposure.
    B. Exposure to asbestos has been shown to cause lung cancer, 
mesothelioma, and cancer of the stomach and colon. Mesothelioma is a 
rare cancer of the thin membrane lining of the chest and abdomen. 
Symptoms of mesothelioma include shortness of breath, pain in the walls 
of the chest, and/or abdominal pain.

                III. Respirators and Protective Clothing

    A. Respirators: You are required to wear a respirator when 
performing tasks that result in asbestos exposure that exceeds the 
permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 f/cc. These conditions can occur 
while your employer is in the process of installing engineering controls 
to reduce asbestos exposure, or where engineering controls are not 
feasible to reduce asbestos exposure. Air-purifying respirators equipped 
with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter can be used where 
airborne asbestos fiber concentrations do not exceed 2 f/cc; otherwise, 
air-supplied, positive-pressure, full facepiece respirators must be 
used. Disposable respirators or dust masks are not permitted to be used 
for asbestos work. For effective protection, respirators must fit your 
face and head snugly. Your employer is required to conduct fit tests 
when you are first assigned a respirator and every 6 months thereafter. 
Respirators should not be loosened or removed in work situations where 
their use is required.
    B. Protective clothing: You are required to wear protective clothing 
in work areas where asbestos fiber concentrations exceed the permissible 
exposure limit.

                   IV. Disposal Procedures and Cleanup

    A. Wastes that are generated by processes where asbestos is present 
include:
    1. Empty asbestos shipping containers.
    2. Process wastes such as cuttings, trimmings, or reject material.
    3. Housekeeping waste from sweeping or vacuuming.
    4. Asbestos fireproofing or insulating material that is removed from 
buildings.
    5. Building products that contain asbestos removed during building 
renovation or demolition.
    6. Contaminated disposable protective clothing.
    B. Empty shipping bags can be flattened under exhaust hoods and 
packed into airtight containers for disposal. Empty shipping drums are 
difficult to clean and should be sealed.
    C. Vacuum bags or disposable paper filters should not be cleaned, 
but should be sprayed with a fine water mist and placed into a labeled 
waste container.
    D. Process waste and housekeeping waste should be wetted with water 
or a mixture of water and surfactant prior to packaging in disposable 
containers.
    E. Material containing asbestos that is removed from buildings must 
be disposed of in leak-tight 6-mil thick plastic bags, plastic-lined 
cardboard containers, or plastic-lined metal containers. These wastes, 
which are removed while wet, should be sealed in containers before they 
dry out to minimize the release of asbestos fibers during handling.

                        V. Access to Information

    A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the 
information contained in this standard and appendices for asbestos. In 
addition, your employer must instruct you in the proper work practices 
for handling materials containing asbestos, and the correct use of 
protective equipment.
    B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being 
exposed to asbestos. You or your representative has the right to observe 
employee measurements and to

[[Page 57]]

record the results obtained. Your employer is required to inform you of 
your exposure, and, if you are exposed above the permissible limit, he 
or she is required to inform you of the actions that are being taken to 
reduce your exposure to within the permissible limit.
    C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and 
medical examinations. These exposure records must be kept for at least 
thirty (30) years. Medical records must be kept for the period of your 
employment plus thirty (30) years.
    D. Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical 
records to your physician or designated representative upon your written 
request.

   Appendix H to Sec. 1910.1001--Medical Surveillance Guidelines for 
                         Asbestos Non-Mandatory

                 I. Route of Entry Inhalation, Ingestion

                             II. Toxicology

    Clinical evidence of the adverse effects associated with exposure to 
asbestos is present in the form of several well-conducted 
epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed workers, family 
contacts of workers, and persons living near asbestos mines. These 
studies have shown a definite association between exposure to asbestos 
and an increased incidence of lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal 
mesothelioma, gastrointestinal cancer, and asbestosis. The latter is a 
disabling fibrotic lung disease that is caused only by exposure to 
asbestos. Exposure to asbestos has also been associated with an 
increased incidence of esophageal, kidney, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and 
buccal cavity cancers. As with other known chronic occupational 
diseases, disease associated with asbestos generally appears about 20 
years following the first occurrence of exposure: There are no known 
acute effects associated with exposure to asbestos.
    Epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer among 
exposed workers who smoke cigarettes is greatly increased over the risk 
of lung cancer among non-exposed smokers or exposed nonsmokers. These 
studies suggest that cessation of smoking will reduce the risk of lung 
cancer for a person exposed to asbestos but will not reduce it to the 
same level of risk as that existing for an exposed worker who has never 
smoked.

           III. Signs and Symptoms of Exposure-Related Disease

    The signs and symptoms of lung cancer or gastrointestinal cancer 
induced by exposure to asbestos are not unique, except that a chest X-
ray of an exposed patient with lung cancer may show pleural plaques, 
pleural calcification, or pleural fibrosis. Symptoms characteristic of 
mesothelioma include shortness of breath, pain in the walls of the 
chest, or abdominal pain. Mesothelioma has a much longer latency period 
compared with lung cancer (40 years versus 15-20 years), and 
mesothelioma is therefore more likely to be found among workers who were 
first exposed to asbestos at an early age. Mesothelioma is always fatal.
    Asbestosis is pulmonary fibrosis caused by the accumulation of 
asbestos fibers in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath, 
coughing, fatigue, and vague feelings of sickness. When the fibrosis 
worsens, shortness of breath occurs even at rest. The diagnosis of 
asbestosis is based on a history of exposure to asbestos, the presence 
of characteristic radiologic changes, end-inspiratory crackles (rales), 
and other clinical features of fibrosing lung disease. Pleural plaques 
and thickening are observed on X-rays taken during the early stages of 
the disease. Asbestosis is often a progressive disease even in the 
absence of continued exposure, although this appears to be a highly 
individualized characteristic. In severe cases, death may be caused by 
respiratory or cardiac failure.

             IV. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations

    As noted above, exposure to asbestos has been linked to an increased 
risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma, gastrointestinal cancer, and 
asbestosis among occupationally exposed workers. Adequate screening 
tests to determine an employee's potential for developing serious 
chronic diseases, such as cancer, from exposure to asbestos do not 
presently exist. However, some tests, particularly chest X-rays and 
pulmonary function tests, may indicate that an employee has been 
overexposed to asbestos increasing his or her risk of developing 
exposure-related chronic diseases. It is important for the physician to 
become familiar with the operating conditions in which occupational 
exposure to asbestos is likely to occur. This is particularly important 
in evaluating medical and work histories and in conducting physical 
examinations. When an active employee has been identified as having been 
overexposed to asbestos, measures taken by the employer to eliminate or 
mitigate further exposure should also lower the risk of serious long-
term consequences.
    The employer is required to institute a medical surveillance program 
for all employees who are or will be exposed to asbestos at or above the 
permissible exposure limit (0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air). All 
examinations and procedures must be performed by or under the 
supervision of a licensed physician, at a reasonable time and place, and 
at no cost to the employee.
    Although broad latitude is given to the physician in prescribing 
specific tests to be

[[Page 58]]

included in the medical surveillance program, OSHA requires inclusion of 
the following elements in the routine examination:
    (i) Medical and work histories with special emphasis directed to 
symptoms of the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and digestive 
tract.
    (ii) Completion of the respiratory disease questionnaire contained 
in Appendix D.
    (iii) A physical examination including a chest roentgenogram and 
pulmonary function test that includes measurement of the employee's 
forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume at one second 
(FEV<INF>1</INF>).
    (iv) Any laboratory or other test that the examining physician deems 
by sound medical practice to be necessary.
    The employer is required to make the prescribed tests available at 
least annually to those employees covered; more often than specified if 
recommended by the examining physician; and upon termination of 
employment.
    The employer is required to provide the physician with the following 
information: A copy of this standard and appendices; a description of 
the mployee's duties as they relate to asbestos exposure; the employee's 
representative level of exposure to asbestos; a description of any 
personal protective and respiratory equipment used; and information from 
previous medical examinations of the affected employee that is not 
otherwise available to the physician. Making this information available 
to the physician will aid in the evaluation of the employee's health in 
relation to assigned duties and fitness to wear personal protective 
equipment, if required.
    The employer is required to obtain a written opinion from the 
examining physician containing the results of the medical examination; 
the physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any detected 
medical conditions that would place the employee at an increased risk of 
exposure-related disease; any recommended limitations on the employee or 
on the use of personal protective equipment; and a statement that the 
employee has been informed by the physician of the results of the 
medical examination and of any medical conditions related to asbestos 
exposure that require further explanation or treatment. This written 
opinion must not reveal specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to 
exposure to asbestos, and a copy of the opinion must be provided to the 
affected employee.

 Appendix J to Sec. 1910.1001--Polarized Light Microscopy of Asbestos--
                              Non-Mandatory

Method number: ID-191
Matrix: Bulk

                          Collection Procedure

    Collect approximately 1 to 2 grams of each type of material and 
place into separate 20 mL scintillation vials.

                          Analytical Procedure

    A portion of each separate phase is analyzed by gross examination, 
phase-polar examination, and central stop dispersion microscopy.
    Commercial manufacturers and products mentioned in this method are 
for descriptive use only and do not constitute endorsements by USDOL-
OSHA. Similar products from other sources may be substituted.

                             1. Introduction

    This method describes the collection and analysis of asbestos bulk 
materials by light microscopy techniques including phase- polar 
illumination and central-stop dispersion microscopy. Some terms unique 
to asbestos analysis are defined below:
    Amphibole: A family of minerals whose crystals are formed by long, 
thin units which have two thin ribbons of double chain silicate with a 
brucite ribbon in between. The shape of each unit is similar to an ``I 
beam''. Minerals important in asbestos analysis include cummingtonite-
grunerite, crocidolite, tremolite-actinolite and anthophyllite.
    Asbestos: A term for naturally occurring fibrous minerals. Asbestos 
includes chrysotile, cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos (amosite), 
anthophyllite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, crocidolite, actinolite 
asbestos and any of these minerals which have been chemically treated or 
altered. The precise chemical formulation of each species varies with 
the location from which it was mined. Nominal compositions are listed:

 Chrysotile...............................Mg<INF>3</INF> Si<INF>2</INF> 
                                           O<INF>5</INF>(OH)<INF>4</INF>
                    Crocidolite (Riebeckite asbestos)....Na<INF>2</INF> 
                Fe<INF>3</INF><SUP>2+</SUP> Fe<INF>2</INF><SUP>3+</SUP> 
                           Si<INF>8</INF> O<INF>22</INF>(OH)<INF>2</INF>
Cummingtonite-Grunerite asbestos (Amosite)..........(Mg,Fe)<INF>7</INF> 
                           Si<INF>8</INF> O<INF>22</INF>(OH)<INF>2</INF>
             Tremolite-Actinolite asbestos................Ca<INF>2</INF>
                                     (Mg,Fe)<INF>5</INF> Si<INF>8</INF> 
                                          O<INF>22</INF>(OH)<INF>2</INF>
  Anthophyllite asbestos.............(Mg,Fe)<INF>7</INF> Si<INF>8</INF> 
                                          O<INF>22</INF>(OH)<INF>2</INF>
    Asbestos Fiber: A fiber of asbestos meeting the criteria for a 
fiber. (See section 3.5.)
    Aspect Ratio: The ratio of the length of a fiber to its diameter 
usually defined as ``length : width'', e.g. 3:1.
    Brucite: A sheet mineral with the composition Mg(OH)<INF>2</INF>.
    Central Stop Dispersion Staining (microscope): This is a dark field 
microscope technique that images particles using only light refracted by 
the particle, excluding light that travels through the particle 
unrefracted. This is usually accomplished with a McCrone objective or 
other arrangement which places a circular stop with apparent aperture 
equal to the objective aperture in the back focal plane of the 
microscope.
    Cleavage Fragments: Mineral particles formed by the comminution of 
minerals, especially those characterized by relatively parallel sides 
and moderate aspect ratio.
    Differential Counting: The term applied to the practice of excluding 
certain kinds of fibers from a phase contrast asbestos count because 
they are not asbestos.
    Fiber: A particle longer than or equal to 5 <greek-m> m with a 
length to width ratio greater than or equal to 3:1. This may include 
cleavage fragments. (see section 3.5 of this appendix).
    Phase Contrast: Contrast obtained in the microscope by causing light 
scattered by small particles to destructively interfere with unscattered 
light, thereby enhancing the visibility of very small particles and 
particles with very low intrinsic contrast.
    Phase Contrast Microscope: A microscope configured with a phase mask 
pair to create phase contrast. The technique which uses this is called 
Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM).
    Phase-Polar Analysis: This is the use of polarized light in a phase 
contrast microscope. It is used to see the same size fibers that are 
visible in air filter analysis. Although fibers finer than 1 <greek-m> m 
are visible, analysis of these is inferred from analysis of larger 
bundles that are usually present.
    Phase-Polar Microscope: The phase-polar microscope is a phase 
contrast microscope which has an analyzer, a polarizer, a first order 
red plate and a rotating phase condenser all in place so that the 
polarized light image is enhanced by phase contrast.
    Sealing Encapsulant: This is a product which can be applied, 
preferably by spraying, onto an asbestos surface which will seal the 
surface so that fibers cannot be released.
    Serpentine: A mineral family consisting of minerals with the general 
composition Mg<INF>3</INF>(Si2O<INF>5</INF>(OH)<INF>4</INF> having the 
magnesium in brucite layer over a silicate layer. Minerals important in 
asbestos analysis included in this family are chrysotile, lizardite, 
antigorite.

                              1.1. History

    Light microscopy has been used for well over 100 years for the 
determination of mineral species. This analysis is carried out using 
specialized polarizing microscopes as

[[Page 60]]

well as bright field microscopes. The identification of minerals is an 
on-going process with many new minerals described each year. The first 
recorded use of asbestos was in Finland about 2500 B.C. where the 
material was used in the mud wattle for the wooden huts the people lived 
in as well as strengthening for pottery. Adverse health aspects of the 
mineral were noted nearly 2000 years ago when Pliny the Younger wrote 
about the poor health of slaves in the asbestos mines. Although known to 
be injurious for centuries, the first modern references to its toxicity 
were by the British Labor Inspectorate when it banned asbestos dust from 
the workplace in 1898. Asbestosis cases were described in the literature 
after the turn of the century. Cancer was first suspected in the mid 
1930's and a causal link to mesothelioma was made in 1965. Because of 
the public concern for worker and public safety with the use of this 
material, several different types of analysis were applied to the 
determination of asbestos content. Light microscopy requires a great 
deal of experience and craft. Attempts were made to apply less 
subjective methods to the analysis. X-ray diffraction was partially 
successful in determining the mineral types but was unable to separate 
out the fibrous portions from the non-fibrous portions. Also, the 
minimum detection limit for asbestos analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
is about 1%. Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) was no more successful. 
These provide useful corroborating information when the presence of 
asbestos has been shown by microscopy; however, neither can determine 
the difference between fibrous and non-fibrous minerals when both habits 
are present. The same is true of Infrared Absorption (IR).
    When electron microscopy was applied to asbestos analysis, hundreds 
of fibers were discovered present too small to be visible in any light 
microscope. There are two different types of electron microscope used 
for asbestos analysis: Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and 
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Scanning Electron Microscopy is 
useful in identifying minerals. The SEM can provide two of the three 
pieces of information required to identify fibers by electron 
microscopy: morphology and chemistry. The third is structure as 
determined by Selected Area Electron Diffraction--SAED which is 
performed in the TEM. Although the resolution of the SEM is sufficient 
for very fine fibers to be seen, accuracy of chemical analysis that can 
be performed on the fibers varies with fiber diameter in fibers of less 
than 0.2 <greek-m> m diameter. The TEM is a powerful tool to identify 
fibers too small to be resolved by light microscopy and should be used 
in conjunction with this method when necessary. The TEM can provide all 
three pieces of information required for fiber identification. Most 
fibers thicker than 1 <greek-m> m can adequately be defined in the light 
microscope. The light microscope remains as the best instrument for the 
determination of mineral type. This is because the minerals under 
investigation were first described analytically with the light 
microscope. It is inexpensive and gives positive identification for most 
samples analyzed. Further, when optical techniques are inadequate, there 
is ample indication that alternative techniques should be used for 
complete identification of the sample.

                             1.2. Principle

    Minerals consist of atoms that may be arranged in random order or in 
a regular arrangement. Amorphous materials have atoms in random order 
while crystalline materials have long range order. Many materials are 
transparent to light, at least for small particles or for thin sections. 
The properties of these materials can be investigated by the effect that 
the material has on light passing through it. The six asbestos minerals 
are all crystalline with particular properties that have been identified 
and cataloged. These six minerals are anisotropic. They have a regular 
array of atoms, but the arrangement is not the same in all directions. 
Each major direction of the crystal presents a different regularity. 
Light photons travelling in each of these main directions will encounter 
different electrical neighborhoods, affecting the path and time of 
travel. The techniques outlined in this method use the fact that light 
traveling through fibers or crystals in different directions will behave 
differently, but predictably. The behavior of the light as it travels 
through a crystal can be measured and compared with known or determined 
values to identify the mineral species. Usually, Polarized Light 
Microscopy (PLM) is performed with strain-free objectives on a bright-
field microscope platform. This would limit the resolution of the 
microscope to about 0.4 <greek-m>m. Because OSHA requires the counting 
and identification of fibers visible in phase contrast, the phase 
contrast platform is used to visualize the fibers with the polarizing 
elements added into the light path. Polarized light methods cannot 
identify fibers finer than about 1 <greek-m>m in diameter even though 
they are visible. The finest fibers are usually identified by inference 
from the presence of larger, identifiable fiber bundles. When fibers are 
present, but not identifiable by light microscopy, use either SEM or TEM 
to determine the fiber identity.

                    1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages

    The advantages of light microcopy are:
    (a) Basic identification of the materials was first performed by 
light microscopy and gross analysis. This provides a large base of

[[Page 61]]

published information against which to check analysis and analytical 
technique.
    (b) The analysis is specific to fibers. The minerals present can 
exist in asbestiform, fibrous, prismatic, or massive varieties all at 
the same time. Therefore, bulk methods of analysis such as X-ray 
diffraction, IR analysis, DTA, etc. are inappropriate where the material 
is not known to be fibrous.
    (c) The analysis is quick, requires little preparation time, and can 
be performed on-site if a suitably equipped microscope is available.
    The disadvantages are:
    (a) Even using phase-polar illumination, not all the fibers present 
may be seen. This is a problem for very low asbestos concentrations 
where agglomerations or large bundles of fibers may not be present to 
allow identification by inference.
    (b) The method requires a great degree of sophistication on the part 
of the microscopist. An analyst is only as useful as his mental catalog 
of images. Therefore, a microscopist's accuracy is enhanced by 
experience. The mineralogical training of the analyst is very important. 
It is the basis on which subjective decisions are made.
    (c) The method uses only a tiny amount of material for analysis. 
This may lead to sampling bias and false results (high or low). This is 
especially true if the sample is severely inhomogeneous.
    (d) Fibers may be bound in a matrix and not distinguishable as 
fibers so identification cannot be made.

                         1.4. Method Performance

    1.4.1. This method can be used for determination of asbestos content 
from 0 to 100% asbestos. The detection limit has not been adequately 
determined, although for selected samples, the limit is very low, 
depending on the number of particles examined. For mostly homogeneous, 
finely divided samples, with no difficult fibrous interferences, the 
detection limit is below 1%. For inhomogeneous samples (most samples), 
the detection limit remains undefined. NIST has conducted proficiency 
testing of laboratories on a national scale. Although each round is 
reported statistically with an average, control limits, etc., the 
results indicate a difficulty in establishing precision especially in 
the low concentration range. It is suspected that there is significant 
bias in the low range especially near 1%. EPA tried to remedy this by 
requiring a mandatory point counting scheme for samples less than 10%. 
The point counting procedure is tedious, and may introduce significant 
biases of its own. It has not been incorporated into this method.
    1.4.2. The precision and accuracy of the quantitation tests 
performed in this method are unknown. Concentrations are easier to 
determine in commercial products where asbestos was deliberately added 
because the amount is usually more than a few percent. An analyst's 
results can be ``calibrated'' against the known amounts added by the 
manufacturer. For geological samples, the degree of homogeneity affects 
the precision.
    1.4.3. The performance of the method is analyst dependent. The 
analyst must choose carefully and not necessarily randomly the portions 
for analysis to assure that detection of asbestos occurs when it is 
present. For this reason, the analyst must have adequate training in 
sample preparation, and experience in the location and identification of 
asbestos in samples. This is usually accomplished through substantial 
on-the-job training as well as formal education in mineralogy and 
microscopy.

                           1.5. Interferences

    Any material which is long, thin, and small enough to be viewed 
under the microscope can be considered an interference for asbestos. 
There are literally hundreds of interferences in workplaces. The 
techniques described in this method are normally sufficient to eliminate 
the interferences. An analyst's success in eliminating the interferences 
depends on proper training.
    Asbestos minerals belong to two mineral families: the serpentines 
and the amphiboles. In the serpentine family, the only common fibrous 
mineral is chrysotile. Occasionally, the mineral antigorite occurs in a 
fibril habit with morphology similar to the amphiboles. The amphibole 
minerals consist of a score of different minerals of which only five are 
regulated by federal standard: amosite, crocidolite, anthophyllite 
asbestos, tremolite asbestos and actinolite asbestos. These are the only 
amphibole minerals that have been commercially exploited for their 
fibrous properties; however, the rest can and do occur occasionally in 
asbestiform habit.
    In addition to the related mineral interferences, other minerals 
common in building material may present a problem for some 
microscopists: gypsum, anhydrite, brucite, quartz fibers, talc fibers or 
ribbons, wollastonite, perlite, attapulgite, etc. Other fibrous 
materials commonly present in workplaces are: fiberglass, mineral wool, 
ceramic wool, refractory ceramic fibers, kevlar, nomex, synthetic 
fibers, graphite or carbon fibers, cellulose (paper or wood) fibers, 
metal fibers, etc.
    Matrix embedding material can sometimes be a negative interference. 
The analyst may not be able to easily extract the fibers from the matrix 
in order to use the method. Where possible, remove the matrix before the 
analysis, taking careful note of the loss of weight. Some common matrix 
materials are: vinyl, rubber, tar, paint, plant fiber, cement, and 
epoxy. A further negative interference is that the asbestos fibers 
themselves may be either too small to be seen in Phase contrast 
Microscopy (PCM) or of a very low

[[Page 62]]

fibrous quality, having the appearance of plant fibers. The analyst's 
ability to deal with these materials increases with experience.

                   1.6. Uses and Occupational Exposure

    Asbestos is ubiquitous in the environment. More than 40% of the land 
area of the United States is composed of minerals which may contain 
asbestos. Fortunately, the actual formation of great amounts of asbestos 
is relatively rare. Nonetheless, there are locations in which 
environmental exposure can be severe such as in the Serpentine Hills of 
California.
    There are thousands of uses for asbestos in industry and the home. 
Asbestos abatement workers are the most current segment of the 
population to have occupational exposure to great amounts of asbestos. 
If the material is undisturbed, there is no exposure. Exposure occurs 
when the asbestos-containing material is abraded or otherwise disturbed 
during maintenance operations or some other activity. Approximately 95% 
of the asbestos in place in the United States is chrysotile.
    Amosite and crocidolite make up nearly all the difference. Tremolite 
and anthophyllite make up a very small percentage. Tremolite is found in 
extremely small amounts in certain chrysotile deposits. Actinolite 
exposure is probably greatest from environmental sources, but has been 
identified in vermiculite containing, sprayed-on insulating materials 
which may have been certified as asbestos-free.

                  1.7. Physical and Chemical Properties

    The nominal chemical compositions for the asbestos minerals were 
given in Section 1. Compared to cleavage fragments of the same minerals, 
asbestiform fibers possess a high tensile strength along the fiber axis. 
They are chemically inert, non- combustible, and heat resistant. Except 
for chrysotile, they are insoluble in Hydrochloric acid (HCl). 
Chrysotile is slightly soluble in HCl. Asbestos has high electrical 
resistance and good sound absorbing characteristics. It can be woven 
into cables, fabrics or other textiles, or matted into papers, felts, 
and mats.

1.8. Toxicology (This Section is for Information Only and Should Not Be 
                          Taken as OSHA Policy)

    Possible physiologic results of respiratory exposure to asbestos are 
mesothelioma of the pleura or peritoneum, interstitial fibrosis, 
asbestosis, pneumoconiosis, or respiratory cancer. The possible 
consequences of asbestos exposure are detailed in the NIOSH Criteria 
Document or in the OSHA Asbestos Standards 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 
1926.1101 and 29 CFR 1915.1001.

                          2. Sampling Procedure

                       2.1. Equipment for Sampling

    (a) Tube or cork borer sampling device
    (b) Knife
    (c) 20 mL scintillation vial or similar vial
    (d) Sealing encapsulant

                         2.2. Safety Precautions

    Asbestos is a known carcinogen. Take care when sampling. While in an 
asbestos-containing atmosphere, a properly selected and fit-tested 
respirator should be worn. Take samples in a manner to cause the least 
amount of dust. Follow these general guidelines:
    (a) Do not make unnecessary dust.
    (b) Take only a small amount (1 to 2 g).
    (c) Tightly close the sample container.
    (d) Use encapsulant to seal the spot where the sample was taken, if 
necessary.

                         2.3. Sampling Procedure

    Samples of any suspect material should be taken from an 
inconspicuous place. Where the material is to remain, seal the sampling 
wound with an encapsulant to eliminate the potential for exposure from 
the sample site. Microscopy requires only a few milligrams of material. 
The amount that will fill a 20 mL scintillation vial is more than 
adequate. Be sure to collect samples from all layers and phases of 
material. If possible, make separate samples of each different phase of 
the material. This will aid in determining the actual hazard. DO NOT USE 
ENVELOPES, PLASTIC OR PAPER BAGS OF ANY KIND TO COLLECT SAMPLES. The use 
of plastic bags presents a contamination hazard to laboratory personnel 
and to other samples. When these containers are opened, a bellows effect 
blows fibers out of the container onto everything, including the person 
opening the container.
    If a cork-borer type sampler is available, push the tube through the 
material all the way, so that all layers of material are sampled. Some 
samplers are intended to be disposable. These should be capped and sent 
to the laboratory. If a non-disposable cork borer is used, empty the 
contents into a scintillation vial and send to the laboratory. 
Vigorously and completely clean the cork borer between samples.

                              2.4 Shipment

    Samples packed in glass vials must not touch or they might break in 
shipment.
    (a) Seal the samples with a sample seal over the end to guard 
against tampering and to identify the sample.
    (b) Package the bulk samples in separate packages from the air 
samples. They may cross-contaminate each other and will invalidate the 
results of the air samples.

[[Page 63]]

    (c) Include identifying paperwork with the samples, but not in 
contact with the suspected asbestos.
    (d) To maintain sample accountability, ship the samples by certified 
mail, overnight express, or hand carry them to the laboratory.

                               3. Analysis

    The analysis of asbestos samples can be divided into two major 
parts: sample preparation and microscopy. Because of the different 
asbestos uses that may be encountered by the analyst, each sample may 
need different preparation steps. The choices are outlined below. There 
are several different tests that are performed to identify the asbestos 
species and determine the percentage. They will be explained below.

                               3.1. Safety

    (a) Do not create unnecessary dust. Handle the samples in HEPA-
filter equipped hoods. If samples are received in bags, envelopes or 
other inappropriate container, open them only in a hood having a face 
velocity at or greater than 100 fpm. Transfer a small amount to a 
scintillation vial and only handle the smaller amount.
    (b) Open samples in a hood, never in the open lab area.
    (c) Index of refraction oils can be toxic. Take care not to get this 
material on the skin. Wash immediately with soap and water if this 
happens.
    (d) Samples that have been heated in the muffle furnace or the 
drying oven may be hot. Handle them with tongs until they are cool 
enough to handle.
    (e) Some of the solvents used, such as THF (tetrahydrofuran), are 
toxic and should only be handled in an appropriate fume hood and 
according to instructions given in the Material Safety Data Sheet 
(MSDS).

                       3.3. Sample Pre-Preparation

    Sample preparation begins with pre-preparation which may include 
chemical reduction of the matrix, heating the sample to dryness or 
heating in the muffle furnace. The end result is a sample which has been 
reduced to a powder that is sufficiently fine to fit under the cover 
slip. Analyze different phases of samples separately, e.g., tile and the 
tile mastic should be analyzed separately as the mastic may contain 
asbestos while the tile may not.

                             (a) Wet samples

    Samples with a high water content will not give the proper 
dispersion colors and must be dried prior to sample mounting. Remove the 
lid of the scintillation vial, place the bottle in the drying oven and 
heat at 100  deg.C to dryness (usually about 2 h). Samples which are not 
submitted to the lab in glass must be removed and placed in glass vials 
or aluminum weighing pans before placing them in the drying oven.

          (b) Samples With Organic Interference--Muffle Furnace

    These may include samples with tar as a matrix, vinyl asbestos tile, 
or any other organic that can be reduced by heating. Remove the sample 
from the vial and weigh in a balance to determine the weight of the 
submitted portion. Place the sample in a muffle

[[Page 64]]

furnace at 500  deg.C for 1 to 2 h or until all obvious organic material 
has been removed. Retrieve, cool and weigh again to determine the weight 
loss on ignition. This is necessary to determine the asbestos content of 
the submitted sample, because the analyst will be looking at a reduced 
sample.
    Note: Heating above 600  deg.C will cause the sample to undergo a 
structural change which, given sufficient time, will convert the 
chrysotile to forsterite. Heating even at lower temperatures for 1 to 2 
h may have a measurable effect on the optical properties of the 
minerals. If the analyst is unsure of what to expect, a sample of 
standard asbestos should be heated to the same temperature for the same 
length of time so that it can be examined for the proper interpretation.

               (c) Samples With Organic Interference--THF

    Vinyl asbestos tile is the most common material treated with this 
solvent, although, substances containing tar will sometimes yield to 
this treatment. Select a portion of the material and then grind it up if 
possible. Weigh the sample and place it in a test tube. Add sufficient 
THF to dissolve the organic matrix. This is usually about 4 to 5 mL. 
Remember, THF is highly flammable. Filter the remaining material through 
a tared silver membrane, dry and weigh to determine how much is left 
after the solvent extraction. Further process the sample to remove 
carbonate or mount directly.

                 (d) Samples With Carbonate Interference

    Carbonate material is often found on fibers and sometimes must be 
removed in order to perform dispersion microscopy. Weigh out a portion 
of the material and place it in a test tube. Add a sufficient amount of 
0.1 M HCl or decalcifying solution in the tube to react all the 
carbonate as evidenced by gas formation; i.e., when the gas bubbles 
stop, add a little more solution. If no more gas forms, the reaction is 
complete. Filter the material out through a tared silver membrane, dry 
and weigh to determine the weight lost.

                         3.4. Sample Preparation

    Samples must be prepared so that accurate determination can be made 
of the asbestos type and amount present. The following steps are carried 
out in the low-flow hood (a low-flow hood has less than 50 fpm flow):
    (1) If the sample has large lumps, is hard, or cannot be made to lie 
under a cover slip, the grain size must be reduced. Place a small amount 
between two slides and grind the material between them or grind a small 
amount in a clean mortar and pestle. The choice of whether to use an 
alumina, ruby, or diamond mortar depends on the hardness of the 
material. Impact damage can alter the asbestos mineral if too much 
mechanical shock occurs. (Freezer mills can completely destroy the 
observable crystallinity of asbestos and should not be used). For some 
samples, a portion of material can be shaved off with a scalpel, ground 
off with a hand grinder or hack saw blade.
    The preparation tools should either be disposable or cleaned 
thoroughly. Use vigorous scrubbing to loosen the fibers during the 
washing. Rinse the implements with copious amounts of water and air-dry 
in a dust-free environment.
    (2) If the sample is powder or has been reduced as in (1) above, it 
is ready to mount. Place a glass slide on a piece of optical tissue and 
write the identification on the painted or frosted end. Place two drops 
of index of refraction medium n=1.550 on the slide. (The medium n=1.550 
is chosen because it is the matching index for chrysotile. Dip the end 
of a clean paper-clip or dissecting needle into the droplet of 
refraction medium on the slide to moisten it. Then dip the probe into 
the powder sample. Transfer what sticks on the probe to the slide. The 
material on the end of the probe should have a diameter of about 3 mm 
for a good mount. If the material is very fine, less sample may be 
appropriate. For non-powder samples such as fiber mats, forceps should 
be used to transfer a small amount of material to the slide. Stir the 
material in the medium on the slide, spreading it out and making the 
preparation as uniform as possible. Place a cover-slip on the 
preparation by gently lowering onto the slide and allowing it to fall 
``trapdoor'' fashion on the preparation to push out any bubbles. Press 
gently on the cover slip to even out the distribution of particulate on 
the slide. If there is insufficient mounting oil on the slide, one or 
two drops may be placed near the edge of the coverslip on the slide. 
Capillary action will draw the necessary amount of liquid into the 
preparation. Remove excess oil with the point of a laboratory wiper.
    Treat at least two different areas of each phase in this fashion. 
Choose representative areas of the sample. It may be useful to select 
particular areas or fibers for analysis. This is useful to identify 
asbestos in severely inhomogeneous samples.
    When it is determined that amphiboles may be present, repeat the 
above process using the appropriate high-dispersion oils until an 
identification is made or all six asbestos minerals have been ruled out. 
Note that percent determination must be done in the index medium 1.550 
because amphiboles tend to disappear in their matching mediums.

                        3.5. Analytical Procedure

    Note: This method presumes some knowledge of mineralogy and optical 
petrography.
    The analysis consists of three parts: The determination of whether 
there is asbestos

[[Page 65]]

present, what type is present and the determination of how much is 
present. The general flow of the analysis is:
    (1) Gross examination.
    (2) Examination under polarized light on the stereo microscope.
    (3) Examination by phase-polar illumination on the compound phase 
microscope.
    (4) Determination of species by dispersion stain. Examination by 
Becke line analysis may also be used; however, this is usually more 
cumbersome for asbestos determination.
    (5) Difficult samples may need to be analyzed by SEM or TEM, or the 
results from those techniques combined with light microscopy for a 
definitive identification. Identification of a particle as asbestos 
requires that it be asbestiform. Description of particles should follow 
the suggestion of Campbell. (Figure 1)

[[Page 66]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.007

    For the purpose of regulation, the mineral must be one of the six 
minerals covered and must be in the asbestos growth habit. Large 
specimen samples of asbestos generally have the gross appearance of 
wood. Fibers are easily parted from it. Asbestos fibers are very long 
compared with their widths. The fibers have a very high tensile strength 
as demonstrated by bending without breaking. Asbestos fibers exist in 
bundles that are easily parted, show longitudinal fine structure and may 
be tufted at the ends showing ``bundle of sticks'' morphology. In the 
microscope

[[Page 67]]

some of these properties may not be observable. Amphiboles do not always 
show striations along their length even when they are asbestos. Neither 
will they always show tufting. They generally do not show a curved 
nature except for very long fibers. Asbestos and asbestiform minerals 
are usually characterized in groups by extremely high aspect ratios 
(greater than 100:1). While aspect ratio analysis is useful for 
characterizing populations of fibers, it cannot be used to identify 
individual fibers of intermediate to short aspect ratio. Observation of 
many fibers is often necessary to determine whether a sample consists of 
``cleavage fragments'' or of asbestos fibers.
    Most cleavage fragments of the asbestos minerals are easily 
distinguishable from true asbestos fibers. This is because true cleavage 
fragments usually have larger diameters than 1 <greek-m>m. Internal 
structure of particles larger than this usually shows them to have no 
internal fibrillar structure. In addition, cleavage fragments of the 
monoclinic amphiboles show inclined extinction under crossed polars with 
no compensator. Asbestos fibers usually show extinction at zero degrees 
or ambiguous extinction if any at all. Morphologically, the larger 
cleavage fragments are obvious by their blunt or stepped ends showing 
prismatic habit. Also, they tend to be acicular rather than filiform.
    Where the particles are less than 1 <greek-m>m in diameter and have 
an aspect ratio greater than or equal to 3:1, it is recommended that the 
sample be analyzed by SEM or TEM if there is any question whether the 
fibers are cleavage fragments or asbestiform particles.
    Care must be taken when analyzing by electron microscopy because the 
interferences are different from those in light microscopy and may 
structurally be very similar to asbestos. The classic interference is 
between anthophyllite and biopyribole or intermediate fiber. Use the 
same morphological clues for electron microscopy as are used for light 
microscopy, e.g. fibril splitting, internal longitudinal striation, 
fraying, curvature, etc.
    (1) Gross examination:
    Examine the sample, preferably in the glass vial. Determine the 
presence of any obvious fibrous component. Estimate a percentage based 
on previous experience and current observation. Determine whether any 
pre- preparation is necessary. Determine the number of phases present. 
This step may be carried out or augmented by observation at 6 to 40 x  
under a stereo microscope.
    (2) After performing any necessary pre-preparation, prepare slides 
of each phase as described above. Two preparations of the same phase in 
the same index medium can be made side-by-side on the same glass for 
convenience. Examine with the polarizing stereo microscope. Estimate the 
percentage of asbestos based on the amount of birefringent fiber 
present.
    (3) Examine the slides on the phase-polar microscopes at 
magnifications of 160 and 400 x . Note the morphology of the fibers. 
Long, thin, very straight fibers with little curvature are indicative of 
fibers from the amphibole family. Curved, wavy fibers are usually 
indicative of chrysotile. Estimate the percentage of asbestos on the 
phase-polar microscope under conditions of crossed polars and a gypsum 
plate. Fibers smaller than 1.0 <greek-m>m in thickness must be 
identified by inference to the presence of larger, identifiable fibers 
and morphology. If no larger fibers are visible, electron microscopy 
should be performed. At this point, only a tentative identification can 
be made. Full identification must be made with dispersion microscopy. 
Details of the tests are included in the appendices.
    (4) Once fibers have been determined to be present, they must be 
identified. Adjust the microscope for dispersion mode and observe the 
fibers. The microscope has a rotating stage, one polarizing element, and 
a system for generating dark-field dispersion microscopy (see Section 
4.6. of this appendix). Align a fiber with its length parallel to the 
polarizer and note the color of the Becke lines. Rotate the stage to 
bring the fiber length perpendicular to the polarizer and note the 
color. Repeat this process for every fiber or fiber bundle examined. The 
colors must be consistent with the colors generated by standard asbestos 
reference materials for a positive identification. In n=1.550, 
amphiboles will generally show a yellow to straw-yellow color indicating 
that the fiber indices of refraction are higher than the liquid. If 
long, thin fibers are noted and the colors are yellow, prepare further 
slides as above in the suggested matching liquids listed below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Type of asbestos                    Index of refraction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chrysotile..........................  n=1.550.
Amosite.............................  n=1.670 r 1.680.
Crocidolite.........................  n=1.690.
Anthophyllite.......................  n=1.605 nd 1.620.
Tremolite...........................  n=1.605 and 1.620.
Actinolite..........................  n=1.620.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Where more than one liquid is suggested, the first is preferred; 
however, in some cases this liquid will not give good dispersion color. 
Take care to avoid interferences in the other liquid; e.g., wollastonite 
in n=1.620 will give the same colors as tremolite. In n=1.605 
wollastonite will appear yellow in all directions. Wollastonite may be 
determined under crossed polars as it will change from blue to yellow as 
it is rotated along its fiber axis by tapping on the cover slip. 
Asbestos minerals will not change in this way.
    Determination of the angle of extinction may, when present, aid in 
the determination

[[Page 68]]

of anthophyllite from tremolite. True asbestos fibers usually have 
0 deg. extinction or ambiguous extinction, while cleavage fragments have 
more definite extinction.
    Continue analysis until both preparations have been examined and all 
present species of asbestos are identified. If there are no fibers 
present, or there is less than 0.1% present, end the analysis with the 
minimum number of slides (2).
    (5) Some fibers have a coating on them which makes dispersion 
microscopy very difficult or impossible. Becke line analysis or electron 
microscopy may be performed in those cases. Determine the percentage by 
light microscopy. TEM analysis tends to overestimate the actual 
percentage present.
    (6) Percentage determination is an estimate of occluded area, 
tempered by gross observation. Gross observation information is used to 
make sure that the high magnification microscopy does not greatly over- 
or under- estimate the amount of fiber present. This part of the 
analysis requires a great deal of experience. Satisfactory models for 
asbestos content analysis have not yet been developed, although some 
models based on metallurgical grain-size determination have found some 
utility. Estimation is more easily handled in situations where the grain 
sizes visible at about 160 x  are about the same and the sample is 
relatively homogeneous.
    View all of the area under the cover slip to make the percentage 
determination. View the fields while moving the stage, paying attention 
to the clumps of material. These are not usually the best areas to 
perform dispersion microscopy because of the interference from other 
materials. But, they are the areas most likely to represent the accurate 
percentage in the sample. Small amounts of asbestos require slower 
scanning and more frequent analysis of individual fields.
    Report the area occluded by asbestos as the concentration. This 
estimate does not generally take into consideration the difference in 
density of the different species present in the sample. For most samples 
this is adequate. Simulation studies with similar materials must be 
carried out to apply microvisual estimation for that purpose and is 
beyond the scope of this procedure.
    (7) Where successive concentrations have been made by chemical or 
physical means, the amount reported is the percentage of the material in 
the ``as submitted'' or original state. The percentage determined by 
microscopy is multiplied by the fractions remaining after pre-
preparation steps to give the percentage in the original sample. For 
example:

    Step 1. 60% remains after heating at 550  deg.C for 1 h. Step 2. 30% 
of the residue of step 1 remains after dissolution of carbonate in 0.1 m 
HCl.
    Step 3. Microvisual estimation determines that 5% of the sample is 
chrysotile asbestos.

    The reported result is:

    R=(Microvisual result in percent) x (Fraction remaining after step 
2) x (Fraction remaining of original sample after step 1)
    R=(5) x (.30) x (.60)=0.9%

    (8) Report the percent and type of asbestos present. For samples 
where asbestos was identified, but is less than 1.0%, report ``Asbestos 
present, less than 1.0%.'' There must have been at least two observed 
fibers or fiber bundles in the two preparations to be reported as 
present. For samples where asbestos was not seen, report as ``None 
Detected.''

                        4. Auxiliary Information

    Because of the subjective nature of asbestos analysis, certain 
concepts and procedures need to be discussed in more depth. This 
information will help the analyst understand why some of the procedures 
are carried out the way they are.

                               4.1. Light

    Light is electromagnetic energy. It travels from its source in 
packets called quanta. It is instructive to consider light as a plane 
wave. The light has a direction of travel. Perpendicular to this and 
mutually perpendicular to each other, are two vector components. One is 
the magnetic vector and the other is the electric vector. We shall only 
be concerned with the electric vector. In this description, the 
interaction of the vector and the mineral will describe all the 
observable phenomena. From a light source such a microscope illuminator, 
light travels in all different direction from the filament.
    In any given direction away from the filament, the electric vector 
is perpendicular to the direction of travel of a light ray. While 
perpendicular, its orientation is random about the travel axis. If the 
electric vectors from all the light rays were lined up by passing the 
light through a filter that would only let light rays with electric 
vectors oriented in one direction pass, the light would then be 
POLARIZED.
    Polarized light interacts with matter in the direction of the 
electric vector. This is the polarization direction. Using this property 
it is possible to use polarized light to probe different materials and 
identify them by how they interact with light.
    The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant at about 2.99 x 10 \8\ 
m/s. When light travels in different materials such as air, water, 
minerals or oil, it does not travel at this speed. It travels slower. 
This slowing is a function of both the material through which the light 
is traveling and the wavelength or

[[Page 69]]

frequency of the light. In general, the more dense the material, the 
slower the light travels. Also, generally, the higher the frequency, the 
slower the light will travel. The ratio of the speed of light in a 
vacuum to that in a material is called the index of refraction (n). It 
is usually measured at 589 nm (the sodium D line). If white light (light 
containing all the visible wavelengths) travels through a material, rays 
of longer wavelengths will travel faster than those of shorter 
wavelengths, this separation is called dispersion. Dispersion is used as 
an identifier of materials as described in Section 4.6.

                        4.2. Material Properties

    Materials are either amorphous or crystalline. The difference 
between these two descriptions depends on the positions of the atoms in 
them. The atoms in amorphous materials are randomly arranged with no 
long range order. An example of an amorphous material is glass. The 
atoms in crystalline materials, on the other hand, are in regular arrays 
and have long range order. Most of the atoms can be found in highly 
predictable locations. Examples of crystalline material are salt, gold, 
and the asbestos minerals.
    It is beyond the scope of this method to describe the different 
types of crystalline materials that can be found, or the full 
description of the classes into which they can fall. However, some 
general crystallography is provided below to give a foundation to the 
procedures described.
    With the exception of anthophyllite, all the asbestos minerals 
belong to the monoclinic crystal type. The unit cell is the basic 
repeating unit of the crystal and for monoclinic crystals can be 
described as having three unequal sides, two 90 deg. angles and one 
angle not equal to 90 deg.. The orthorhombic group, of which 
anthophyllite is a member has three unequal sides and three 90 deg. 
angles. The unequal sides are a consequence of the complexity of fitting 
the different atoms into the unit cell. Although the atoms are in a 
regular array, that array is not symmetrical in all directions. There is 
long range order in the three major directions of the crystal. However, 
the order is different in each of the three directions. This has the 
effect that the index of refraction is different in each of the three 
directions. Using polarized light, we can investigate the index of 
refraction in each of the directions and identify the mineral or 
material under investigation. The indices <greek-a>, <greek-b>, and 
<greek-g> are used to identify the lowest, middle, and highest index of 
refraction respectively. The x direction, associated with <greek-a> is 
called the fast axis. Conversely, the z direction is associated with 
<greek-g> and is the slow direction. Crocidolite has <greek-a> along the 
fiber length making it ``length-fast''. The remainder of the asbestos 
minerals have the <greek-g> axis along the fiber length. They are called 
``length-slow''. This orientation to fiber length is used to aid in the 
identification of asbestos.

                     4.3. Polarized Light Technique

    Polarized light microscopy as described in this section uses the 
phase-polar microscope described in Section 3.2. A phase contrast 
microscope is fitted with two polarizing elements, one below and one 
above the sample. The polarizers have their polarization directions at 
right angles to each other. Depending on the tests performed, there may 
be a compensator between these two polarizing elements. Light emerging 
from a polarizing element has its electric vector pointing in the 
polarization direction of the element. The light will not be 
subsequently transmitted through a second element set at a right angle 
to the first element. Unless the light is altered as it passes from one 
element to the other, there is no transmission of light.

                        4.4. Angle of Extinction

    Crystals which have different crystal regularity in two or three 
main directions are said to be anisotropic. They have a different index 
of refraction in each of the main directions. When such a crystal is 
inserted between the crossed polars, the field of view is no longer dark 
but shows the crystal in color. The color depends on the properties of 
the crystal. The light acts as if it travels through the crystal along 
the optical axes. If a crystal optical axis were lined up along one of 
the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) the 
light would appear to travel only in that direction, and it would blink 
out or go dark. The difference in degrees between the fiber direction 
and the angle at which it blinks out is called the angle of extinction. 
When this angle can be measured, it is useful in identifying the 
mineral. The procedure for measuring the angle of extinction is to first 
identify the polarization direction in the microscope. A commercial 
alignment slide can be used to establish the polarization directions or 
use anthophyllite or another suitable mineral. This mineral has a zero 
degree angle of extinction and will go dark to extinction as it aligns 
with the polarization directions. When a fiber of anthophyllite has gone 
to extinction, align the eyepiece reticle or graticule with the fiber so 
that there is a visual cue as to the direction of polarization in the 
field of view. Tape or otherwise secure the eyepiece in this position so 
it will not shift.
    After the polarization direction has been identified in the field of 
view, move the particle of interest to the center of the field of view 
and align it with the polarization direction. For fibers, align the 
fiber along this direction. Note the angular reading of the rotating 
stage. Looking at the particle, rotate

[[Page 70]]

the stage until the fiber goes dark or ``blinks out''. Again note the 
reading of the stage. The difference in the first reading and the second 
is an angle of extinction.
    The angle measured may vary as the orientation of the fiber changes 
about its long axis. Tables of mineralogical data usually report the 
maximum angle of extinction. Asbestos forming minerals, when they 
exhibit an angle of extinction, usually do show an angle of extinction 
close to the reported maximum, or as appropriate depending on the 
substitution chemistry.

                  4.5. Crossed Polars with Compensator

    When the optical axes of a crystal are not lined up along one of the 
polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) part of the 
light travels along one axis and part travels along the other visible 
axis. This is characteristic of birefringent materials.
    The color depends on the difference of the two visible indices of 
refraction and the thickness of the crystal. The maximum difference 
available is the difference between the <greek-a> and the <greek-g> 
axes. This maximum difference is usually tabulated as the birefringence 
of the crystal.
    For this test, align the fiber at 45 deg. to the polarization 
directions in order to maximize the contribution to each of the optical 
axes. The colors seen are called retardation colors. They arise from the 
recombination of light which has traveled through the two separate 
directions of the crystal. One of the rays is retarded behind the other 
since the light in that direction travels slower. On recombination, some 
of the colors which make up white light are enhanced by constructive 
interference and some are suppressed by destructive interference. The 
result is a color dependent on the difference between the indices and 
the thickness of the crystal. The proper colors, thicknesses, and 
retardations are shown on a Michel-Levy chart. The three items, 
retardation, thickness and birefringence are related by the following 
relationship:

R=t(n<greek-g>--n<greek-a>)
R=retardation, t=crystal thickness in <greek-m>m, and
n<greek-a>,<greek-g>=indices of refraction.
    Examination of the equation for asbestos minerals reveals that the 
visible colors for almost all common asbestos minerals and fiber sizes 
are shades of gray and black. The eye is relatively poor at 
discriminating different shades of gray. It is very good at 
discriminating different colors. In order to compensate for the low 
retardation, a compensator is added to the light train between the 
polarization elements. The compensator used for this test is a gypsum 
plate of known thickness and birefringence. Such a compensator when 
oriented at 45 deg. to the polarizer direction, provides a retardation 
of 530 nm of the 530 nm wavelength color. This enhances the red color 
and gives the background a characteristic red to red-magenta color. If 
this ``full-wave'' compensator is in place when the asbestos preparation 
is inserted into the light train, the colors seen on the fibers are 
quite different. Gypsum, like asbestos has a fast axis and a slow axis. 
When a fiber is aligned with its fast axis in the same direction as the 
fast axis of the gypsum plate, the ray vibrating in the slow direction 
is retarded by both the asbestos and the gypsum. This results in a 
higher retardation than would be present for either of the two minerals. 
The color seen is a second order blue. When the fiber is rotated 90 deg. 
using the rotating stage, the slow direction of the fiber is now aligned 
with the fast direction of the gypsum and the fast direction of the 
fiber is aligned with the slow direction of the gypsum. Thus, one ray 
vibrates faster in the fast direction of the gypsum, and slower in the 
slow direction of the fiber; the other ray will vibrate slower in the 
slow direction of the gypsum and faster in the fast direction of the 
fiber. In this case, the effect is subtractive and the color seen is a 
first order yellow. As long as the fiber thickness does not add 
appreciably to the color, the same basic colors will be seen for all 
asbestos types except crocidolite. In crocidolite the colors will be 
weaker, may be in the opposite directions, and will be altered by the 
blue absorption color natural to crocidolite. Hundreds of other 
materials will give the same colors as asbestos, and therefore, this 
test is not definitive for asbestos. The test is useful in 
discriminating against fiberglass or other amorphous fibers such as some 
synthetic fibers. Certain synthetic fibers will show retardation colors 
different than asbestos; however, there are some forms of polyethylene 
and aramid which will show morphology and retardation colors similar to 
asbestos minerals. This test must be supplemented with a positive 
identification test when birefringent fibers are present which can not 
be excluded by morphology. This test is relatively ineffective for use 
on fibers less than 1 <greek-m>m in diameter. For positive confirmation 
TEM or SEM should be used if no larger bundles or fibers are visible.

                        4.6. Dispersion Staining

    Dispersion microscopy or dispersion staining is the method of choice 
for the identification of asbestos in bulk materials. Becke line 
analysis is used by some laboratories and yields the same results as 
does dispersion staining for asbestos and can be used in lieu of 
dispersion staining. Dispersion staining is performed on the same 
platform as the phase-polar analysis with the analyzer and compensator 
removed. One polarizing element remains to define the direction of the

[[Page 71]]

light so that the different indices of refraction of the fibers may be 
separately determined. Dispersion microscopy is a dark-field technique 
when used for asbestos. Particles are imaged with scattered light. Light 
which is unscattered is blocked from reaching the eye either by the back 
field image mask in a McCrone objective or a back field image mask in 
the phase condenser. The most convenient method is to use the rotating 
phase condenser to move an oversized phase ring into place. The ideal 
size for this ring is for the central disk to be just larger than the 
objective entry aperture as viewed in the back focal plane. The larger 
the disk, the less scattered light reaches the eye. This will have the 
effect of diminishing the intensity of dispersion color and will shift 
the actual color seen. The colors seen vary even on microscopes from the 
same manufacturer. This is due to the different bands of wavelength 
exclusion by different mask sizes. The mask may either reside in the 
condenser or in the objective back focal plane. It is imperative that 
the analyst determine by experimentation with asbestos standards what 
the appropriate colors should be for each asbestos type. The colors 
depend also on the temperature of the preparation and the exact 
chemistry of the asbestos. Therefore, some slight differences from the 
standards should be allowed. This is not a serious problem for 
commercial asbestos uses. This technique is used for identification of 
the indices of refraction for fibers by recognition of color. There is 
no direct numerical readout of the index of refraction. Correlation of 
color to actual index of refraction is possible by referral to published 
conversion tables. This is not necessary for the analysis of asbestos. 
Recognition of appropriate colors along with the proper morphology are 
deemed sufficient to identify the commercial asbestos minerals. Other 
techniques including SEM, TEM, and XRD may be required to provide 
additional information in order to identify other types of asbestos.
    Make a preparation in the suspected matching high dispersion oil, 
e.g., n=1.550 for chrysotile. Perform the preliminary tests to determine 
whether the fibers are birefringent or not. Take note of the 
morphological character. Wavy fibers are indicative of chrysotile while 
long, straight, thin, frayed fibers are indicative of amphibole 
asbestos. This can aid in the selection of the appropriate matching oil. 
The microscope is set up and the polarization direction is noted as in 
Section 4.4. Align a fiber with the polarization direction. Note the 
color. This is the color parallel to the polarizer. Then rotate the 
fiber rotating the stage 90 deg. so that the polarization direction is 
across the fiber. This is the perpendicular position. Again note the 
color. Both colors must be consistent with standard asbestos minerals in 
the correct direction for a positive identification of asbestos. If only 
one of the colors is correct while the other is not, the identification 
is not positive. If the colors in both directions are bluish-white, the 
analyst has chosen a matching index oil which is higher than the correct 
matching oil, e.g. the analyst has used n=1.620 where chrysotile is 
present. The next lower oil (Section 3.5.) should be used to prepare 
another specimen. If the color in both directions is yellow-white to 
straw-yellow-white, this indicates that the index of the oil is lower 
than the index of the fiber, e.g. the preparation is in n=1.550 while 
anthophyllite is present. Select the next higher oil (Section 3.5.) and 
prepare another slide. Continue in this fashion until a positive 
identification of all asbestos species present has been made or all 
possible asbestos species have been ruled out by negative results in 
this test. Certain plant fibers can have similar dispersion colors as 
asbestos. Take care to note and evaluate the morphology of the fibers or 
remove the plant fibers in pre- preparation. Coating material on the 
fibers such as carbonate or vinyl may destroy the dispersion color. 
Usually, there will be some outcropping of fiber which will show the 
colors sufficient for identification. When this is not the case, treat 
the sample as described in Section 3.3. and then perform dispersion 
staining. Some samples will yield to Becke line analysis if they are 
coated or electron microscopy can be used for identification.

or does, result in massive release of vinyl chloride.
    (6) Fabricated product means a product made wholly or partly from 
polyvinyl chloride, and which does not require further processing at 
temperatures, and for times, sufficient to cause mass melting of the 
polyvinyl chloride resulting in the release of vinyl chloride.
    (7) Hazardous operation means any operation, procedure, or activity 
where a release of either vinyl chloride liquid or gas might be expected 
as a consequence of the operation or because of an accident in the 
operation, which would result in an employee exposure in excess of the 
permissible exposure limit.
    (8) OSHA Area Director means the Director for the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration Area Office having jurisdiction over 
the geographic area in which the employer's establishment is located.
    (9) Polyvinyl chloride means polyvinyl chloride homopolymer or

greater than 5 ppm averaged over any period not exceeding 15 minutes.

[[Page 79]]

    (3) No employee may be exposed to vinyl chloride by direct contact 
with liquid vinyl chloride.
    (d) Monitoring. (1) A program of initial monitoring and measurement 
shall be undertaken in each establishment to determine if there is any 
employee exposed, without regard to the use of respirators, in excess of 
the action level.
    (2) Where a determination conducted under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shows any employee exposures, without regard to the use of 
respirators, in excess of the action level, a program for determining 
exposures for each such employee shall be established. Such a program:
    (i) Shall be repeated at least monthly where any employee is 
exposed, without regard to the use of respirators, in excess of the 
permissible exposure limit.
    (ii) Shall be repeated not less than quarterly where any employee is 
exposed, without regard to the use of respirators, in excess of the 
action level.
    (iii) May be discontinued for any employee only when at least two 
consecutive monitoring determinations, made not less than 5 working days 
apart, show exposures for that employee at or below the action level.
    (3) Whenever there has been a production, process or control change 
which may result in an increase in the release of vinyl chloride, or the 
employer has any other reason to suspect that any employee may be 
exposed in excess of the action level, a determination of employee 
exposure under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be performed.

    (i) Vinyl chloride or polyvinyl chloride is manufactured, reacted, 
repackaged, stored, handled or used; and
    (ii) Vinyl chloride concentrations are in excess of the permissible 
exposure limit.
    (2) Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons.
    (f) Methods of compliance. Employee exposures to vinyl chloride 
shall be controlled to at or below the permissible exposure limit 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section by engineering, work practice, 
and personal protective controls as follows:
    (1) Feasible engineering and work practice controls shall 
immediately be used to reduce exposures to at or below the permissible 
exposure limit.
    (2) Wherever feasible engineering and work practice controls which 
can be instituted immediately are not sufficient to reduce exposures to 
at or below the permissible exposure limit, they shall nonetheless be 
used to reduce exposures to the lowest practicable level, and shall be 
supplemented by respiratory protection in accordance with paragraph (g) 
of this section. A program shall be established and implemented to 
reduce exposures to at or below the permissible exposure limit, or to 
the greatest extent feasible, solely by means of engineering and work 
practice controls, as soon as feasible.
    (3) Written plans for such a program shall be developed and 
furnished upon request for examination and copying to authorized 
representatives of the Assistant Secretary and the Director. Such plans 
shall be updated at least every six months.

[[Page 84]]

    (e) Exposure monitoring--(1) General. (i) Determinations of airborne 
exposure levels shall be made from air samples that are representative 
of each employee's exposure to inorganic arsenic over an eight (8) hour 
period.
    (ii) For the purposes of this section, employee exposure is that 
exposure which would occur if the employee were not using a respirator.
    (iii) The employer shall collect full shift (for at least 7 
continuous hours) personal samples including at least one sample for 
each shift for each job classification in each work area.
    (2) Initial monitoring. Each employer who has a workplace or work 
operation covered by this standard shall monitor each such workplace and 
work operation to accurately determine the airborne concentration of 
inorganic arsenic to which employees may be exposed.
    (3) Frequency. (i) If the initial monitoring reveals employee 
exposure to be below the action level the measurements need not be 
repeated except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section.
    (ii) If the initial monitoring, required by this section, or 
subsequent monitoring reveals employee exposure to be above the 
permissible exposure limit, the employer shall repeat monitoring at 
least quarterly.
    (iii) If the initial monitoring, required by this section, or 
subsequent monitoring reveals employee exposure to be above the action 
level and below the permissible exposure limit the employer shall repeat 
monitoring at least every six months.
    (iv) The employer shall continue monitoring at the required 
frequency until at least two consecutive measurements, taken at least 
seven (7) days apart, are below the action level at which time the 
employer may discontinue monitoring for that employee until such time as 
any of the events in paragraph (e)(4) of this section occur.
    (4) Additional monitoring. Whenever there has been a production, 
process, control or personal change which may result in new or 
additional exposure to inorganic arsenic, or whenever the employer has 
any other reason to suspect a change which may result in new or 
additional exposures to inorganic arsenic, additional monitoring which 
complies with paragraph (e) of this section shall be conducted.
    (5) Employee notification. (i) Within five (5) working days after 
the receipt of monitoring results, the employer shall notify each 
employee in writing of the results which represent that employee's 
exposures.
    (ii) Whenever the results indicate that the representative employee 
exposure exceeds the permissible exposure limit, the employer shall 
include in the written notice a statement that the permissible exposure 
limit was exceeded and a description of the corrective action taken to 
reduce exposure to or below the permissible exposure limit.
    (6) Accuracy of measurement. (i) The employer shall use a method of 
monitoring and measurement which has an accuracy (with a confidence 
level of 95 percent) of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for 
concentrations of inorganic arsenic greater than or equal to 10 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>.
    (ii) The employer shall use a method of monitoring and measurement 
which has an accuracy (with confidence level of 95 percent) of not less 
than plus or minus 35 percent for concentrations of inorganic arsenic 
greater than 5 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>but less than 10 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>.
    (f) Regulated area--(1) Establishment. The employer shall establish 
regulated areas where worker exposures to inorganic arsenic, without 
regard to the use of respirators, are in excess of the permissible 
limit.
    (2) Demarcation. Regulated areas shall be demarcated and segregated 
from the rest of the workplace in any manner that minimizes the number 
of persons who will be exposed to inorganic arsenic.
    (3) Access. Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons or to persons otherwise authorized by the Act or regulations 
issued pursuant thereto to enter such areas.
    (4) Provision of respirators. All persons entering a regulated area 
shall be supplied with a respirator, selected in accordance with 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (5) Prohibited activities. The employer shall assure that in 
regulated areas, food or beverages are not consumed, smoking products, 
chewing tobacco

[[Page 85]]

and gum are not used and cosmetics are not applied, except that these 
activities may be conducted in the lunchrooms, change rooms and showers 
required under paragraph (m) of this section. Drinking water may be 
consumed in the regulated area.
    (g) Methods of compliance--(1) Controls. (i) The employer shall 
institute at the earliest possible time but not later than December 31, 
1979, engineering and work practice controls to reduce exposures to or 
below the permissible exposure limit, except to the extent that the 
employer can establish that such controls are not feasible.
    (ii) Where engineering and work practice controls are not sufficient 
to reduce exposures to or below the permissible exposure limit, they 
shall nonetheless be used to reduce exposures to the lowest levels 
achievable by these controls and shall be supplemented by the use of 
respirators in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section and other 
necessary personal protective equipment. Employee rotation is not 
required as a control strategy before respiratory protection is 
instituted.
    (2) Compliance Program. (i) The employer shall establish and 
implement a written program to reduce exposures to or below the 
permissible exposure limit by means of engineering and work practice 
controls.
    (ii) Written plans for these compliance programs shall include at 
least the following:
    (A) A description of each operation in which inorganic arsenic is 
emitted; e.g. machinery used, material processed, controls in place, 
crew size, operating procedures and maintenance practices;
    (B) Engineering plans and studies used to determine methods selected 
for controlling exposure to inorganic arsenic;
    (C) A report of the technology considered in meeting the permissible 
exposure limit;
    (D) Monitoring data;
    (E) A detailed schedule for implementation of the engineering 
controls and work practices that cannot be implemented immediately and 
for the adaption and implementation of any additional engineering and 
work practices necessary to meet the permissible exposure limit;
    (F) Whenever the employer will not achieve the permissible exposure 
limit with engineering controls and work practices by December 31, 1979, 
the employer shall include in the compliance plan an analysis of the 
effectiveness of the various controls, shall install engineering 
controls and institute work practices on the quickest schedule feasible, 
and shall include in the compliance plan and implement a program to 
minimize the discomfort and maximize the effectiveness of respirator 
use; and
    (G) Other relevant information.
    (iii) Written plans for such a program shall be submitted upon 
request to the Assistant Secretary and the Director, and shall be 
available at the worksite for examination and copying by the Assistant 
Secretary, Director, any affected employee or authorized employee 
representatives.
    (iv) The plans required by this paragraph shall be revised and 
updated at least every 6 months to reflect the current status of the 
program.
    (h) Respiratory protection--(1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering 
or work-practice controls.
    (ii) Work operations, such as maintenance and repair activities, for 
which the employer establishes that engineering and work-practice 
controls are not feasible.
    (iii) Work operations for which engineering and work-practice 
controls are not yet sufficient to reduce employee exposures to or below 
the permissible exposure limit.
    (iv) Emergencies.
    (2) Respirator program. (i) The employer must implement a 
respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b) 
through (d) (except (d)(1)(iii)), and (f) through (m).
    (ii) If an employee exhibits breathing difficulty during fit testing 
or respirator use, they must be examined by a physician trained in 
pulmonary medicine to determine whether they can use

[[Page 86]]

a respirator while performing the required duty.
    (3) Respirator selection. (i) The employer must use Table I of this 
section to select the appropriate respirator or combination of 
respirators for inorganic arsenic compounds without significant vapor 
pressure, and Table II of this section to select the appropriate 
respirator or combination of respirators for inorganic arsenic compounds 
that have significant vapor pressure.
    (ii) When employee exposures exceed the permissible exposure limit 
for inorganic arsenic and also exceed the relevant limit for other gases 
(for example, sulfur dioxide), an air-purifying respirator provided to 
the employee as specified by this section must have a combination high-
efficiency filter with an appropriate gas sorbent. (See footnote in 
Table 1 of this section.)
    (iii) Employees required to use respirators may choose, and the 
employer must provide, a powered air-purifying respirator if it will 
provide proper protection. In addition, the employer must provide a 
combination dust and acid-gas respirator to employees who are exposed to 
gases over the relevant exposure limits.

 Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1018--Inorganic Arsenic Substance Information 
                                  Sheet

                       i. substance identification

    A. Substance. Inorganic Arsenic.
    B. Definition. Copper acetoarsenite, arsenic and all inorganic 
compounds containing arsenic except arsine, measured as arsenic (As).
    C. Permissible Exposure Limit. 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air 
as determined as an average over an 8-hour period. No employee may be 
exposed to any skin or eye contact with arsenic trichloride or to skin 
or eye contact likely to cause skin or eye irritation.
    D. Regulated Areas. Only employees authorized by your employer 
should enter a regulated area.

                         ii. health hazard data

    A. Comments. The health hazard of inorganic arsenic is high.
    B. Ways in which the chemical affects your body. Exposure to 
airborne concentrations of inorganic arsenic may cause lung cancer, and 
can be a skin irritant. Inorganic arsenic may also affect your body if 
swallowed. One compound in particular, arsenic trichloride, is 
especially dangerous because it can be absorbed readily through the 
skin. Because inorganic arsenic is a poison, you should wash your hands 
thoroughly prior to eating or smoking.

                 iii. protective clothing and equipment

    A. Respirators. Respirators will be provided by your employer at no 
cost to you for routine use if your employer is in the process of 
implementing engineering and work practice controls or where engineering 
and work practice controls are not feasible or insufficient. You must 
wear respirators for non-routine activities or in emergency situations 
where you are likely to be exposed to levels of inorganic arsenic in 
excess of the permissible exposure limit. Since how well your respirator 
fits your face is very important, your employer is required to conduct 
fit tests to make sure the respirator seals properly when you wear it. 
These tests are simple and rapid and will be explained to you during 
training sessions.
    B. Protective clothing. If you work in a regulated area, your 
employer is required to provide at no cost to you, and you must wear, 
appropriate, clean, protective clothing and equipment. The purpose of 
this equipment is to prevent you from bringing to your home arsenic-
contaminated dust and to protect your body from repeated skin contact 
with inorganic arsenic likely to cause skin irritation. This clothing 
should include such items as coveralls or similar full-body clothing, 
gloves, shoes or coverlets, and aprons. Protective equipment should 
include face shields or vented goggles, where eye irritation may occur. 
y

                  iv. hygiene facilities and practices

    You must not eat, drink, smoke, chew gum or tobacco, or apply 
cosmetics in the regulated area, except that drinking water is 
permitted. If you work in a regulated area your employer is required to 
provide lunchrooms and other areas for these purposes.
    If you work in a regulated area, your employer is required to 
provide showers, washing facilities, and change rooms. You must wash 
your face, and hands before eating and must shower at the end of the 
work shift. Do not take used protective clothing out of change rooms 
without your employer's permission. Your employer is required to provide 
for laundering or cleaning of your protective clothing.

                           v. signs and labels

    Your employer is required to post warning signs and labels for your 
protection. Signs must be posted in regulated areas. The signs must warn 
that a cancer hazard is present, that only authorized employees may 
enter the area, and that no smoking or eating is allowed, and that 
respirators must be worn.

                        vi. medical examinations

    If your exposure to arsenic is over the Action Level (5 mg/m3)--
(including all persons working in regulated areas) at least 30 days per 
year, or you have been exposed to arsenic

[[Page 93]]

for more than 10 years over the Action Level, your employer is required 
to provide you with a medical examination. The examination shall be 
every 6 months for employees over 45 years old or with more than 10 
years exposure over the Action Level and annually for other covered 
employees. The medical examination must include a medical history; a 
chest x-ray; a skin examination and a nasal examination. The examining 
physician will provide a written opinion to your employer containing the 
results of your medical exams. You should also receive a copy of this 
opinion. The physician must not tell your employer any conditions he 
detects unrelated to occupational exposure to arsenic but must tell you 
those conditions.

                     vii. observation of monitoring

    Your employer is required to monitor your exposure to arsenic and 
you or your representatives are entitled to observe the monitoring 
procedure. You are entitled to receive an explanation of the measurement 
procedure, and to record the results obtained. When the monitoring 
procedure is taking place in an area where respirators or personal 
protective clothing and equipment are required to be worn, you must also 
be provided with and must wear the protective clothing and equipment.

                         viii. access to records

    You or your representative are entitled to records of your exposure 
to inorganic arsenic and your medical examination records if you request 
your employer to provide them.

                      ix. training and notification

    Additional information on all of these items plus training as to 
hazards of exposure to inorganic arsenic and the engineering and work 
practice controls associated with your job will also be provided by your 
employer. If you are exposed over the permissible exposure limit, your 
employer must inform you of that fact and the actions he is taking to 
reduce your exposures.

arsenic trichloride can be most easily collected in a midget bubbler 
filled with 15 ml. of 0.1 N NaOH.
    The method of sampling and analysis should have an accuracy of not 
less than <plus-minus>25 percent (with a confidence limit of 95 percent) 
for 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air (10 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>) 
and <plus-minus>35 percent (with a confidence limit of 95 percent) for 
concentrations of inorganic arsenic between 5 and 10 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>.

      Appendix C to Sec. 1910.1018--Medical Surveillance Guidelines

                               I. General

    Medical examinations are to be provided for all employees exposed to 
levels of inorganic arsenic above the action level (5 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>) for at least 30 days per year (which would include among 
others, all employees, who work in regulated areas). Examinations are 
also to be provided to all employees who have had 10 years or more 
exposure above the action level for more than 30 days per year while 
working for the present or predecessor employer though they may no 
longer be exposed above the level.
    An initial medical examination is to be provided to all such 
employees by December 1, 1978. In addition, an initial medical 
examination is to be provided to all employees who are first assigned to 
areas in which worker exposure will probably exceed 5 <greek-m>g/

[[Page 94]]

m<SUP>3</SUP>(after the effective date of this standard) at the time of 
initial assignment. In addition to its immediate diagnostic usefulness, 
the initial examination will provide a baseline for comparing future 
test results. The initial examination must include as a minimum the 
following elements:
    (1) A work and medical history, including a smoking history, and 
presence and degree of respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness, 
cough, sputum production, and wheezing;
    (2) A 14" by 17" posterior-anterior chest X-ray and an International 
Labor Office UICC/Cincinnati (ILO U/C) rating;
    (3) A nasal and skin examination; and
    (4) Other examinations which the physician believes appropriate 
because of the employee's exposure to inorganic arsenic or because of 
required respirator use.
    Periodic examinations are also to be provided to the employees 
listed above. The periodic examinations shall be given annually for 
those covered employees 45 years of age or less with fewer than 10 years 
employment in areas where employee exposure exceeds the action level (5 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>). Periodic examinations need not include sputum 
cytology and only an updated medical history is required.
    Periodic examinations for other covered employees, shall be provided 
every six (6) months. These examinations shall include all tests 
required in the initial examination, except that the medical history 
need only be updated.
    The examination contents are minimum requirements. Additional tests 
such as lateral and oblique X-rays or pulmonary function tests may be 
useful. For workers exposed to three arsenicals which are associated 
with lymphatic cancer, copper acetoarsenite, potassium arsenite, or 
sodium arsenite the examination should also include palpation of 
superficial lymph nodes and complete blood count.

                       ii. noncarcinogenic effects

    The OSHA standard is based on minimizing risk of exposed workers 
dying of lung cancer from exposure to inorganic arsenic. It will also 
minimize skin cancer from such exposures.
    The following three sections quoted from ``Occupational Diseases: A 
Guide to Their Recognition'', Revised Edition, June 1977, National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is included to provide 
information on the nonneoplastic effects of exposure to inorganic 
arsenic. Such effects should not occur if the OSHA standards are 
followed.
    A. Local-- Trivalent arsenic compounds are corrosive to the skin. 
Brief contact has no effect but prolonged contact results in a local 
hyperemia and later vesicular or pustular eruption. The moist mucous 
membranes are most sensitive to the irritant action. Conjunctiva, moist 
and macerated areas of skin, the eyelids, the angles of the ears, nose, 
mouth, and respiratory mucosa are also vulnerable to the irritant 
effects. The wrists are common sites of dermatitis, as are the genitalia 
if personal hygiene is poor. Perforations of the nasal septum may occur. 
Arsenic trioxide and pentoxide are capable of producing skin 
sensitization and contact dermatitis. Arsenic is also capable of 
producing keratoses, especially of the palms and soles.
    B. Systemic-- The acute toxic effects of arsenic are generally seen 
following ingestion of inorganic arsenical compounds. This rarely occurs 
in an industrial setting. Symptoms develop within \1/2\ to 4 hours 
following ingestion and are usually characterized by constriction of the 
throat followed by dysphagia, epigastric pain, vomiting, and watery 
diarrhea. Blood may appear in vomitus and stools. If the amount ingested 
is sufficiently high, shock may develop due to severe fluid loss, and 
death may ensue in 24 hours. If the acute effects are survived, 
exfoliative dermatitis and peripheral neuritis may develop.
    Cases of acute arsenical poisoning due to inhalation are exceedingly 
rare in industry. When it does occur, respiratory tract symptoms--cough, 
chest pain, dyspnea--giddiness, headache, and extreme general weakness 
precede gastrointestinal symptoms. The acute toxic symptoms of trivalent 
arsenical poisoning are due to severe inflammation of the mucous 
membranes and greatly increased permeability of the blood capillaries.
    Chronic arsenical poisoning due to ingestion is rare and generally 
confined to patients taking prescribed medications. However, it can be a 
concomitant of inhaled inorganic arsenic from swallowed sputum and 
improper eating habits. Symptoms are weight loss, nausea and diarrhea 
alternating with constipation, pigmentation and eruption of the skin, 
loss of hair, and peripheral neuritis. Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis 
have been described. Polyneuritis may be the salient feature, but more 
frequently there are numbness and parasthenias of ``glove and stocking'' 
distribution. The skin lesions are usually melanotic and keratotic and 
may occasionally take the form of an intradermal cancer of the squamous 
cell type, but without infiltrative properties. Horizontal white lines 
(striations) on the fingernails and toenails are commonly seen in 
chronic arsenical poisoning and are considered to be a diagnostic 
accompaniment of arsenical polyneuritis.
    Inhalation of inorganic arsenic compounds is the most common cause 
of chronic poisoning in the industrial situation. This condition is 
divided into three phases based on signs and symptoms.

[[Page 95]]

    First Phase: The worker complains of weakness, loss of appetite, 
some nausea, occasional vomiting, a sense of heaviness in the stomach, 
and some diarrhea.
    Second Phase: The worker complains of conjunctivitis, a catarrhal 
state of the mucous membranes of the nose, larynx, and respiratory 
passage. Coryza, hoarseness, and mild tracheobronchitis may occur. 
Perforation of the nasal septum is common, and is probably the most 
typical lesion of the upper respiratory tract in occupational exposure 
to arsenical dust. Skin lesions, eczematoid and allergic in type, are 
common.
    Third Phase: The worker complains of symptoms of peripheral 
neuritis, initially of hands and feet, which is essentially sensory. In 
more severe cases, motor paralyses occur; the first muscles affected are 
usually the toe extensors and the peronei. In only the most severe cases 
will paralysis of flexor muscles of the feet or of the extensor muscles 
of hands occur.
    Liver damage from chronic arsenical poisoning is still debated, and 
as yet the question is unanswered. In cases of chronic and acute 
arsenical poisoning, toxic effects to the myocardium have been reported 
based on EKG changes. These findings, however, are now largely 
discounted and the EKG changes are ascribed to electrolyte disturbances 
concomitant with arsenicalism. Inhalation of arsenic trioxide and other 
inorganic arsenical dusts does not give rise to radiological evidence or 
pneumoconiosis. Arsenic does have a depressant effect upon the bone 
marrow, with disturbances of both erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis.

Sec. 1910.1020  Access to employee exposure and medical records.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide employees and 
their designated representatives a right of access to relevant exposure 
and medical records; and to provide representatives of the Assistant 
Secretary a right of access to these records in order to fulfill 
responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Access by 
employees, their representatives, and the Assistant Secretary is 
necessary to yield both direct and indirect improvements in the 
detection, treatment, and prevention of occupational disease. Each 
employer is responsible for assuring compliance with this section, but 
the activities involved in complying with the access to medical records 
provisions can be carried out, on behalf of the employer, by the 
physician or other health care personnel in charge of employee medical 
records. Except as expressly provided, nothing in this section is 
intended to affect existing legal and ethical obligations concerning the 
maintenance and confidentiality of employee medical information, the 
duty to disclose information to a patient/employee or any other aspect 
of the medical-care relationship, or affect existing legal obligations 
concerning the protection of trade secret information.
    (b) Scope and application. (1) This section applies to each general 
industry, maritime, and construction employer who makes, maintains, 
contracts for, or has access to employee exposure or medical records, or 
analyses thereof, pertaining to employees exposed to toxic substances or 
harmful physical agents.

[[Page 96]]

    (2) This section applies to all employee exposure and medical 
records, and analyses thereof, of such employees, whether or not the 
records are mandated by specific occupational safety and health 
standards.
    (3) This section applies to all employee exposure and medical 
records, and analyses thereof, made or maintained in any manner, 
including on an in-house of contractual (e.g., fee-for-service) basis. 
Each employer shall assure that the preservation and access requirements 
of this section are complied with regardless of the manner in which the 
records are made or maintained.
    (c) Definitions. (1) Access means the right and opportunity to 
examine and copy.
    (2) Analysis using exposure or medical records means any compilation 
of data or any statistical study based at least in part on information 
collected from individual employee exposure or medical records or 
information collected from health insurance claims records, provided 
that either the analysis has been reported to the employer or no further 
work is currently being done by the person responsible for preparing the 
analysis.
    (3) Designated representative means any individual or organization 
to whom an employee gives written authorization to exercise a right of 
access. For the purposes of access to employee exposure records and 
analyses using exposure or medical records, a recognized or certified 
collective bargaining agent shall be treated automatically as a 
designated representative without regard to written employee 
authorization.
    (4) Employee means a current employee, a former employee, or an 
employee being assigned or transferred to work where there will be 
exposure to toxic substances or harmful physical agents. In the case of 
a deceased or legally incapacitated employee, the employee's legal 
representative may directly exercise all the employee's rights under 
this section.
    (5) Employee exposure record means a record containing any of the 
following kinds of information:
    (i) Environmental (workplace) monitoring or measuring of a toxic 
substance or harmful physical agent, including personal, area, grab, 
wipe, or other form of sampling, as well as related collection and 
analytical methodologies, calculations, and other background data 
relevant to interpretation of the results obtained;
    (ii) Biological monitoring results which directly assess the 
absorption of a toxic substance or harmful physical agent by body 
systems (e.g., the level of a chemical in the blood, urine, breath, 
hair, fingernails, etc) but not including results which assess the 
biological effect of a substance or agent or which assess an employee's 
use of alcohol or drugs;
    (iii) Material safety data sheets indicating that the material may 
pose a hazard to human health; or
    (iv) In the absence of the above, a chemcial inventory or any other 
record which reveals where and when used and the identity (e.g., 
chemical, common, or trade name) of a toxic substance or harmful 
physical agent.
    (6)(i) Employee medical record means a record concerning the health 
status of an employee which is made or maintained by a physician, nurse, 
or other health care personnel or technician, including:
    (A) Medical and employment questionnaires or histories (including 
job description and occupational exposures),
    (B) The results of medical examinations (pre-employment, pre-
assignment, periodic, or episodic) and laboratory tests (including chest 
and other X-ray examinations taken for the purposes of establishing a 
base-line or detecting occupational illness, and all biological 
monitoring not defined as an ``employee exposure record''),
    (C) Medical opinions, diagnoses, progress notes, and 
recommendations,
    (D) First aid records,
    (E) Descriptions of treatments and prescriptions, and
    (F) Employee medical complaints.
    (ii) ``Employee medical record'' does not include medical 
information in the form of:
    (A) Physical specimens (e.g., blood or urine samples) which are 
routinely discarded as a part of normal medical practice; or

[[Page 97]]

    (B) Records concerning health insurance claims if maintained 
separately from the employer's medical program and its records, and not 
accessible to the employer by employee name or other direct personal 
identifier (e.g., social security number, payroll number, etc.); or
    (C) Records created solely in preparation for litigation which are 
privileged from discovery under the applicable rules of procedure or 
evidence; or
    (D) Records concerning voluntary employee assistance programs 
(alcohol, drug abuse, or personal counseling programs) if maintained 
separately from the employer's medical program and its records.
    (7) Employer means a current employer, a former employer, or a 
successor employer.
    (8) Exposure or exposed means that an employee is subjected to a 
toxic substance or harmful physical agent in the course of employment 
through any route of entry (inhalation, ingestion, skin contact or 
absorption, etc.), and includes past exposure and potential (e.g., 
accidental or possible) exposure, but does not include situations where 
the employer can demonstrate that the toxic substance or harmful 
physical agent is not used, handled, stored, generated, or present in 
the workplace in any manner different from typical non-occupational 
situations.
    (9) Health Professional means a physician, occupational health 
nurse, industrial hygienist, toxicologist, or epidemiologist, providing 
medical or other occupational health services to exposed employees.
    (10) Record means any item, collection, or grouping of information 
regardless of the form or process by which it is maintained (e.g., paper 
document, microfiche, microfilm, X-ray film, or automated data 
processing).
    (11) Specific chemical identity means the chemical name, Chemical 
Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number, or any other information that 
reveals the precise chemical designation of the substance.
    (12)(i) Specific written consent means a written authorization 
containing the following:
    (A) The name and signature of the employee authorizing the release 
of medical information,
    (B) The date of the written authorization,
    (C) The name of the individual or organization that is authorized to 
release the medical information,
    (D) The name of the designated representative (individual or 
organization) that is authorized to receive the released information,

medical information, and
    (G) A date or condition upon which the written authorization will 
expire (if less than one year).
    (ii) A written authorization does not operate to authorize the 
release of medical information not in existence on the date of written 
authorization, unless the release of future information is expressly 
authorized, and does not operate for more than one year from the date of 
written authorization.
    (iii) A written authorization may be revoked in writing 
prospectively at any time.
    (13) Toxic substance or harmful physical agent means any chemical 
substance, biological agent (bacteria, virus, fungus, etc.), or physical 
stress (noise, heat, cold, vibration, repetitive motion, ionizing and 
non-ionizing radiation, hypo-or hyperbaric pressure, etc.) which:
    (i) Is listed in the latest printed edition of the National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Registry of Toxic 
Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS), which is incorporated by 
reference as specified in Sec. 1910.6; or
    (ii) Has yielded positive evidence of an acute or chronic health 
hazard in testing conducted by, or known to, the employer; or
    (iii) Is the subject of a material safety data sheet kept by or 
known to the employer indicating that the material may pose a hazard to 
human health.
    (14) Trade secret means any confidential formula, pattern, process, 
device, or information or compilation of information that is used in an 
employer's

[[Page 98]]

business and that gives the employer an opportunity to obtain an 
advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.
    (d) Preservation of records. (1) Unless a specific occupational 
safety and health standard provides a different period of time, each 
employer shall assure the preservation and retention of records as 
follows:
    (i) Employee medical records. The medical record for each employee 
shall be preserved and maintained for at least the duration of 
employment plus thirty (30) years, except that the following types of 
records need not be retained for any specified period:
    (A) Health insurance claims records maintained separately from the 
employer's medical program and its records,
    (B) First aid records (not including medical histories) of one-time 
treatment and subsequent observation of minor scratches, cuts, burns, 
splinters, and the like which do not involve medical treatment, loss of 
consciousness, restriction of work or motion, or transfer to another 
job, if made on-site by a non-physician and if maintained separately 
from the employer's medical program and its records, and
    (C) The medical records of employees who have worked for less than 
(1) year for the employer need not be retained beyond the term of 
employment if they are provided to the employee upon the termination of 
employment.
    (ii) Employee exposure records. Each employee exposure record shall 
be preserved and maintained for at least thirty (30) years, except that:
    (A) Background data to environmental (workplace) monitoring or 
measuring, such as laboratory reports and worksheets, need only be 
retained for one (1) year as long as the sampling results, the 
collection methodology (sampling plan), a description of the analytical 
and mathematical methods used, and a summary of other background data 
relevant to interpretation of the results obtained, are retained for at 
least thirty (30) years; and
    (B) Material safety data sheets and paragraph (c)(5)(iv) records 
concerning the identity of a substance or agent need not be retained for 
any specified period as long as some record of the identity (chemical 
name if known) of the substance or agent, where it was used, and when it 
was used is retained for at least thirty (30) years;\1\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Material safety data sheets must be kept for those chemicals 
currently in use that are effected by the Hazard Communication Standard 
in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) Biological monitoring results designated as exposure records by 
specific occupational safety and health standards shall be preserved and 
maintained as required by the specific standard.
    (iii) Analyses using exposure or medical records. Each analysis 
using exposure or medial records shall be preserved and maintained for 
at least thirty (30) years.
    (2) Nothing in this section is intended to mandate the form, manner, 
or process by which an employer preserves a record as long as the 
information contained in the record is preserved and retrievable, except 
that chest X-ray films shall be preserved in their original state.
    (e) Access to records--(1) General. (i) Whenever an employee or 
designated representative requests access to a record, the employer 
shall assure that access is provided in a reasonable time, place, and 
manner. If the employer cannot reasonably provide access to the record 
within fifteen (15) working days, the employer shall within the fifteen 
(15) working days apprise the employee or designated representative 
requesting the record of the reason for the delay and the earliest date 
when the record can be made available.
    (ii) The employer may require of the requester only such information 
as should be readily known to the requester and which may be necessary 
to locate or identify the records being requested (e.g. dates and 
locations where the employee worked during the time period in question).
    (iii) Whenever an employee or designated representative requests a 
copy of a record, the employer shall assure that either:
    (A) A copy of the record is provided without cost to the employee or 
representative,
    (B) The necessary mechanical copying facilities (e.g., photocopying) 
are

[[Page 99]]

made available without cost to the employee or representative for 
copying the record, or
    (C) The record is loaned to the employee or representative for a 
reasonable time to enable a copy to be made.
    (iv) In the case of an original X-ray, the employer may restrict 
access to on-site examination or make other suitable arrangements for 
the temporary loan of the X-ray.
    (v) Whenever a record has been previously provided without cost to 
an employee or designated representative, the employer may charge 
reasonable, non-discriminatory administrative costs (i.e., search and 
copying expenses but not including overhead expenses) for a request by 
the employee or designated representative for additional copies of the 
record, except that
    (A) An employer shall not charge for an initial request for a copy 
of new information that has been added to a record which was previously 
provided; and
    (B) An employer shall not charge for an initial request by a 
recognized or certified collective bargaining agent for a copy of an 
employee exposure record or an analysis using exposure or medical 
records.
    (vi) Nothing in this section is intended to preclude employees and 
collective bargaining agents from collectively bargaining to obtain 
access to information in addition to that available under this section.
    (2) Employee and designated representative access--(i) Employee 
exposure records. (A) Except as limited by paragraph (f) of this 
section, each employer shall, upon request, assure the access to each 
employee and designated representative to employee exposure records 
relevant to the employee. For the purpose of this section, an exposure 
record relevant to the employee consists of:
    (1) A record which measures or monitors the amount of a toxic 
substance or harmful physical agent to which the employee is or has been 
exposed;
    (2) In the absence of such directly relevant records, such records 
of other employees with past or present job duties or working conditions 
related to or similar to those of the employee to the extent necessary 
to reasonably indicate the amount and nature of the toxic substances or 
harmful physical agents to which the employee is or has been subjected, 
and
    (3) Exposure records to the extent necessary to reasonably indicate 
the amount and nature of the toxic substances or harmful physical agents 
at workplaces or under working conditions to which the employee is being 
assigned or transferred.
    (B) Requests by designated representatives for unconsented access to 
employee exposure records shall be in writing and shall specify with 
reasonable particularity:
    (1) The records requested to be disclosed; and
    (2) The occupational health need for gaining access to these 
records.
    (ii) Employee medical records. (A) Each employer shall, upon 
request, assure the access of each employee to employee medical records 
of which the employee is the subject, except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.
    (B) Each employer shall, upon request, assure the access of each 
designated representative to the employee medical records of any 
employee who has given the designated representative specific written 
consent. Appendix A to this section contains a sample form which may be 
used to establish specific written consent for access to employee 
medical records.
    (C) Whenever access to employee medical records is requested, a 
physician representing the employer may recommend that the employee or 
designated representative:
    (1) Consult with the physician for the purposes of reviewing and 
discussing the records requested,
    (2) Accept a summary of material facts and opinions in lieu of the 
records requested, or
    (3) Accept release of the requested records only to a physician or 
other designated representative.
    (D) Whenever an employee requests access to his or her employee 
medical records, and a physician representing the employer believes that 
direct employee access to information contained in the records regarding 
a specific diagnosis of a terminal illness or a psychiatric condition 
could be detrimental

[[Page 100]]

to the employee's health, the employer may inform the employee that 
access will only be provided to a designated representative of the 
employee having specific written consent, and deny the employee's 
request for direct access to this information only. Where a designated 
representative with specific written consent requests access to 
information so withheld, the employer shall assure the access of the 
designated representative to this information, even when it is known 
that the designated representative will give the information to the 
employee.
    (E) A physician, nurse, or other responsible health care personnel 
maintaining medical records may delete from requested medical records 
the identity of a family member, personal friend, or fellow employee who 
has provided confidential information concerning an employee's health 
status.
    (iii) Analyses using exposure or medical records. (A) Each employee 
shall, upon request, assure the access of each employee and designated 
representative to each analysis using exposure or medical records 
concerning the employee's working conditions or workplace.
    (B) Whenever access is requested to an analysis which reports the 
contents of employee medical records by either direct identifier (name, 
address, social security number, payroll number, etc.) or by information 
which could reasonably be used under the circumstances indirectly to 
identify specific employees (exact age, height, weight, race, sex, date 
of initial employment, job title, etc.), the employer shall assure that 
personal identifiers are removed before access is provided. If the 
employer can demonstrate that removal of personal identifiers from an 
analysis is not feasible, access to the personally identifiable portions 
of the analysis need not be provided.
    (3) OSHA access. (i) Each employer shall, upon request, and without 
derogation of any rights under the Constitution or the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. 651 et seq., that the employer 
chooses to exercise, assure the prompt access of representatives of the 
Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health to 
employee exposure and medical records and to analyses using exposure or 
medical records. Rules of agency practice and procedure governing OSHA 
access to employee medical records are contained in 29 CFR 1913.10.
    (ii) Whenever OSHA seeks access to personally identifiable employee 
medical information by presenting to the employer a written access order 
pursuant to 29 CFR 1913.10(d), the employer shall prominently post a 
copy of the written access order and its accompanying cover letter for 
at least fifteen (15) working days.
    (f) Trade secrets. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section, nothing in this section precludes an employer from 
deleting from records requested by a health professional, employee, or 
designated representative any trade secret data which discloses 
manufacturing processes, or discloses the percentage of a chemical 
substance in mixture, as long as the health professional, employee, or 
designated representative is notified that information has been deleted. 
Whenever deletion of trade secret information substantially impairs 
evaluation of the place where or the time when exposure to a toxic 
substance or harmful physical agent occurred, the employer shall provide 
alternative information which is sufficient to permit the requesting 
party to identify where and when exposure occurred.
    (2) The employer may withhold the specific chemical identity, 
including the chemical name and other specific identification of a toxic 
substance from a disclosable record provided that:
    (i) The claim that the information withheld is a trade secret can be 
supported;
    (ii) All other available information on the properties and effects 
of the toxic substance is disclosed;
    (iii) The employer informs the requesting party that the specific 
chemical identity is being withheld as a trade secret; and
    (iv) The specific chemical identity is made available to health 
professionals, employees and designated representatives in accordance 
with the specific applicable provisions of this paragraph.
    (3) Where a treating physician or nurse determines that a medical 
emergency exists and the specific chemical

[[Page 101]]

identity of a toxic substance is necessary for emergency or first-aid 
treatment, the employer shall immediately disclose the specific chemical 
identity of a trade secret chemical to the treating physician or nurse, 
regardless of the existence of a written statement of need or a 
confidentiality agreement. The employer may require a written statement 
of need and confidentiality agreement, in accordance with the provisions 
of paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5), as soon as circumstances permit.
    (4) In non-emergency situations, an employer shall, upon request, 
disclose a specific chemical identity, otherwise permitted to be 
withheld under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, to a health 
professional, employee, or designated representative if:
    (i) The request is in writing;
    (ii) The request describes with reasonable detail one or more of the 
following occupational health needs for the information:
    (A) To assess the hazards of the chemicals to which employees will 
be exposed;
    (B) To conduct or assess sampling of the workplace atmosphere to 
determine employee exposure levels;
    (C) To conduct pre-assignment or periodic medical surveillance of 
exposed employees;
    (D) To provide medical treatment to exposed employees;
    (E) To select or assess appropriate personal protective equipment 
for exposed employees;
    (F) To design or assess engineering controls or other protective 
measures for exposed employees; and
    (G) To conduct studies to determine the health effects of exposure.
    (iii) The request explains in detail why the disclosure of the 
specific chemical identity is essential and that, in lieu thereof, the 
disclosure of the following information would not enable the health 
professional, employee or designated representative to provide the 
occupational health services described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this 
section:
    (A) The properties and effects of the chemical;
    (B) Measures for controlling workers' exposure to the chemical;
    (C) Methods of monitoring and analyzing worker exposure to the 
chemical; and,
    (D) Methods of diagnosing and treating harmful exposures to the 
chemical;
    (iv) The request includes a description of the procedures to be used 
to maintain the confidentiality of the disclosed information; and,
    (v) The health professional, employee, or designated representative 
and the employer or contractor of the services of the health 
professional or designated representative agree in a written 
confidentiality agreement that the health professional, employee or 
designated representative will not use the trade secret information for 
any purpose other than the health need(s) asserted and agree not to 
release the information under any circumstances other than to OSHA, as 
provided in paragraph (f)(9) of this section, except as authorized by 
the terms of the agreement or by the employer.
    (5) The confidentiality agreement authorized by paragraph (f)(4)(iv) 
of this section:
    (i) May restrict the use of the information to the health purposes 
indicated in the written statement of need;
    (ii) May provide for appropriate legal remedies in the event of a 
breach of the agreement, including stipulation of a reasonable pre-
estimate of likely damages; and,
    (iii) May not include requirements for the posting of a penalty 
bond.
    (6) Nothing in this section is meant to preclude the parties from 
pursuing non-contractual remedies to the extent permitted by law.
    (7) If the health professional, employee or designated 
representative receiving the trade secret information decides that there 
is a need to disclose it to OSHA, the employer who provided the 
information shall be informed by the health professional prior to, or at 
the same time as, such disclosure.
    (8) If the employer denies a written request for disclosure of a 
specific chemical identity, the denial must:
    (i) Be provided to the health professional, employee or designated 
representative within thirty days of the request;
    (ii) Be in writing;

[[Page 102]]

    (iii) Include evidence to support the claim that the specific 
chemical identity is a trade secret;
    (iv) State the specific reasons why the request is being denied; 
and,
    (v) Explain in detail how alternative information may satisfy the 
specific medical or occupational health need without revealing the 
specific chemical identity.
    (9) The health professional, employee, or designated representative 
whose request for information is denied under paragraph (f)(4) of this 
section may refer the request and the written denial of the request to 
OSHA for consideration.
    (10) When a heath professional employee, or designated 
representative refers a denial to OSHA under paragraph (f)(9) of this 
section, OSHA shall consider the evidence to determine if:
    (i) The employer has supported the claim that the specific chemical 
identity is a trade secret;
    (ii) The health professional employee, or designated representative 
has supported the claim that there is a medical or occupational health 
need for the information; and
    (iii) The health professional, employee or designated representative 
has demonstrated adequate means to protect the confidentiality.
    (11)(i) If OSHA determines that the specific chemical identity 
requested under paragraph (f)(4) of this section is not a bona fide 
trade secret, or that it is a trade secret but the requesting health 
professional, employee or designated representatives has a legitimate 
medical or occupational health need for the information, has executed a 
written confidentiality agreement, and has shown adequate means for 
complying with the terms of such agreement, the employer will be subject 
to citation by OSHA.
    (ii) If an employer demonstrates to OSHA that the execution of a 
confidentiality agreement would not provide sufficient protection 
against the potential harm from the unauthorized disclosure of a trade 
secret specific chemical identity, the Assistant Secretary may issue 
such orders or impose such additional limitations or conditions upon the 
disclosure of the requested chemical information as may be appropriate 
to assure that the occupational health needs are met without an undue 
risk of harm to the employer.
    (12) Notwithstanding the existence of a trade secret claim, an 
employer shall, upon request, disclose to the Assistant Secretary any 
information which this section requires the employer to make available. 
Where there is a trade secret claim, such claim shall be made no later 
than at the time the information is provided to the Assistant Secretary 
so that suitable determinations of trade secret status can be made and 
the necessary protections can be implemented.
    (13) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the 
disclosure under any circumstances of process or percentage of mixture 
information which is trade secret.
    (g) Employee information. (1) Upon an employee's first entering into 
employment, and at least annually thereafter, each employer shall inform 
current employees covered by this section of the following:
    (i) The existence, location, and availability of any records covered 
by this section;
    (ii) The person responsible for maintaining and providing access to 
records; and
    (iii) Each employee's rights of access to these records.
    (2) Each employer shall keep a copy of this section and its 
appendices, and make copies readily available, upon request, to 
employees. The employer shall also distribute to current employees any 
informational materials concerning this section which are made available

  Appendix B to Sec. 1910.20--Availability of NIOSH Registry of Toxic 
         Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS) (Non-Mandatory)

    The final regulation, 29 CFR 1910.20, applies to all employee 
exposure and medical records, and analyses thereof, of employees exposed 
to toxic substances or harmful physical agents (paragraph (b)(2)). The 
term toxic substance or harmful physical agent is defined by paragraph 
(c)(13) to encompass chemical substances, biological agents, and 
physical stresses for which there is evidence of harmful health effects. 
The regulation uses the latest printed edition of the National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Registry of Toxic Effects of 
Chemical Substances (RTECS) as one of the chief sources of information 
as to whether evidence of harmful health effects exists. If a substance 
is listed in the latest printed RTECS, the regulation applies to 
exposure and medical records (and analyses of these records) relevant to 
employees exposed to the substance.
    It is appropriate to note that the final regulation does not require 
that employers purchase a copy of RTECS, and many employers need not 
consult RTECS to ascertain whether their employee exposure or medical 
records are subject to the rule. Employers who do not currently have the 
latest printed edition of the NIOSH RTECS, however, may desire to obtain 
a copy. The RTECS is issued in an annual printed edition as mandated by 
section 20(a)(6) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 
669(a)(6)).
    The Introduction to the 1980 printed edition describes the RTECS as 
follows:
    ``The 1980 edition of the Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical 
Substances, formerly known as the Toxic Substances list, is the ninth 
revision prepared in compliance with the requirements of Section 
20(a)(6) of the

[[Page 104]]

Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-596). The 
original list was completed on June 28, 1971, and has been updated 
annually in book format. Beginning in October 1977, quarterly revisions 
have been provided in microfiche. This edition of the Registry contains 
168,096 listings of chemical substances: 45,156 are names of different 
chemicals with their associated toxicity data and 122,940 are synonyms. 
This edition includes approximately 5,900 new chemical compounds that 
did not appear in the 1979 Registry. (p. xi)
    ``The Registry's purposes are many, and it serves a variety of 
users. It is a single source document for basic toxicity information and 
for other data, such as chemical identifiers ad information necessary 
for the preparation of safety directives and hazard evaluations for 
chemical substances. The various types of toxic effects linked to 
literature citations provide researchers and occupational health 
scientists with an introduction to the toxicological literature, making 
their own review of the toxic hazards of a given substance easier. By 
presenting data on the lowest reported doses that produce effects by 
several routes of entry in various species, the Registry furnishes 
valuable information to those responsible for preparing safety data 
sheets for chemical substances in the workplace. Chemical and production 
engineers can use the Registry to identify the hazards which may be 
associated with chemical intermediates in the development of final 
products, and thus can more readily select substitutes or alternative 
processes which may be less hazardous. Some organizations, including 
health agencies and chemical companies, have included the NIOSH Registry 
accession numbers with the listing of chemicals in their files to 
reference toxicity information associated with those chemicals. By 
including foreign language chemical names, a start has been made toward 
providing rapid identification of substances produced in other 
countries. (p. xi)
    ``In this edition of the Registry, the editors intend to identify 
``all known toxic substances'' which may exist in the environment and to 
provide pertinent data on the toxic effects from known doses entering an 
organism by any route described. (p xi)
    ``It must be reemphasized that the entry of a substance in the 
Registry does not automatically mean that it must be avoided. A listing 
does mean, however, that the substance has the documented potential of 
being harmful if misused, and care must be exercised to prevent tragic 
consequences. Thus, the Registry lists many substances that are common 
in everyday life and are in nearly every household in the United States. 
One can name a variety of such dangerous substances: prescription and 
non-prescription drugs; food additives; pesticide concentrates, sprays, 
and dusts; fungicides; herbicides; paints; glazes, dyes; bleaches and 
other household cleaning agents; alkalies; and various solvents and 
diluents. The list is extensive because chemicals have become an 
integral part of our existence.''
    The RTECS printed edition may be purchased from the Superintendent 
of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), Washington, DC 
20402 (202-783-3238).
    Some employers may desire to subscribe to the quarterly update to 
the RTECS which is published in a microfiche edition. An annual 
subscription to the quarterly microfiche may be purchased from the GPO 
(Order the ``Microfiche Edition, Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical 
Substances''). Both the printed edition and the microfiche edition of 
RTECS are available for review at many university and public libraries 
throughout the country. The latest RTECS editions may also be examined 
at the OSHA Technical Data Center, Room N2439--Rear, United States

<R05>
Sec. 1910.1025  Lead.

    (a) Scope and application. (1) This section applies to all 
occupational exposure to lead, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2).
    (2) This section does not apply to the construction industry or to 
agricultural operations covered by 29 CFR Part 1928.
    (b) Definitions. Action level means employee exposure, without 
regard to the use of respirators, to an airborne concentration of lead 
of 30 micrograms per cubic meter of air (30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>) 
averaged over an 8-hour period.
    Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee.
    Director means the Director, National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH), U.S. Department of Health, Education, and 
Welfare, or designee.
    Lead means metallic lead, all inorganic lead compounds, and organic 
lead soaps. Excluded from this definition are all other organic lead 
compounds.

[[Page 105]]

    (c) Permissible exposure limit (PEL). (1) The employer shall assure 
that no employee is exposed to lead at concentrations greater than fifty 
micrograms per cubic meter of air (50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>) averaged 
over an 8-hour period.
    (2) If an employee is exposed to lead for more than 8 hours in any 
work day, the permissible exposure limit, as a time weighted average 
(TWA) for that day, shall be reduced according to the following formula:

Maximum permissible limit (in <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>)=400<divide>hours 
                           worked in the day.

    (3) When respirators are used to supplement engineering and work 
practice controls to comply with the PEL and all the requirements of 
paragraph (f) have been met, employee exposure, for the purpose of 
determining whether the employer has complied with the PEL, may be 
considered to be at the level provided by the protection factor of the 
respirator for those periods the respirator is worn. Those periods may 
be averaged with exposure levels during periods when respirators are not 
worn to determine the employee's daily TWA exposure.
    (d) Exposure monitoring--(1) General. (i) For the purposes of 
paragraph (d), employee exposure is that exposure which would occur if 
the employee were not using a respirator.
    (ii) With the exception of monitoring under paragraph (d)(3), the 
employer shall collect full shift (for at least 7 continuous hours) 
personal samples including at least one sample for each shift for each 
job classification in each work area.
    (iii) Full shift personal samples shall be representative of the 
monitored employee's regular, daily exposure to lead.
    (2) Initial determination. Each employer who has a workplace or work 
operation covered by this standard shall determine if any exployee may 
be exposed to lead at or above the action level.
    (3) Basis of initial determination. (i) The employer shall monitor 
employee exposures and shall base initial determinations on the employee 
exposure monitoring results and any of the following, relevant 
considerations:
    (A) Any information, observations, or calculations which would 
indicate employee exposure to lead;
    (B) Any previous measurements of airborne lead; and
    (C) Any employee complaints of symptoms which may be attributable to 
exposure to lead.
    (ii) Monitoring for the initial determination may be limited to a 
representative sample of the exposed employees who the employer 
reasonably believes are exposed to the greatest airborne concentrations 
of lead in the workplace.
    (iii) Measurements of airborne lead made in the preceding 12 months 
may be used to satisfy the requirement to monitor under paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) if the sampling and analytical methods used meet the accuracy 
and confidence levels of paragraph (d)(9) of this section.
    (4) Positive initial determination and initial monitoring. (i) Where 
a determination conducted under paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this 
section shows the possibility of any employee exposure at or above the 
action level, the employer shall conduct monitoring which is 
representative of the exposure for each employee in the workplace who is 
exposed to lead.
    (ii) Measurements of airborne lead made in the preceding 12 months 
may be used to satisfy this requirement if the sampling and analytical 
methods used meet the accuracy and confidence levels of paragraph (d)(9) 
of this section.
    (5) Negative initial determination. Where a determination, conducted 
under paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section is made that no 
employee is exposed to airborne concentrations of lead at or above the 
action level, the employer shall make a written record of such 
determination. The record shall include at least the information 
specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and shall also include the 
date of determination, location within the worksite, and the name and 
social security number of each employee monitored.
    (6) Frequency. (i) If the initial monitoring reveals employee 
exposure to be below the action level the measurements need not be 
repeated except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this 
section.

[[Page 106]]

    (ii) If the initial determination or subsequent monitoring reveals 
employee exposure to be at or above the action level but below the 
permissible exposure limit the employer shall repeat monitoring in 
accordance with this paragraph at least every 6 months. The employer 
shall continue monitoring at the required frequency until at least two 
consecutive measurements, taken at least 7 days apart, are below the 
action level at which time the employer may discontinue monitoring for 
that employee except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this 
section.
    (iii) If the initial monitoring reveals that employee exposure is 
above the permissible exposure limit the employer shall repeat 
monitoring quarterly. The employer shall continue monitoring at the 
required frequency until at least two consecutive measurements, taken at 
least 7 days apart, are below the PEL but at or above the action level 
at which time the employer shall repeat monitoring for that employee at 
the frequency specified in paragraph (d)(6)(ii), except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
    (7) Additional monitoring. Whenever there has been a production, 
process, control or personnel change which may result in new or 
additional exposure to lead, or whenever the employer has any other 
reason to suspect a change which may result in new or additional 
exposures to lead, additional monitoring in accordance with this 
paragraph shall be conducted.
    (8) Employee notification. (i) Within 5 working days after the 
receipt of monitoring results, the employer shall notify each employee 
in writing of the results which represent that employee's exposure.
    (ii) Whenever the results indicate that the representative employee 
exposure, without regard to respirators, exceeds the permissible 
exposure limit, the employer shall incude in the written notice a 
statement that the permissible exposure limit was exceeded and a 
description of the corrective action taken or to be taken to reduce 
exposure to or below the permissible exposure limit.
    (9) Accuracy of measurement. The employer shall use a method of 
monitoring and analysis which has an accuracy (to a confidence level of 
95%) of not less than plus or minus 20 percent for airborne 
concentrations of lead equal to or greater than 30 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>.
    (e) Methods of compliance--(1) Engineering and work practice 
controls. (i) Where any employee is exposed to lead above the 
permissible exposure limit for more than 30 days per year, the employer 
shall implement engineering and work practice controls (including 
administrative controls) to reduce and maintain employee exposure to 
lead in accordance with the implementation schedule in Table I below, 
except to the extent that the employer can demonstrate that such 
controls are not feasible. Wherever the engineering and work practice 
controls which can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce employee 
exposure to or below the permissible exposure limit, the employer shall 
nonetheless use them to reduce exposures to the lowest feasible level 
and shall supplement them by the use of respiratory protection which 
complies with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (ii) Where any employee is exposed to lead above the permissible 
exposure limit, but for 30 days or less per year, the employer shall 
implement engineering controls to reduce exposures to 200 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>, but thereafter may implement any combination of 
engineering, work practice (including administrative controls), and 
respiratory controls to reduce and maintain employee exposure to lead to 
or below 50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>.

\1\ Calculated by counting from the date the stay on implementation of
  paragraph (e)(1) was lifted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
  District of Columbia, the number of years specified in the 1978 lead
  standard and subsequent amendments for compliance with the PEL of 50
  <greek-m> g/m\3\ for exposure to airborne concentrations of lead
  levels for the particular industry.
\2\ Large nonferrous foundries (20 or more employees) are required to
  achieve the PEL of 50 <greek-m> g/m\3\ by means of engineering and
  work practice controls. Small nonferrous foundries (fewer than 20
  employees) are required to achieve an 8-hour TWA of 75 <greek-m> g/
  m\3\ by such controls.

[[Page 107]]

 
\3\ Expressed as the number of years from the date on which the Court
  lifts the stay on the implementation of paragraph (e)(1) for this
  industry for employers to achieve a lead in air concentration of 75
  <greek-m> g/m\3\. Compliance with paragraph (e) in this industry is
  determined by a compliance directive that incorporates elements from
  the settlement agreement between OSHA and representatives of the
  industry.

    (2) Respiratory protection. Where engineering and work practice 
controls do not reduce employee exposure to or below the 50 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>permissible exposure limit, the employer shall supplement 
these controls with respirators in accordance with paragraph (f). 
    (3) Compliance program. (i) Each employer shall establish and 
implement a written compliance program to reduce exposures to or below 
the permissible exposure limit, and interim levels if applicable, solely 
by means of engineering and work practice controls in accordance with 
the implementation schedule in paragraph (e)(1).
    (ii) Written plans for these compliance programs shall include at 
least the following:
    (A) A description of each operation in which lead is emitted; e.g. 
machinery used, material processed, controls in place, crew size, 
employee job responsibilities, operating procedures and maintenance 
practices;
    (B) A description of the specific means that will be employed to 
achieve compliance, including engineering plans and studies used to 
determine methods selected for controlling exposure to lead;
    (C) A report of the technology considered in meeting the permissible 
exposure limit;
    (D) Air monitoring data which documents the source of lead 
emissions;
    (E) A detailed schedule for implementation of the program, including 
documentation such as copies of purchase orders for equipment, 
construction contracts, etc.;
    (F) A work practice program which includes items required under 
paragraphs (g), (h) and (i) of this regulation;
    (G) An administrative control schedule required by paragraph (e)(6), 
if applicable;
    (H) Other relevant information.
    (iii) Written programs shall be submitted upon request to the 
Assistant Secretary and the Director, and shall be available at the 
worksite for examination and copying by the Assistant Secretary, 
Director, any affected employee or authorized employee representatives.
    (iv) Written programs shall be revised and updated at least every 6 
months to reflect the current status of the program.
    (4) Mechanical ventilation. (i) When ventilation is used to control 
exposure, measurements which demonstrate the effectiveness of the system 
in controlling exposure, such as capture velocity, duct velocity, or 
static pressure shall be made at least every 3 months. Measurements of 
the system's effectiveness in controlling exposure shall be made within 
5 days of any change in production, process, or control which might 
result in a change in employee exposure to lead.
    (ii) Recirculation of air. If air from exhaust ventilation is 
recirculated into the workplace, the employer shall assure that (A) the 
system has a high efficiency filter with reliable back-up filter; and 
(B) controls to monitor the concentration of lead in the return air and 
to bypass the recirculation system automatically if it fails are 
installed, operating, and maintained.
    (5) Administrative controls. If administrative controls are used as 
a means of reducing employees TWA exposure to lead, the employer shall 
establish and implement a job rotation schedule which includes:
    (i) Name or identification number of each affected employee;
    (ii) Duration and exposure levels at each job or work station where 
each affected employee is located; and
    (iii) Any other information which may be useful in assessing the 
reliability of administrative controls to reduce exposure to lead.
    (f) Respiratory protection--(1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods necessary to install or implement engineering or work-
practice controls.
    (ii) Work operations for which engineering and work-practice 
controls are

[[Page 108]]

not sufficient to reduce employee exposures to or below the permissible 
exposure limit.
    (iii) Periods when an employee requests a respirator.
    (2) Respirator program. (i) The employer must implement a 
respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b) 
through (d) (except (d)(1)(iii)), and (f) through (m).
    (ii) If an employee has breathing difficulty during fit testing or 
respirator use, the employer must provide the employee with a medical 
examination in accordance with paragraph (j)(3)(i)(C) of this section to 
determine whether or not the employee can use a respirator while 
performing the required duty.

    (3) Medical examinations and consultations--(i) Frequency. The 
employer shall make available medical examinations and consultations to 
each employee covered under paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section on the 
following schedule:
    (A) At least annually for each employee for whom a blood sampling 
test conducted at any time during the preceding 12 months indicated a 
blood lead level at or above 40 <greek-m> g/100 g;
    (B) Prior to assignment for each employee being assigned for the 
first time to an area in which airborne concentrations of lead are at or 
above the action level;
    (C) As soon as possible, upon notification by an employee either 
that the employee has developed signs or symptoms commonly associated 
with lead intoxication, that the employee desires medical advice 
concerning the effects of current or past exposure to lead on the 
employee's ability to procreate a healthy child, or that the employee 
has demonstrated difficulty in breathing during a respirator fitting 
test or during use; and
    (D) As medically appropriate for each employee either removed from 
exposure to lead due to a risk of sustaining material impairment to 
health, or otherwise limited pursuant to a final medical determination.
    (ii) Content. Medical examinations made available pursuant to 
paragraph (j)(3)(i) (A) through (B) of this section shall include the 
following elements:
    (A) A detailed work history and a medical history, with particular

    (5) Serum creatinine;
    (E) A routine urinalysis with microscopic examination; and
    (F) Any laboratory or other test which the examining physician deems 
necessary by sound medical practice.

The content of medical examinations made available pursuant to paragraph 
(j)(3)(i) (C) through (D) of this section shall be determined by an 
examining physician and, if requested by an employee, shall include 
pregnancy testing or laboratory evaluation of male fertility.
    (iii) Multiple physician review mechanism. (A) If the employer 
selects the initial physician who conducts any medical examination or 
consultation provided to an employee under this section, the employee 
may designate a second physician:
    (1) To review any findings, determinations or recommendations of the 
initial physician; and
    (2) To conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory 
tests as the second physician deems necessary to facilitate this review.
    (B) The employer shall promptly notify an employee of the right to 
seek a second medical opinion after each occasion that an initial 
physician conducts a medical examination or consultation pursuant to 
this section. The employer may condition its participation in, and 
payment for, the multiple physician review mechanism upon the employee 
doing the following within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the 
foregoing notification, or receipt of the initial physician's written 
opinion, whichever is later:
    (1) The employee informing the employer that he or she intends to 
seek a second medical opinion, and
    (2) The employee initiating steps to make an appointment with a 
second physician.
    (C) If the findings, determinations or recommendations of the second 
physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the employer 
and the employee shall assure that efforts are made for the two 
physicians to resolve any disagreement.
    (D) If the two physicians have been unable to quickly resolve their 
disagreement, then the employer and the employee through their 
respective physicians shall designate a third physician:
    (1) To review any findings, determinations or recommendations of the 
prior physicians; and
    (2) To conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests 
and discussions with the prior physicians as the third physician deems 
necessary to resolve the disagreement of the prior physicians.
    (E) The employer shall act consistent with the findings, 
determinations and recommendations of the third physician, unless the 
employer and the employee reach an agreement which is otherwise 
consistent with the recommendations of at least one of the three 
physicians.
    (iv) Information provided to examining and consulting physicians. 
(A) The employer shall provide an initial physician conducting a medical 
examination or consultation under this section with the following 
information:
    (1) A copy of this regulation for lead including all Appendices;
    (2) A description of the affected employee's duties as they relate 
to the employee's exposure;
    (3) The employee's exposure level or anticipated exposure level to 
lead and to any other toxic substance (if applicable);
    (4) A description of any personal protective equipment used or to be 
used;
    (5) Prior blood lead determinations; and
    (6) All prior written medical opinions concerning the employee in 
the employer's possession or control.
    (B) The employer shall provide the foregoing information to a second 
or third physician conducting a medical examination or consultation 
under this section upon request either by the second or third physician, 
or by the employee.
    (v) Written medical opinions. (A) The employer shall obtain and 
furnish the employee with a copy of a written medical opinion from each 
examining or consulting physician which contains the following 
information:
    (1) The physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any 
detected medical condition which would place

[[Page 112]]

the employee at increased risk of material impairment of the employee's 
health from exposure to lead;
    (2) Any recommended special protective measures to be provided to 
the employee, or limitations to be placed upon the employee's exposure 
to lead;
    (3) Any recommended limitation upon the employee's use of 
respirators, including a determination of whether the employee can wear 
a powered air purifying respirator if a physician determines that the 
employee cannot wear a negative pressure respirator; and
    (4) The results of the blood lead determinations.
    (B) The employer shall instruct each examining and consulting 
physician to:
    (1) Not reveal either in the written opinion, or in any other means 
of communication with the employer, findings, including laboratory 
results, or diagnoses unrelated to an employee's occupational exposure 
to lead; and
    (2) Advise the employee of any medical condition, occupational or 
nonoccupational, which dictates further medical examination or 
treatment.
    (vi) Alternate Physician Determination Mechanisms. The employer and 
an employee or authorized employee representative may agree upon the use 
of any expeditious alternate physician determination mechanism in lieu 
of the multiple physician review mechanism provided by this paragraph so 
long as the alternate mechanism otherwise satisfies the requirements 
contained in this paragraph.
    (4) Chelation. (i) The employer shall assure that any person whom he 
retains, employs, supervises or controls does not engage in prophylactic 
chelation of any employee at any time.
    (ii) If therapeutic or diagnostic chelation is to be performed by 
any person in paragraph (j)(4)(i), the employer shall assure that it be 
done under the supervision of a licensed physician in a clinical setting 
with thorough and appropriate medical monitoring and that the employee 
is notified in writing prior to its occurrence.
    (k) Medical Removal Protection--(1) Temporary medical removal and 
return of an employee--(i) Temporary removal due to elevated blood lead 
levels. (A) The employer shall remove an employee from work having an 
exposure to lead at or above the action level on each occasion that a 
periodic and a follow-up blood sampling test conducted pursuant to this 
section indicate that the employee's blood lead level is at or above 60 
<greek-m> g/100 g of whole blood; and
    (B) The employer shall remove an employee from work having an 
exposure to lead at or above the action level on each occasion that the 
average of the last three blood sampling tests conducted pursuant to 
this section (or the average of all blood sampling tests conducted over 
the previous six (6) months, whichever is longer) indicates that the 
employee's blood lead level is at or above 50 <greek-m> g/100 g of whole 
blood; provided, however, that an employee need not be removed if the 
last blood sampling test indicates a blood lead level at or below 40 
<greek-m> g/100 g of whole blood.
    (ii) Temporary removal due to a final medical determination. (A) The 
employer shall remove an employee from work having an exposure to lead 
at or above the action level on each occasion that a final medical 
determination results in a medical finding, determination, or opinion 
that the employee has a detected medical condition which places the 
employee at increased risk of material impairment to health from 
exposure to lead.
    (B) For the purposes of this section, the phrase ``final medical 
determination'' shall mean the outcome of the multiple physician review 
mechanism or alternate medical determination mechanism used pursuant to 
the medical surveillance provisions of this section.
    (C) Where a final medical determination results in any recommended 
special protective measures for an employee, or limitations on an 
employee's exposure to lead, the employer shall implement and act 
consistent with the recommendation.
    (iii) Return of the employee to former job status. (A) The employer 
shall return an employee to his or her former job status:
    (1) For an employee removed due to a blood lead level at or above 60 
<greek-m>g/100 g, or due to an average blood lead level at or above 50 
<greek-m>g/100 g, when two consecutive blood sampling tests indicate 
that

[[Page 113]]

the employee's blood lead level is at or below 40 <greek-m>g/100 g of 
whole blood;
    (2) For an employee removed due to a final medical determination, 
when a subsequent final medical determination results in a medical 
finding, determination, or opinion that the employee no longer has a 
detected medical condition which places the employee at increased risk 
of material impairment to health from exposure to lead.
    (B) For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an 
employer return an employee to his or her former job status is not 
intended to expand upon or restrict any rights an employee has or would 
have had, absent temporary medical removal, to a specific job 
classification or position under the terms of a collective bargaining 
agreement.
    (iv) Removal of other employee special protective measure or 
limitations. The employer shall remove any limitations placed on an 
employee or end any special protective measures provided to an employee 
pursuant to a final medical determination when a subsequent final 
medical determination indicates that the limitations or special 
protective measures are no longer necessary.
    (v) Employer options pending a final medical determination. Where 
the multiple physician review mechanism, or alternate medical 
determination mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance 
provisions of this section, has not yet resulted in a final medical 
determination with respect to an employee, the employer shall act as 
follows:
    (A) Removal. The employer may remove the employee from exposure to 
lead, provide special protective measures to the employee, or place 
limitations upon the employee, consistent with the medical findings, 
determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have 
reviewed the employee's health status.
    (B) Return. The employer may return the employee to his or her 
former job status, end any special protective measures provided to the 
employee, and remove any limitations placed upon the employee, 
consistent with the medical findings, determinations, or recommendations 
of any of the physicians who have reviewed the employee's health status, 
with two exceptions. If
    (1) the initial removal, special protection, or limitation of the 
employee resulted from a final medical determination which differed from 
the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial 
physician or
    (2) The employee has been on removal status for the preceding 
eighteen months due to an elevated blood lead level, then the employer 
shall await a final medical determination.
    (2) Medical removal protection benefits--(i) Provision of medical 
removal protection benefits. The employer shall provide to an employee 
up to eighteen (18) months of medical removal protection benefits on 
each occasion that an employee is removed from exposure to lead or 
otherwise limited pursuant to this section.
    (ii) Definition of medical removal protection benefits. For the 
purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer provide 
medical removal protection benefits means that the employer shall 
maintain the earnings, seniority and other employment rights and 
benefits of an employee as though the employee had not been removed from 
normal exposure to lead or otherwise limited.
    (iii) Follow-up medical surveillance during the period of employee 
removal or limitation. During the period of time that an employee is 
removed from normal exposure to lead or otherwise limited, the employer 
may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon 
the employee's participation in follow-up medical surveillance made 
available pursuant to this section.
    (iv) Workers' compensation claims. If a removed employee files a 
claim for workers' compensation payments for a lead-related disability, 
then the employer shall continue to provide medical removal protection 
benefits pending disposition of the claim. To the extent that an award 
is made to the employee for earnings lost during the period of removal, 
the employer's medical removal protection obligation shall be reduced by 
such amount. The employer shall receive no credit for

[[Page 114]]

workers' compensation payments received by the employee for treatment 
related expenses.
    (v) Other credits. The employer's obligation to provide medical 
removal protection benefits to a removed employee shall be reduced to 
the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost 
during the period of removal either from a publicly or employer-funded 
compensation program, or receives income from employment with another 
employer made possible by virtue of the employee's removal.
    (vi) Employees whose blood lead levels do not adequately decline 
within 18 months of removal. The employer shall take the following 
measures with respect to any employee removed from exposure to lead due 
to an elevated blood lead level whose blood lead level has not declined 
within the past eighteen (18) months of removal so that the employee has 
been returned to his or her former job status:
    (A) The employer shall make available to the employee a medical 
examination pursuant to this section to obtain a final medical 
determination with respect to the employee;
    (B) The employer shall assure that the final medical determination 
obtained indicates whether or not the employee may be returned to his or 
her former job status, and if not, what steps should be taken to protect 
the employee's health;
    (C) Where the final medical determination has not yet been obtained, 
or once obtained indicates that the employee may not yet be returned to 
his or her former job status, the employer shall continue to provide 
medical removal protection benefits to the employee until either the 
employee is returned to former job status, or a final medical 
determination is made that the employee is incapable of ever safely 
returning to his or her former job status.
    (D) Where the employer acts pursuant to a final medical 
determination which permits the return of the employee to his or her 
former job status despite what would otherwise be an unacceptable blood 
lead level, later questions concerning removing the employee again shall 
be decided by a final medical determination. The employer need not 
automatically remove such an employee pursuant to the blood lead level 
removal criteria provided by this section.
    (vii) Voluntary Removal or Restriction of An Employee. Where an 
employer, although not required by this section to do so, removes an 
employee from exposure to lead or otherwise places limitations on an 
employee due to the effects of lead exposure on the employee's medical 
condition, the employer shall provide medical removal protection 
benefits to the employee equal to that required by paragraph (k)(2)(i) 
of this section.
    (l) Employee information and training--(1) Training program. (i) 
Each employer who has a workplace in which there is a potential exposure 
to airborne lead at any level shall inform employees of the content of 
Appendices A and B of this regulation.

  Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1025--Substance Data Sheet for Occupational 
                            Exposure to Lead

                       i. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: Pure lead (Pb) is a heavy metal at room temperature 
and pressure and is a basic chemical element. It can combine with 
various other substances to form numerous lead compounds.
    B. Compounds Covered by the Standard: The word ``lead'' when used in 
this standard means elemental lead, all inorganic lead compounds and a 
class of organic lead compounds called lead soaps. This standard does 
not apply to other organic lead compounds.
    C. Uses: Exposure to lead occurs in at least 120 different 
occupations, including primary and secondary lead smelting, lead storage 
battery manufacturing, lead pigment manufacturing and use, solder 
manufacturing and use, shipbuilding and ship repairing, auto 
manufacturing, and printing.
    D. Permissible Exposure: The Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) set by 
the standard is 50 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air (50 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>), averaged over an 8-hour workday.
    E. Action Level: The standard establishes an action level of 30 
micrograms per cubic meter of air (30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>), time 
weighted average, based on an 8-hour work-day. The action level 
initiates several requirements of the standard, such as exposure 
monitoring, medical surveillance, and training and education.

                         ii. health hazard data

    A. Ways in which lead enters your body. When absorbed into your body 
in certain doses lead is a toxic substance. The object of the lead 
standard is to prevent absorption of harmful quantities of lead. The 
standard is intended to protect you not only from the immediate toxic 
effects of lead, but also from the serious toxic effects that may not 
become apparent until years of exposure have passed.
    Lead can be absorbed into your body by inhalation (breathing) and 
ingestion (eating). Lead (except for certain organic lead compounds not 
covered by the standard, such as tetraethyl lead) is not absorbed 
through your skin. When lead is scattered in the air as a dust, fume or 
mist it can be inhaled and

[[Page 118]]

absorbed through you lungs and upper respiratory tract. Inhalation of 
airborne lead is generally the most important source of occupational 
lead absorption. You can also absorb lead through your digestive system 
if lead gets into your mouth and is swallowed. If you handle food, 
cigarettes, chewing tobacco, or make-up which have lead on them or 
handle them with hands contaminated with lead, this will contribute to 
ingestion.
    A significant portion of the lead that you inhale or ingest gets 
into your blood stream. Once in your blood stream, lead is circulated 
throughout your body and stored in various organs and body tissues. Some 
of this lead is quickly filtered out of your body and excreted, but some 
remains in the blood and other tissues. As exposure to lead continues, 
the amount stored in your body will increase if you are absorbing more 
lead than your body is excreting. Even though you may not be aware of 
any immediate symptoms of disease, this lead stored in your tissues can 
be slowly causing irreversible damage, first to individual cells, then 
to your organs and whole body systems.
    B. Effects of overexposure to lead--(1) Short term (acute) 
overexposure. Lead is a potent, systemic poison that serves no known 
useful function once absorbed by your body. Taken in large enough doses, 
lead can kill you in a matter of days. A condition affecting the brain 
called acute encephalopathy may arise which develops quickly to 
seizures, coma, and death from cardiorespiratory arrest. A short term 
dose of lead can lead to acute encephalopathy. Short term occupational 
exposures of this magnitude are highly unusual, but not impossible. 
Similar forms of encephalopathy may, however, arise from extended, 
chronic exposure to lower doses of lead. There is no sharp dividing line 
between rapidly developing acute effects of lead, and chronic effects 
which take longer to acquire. Lead adversely affects numerous body 
systems, and causes forms of health impairment and disease which arise 
after periods of exposure as short as days or as long as several years.
    (2) Long-term (chronic) overexposure. Chronic overexposure to lead 
may result in severe damage to your blood-forming, nervous, urinary and 
reproductive systems. Some common symptoms of chronic overexposure 
include loss of appetite, metallic taste in the mouth, anxiety, 
constipation, nausea, pallor, excessive tiredness, weakness, insomnia, 
headache, nervous irritability, muscle and joint pain or soreness, fine 
tremors, numbness, dizziness, hyperactivity and colic. In lead colic 
there may be severe abdominal pain.
    Damage to the central nervous system in general and the brain 
(encephalopathy) in particular is one of the most severe forms of lead 
poisoning. The most severe, often fatal, form of encephalopathy may be 
preceded by vomiting, a feeling of dullness progressing to drowsiness 
and stupor, poor memory, restlessness, irritability, tremor, and 
convulsions. It may arise suddenly with the onset of seizures, followed 
by coma, and death. There is a tendency for muscular weakness to develop 
at the same time. This weakness may progress to paralysis often observed 
as a characteristic ``wrist drop'' or ``foot drop'' and is a 
manifestation of a disease to the nervous system called peripheral 
neuropathy.
    Chronic overexposure to lead also results in kidney disease with 
few, if any, symptoms appearing until extensive and most likely 
permanent kidney damage has occurred. Routine laboratory tests reveal 
the presence of this kidney disease only after about two-thirds of 
kidney function is lost. When overt symptoms of urinary dysfunction 
arise, it is often too late to correct or prevent worsening conditions, 
and progression to kidney dialysis or death is possible.
    Chronic overexposure to lead impairs the reproductive systems of 
both men and women. Overexposure to lead may result in decreased sex 
drive, impotence and sterility in men. Lead can alter the structure of 
sperm cells raising the risk of birth defects. There is evidence of 
miscarriage and stillbirth in women whose husbands were exposed to lead 
or who were exposed to lead themselves. Lead exposure also may result in 
decreased fertility, and abnormal menstrual cycles in women. The course 
of pregnancy may be adversely affected by exposure to lead since lead 
crosses the placental barrier and poses risks to developing fetuses. 
Children born of parents either one of whom were exposed to excess lead 
levels are more likely to have birth defects, mental retardation, 
behavioral disorders or die during the first year of childhood.
    Overexposure to lead also disrupts the blood-forming system 
resulting in decreased hemoglobin (the substance in the blood that 
carries oxygen to the cells) and ultimately anemia. Anemia is 
characterized by weakness, pallor and fatigability as a result of 
decreased oxygen carrying capacity in the blood.
    (3) Health protection goals of the standard. Prevention of adverse 
health effects for most workers from exposure to lead throughout a 
working lifetime requires that worker blood lead (PbB) levels be 
maintained at or below forty micrograms per one hundred grams of whole 
blood (40 <greek-m>g/100g). The blood lead levels of workers (both male 
and female workers) who intend to have children should be maintained 
below 30 <greek-m>g/100g to minimize adverse reproductive health effects 
to the parents and to the developing fetus.
    The measurement of your blood lead level is the most useful 
indicator of the amount of lead being absorbed by your body. Blood lead 
levels (PbB) are most often reported in units

[[Page 119]]

of milligrams (mg) or micrograms (<greek-m>g) of lead (1 mg=1000 
<greek-m>g) per 100 grams (100g), 100 milliters (100 ml) or deciliter 
(dl) of blood. These three units are essentially the same. Sometime 
PbB's are expressed in the form of mg% or <greek-m>g%. This is a 
shorthand notation for 100g, 100 ml, or dl.
    PbB measurements show the amount of lead circulating in your blood 
stream, but do not give any information about the amount of lead stored 
in your various tissues. PbB measurements merely show current absorption 
of lead, not the effect that lead is having on your body or the effects 
that past lead exposure may have already caused. Past research into 
lead-related diseases, however, has focused heavily on associations 
between PbBs and various diseases. As a result, your PbB is an important 
indicator of the likelihood that you will gradually acquire a lead-
related health impairment or disease.
    Once your blood lead level climbs above 40 <greek-m>g/100g, your 
risk of disease increases. There is a wide variability of individual 
response to lead, thus it is difficult to say that a particular PbB in a 
given person will cause a particular effect. Studies have associated 
fatal encephalopathy with PbBs as low as 150 <greek-m>g/100g. Other 
studies have shown other forms of diseases in some workers with PbBs 
well below 80 <greek-m>g/100g. Your PbB is a crucial indicator of the 
risks to your health, but one other factor is also extremely important. 
This factor is the length of time you have had elevated PbBs. The longer 
you have an elevated PbB, the greater the risk that large quantities of 
lead are being gradually stored in your organs and tissues (body 
burden). The greater your overall body burden, the greater the chances 
of substantial permanent damage.
    The best way to prevent all forms of lead-related impairments and 
diseases--both short term and long term- is to maintain your PbB below 
40 <greek-m>g/100g. The provisions of the standard are designed with 
this end in mind. Your employer has prime responsibility to assure that 
the provisions of the standard are complied with both by the company and 
by individual workers. You as a worker, however, also have a 
responsibility to assist your employer in complying with the standard. 
You can play a key role in protecting your own health by learning about 
the lead hazards and their control, learning what the standard requires, 
following the standard where it governs your own actions, and seeing 
that your employer complies with provisions governing his actions.
    (4) Reporting signs and symptoms of health problems. You should 
immediately notify your employer if you develop signs or symptoms 
associated with lead poisoning or if you desire medical advice 
concerning the effects of current or past exposure to lead on your 
ability to have a healthy child. You should also notify your employer if 
you have difficulty breathing during a respirator fit test or while 
wearing a respirator. In each of these cases your employer must make 
available to you appropriate medical examinations or consultations. 
These must be provided at no cost to you and at a reasonable time and 
place.
    The standard contains a procedure whereby you can obtain a second 
opinion by a physician of your choice if the employer selected the 
initial physician.

         Appendix B to Sec. 1910.1025--Employee Standard Summary

    This appendix summarizes key provisions of the standard that you as 
a worker should become familiar with.

           i. Permissible Exposure Limit (pel)--Paragraph (c)

    The standards sets a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of fifty 
micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air (50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>), 
averaged over an 8-hour work-day. This is the highest level of lead in 
air to which you may be permissibly exposed over an 8-hour workday. 
Since it is an 8-hour average it permits short exposures above the PEL 
so long as for each 8-hour work day your average exposure does not 
exceed the PEL.
    This standard recognizes that your daily exposure to lead can extend 
beyond a typical 8-hour workday as the result of overtime or other 
alterations in your work schedule. To deal with this, the standard 
contains a formula which reduces your permissible exposure when you are 
exposed more than 8 hours. For example, if you are exposed to lead for 
10 hours a day, the maximum permitted average exposure would be 40 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>.

                 ii. exposure monitoring--paragraph (d)

    If lead is present in the workplace where you work in any quantity, 
your employer is required to make an initial determination of whether 
the action level is exceeded for any employee. This initial 
determination must include instrument monitoring of the air for the 
presence of lead and must cover the exposure of a representative number 
of employees who are reasonably believed to have the highest exposure 
levels. If your employer has conducted appropriate air sampling for lead 
in the past year he may use these results. If there have been any 
employee complaints of symptoms which may be attributable to exposure to 
lead or if there is any other information or observations which would 
indicate employee exposure to lead, this must also be considered as part 
of the initial determination. This initial determination must have been 
completed by March 31, 1979. If this initial determination shows that a 
reasonable possibility exists that any employee may be exposed, without

[[Page 120]]

regard to respirators, over the action level (30 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>) your employer must set up an air monitoring program to 
determine the exposure level of every employee exposed to lead at your 
workplace.
    In carrying out this air monitoring program, your employer is not 
required to monitor the exposure of every employee, but he must monitor 
a representative number of employees and job types. Enough sampling must 
be done to enable each employee's exposure level to be reasonably least 
one full shift (at least 7 hours) air sample. In addition, these air 
samples must be taken under conditions which represent each employee's 
regular, daily exposure to lead. All initial exposure monitoring must 
have been completed by May 30, 1979.
    If you are exposed to lead and air sampling is performed, your 
employer is required to quickly notify you in writing of air monitoring 
results which represent your exposure. If the results indicate your 
exposure exceeds the PEL (without regard to your use of respirators), 
then your employer must also notify you of this in writing, and provide 
you with a description of the corrective action that will be taken to 
reduce your exposure.
    Your exposure must be rechecked by monitoring every six months if 
your exposure is over the action level but below the PEL. Air monitoring 
must be repeated every 3 months if you are exposed over the PEL. Your 
employer may discontinue monitoring for you if 2 consecutive 
measurements, taken at least two weeks apart, are below the action 
level. However, whenever there is a production, process, control, or 
personnel change at your workplace which may result in new or additional 
exposure to lead, or whenever there is any other reason to suspect a 
change which may result in new or additional exposure to lead, your 
employer must perform additional monitoring.

                iii. methods of compliance--paragraph (e)

    Your employer is required to assure that no employee is exposed to 
lead in excess of the PEL. The standard establishes a priority of 
methods to be used to meet the PEL.

                iv. respiratory protection--paragraph (f)

    Your employer is required to provide and assure your use of 
respirators when your exposure to lead is not controlled below the PEL 
by other means. The employer must pay the cost of the respirator. 
Whenever you request one, your employer is also required to provide you 
a respirator even if your air exposure level does not exceed the PEL. 
You might desire a respirator when, for example, you have received 
medical advice that your lead absorption should be decreased. Or, you 
may intend to have children in the near future, and want to reduce the 
level of lead in your body to minimize adverse reproductive effects. 
While respirators are the least satisfactory means of controlling your 
exposure, they are capable of providing significant protection if 
properly chosen, fitted, worn, cleaned, maintained, and replaced when 
they stop providing adequate protection.
    Your employer is required to select respirators from the seven types 
listed in Table II of the Respiratory Protection section of the standard 
(Sec. 1910.1025(f)). Any respirator chosen must be approved by the 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) under the 
provisions of 42 CFR part 84. This respirator selection table will 
enable your employer to choose a type of respirator that will give you a 
proper amount of protection based on your airborne lead exposure. Your 
employer may select a type of respirator that provides greater 
protection than that required by the standard; that is, one recommended 
for a higher concentration of lead than is present in your workplace. 
For example, a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) is much more 
protective than a typical negative pressure respirator, and may also be 
more comfortable to wear. A PAPR has a filter, cartridge, or canister to 
clean the air, and a power source that continuously blows filtered air 
into your breathing zone. Your employer might make a PAPR available to 
you to ease the burden of having to wear a respirator for long periods 
of time. The standard provides that you can obtain a PAPR upon request.
    Your employer must also start a Respiratory Protection Program. This 
program must include written procedures for the proper selection, use, 
cleaning, storage, and maintenance of respirators.
    Your employer must ensure that your respirator facepiece fits 
properly. Proper fit of a respirator facepiece is critical to your 
protection from airborne lead. Obtaining a proper fit on each employee 
may require your employer to make available several different types of 
respirator masks. To ensure that your respirator fits properly and that 
facepiece leakage is minimal, your employer must give you either a 
qualitative or quantitative fit test as specified in Appendix A of the 
Respiratory Protection standard located at 29 CFR 1910.134.
    You must also receive from your employer proper training in the use 
of respirators. Your employer is required to teach you how to wear a 
respirator, to know why it is needed, and to understand its limitations.
    The standard provides that if your respirator uses filter elements, 
you must be given an opportunity to change the filter elements whenever 
an increase in breathing resistance is detected. You also must be 
permitted to periodically leave your work area to wash your face and 
respirator facepiece whenever necessary to prevent skin irritation. If 
you ever have difficulty in breathing

[[Page 121]]

during a fit test or while using a respirator, your employer must make a 
medical examination available to you to determine whether you can safely 
wear a respirator. The result of this examination may be to give you a 
positive pressure respirator (which reduces breathing resistance) or to 
provide alternative means of protection.

        v. protective work clothing and equipment--paragraph (g)

    If you are exposed to lead above the PEL, or if you are exposed to 
lead compounds such as lead arsenate or lead azide which can cause skin 
and eye irritation, your employer must provide you with protective work 
clothing and equipment appropriate for the hazard. If work clothing is 
provided, it must be provided in a clean and dry condition at least 
weekly, and daily if your airborne exposure to lead is greater than 200 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>. Appropriate protective work clothing and 
equipment can include coveralls or similar full-body work clothing, 
gloves, hats, shoes or disposable shoe coverlets, and face shields or 
vented goggles. Your employer is required to provide all such equipment 
at no cost to you. He is responsible for providing repairs and 
replacement as necessary, and also is responsible for the cleaning, 
laundering or disposal of protective clothing and equipment. 
Contaminated work clothing or equipment must be removed in change rooms 
and not worn home or you will extend your exposure and expose your 
family since lead from your clothing can accumulate in your house, car, 
etc. Contaminated clothing which is to be cleaned, laundered or disposed 
of must be placed in closed containers in the change room. At no time 
may lead be removed from protective clothing or equipment by any means 
which disperses lead into the workroom air.

                     vi. housekeeping--paragraph (h)

    Your employer must establish a housekeeping program sufficient to 
maintain all surfaces as free as practicable of accumulations of lead 
dust. Vacuuming is the preferred method of meeting this requirement, and 
the use of compressed air to clean floors and other surfaces is 
absolutely prohibited. Dry or wet sweeping, shoveling, or brushing may 
not be used except where vaccuming or other equally effective methods 
have been tried and do not work. Vacuums must be used and emptied in a 
manner which minimizes the reentry of lead into the workplace.

          vii. hygiene facilities and practices--paragraph (i)

    The standard requires that change rooms, showers, and filtered air 
lunchrooms be constructed and made available to workers exposed to lead 
above the PEL. When the PEL is exceeded the employer must assure that 
food and beverage is not present or consumed, tobacco products are not 
present or used, and cosmetics are not applied, except in these 
facilities. Change rooms, showers, and lunchrooms, must be used by 
workers exposed in excess of the PEL. After showering, no clothing or 
equipment worn during the shift may be worn home, and this includes 
shoes and underwear. Your own clothing worn during the shift should be 
carried home and cleaned carefully so that it does not contaminate your 
home. Lunchrooms may not be entered with protective clothing or 
equipment unless surface dust has been removed by vacuuming, downdraft 
booth, or other cleaning method. Finally, workers exposed above the PEL 
must wash both their hands and faces prior to eating, drinking, smoking 
or applying cosmetics.
    All of the facilities and hygiene practices just discussed are 
essential to minimize additional sources of lead absorption from 
inhalation or ingestion of lead that may accumulate on you, your 
clothes, or your possessions. Strict compliance with these provisions 
can virtually eliminate several sources of lead exposure which 
significantly contribute to excessive lead absorption.

                viii. medical surveillance--paragraph (j)

    The medical surveillance program is part of the standard's 
comprehensive approach to the prevention of lead-related disease. Its 
purpose is to supplement the main thrust of the standard which is aimed 
at minimizing airborne concentrations of lead and sources of ingestion. 
Only medical surveillance can determine if the other provisions of the 
standard have affectively protected you as an individual. Compliance 
with the standard's provision will protect most workers from the adverse 
effects of lead exposure, but may not be satisfactory to protect 
individual workers (1) who have high body burdens of lead acquired over 
past years, (2) who have additional uncontrolled sources of non-
occupational lead exposure, (3) who exhibit unusual variations in lead 
absorption rates, or (4) who have specific non-work related medical 
conditions which could be aggravated by lead exposure (e.g., renal 
disease, anemia). In addition, control systems may fail, or hygiene and 
respirator programs may be inadequate. Periodic medical surveillance of 
individual workers will help detect those failures. Medical surveillance 
will also be important to protect your reproductive ability--regardless 
of whether you are a man or woman.
    All medical surveillance required by the standard must be performed 
by or under the supervision of a licensed physician. The employer must 
provide required medical surveillance without cost to employees and at a 
reasonable time and place. The standard's medical surveillance program 
has two parts-

[[Page 122]]

periodic biological monitoring and medical examinations.
    Your employer's obligation to offer you medical surveillance is 
triggered by the results of the air monitoring program. Medical 
surveillance must be made available to all employees who are exposed in 
excess of the action level for more than 30 days a year. The initial 
phase of the medical surveillance program, which includes blood lead 
level tests and medical examinations, must be completed for all covered 
employees no later than August 28, 1979. Priority within this first 
round of medical surveillance must be given to employees whom the 
employer believes to be at greatest risk from continued exposure (for 
example, those with the longest prior exposure to lead, or those with 
the highest current exposure). Thereafter, the employer must 
periodically make medical surveillance--both biological monitoring and 
medical examinations--available to all covered employees.
    Biological monitoring under the standard consists of blood lead 
level (PbB) and zinc protoporphyrin tests at least every 6 months after 
the initial PbB test. A zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) test is a very useful 
blood test which measures an effect of lead on your body. Thus 
biological monitoring under the standard is currently limited to PbB 
testing. If a worker's PbB exceeds 40 <greek-m>g/100g the monitoring 
frequency must be increased from every 6 months to at least every 2 
months and not reduced until two consecutive PbBs indicate a blood lead 
level below 40 <greek-m>g/100g. Each time your PbB is determined to be 
over 40 <greek-m>g/100g, your employer must notify you of this in 
writing within five working days of his receipt of the test results. The 
employer must also inform you that the standard requires temporary 
medical removal with economic protection when your PbB exceeds certain 
criteria. (See Discussion of Medical Removal Protection--Paragraph (k).) 
During the first year of the standard, this removal criterion is 80 
<greek-m>g/100g. Anytime your PbB exceeds 80 <greek-m>g/100g your 
employer must make available to you a prompt follow-up PbB test to 
ascertain your PbB. If the two tests both exceed 80 <greek-m>g/100g and 
you are temporarily removed, then your employer must make successive PbB 
tests available to you on a monthly basis during the period of your 
removal.
    Medical examinations beyond the initial one must be made available 
on an annual basis if your blood lead level exceeds 40 <greek-m>g/100g 
at any time during the preceding year. The initial examination will 
provide information to establish a baseline to which subsequent data can 
be compared. An initial medical examination must also be made available 
(prior to assignment) for each employee being assigned for the first 
time to an area where the airborne concentration of lead equals or 
exceeds the action level. In addition, a medical examination or 
consultation must be made available as soon as possible if you notify 
your employer that you are experiencing signs or symptoms commonly 
associated with lead poisoning or that you have difficulty breathing 
while wearing a respirator or during a respirator fit test. You must 
also be provided a medical examination or consultation if you notify 
your employer that you desire medical advice concerning the effects of 
current or past exposure to lead on your ability to procreate a healthy 
child.
    Finally, appropriate follow-up medical examinations or consultations 
may also be provided for employees who have been temporarily removed 
from exposure under the medical removal protection provisions of the 
standard. (See Part IX, below.)
    The standard specifies the minimum content of pre-assignment and 
annual medical examinations. The content of other types of medical 
examinations and consultations is left up to the sound discretion of the 
examining physician. Pre-assignment and annual medical examinations must 
include (1) a detailed work history and medical history, (2) a thorough 
physical examination, and (3) a series of laboratory tests designed to 
check your blood chemistry and your kidney function. In addition, at any 
time upon your request, a laboratory evaluation of male fertility will 
be made (microscopic examination of a sperm sample), or a pregnancy test 
will be given.
    The standard does not require that you participate in any of the 
medical procedures, tests, etc. which your employer is required to make 
available to you. Medical surveillance can, however, play a very 
important role in protecting your health. You are strongly encouraged, 
therefore, to participate in a meaningful fashion. The standard contains 
a multiple physician review mechanism which would give you a chance to 
have a physician of your choice directly participate in the medical 
surveillance program. If you were dissatisfied with an examination by a 
physician chosen by your employer, you could select a second physician 
to conduct an independent analysis. The two doctors would attempt to 
resolve any differences of opinion, and select a third physician to 
resolve any firm dispute. Generally your employer will choose the 
physician who conducts medical surveillance under the lead standard--
unless you and your employer can agree on the choice of a physician or 
physicians. Some companies and unions have agreed in advance, for 
example, to use certain independent medical laboratories or panels of 
physicians. Any of these arrangements are acceptable so long as required 
medical surveillance is made available to workers.
    The standard requires your employer to provide certain information 
to a physician to

[[Page 123]]

aid in his or her examination of you. This information includes (1) the 
standard and its appendices, (2) a description of your duties as they 
relate to lead exposure, (3) your exposure level, (4) a description of 
personal protective equipment you wear, (5) prior blood lead level 
results, and (6) prior written medical opinions concerning you that the 
employer has. After a medical examination or consultation the physician 
must prepare a written report which must contain (1) the physician's 
opinion as to whether you have any medical condition which places you at 
increased risk of material impairment to health from exposure to lead, 
(2) any recommended special protective measures to be provided to you, 
(3) any blood lead level determinations, and (4) any recommended 
limitation on your use of respirators. This last element must include a 
determination of whether you can wear a powered air purifying respirator 
(PAPR) if you are found unable to wear a negative pressure respirator.
    The medical surveillance program of the lead standard may at some 
point in time serve to notify certain workers that they have acquired a 
disease or other adverse medical condition as a result of occupational 
lead exposure. If this is true, these workers might have legal rights to 
compensation from public agencies, their employers, firms that supply 
hazardous products to their employers, or other persons. Some states 
have laws, including worker compensation laws, that disallow a worker 
who learns of a job-related health impairment to sue, unless the worker 
sues within a short period of time after learning of the impairment. 
(This period of time may be a matter of months or years.) An attorney 
can be consulted about these possibilities. It should be stressed that 
OSHA is in no way trying to either encourage or discourage claims or 
lawsuits. However, since results of the standard's medical surveillance 
program can significantly affect the legal remedies of a worker who has 
acquired a job-related disease or impairment, it is proper for OSHA to 
make you aware of this.
    The medical surveillance section of the standard also contains 
provisions dealing with chelation. Chelation is the use of certain drugs 
(administered in pill form or injected into the body) to reduce the 
amount of lead absorbed in body tissues. Experience accumulated by the 
medical and scientific communities has largely confirmed the 
effectiveness of this type of therapy for the treatment of very severe 
lead poisoning. On the other hand, it has also been established that 
there can be a long list of extremely harmful side effects associated 
with the use of chelating agents. The medical community has balanced the 
advantages and disadvantages resulting from the use of chelating agents 
in various circumstances and has established when the use of these 
agents is acceptable. The standard includes these accepted limitations 
due to a history of abuse of chelation therapy by some lead companies. 
The most widely used chelating agents are calcium disodium EDTA, (Ca 
Na<INF>2</INF> EDTA), Calcium Disodium Versenate (Versenate), and d-
penicillamine (pencillamine or Cupramine).
    The standard prohibits ``prophylactic chelation'' of any employee by 
any person the employer retains, supervises or controls. ``Prophylactic 
chelation'' is the routine use of chelating or similarly acting drugs to 
prevent elevated blood levels in workers who are occupationally exposed 
to lead, or the use of these drugs to routinely lower blood lead levels 
to predesignated concentrations believed to be `safe'. It should be 
emphasized that where an employer takes a worker who has no symptoms of 
lead poisoning and has chelation carried out by a physician (either 
inside or outside of a hospital) solely to reduce the worker's blood 
lead level, that will generally be considered prophylactic chelation. 
The use of a hospital and a physician does not mean that prophylactic 
chelation is not being performed. Routine chelation to prevent increased 
or reduce current blood lead levels is unacceptable whatever the 
setting.
    The standard allows the use of ``therapeutic'' or ``diagnostic'' 
chelation if administered under the supervision of a licensed physician 
in a clinical setting with thorough and appropriate medical monitoring. 
Therapeutic chelation responds to severe lead poisoning where there are 
marked symptoms. Diagnostic chelation involved giving a patient a dose 
of the drug then collecting all urine excreted for some period of time 
as an aid to the diagnosis of lead poisoning.
    In cases where the examining physician determines that chelation is 
appropriate, you must be notified in writing of this fact before such 
treatment. This will inform you of a potentially harmful treatment, and 
allow you to obtain a second opinion.

              ix. medical removal protection--paragraph (k)

    Excessive lead absorption subjects you to increased risk of disease. 
Medical removal protection (MRP) is a means of protecting you when, for 
whatever reasons, other methods, such as engineering controls, work 
practices, and respirators, have failed to provide the protection you 
need. MRP involves the temproary removal of a worker from his or her 
regular job to a place of significantly lower exposure without any loss 
of earnings, seniority, or other employment rights or benefits. The 
purpose of this program is to cease further lead absorption and allow 
your body to naturally excrete lead which has previously been absorbed. 
Temporary medical removal can result from an elevated blood lead level, 
or a medical opinion. Up to 18 months of protection is provided as a 
result

[[Page 124]]

of either form of removal. The vast majority of removed workers, 
however, will return to their former jobs long before this eighteen 
month period expires. The standard contains special provisions to deal 
with the extraordinary but possible case where a longterm worker's blood 
lead level does not adequately decline during eighteen months of 
removal.
    During the first year of the standard, if your blood lead level is 
80 <greek-m>g/100g or above you must be removed from any exposure where 
your air lead level without a respirator would be 100 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>or above. If you are removed from your normal job you may 
not be returned until your blood lead level declines to at least 60 
<greek-m>g/100g. These criteria for removal and return will change 
according to the following schedule:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          Removal blood lead     Air lead (<greek-m>g/      Return blood lead
                                          (<greek-m>g/100 g)              m<SUP>3</SUP>)               (<greek-m>g/100 g)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After Mar. 1, 1980...................  70 and above...........  50 and above...........  At or below 50.
After Mar. 1, 1981...................  60 and above...........  30 and above...........  At or below 40.
After Mar. 1, 1983...................  50 and above averaged    30 and above...........      Do.
                                        over six months.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You may also be removed from exposure even if your blood lead levels 
are below these criteria if a final medical determination indicates that 
you temporarily need reduced lead exposure for medical reasons. If the 
physician who is implementing your employers medical program makes a 
final written opinion recommending your removal or other special 
protective measures, your employer must implement the physician's 
recommendation. If you are removed in this manner, you may only be 
returned when the doctor indicates that it is safe for you to do so.
    The standard does not give specific instructions dealing with what 
an employer must do with a removed worker. Your job assignment upon 
removal is a matter for you, your employer and your union (if any) to 
work out consistent with existing procedures for job assignments. Each 
removal must be accomplished in a manner consistent with existing 
collective bargaining relationships. Your employer is given broad 
discretion to implement temporary removals so long as no attempt is made 
to override existing agreements. Similarly, a removed worker is provided 
no right to veto an employer's choice which satisfies the standard.
    In most cases, employers will likely transfer removed employees to 
other jobs with sufficiently low lead exposure. Alternatively, a 
worker's hours may be reduced so that the time weighted average exposure 
is reduced, or he or she may be temporarily laid off if no other 
alternative is feasible.
    In all of these situation, MRP benefits must be provided during the 
period of removal--i.e., you continue to receive the same earnings, 
seniority, and other rights and benefits you would have had if you had 
not been removed. Earnings includes more than just your base wage; it 
includes overtime, shift differentials, incentives, and other 
compensation you would have earned if you had not been removed. During 
the period of removal you must also be provided with appropriate follow-
up medical surveillance. If you were removed because your blood lead 
level was too high, you must be provided with a monthly blood test. If a 
medical opinion caused your removal, you must be provided medical tests 
or examinations that the doctor believes to be appropriate. If you do 
not participate in this follow up medical surveillance, you may lose 
your eligibility for MRP benefits.
    When you are medically eligible to return to your former job, your 
employer must return you to your ``former job status.'' This means that 
you are entitled to the position, wages, benefits, etc., you would have 
had if you had not been removed. If you would still be in your old job 
if no removal had occurred that is where you go back. If not, you are 
returned consistent with whatever job assignment discretion your 
employer would have had if no removal had occurred. MRP only seeks to 
maintain your rights, not expand them or diminish them.
    If you are removed under MRP and you are also eligible for worker 
compensation or other compensation for lost wages, your employer's MRP 
benefits obligation is reduced by the amount that you actually receive 
from these other sources. This is also true if you obtain other 
employment during the time you are laid off with MRP benefits.
    The standard also covers situations where an employer voluntarily 
removes a worker from exposure to lead due to the effects of lead on the 
employee's medical condition, even though the standard does not require 
removal. In these situations MRP benefits must still be provided as 
though the standard required removal. Finally, it is important to note 
that in all cases where removal is required, respirators cannot be used 
as a substitute. Respirators may be used before removal becomes 
necessary, but not as an alternative to a transfer to a low exposure 
job, or to a lay-off with MRP benefits.

           x. employee information and training--paragraph (l)

    Your employer is required to provide an information and training 
program for all employees exposed to lead above the action level or who 
may suffer skin or eye irritation from lead. This program must inform 
these employees of the specific hazards associated with their work 
environment, protective measures which can be taken, the danger of lead 
to their bodies (including their reproductive systems), and their rights 
under the standard. In addition your employer must make readily 
available to all employees, including those exposed below the action 
level, a copy of the standard and its appendices and must distribute to 
all employees any materials provided to the employer by the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
    Your employer is required to complete this training program for all 
employees by August 28, 1979. After this date, all new employees must be 
trained prior to initial assignment to areas where there is a 
possibility of exposure over the action level.
    This training program must also be provided at least annually 
thereafter.

                        xi. signs--paragraph (m)

    The standard requires that the following warning sign be posted in 
work areas where the exposure to lead exceeds the PEL:

                                 WARNING

                             LEAD WORK AREA

                          NO SMOKING OR EATING

                    xii. recordkeeping--paragraph (n)

    Your employer is required to keep all records of exposure monitoring 
for airborne lead. These records must include the name and job 
classification of employees measured, details of the sampling and 
analytic techniques, the results of this sampling, and the type of 
respiratory protection being worn by the person sampled. Your employer 
is also required to keep all records of biological monitoring and 
medical examination results. These must include the names of the 
employees, the physician's written opinion, and a copy of the results of 
the examination. All of the above kinds of records must be kept for 40 
years, or for at least 20 years after your termination of employment, 
whichever is longer.
    Recordkeeping is also required if you are temporarily removed from 
your job under the medical removal protection program. This record must 
include your name and social security number, the date of your removal 
and return, how the removal was or is being accomplished, and whether or 
not the reason for the removal was an elevated blood lead level. Your 
employer is required to keep each medical removal record only for as 
long as the duration of an employee's employment.
    The standard requires that if you request to see or copy 
environmental monitoring, blood lead level monitoring, or medical 
removal records, they must be made available to you or to a 
representative that you authorize. Your union also has access to these 
records. Medical records other than PbB's must also be provided upon 
request to you, to your physician or to any other person whom you may 
specifically designate. Your union does not have access to your personal 
medical records unless you authorize their access.

             xiii. observations of monitoring--paragraph (o)

    When air monitoring for lead is performed at your workplace as 
required by this standard, your employer must allow you or someone you 
designate to act as an observer of the monitoring. Observers are 
entitled to an explanation of the measurement procedure, and to record 
the results obtained. Since results will not normally be available at 
the time of the monitoring, observers are entitled to record or receive 
the results of the monitoring when returned by the laboratory. Your 
employer is required to provide the observer with any personal 
protective devices required to be worn by employees working in the area 
that is being monitored. The employer must require the observer to wear 
all such equipment and to comply with all other applicable safety and 
health procedures.

                   xiv. effective date--paragraph (p)

    The standard's effective data is March 1, 1979, and employer 
obligations under the standard begin to come into effect as of that 
date.

      Appendix C to Sec. 1910.1025--Medical Surveillance Guidelines

                              introduction

    The primary purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 is to assure, so far as possible, safe and healthful working 
conditions for every working man and woman. The occupational health 
standard for inorganic lead<SUP>1</SUP> was promulgated to protect 
workers exposed to inorganic lead including metallic lead, all inorganic 
lead compounds and organic lead soaps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>1</SUP> The term inorganic lead used throughout the medical 
surveillance appendices is meant to be synonymous with the definition of 
lead set forth in the standard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under this final standard in effect as of March 1, 1979, 
occupational exposure to inorganic lead is to be limited to 50 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> (micrograms per cubic meter) based on an 8 hour 
time-weighted average (TWA). This level of exposure eventually must be 
achieved through a combination of engineering, work practice and other 
administrative controls. Periods of time ranging from 1 to 10 years are 
provided for different industries to implement these controls. The 
schedule which is based on individual industry considerations is given 
in Table 1. Until these controls are in place, respirators must be used 
to meet the 50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> exposure limit.
    The standard also provides for a program of biological monitoring 
and medical surveillance for all employees exposed to levels of 
inorganic lead above the action level of 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> 
(TWA) for more than 30 days per year.
    The purpose of this document is to outline the medical surveillance 
provisions of the standard for inorganic lead, and to provide further 
information to the physician regarding the examination and evaluation of 
workers exposed to inorganic lead.
    Section 1 provides a detailed description of the monitoring 
procedure including the required frequency of blood testing for exposed 
workers, provisions for medical removal protection (MRP), the 
recommended right of the employee to a second medical opinion, and 
notification and recordkeeping requirements of the employer. A 
discussion of the requirements for respirator use and respirator 
monitoring and OSHA's position on prophylactic chelation therapy are 
also included in this section.
    Section 2 discusses the toxic effects and clinical manifestations of 
lead poisoning and effects of lead intoxication on enzymatic pathways in 
heme synthesis. The adverse effects on both male and female reproductive 
capacity and on the fetus are also discussed.
    Section 3 outlines the recommended medical evaluation of the worker 
exposed to inorganic lead including details of the medical history, 
physical examination, and recommended laboratory tests, which are based 
on the toxic effects of lead as discussed in Section 2.
    Section 4 provides detailed information concerning the laboratory 
tests available for the monitoring of exposed workers. Included also is 
a discussion of the relative value of each test and the limitations and 
precautions which are necessary in the interpretation of the laboratory 
results.

\1\ Airborne levels to be achieved without reliance or respirator protection through a combination of
  engineering, work practice and other administrative controls. While these controls are being implemented
  respirators must be used to meet the 50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> exposure limit.

i. medical surveillance and monitoring requirements for workers exposed 
                            to inorganic lead

    Under the occupational health standard for inorganic lead, a program 
of biological monitoring and medical surveillance is to be made 
available to all employees exposed to lead above the action level of 30 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> TWA for more than 30 days each year. This 
program consists of periodic blood sampling and medical evaluation to be 
performed on a schedule which is defined by previous laboratory results, 
worker complaints or concerns, and the clinical assessment of the 
examining physician.
    Under this program, the blood lead level of all employees who are 
exposed to lead above the action level of 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> is 
to be determined at least every six months. The frequency is increased 
to every two months for employees whose last blood lead level was 
between 40 <greek-m> g/100 g whole blood and the level requiring 
employee medical removal to be discussed below. For employees who are 
removed from exposure to lead due to an elevated blood lead, a new blood 
lead level must be measured monthly. A zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is 
required on each occasion that a blood lead level measurement is made.
    An annual medical examination and consultation performed under the 
guidelines discussed in Section 3 is to be made available to each 
employee for whom a blood test conducted at any time during the 
preceding 12 months indicated a blood lead level at or above 40 
<greek-m> g/100 g. Also, an examination is to be given to all employees 
prior to their assignment to an area in which airborne lead 
concentrations reach or exceed the action level. In addition, a medical 
examination must be provided as soon as possible after notification by 
an employee that the employee has developed signs or symptoms commonly 
associated with lead intoxication, that the employee desires medical 
advice regarding lead exposure and the ability to procreate a healthy 
child, or that the employee has demonstrated difficulty in breathing 
during a respirator fitting test or during respirator use. An 
examination is also to be made available to each employee removed from 
exposure to lead due to a risk of sustaining material impairment to 
health, or otherwise limited or specially protected pursuant to medical 
recommendations.
    Results of biological monitoring or the recommendations of an 
examining physician may necessitate removal of an employee from further 
lead exposure pursuant to the standard's medical removal protection 
(MRP) program. The object of the MRP program is to provide temporary 
medical removal to workers either with substantially elevated blood lead 
levels or otherwise at risk of sustaining material health impairment 
from continued substantial exposure to lead. The following guidelines 
which are summarized in Table 2 were created under the standard for the 
temporary removal of an exposed employee and his or her subsequent 
return to work in an exposure area.

 to work. Permissible exposure

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: When medical opinion indicates that an employee is at risk of material impairment from exposure to lead,
  the physician can remove an employee from exposures exceeding the action level (or less) or recommend special
  protective measures as deemed appropriate and necessary. Medical monitoring during the medical removal period
  can be more stringent than noted in the table above if the physician so specifies. Return to work or removal
  of limitations and special protections is permitted when the physician indicates that the worker is no longer
  at risk of material impairment.

    Under the standard's ultimate worker removal criteria, a worker is 
to be removed from any work having any eight hour TWA exposure to lead 
of 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> or more whenever either of the following 
circumstances apply: (1) a blood lead level of 60 <greek-m> g/100 g or 
greater is obtained and confirmed by a second follow-up blood lead level 
performed within two weeks after the employer receives the results of 
the first blood sampling test, or (2) the average of the previous three 
blood lead determinations or the average of all blood lead 
determinations conducted during the previous six months, whichever 
encompasses the longest time period, equals or exceeds 50 <greek-m> g/
100 g, unless the last blood sample indicates a blood lead level at or 
below 40 <greek-m> g/100 g in which case the employee need not be 
removed. Medical removal is to continue until two consecutive blood lead 
levels are 40 <greek-m> g/100 g or less.
    During the first two years that the ultimate removal criteria are 
being phased in, the return criteria have been set to assure that a 
worker's blood lead level has substantially declined during the period 
of removal. From March 1, 1979 to March 1, 1980, the blood lead level 
requiring employee medical removal is 80 <greek-m> g/100 g. Workers 
found to have a confirmed blood lead at this level or greater need only 
be removed from work having a daily 8 hour TWA exposure to lead at or 
above 100 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>. Workers so removed are to be 
returned to work when their blood lead levels are at or below 60 
<greek-m> g/100 g of whole blood. From March 1, 1980 to March 1, 1981, 
the blood lead level requiring medical removal is 70 <greek-m> g/100 g. 
During this period workers need only be removed from jobs having a daily 
8 hour TWA exposure to lead at or above 50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> and 
are to be returned to work when a level of 50 <greek-m> g/100 g is 
achieved. Beginning March 1, 1981, return depends on a worker's blood 
lead level declining to 40 <greek-m> g/100 g of whole blood.
    As part of the standard, the employer is required to notify in 
writing each employee whose blood lead level exceeds 40 <greek-m> g/100 
g. In addition each such employee is to be informed that the standard 
requires medical removal with MRP benefits, discussed below, when an 
employee's blood lead level exceeds the above defined limits.
    In addition to the above blood lead level criteria, temporary worker 
removal may also take place as a result of medical determinations and 
recommendations. Written medical opinions must be prepared after each 
examination pursuant to the standard. If the examining physician 
includes a medical finding, determination or opinion that the employee 
has a medical condition which

[[Page 129]]

places the employee at increased risk of material health impairment from 
exposure to lead, then the employee must be removed from exposure to 
lead at or above the action level. Alternatively, if the examining 
physician recommends special protective measures for an employee (e.g., 
use of a powered air purifying respirator) or recommends limitations on 
an employee's exposure to lead, then the employer must implement these 
recommendations. Recommendations may be more stringent than the specific 
provisions of the standard. The examining physician, therefore, is given 
broad flexibility to tailor special protective procedures to the needs 
of individual employees. This flexibility extends to the evaluation and 
management of pregnant workers and male and female workers who are 
planning to raise children. Based on the history, physical examination, 
and laboratory studies, the physician might recommend special protective 
measures or medical removal for an employee who is pregnant or who is 
planning to conceive a child when, in the physician's judgment, 
continued exposure to lead at the current job would pose a significant 
risk. The return of the employee to his or her former job status, or the 
removal of special protections or limitations, depends upon the 
examining physician determining that the employee is no longer at 
increased risk of material impairment or that special measures are no 
longer needed.
    During the period of any form of special protection or removal, the 
employer must maintain the worker's earnings, seniority, and other 
employment rights and benefits (as though the worker had not been 
removed) for a period of up to 18 months. This economic protection will 
maximize meaningful worker participation in the medical surveillance 
program, and is appropriate as part of the employer's overall obligation 
to provide a safe and healthful workplace. The provisions of MRP 
benefits during the employee's removal period may, however, be 
conditioned upon participation in medical surveillance.
    On rare occasions, an employee's blood lead level may not acceptably 
decline within 18 months of removal. This situation will arise only in 
unusual circumstances, thus the standard relies on an individual medical 
examination to determine how to protect such an employee. This medical 
determination is to be based on both laboratory values, including lead 
levels, zinc protoporphyrin levels, blood counts, and other tests felt 
to be warranted, as well as the physician's judgment that any symptoms 
or findings on physical examination are a result of lead toxicity. The 
medical determination may be that the employee is incapable of ever 
safely returning to his or her former job status. The medical 
determination may provide additional removal time past 18 months for 
some employees or specify special protective measures to be implemented.
    The lead standard provides for a multiple physician review in cases 
where the employee wishes a second opinion concerning potential lead 
poisoning or toxicity. If an employee wishes a second opinion, he or she 
can make an appointment with a physician of his or her choice. This 
second physician will review the findings, recommendations or 
determinations of the first physician and conduct any examinations, 
consultations or tests deemed necessary in an attempt to make a final 
medical determination. If the first and second physicians do not agree 
in their assessment they must try to resolve their differences. If they 
cannot reach an agreement then they must designate a third physician to 
resolve the dispute.
    The employer must provide examining and consulting physicians with 
the following specific information: a copy of the lead regulations and 
all appendices, a description of the employee's duties as related to 
exposure, the exposure level to lead and any other toxic substances (if 
applicable), a description of personal protective equipment used, blood 
lead levels, and all prior written medical opinions regarding the 
employee in the employer's possession or control. The employer must also 
obtain from the physician and provide the employee with a written 
medical opinion containing blood lead levels, the physicians's opinion 
as to whether the employee is at risk of material impairment to health, 
any recommended protective measures for the employee if further exposure 
is permitted, as well as any recommended limitations upon an employee's 
use of respirators.
    Employers must instruct each physician not to reveal to the employer 
in writing or in any other way his or her findings, laboratory results, 
or diagnoses which are felt to be unrelated to occupational lead 
exposure. They must also instruct each physician to advise the employee 
of any occupationally or non-occupationally related medical condition 
requiring further treatment or evaluation.
    The standard provides for the use of respirators where engineering 
and other primary controls have not been fully implemented. However, the 
use of respirator protection shall not be used in lieu of temporary 
medical removal due to elevated blood lead levels or findings that an 
employee is at risk of material health impairment. This is based on the 
numerous inadequacies of respirators including skin rash where the 
facepiece makes contact with the skin, unacceptable stress to breathing 
in some workers with underlying cardiopulmonary impairment, difficulty 
in providing adequate fit, the tendency for respirators to create 
additional hazards by interfering with vision, hearing, and mobility, 
and the difficulties of assuring the maximum effectiveness of a 
complicated work practice program involving respirators.

[[Page 130]]

Respirators do, however, serve a useful function where engineering and 
work practice controls are inadequate by providing supplementary, 
interim, or short-term protection, provided they are properly selected 
for the environment in which the employee will be working, properly 
fitted to the employee, maintained and cleaned periodically, and worn by 
the employee when required.
    In its final standard on occupational exposure to inorganic lead, 
OSHA has prohibited prophylactic chelation. Diagnostic and therapeutic 
chelation are permitted only under the supervision of a licensed 
physician with appropriate medical monitoring in an acceptable clinical 
setting. The decision to initiate chelation therapy must be made on an 
individual basis and take into account the severity of symptoms felt to 
be a result of lead toxicity along with blood lead levels, ZPP levels, 
and other laboratory tests as appropriate. EDTA and penicillamine which 
are the primary chelating agents used in the therapy of occupational 
lead poisoning have significant potential side effects and their use 
must be justified on the basis of expected benefits to the worker. 
Unless frank and severe symptoms are present, therapeutic chelation is 
not recommended given the opportunity to remove a worker from exposure 
and allow the body to naturally excrete accumulated lead. As a 
diagnostic aid, the chelation mobilization test using CA-EDTA has 
limited applicability. According to some investigators, the test can 
differentiate between lead-induced and other nephropathies. The test may 
also provide an estimation of the mobile fraction of the total body lead 
burden.
    Employers are required to assure that accurate records are 
maintained on exposure monitoring, medical surveillance, and medical 
removal for each employee. Exposure monitoring and medical surveillance 
records must be kept for 40 years or the duration of employment plus 20 
years, whichever is longer, while medical removal records must be 
maintained for the duration of employment. All records required under 
the standard must be made available upon request to the Assistant 
Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health and the Director 
of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Employers 
must also make environmental and biological monitoring and medical 
removal records available to affected employees and to former employees 
or their authorized employee representatives. Employees or their 
specifically designated representatives have access to their entire 
medical surveillance records.
    In addition, the standard requires that the employer inform all 
workers exposed to lead at or above the action level of the provisions 
of the standard and all its appendices, the purpose and description of 
medical surveillance and provisions for medical removal protection if 
temporary removal is required. An understanding of the potential health 
effects of lead exposure by all exposed employees along with full 
understanding of their rights under the lead standard is essential for 
an effective monitoring program.

              ii. adverse health effects of inorganic lead

    Although the toxicity of lead has been known for 2,000 years, the 
knowledge of the complex relationship between lead exposure and human 
response is still being refined. Significant research into the toxic 
properties of lead continues throughout the world, and it should be 
anticipated that our understanding of thresholds of effects and margins 
of safety will be improved in future years. The provisions of the lead 
standard are founded on two prime medical judgments: first, the 
prevention of adverse health effects from exposure to lead throughout a 
working lifetime requires that worker blood lead levels be maintained at 
or below 40 <greek-m> g/100 g and second, the blood lead levels of 
workers, male or female, who intend to parent in the near future should 
be maintained below 30 <greek-m> g/100 g to minimize adverse 
reproductive health effects to the parents and developing fetus. The 
adverse effects of lead on reproduction are being actively researched 
and OSHA encourages the physician to remain abreast of recent 
developments in the area to best advise pregnant workers or workers 
planning to conceive children.
    The spectrum of health effects caused by lead exposure can be 
subdivided into five developmental stages: normal, physiological changes 
of uncertain significance, pathophysiological changes, overt symptoms 
(morbidity), and mortality. Within this process there are no sharp 
distinctions, but rather a continuum of effects. Boundaries between 
categories overlap due to the wide variation of individual responses and 
exposures in the working population. OSHA's development of the lead 
standard focused on pathophysiological changes as well as later stages 
of disease.
    1. Heme Synthesis Inhibition. The earliest demonstrated effect of 
lead involves its ability to inhibit at least two enzymes of the heme 
synthesis pathway at very low blood levels. Inhibition of delta 
aminolevulinic acid dehydrase (ALA-D) which catalyzes the conversion of 
delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to protoporphyrin is observed at a blood 
lead level below 20 <greek-m> g/100 g whole blood. At a blood lead level 
of 40 ug/100 g, more than 20% of the population would have 70% 
inhibition of ALA-D. There is an exponential increase in ALA excretion 
at blood lead levels greater than 40 <greek-m> g/100 g.
    Another enzyme, ferrochelatase, is also inhibited at low blood lead 
levels. Inhibition of ferrochelatase leads to increased free erythrocyte 
protoporphyrin (FEP) in the blood

[[Page 131]]

which can then bind to zinc to yield zinc protoporphyrin. At a blood 
lead level of 50 <greek-m> g/100 g or greater, nearly 100% of the 
population will have an increase in FEP. There is also an exponential 
relationship between blood lead levels greater than 40 <greek-m> g/100 g 
and the associated ZPP level, which has led to the development of the 
ZPP screening test for lead exposure.
    While the significance of these effects is subject to debate, it is 
OSHA's position that these enzyme disturbances are early stages of a 
disease process which may eventually result in the clinical symptoms of 
lead poisoning. Whether or not the effects do progress to the later 
stages of clinical disease, disruption of these enzyme processes over a 
working lifetime is considered to be a material impairment of health.
    One of the eventual results of lead-induced inhibition of enzymes in 
the heme synthesis pathway is anemia which can be asymptomatic if mild 
but associated with a wide array of symptoms including dizziness, 
fatigue, and tachycardia when more severe. Studies have indicated that 
lead levels as low as 50 <greek-m> g/100 g can be associated with a 
definite decreased hemoglobin, although most cases of lead-induced 
anemia, as well as shortened red-cell survival times, occur at lead 
levels exceeding 80 <greek-m> g/100 g. Inhibited hemoglobin synthesis is 
more common in chronic cases whereas shortened erythrocyte life span is 
more common in acute cases.
    In lead-induced anemias, there is usually a reticulocytosis along 
with the presence of basophilic stippling, and ringed sideroblasts, 
although none of the above are pathognomonic for lead-induced anemia.
    2. Neurological Effects. Inorganic lead has been found to have toxic 
effects on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The earliest 
stages of lead-induced central nervous system effects first manifest 
themselves in the form of behavioral disturbances and central nervous 
system symptoms including irritability, restlessness, insomnia and other 
sleep disturbances, fatigue, vertigo, headache, poor memory, tremor, 
depression, and apathy. With more severe exposure, symptoms can progress 
to drowsiness, stupor, hallucinations, delerium, convulsions and coma.
    The most severe and acute form of lead poisoning which usually 
follows ingestion or inhalation of large amounts of lead is acute 
encephalopathy which may arise precipitously with the onset of 
intractable seizures, coma, cardiorespiratory arrest, and death within 
48 hours.
    While there is disagreement about what exposure levels are needed to 
produce the earliest symptoms, most experts agree that symptoms 
definitely can occur at blood lead levels of 60 <greek-m> g/100 g whole 
blood and therefore recommend a 40 <greek-m> g/100 g maximum. The 
central nervous system effects frequently are not reversible following 
discontinued exposure or chelation therapy and when improvement does 
occur, it is almost always only partial.
    The peripheral neuropathy resulting from lead exposure 
characteristically involves only motor function with minimal sensory 
damage and has a marked predilection for the extensor muscles of the 
most active extremity. The peripheral neuropathy can occur with varying 
degrees of severity. The earliest and mildest form which can be detected 
in workers with blood lead levels as low as 50 <greek-m> g/100 g is 
manifested by slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity often without 
clinical symptoms. With progression of the neuropathy there is 
development of painless extensor muscle weakness usually involving the 
extensor muscles of the fingers and hand in the most active upper 
extremity, followed in severe cases by wrist drop or, much less 
commonly, foot drop.
    In addition to slowing of nerve conduction, electromyographical 
studies in patients with blood lead levels greater than 50 <greek-m> g/
100 g have demonstrated a decrease in the number of acting motor unit 
potentials, an increase in the duration of motor unit potentials, and 
spontaneous pathological activity including fibrillations and 
fasciculations. Whether these effects occur at levels of 40 <greek-m> g/
100 g is undetermined.
    While the peripheral neuropathies can occasionally be reversed with 
therapy, again such recovery is not assured particularly in the more 
severe neuropathies and often improvement is only partial. The lack of 
reversibility is felt to be due in part to segmental demyelination.
    3. Gastrointestinal. Lead may also affect the gastrointestinal 
system producing abdominal colic or diffuse abdominal pain, 
constipation, obstipation, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Lead 
colic rarely develops at blood lead levels below 80 <greek-m> g/100 g.
    4. Renal. Renal toxicity represents one of the most serious health 
effects of lead poisoning. In the early stages of disease nuclear 
inclusion bodies can frequently be identified in proximal renal tubular 
cells. Renal function remains normal and the changes in this stage are 
probably reversible. With more advanced disease there is progressive 
interstitial fibrosis and impaired renal function. Eventually extensive 
interstitial fibrosis ensues with sclerotic glomeruli and dilated and 
atrophied proximal tubules; all represent end stage kidney disease. 
Azotemia can be progressive, eventually resulting in frank uremia 
necessitating dialysis. There is occasionally associated hypertension 
and hyperuricemia with or without gout.
    Early kidney disease is difficult to detect. The urinalysis is 
normal in early lead nephropathy and the blood urea nitrogen and serum 
creatinine increase only when two-

[[Page 132]]

thirds of kidney function is lost. Measurement of creatinine clearance 
can often detect earlier disease as can other methods of measurement of 
glomerular filtration rate. An abnormal Ca-EDTA mobilization test has 
been used to differentiate between lead-induced and other nephropathies, 
but this procedure is not widely accepted. A form of Fanconi syndrome 
with aminoaciduria, glycosuria, and hyperphosphaturia indicating severe 
injury to the proximal renal tubules is occasionally seen in children.
    5. Reproductive effects. Exposure to lead can have serious effects 
on reproductive function in both males and females. In male workers 
exposed to lead there can be a decrease in sexual drive, impotence, 
decreased ability to produce healthy sperm, and sterility. Malformed 
sperm (teratospermia), decreased number of sperm (hypospermia), and 
sperm with decreased motility (asthenospermia) can all occur. 
Teratospermia has been noted at mean blood lead levels of 53 <greek-m> 
g/100 g and hypospermia and asthenospermia at 41 <greek-m> g/100 g. 
Furthermore, there appears to be a dose-response relationship for 
teratospermia in lead exposed workers.
    Women exposed to lead may experience menstrual disturbances 
including dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and amenorrhea. Following exposure 
to lead, women have a higher frequency of sterility, premature births, 
spontaneous miscarriages, and stillbirths.
    Germ cells can be affected by lead and cause genetic damage in the 
egg or sperm cells before conception and result in failure to implant, 
miscarriage, stillbirth, or birth defects.
    Infants of mothers with lead poisoning have a higher mortality 
during the first year and suffer from lowered birth weights, slower 
growth, and nervous system disorders.
    Lead can pass through the placental barrier and lead levels in the 
mother's blood are comparable to concentrations of lead in the umbilical 
cord at birth. Transplacental passage becomes detectable at 12-14 weeks 
of gestation and increases until birth.
    There is little direct data on damage to the fetus from exposure to 
lead but it is generally assumed that the fetus and newborn would be at 
least as susceptible to neurological damage as young children. Blood 
lead levels of 50-60 <greek-m> g/100 g in children can cause significant 
neurobehavioral impairments and there is evidence of hyperactivity at 
blood levels as low as 25 <greek-m> g/100 g. Given the overall body of 
literature concerning the adverse health effects of lead in children, 
OSHA feels that the blood lead level in children should be maintained 
below 30 <greek-m> g/100 g with a population mean of 15 <greek-m> g/100 
g. Blood lead levels in the fetus and newborn likewise should not exceed 
30 <greek-m> g/100 g.
    Because of lead's ability to pass through the placental barrier and 
also because of the demonstrated adverse effects of lead on reproductive 
function in both the male and female as well as the risk of genetic 
damage of lead on both the ovum and sperm, OSHA recommends a 30 
<greek-m> g/100 g maximum permissible blood lead level in both males and 
females who wish to bear children.
    6. Other toxic effects. Debate and research continue on the effects 
of lead on the human body. Hypertension has frequently been noted in 
occupationally exposed individuals although it is difficult to assess 
whether this is due to lead's adverse effects on the kidney or if some 
other mechanism is involved. Vascular and electrocardiogarphic changes 
have been detected but have not been well characterized. Lead is thought 
to impair thyroid function and interfere with the pituitary-adrenal 
axis, but again these effects have not been well defined.

                         iii. medical evaluation

    The most important principle in evaluating a worker for any 
occupational disease including lead poisoning is a high index of 
suspicion on the part of the examining physician. As discussed in 
Section 2, lead can affect numerous organ systems and produce a wide 
array of signs and symptoms, most of which are non-specific and subtle 
in nature at least in the early stages of disease. Unless serious 
concern for lead toxicity is present, many of the early clues to 
diagnosis may easily be overlooked.
    The crucial initial step in the medical evaluation is recognizing 
that a worker's employment can result in exposure to lead. The worker 
will frequently be able to define exposures to lead and lead containing 
materials but often will not volunteer this information unless 
specifically asked. In other situations the worker may not know of any 
exposures to lead but the suspicion might be raised on the part of the 
physician because of the industry or occupation of the worker. Potential 
occupational exposure to lead and its compounds occur in at least 120 
occupations, including lead smelting, the manufacture of lead storage 
batteries, the manufacture of lead pigments and products containing 
pigments, solder manufacture, shipbuilding and ship repair, auto 
manufacturing, construction, and painting.
    Once the possibility for lead exposure is raised, the focus can then 
be directed toward eliciting information from the medical history, 
physical exam, and finally from laboratory data to evaluate the worker 
for potential lead toxicity.
    A complete and detailed work history is important in the initial 
evaluation. A listing of all previous employment with information on 
work processes, exposure to fumes or dust, known exposures to lead or 
other toxic substances, respiratory protection used, and previous 
medical surveillance should all be

[[Page 133]]

included in the worker's record. Where exposure to lead is suspected, 
information concerning on-the-job personal hygiene, smoking or eating 
habits in work areas, laundry procedures, and use of any protective 
clothing or respiratory protection equipment should be noted. A complete 
work history is essential in the medical evaluation of a worker with 
suspected lead toxicity, especially when long term effects such as 
neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity are considered.
    The medical history is also of fundamental importance and should 
include a listing of all past and current medical conditions, current 
medications including proprietary drug intake, previous surgeries and 
hospitalizations, allergies, smoking history, alcohol consumption, and 
also non-occupational lead exposures such as hobbies (hunting, riflery). 
Also known childhood exposures should be elicited. Any previous history 
of hematological, neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, psychological, 
gynecological, genetic, or reproductive problems should be specifically 
noted.
    A careful and complete review must be performed to assess both 
recognized complaints and subtle or slowly acquired symptoms which the 
worker might not appreciate as being significant. The review of symptoms 
should include the following:
    General--weight loss, fatigue, decreased appetite.
    Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat (HEENT)--headaches, visual 
disturbances or decreased visual acuity, hearing deficits or tinnitus, 
pigmentation of the oral mucosa, or metallic taste in mouth.
    Cardio-pulmonary--shortness of breath, cough, chest pains, 
palpitations, or orthopnea.
    Gastrointestinal--nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, 
constipation or diarrhea.
    Neurologic--irritability, insomnia, weakness (fatigue), dizziness, 
loss of memory, confusion, hallucinations, incoordination, ataxia, 
decreased strength in hands or feet, disturbances in gait, difficulty in 
climbing stairs, or seizures.
    Hematologic--pallor, easy fatigability, abnormal blood loss, melena.
    Reproductive (male and female and spouse where relevant)--history of 
infertility, impotence, loss of libido, abnormal menstrual periods, 
history of miscarriages, stillbirths, or children with birth defects.
    Musculo-skeletal--muscle and joint pains.
    The physical examination should emphasize the neurological, 
gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems. The worker's weight and 
blood pressure should be recorded and the oral mucosa checked for 
pigmentation characteristic of a possible Burtonian or lead line on the 
gingiva. It should be noted, however, that the lead line may not be 
present even in severe lead poisoning if good oral hygiene is practiced.
    The presence of pallor on skin examination may indicate an anemia, 
which if severe might also be associated with a tachycardia. If an 
anemia is suspected, an active search for blood loss should be 
undertaken including potential blood loss through the gastrointestinal 
tract.
    A complete neurological examination should include an adequate 
mental status evaluation including a search for behavioral and 
psychological disturbances, memory testing, evaluation for irritability, 
insomnia, hallucinations, and mental clouding. Gait and coordination 
should be examined along with close observation for tremor. A detailed 
evaluation of peripheral nerve function including careful sensory and 
motor function testing is warranted. Strength testing particularly of 
extensor muscle groups of all extremities is of fundamental importance.
    Cranial nerve evaluation should also be included in the routine 
examination.
    The abdominal examination should include auscultation for bowel 
sounds and abdominal bruits and palpation for organomegaly, masses, and 
diffuse abdominal tenderness.
    Cardiovascular examination should evaluate possible early signs of 
congestive heart failure. Pulmonary status should be addressed 
particularly if respirator protection is contemplated.
    As part of the medical evaluation, the lead standard requires the 
following laboratory studies:
    1. Blood lead level
    2. Hemoglobin and hematocrit determinations, red cell indices, and 
examination of the peripheral blood smear to evaluate red blood cell 
morphology
    3. Blood urea nitrogen
    4. Serum creatinine
    5. Routine urinalysis with microscopic examination.
    6. A zinc protoporphyrin level
    In addition to the above, the physician is authorized to order any 
further laboratory or other tests which he or she deems necessary in 
accordance with sound medical practice. The evaluation must also include 
pregnancy testing or laboratory evaluation of male fertility if 
requested by the employee.
    Additional tests which are probably not warranted on a routine basis 
but may be appropriate when blood lead and ZPP levels are equivocal 
include delta aminolevulinic acid and coproporphyrin concentrations in 
the urine, and dark-field illumination for detection of basophilic 
stippling in red blood cells.

[[Page 134]]

    If an anemia is detected further studies including a careful 
examination of the peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, stool for 
occult blood, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, bilirubin, and, 
if appropriate, vitamin B12 and folate may be of value in attempting to 
identify the cause of the anemia.
    If a peripheral neuropathy is suspected, nerve conduction studies 
are warranted both for diagnosis and as a basis to monitor any therapy.
    If renal disease is questioned, a 24 hour urine collection for 
creatinine clearance, protein, and electrolytes may be indicated. 
Elevated uric acid levels may result from lead-induced renal disease and 
a serum uric acid level might be performed.
    An electrocardiogram and chest x-ray may be obtained as deemed 
appropriate.
    Sophisticated and highly specialized testing should not be done 
routinely and where indicated should be under the direction of a 
specialist.

                        iv. laboratory evaluation

    The blood lead level at present remains the single most important 
test to monitor lead exposure and is the test used in the medical 
surveillance program under the lead standard to guide employee medical 
removal. The ZPP has several advantages over the blood lead level. 
Because of its relatively recent development and the lack of extensive 
data concerning its interpretation, the ZPP currently remains an 
ancillary test.
    This section will discuss the blood lead level and ZPP in detail and 
will outline their relative advantages and disadvantages. Other blood 
tests currently available to evaluate lead exposure will also be 
reviewed.
    The blood lead level is a good index of current or recent lead 
absorption when there is no anemia present and when the worker has not 
taken any chelating agents. However, blood lead levels along with 
urinary lead levels do not necessarily indicate the total body burden of 
lead and are not adequate measures of past exposure. One reason for this 
is that lead has a high affinity for bone and up to 90% of the body's 
total lead is deposited there. A very important component of the total 
lead body burden is lead in soft tissue (liver, kidney, and brain). This 
fraction of the lead body burden, the biologically active lead, is not 
entirely reflected by blood lead levels since it is a function of the 
dynamics of lead absorption, distribution, deposition in bone and 
excretion. Following discontinuation of exposure to lead, the excess 
body burden is only slowly mobilized from bone and other relatively 
stable body stores and excreted. Consequently, a high blood lead level 
may only represent recent heavy exposure to lead without a significant 
total body excess and likewise a low blood lead level does not exclude 
an elevated total body burden of lead.
    Also due to its correlation with recent exposures, the blood lead 
level may vary considerably over short time intervals.
    To minimize laboratory error and erroneous results due to 
contamination, blood specimens must be carefully collected after 
thorough cleaning of the skin with appropriate methods using lead-free 
blood containers and analyzed by a reliable laboratory. Under the 
standard, samples must be analyzed in laboratories which are approved by 
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) or which have received satisfactory 
grades in proficiency testing by the CDC in the previous year. Analysis 
is to be made using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, anodic 
stripping voltammetry or any method which meets the accuracy 
requirements set forth by the standard.
    The determination of lead in urine is generally considered a less 
reliable monitoring technique than analysis of whole blood primarily due 
to individual variability in urinary excretion capacity as well as the 
technical difficulty of obtaining accurate 24 hour urine collections. In 
addition, workers with renal insufficiency, whether due to lead or some 
other cause, may have decreased lead clearance and consequently urine 
lead levels may underestimate the true lead burden. Therefore, urine 
lead levels should not be used as a routine test.
    The zinc protoporphyrin test, unlike the blood lead determination, 
measures an adverse metabolic effect of lead and as such is a better 
indicator of lead toxicity than the level of blood lead itself. The 
level of ZPP reflects lead absorption over the preceding 3 to 4 months, 
and therefore is a better indicator of lead body burden. The ZPP 
requires more time than the blood lead to read significantly elevated 
levels; the return to normal after discontinuing lead exposure is also 
slower. Furthermore, the ZPP test is simpler, faster, and less expensive 
to perform and no contamination is possible. Many investigators believe 
it is the most reliable means of monitoring chronic lead absorption.
    Zinc protoporphyrin results from the inhibition of the enzyme 
ferrochelatase which catalyzes the insertion of an iron molecule into 
the protoporphyrin molecule, which then becomes heme. If iron is not 
inserted into the molecule then zinc, having a greater affinity for 
protoporphyrin, takes the place of the iron, forming ZPP.
    An elevation in the level of circulating ZPP may occur at blood lead 
levels as low as 20-30 <greek-m> g/100 g in some workers. Once the blood 
lead level has reached 40 <greek-m> g/100 g there is more marked rise in 
the ZPP value from its normal range of less than 100 <greek-m> g/100 ml. 
Increases in blood lead levels beyond 40 <greek-m> g/

[[Page 135]]

100 g are associated with exponential increases in ZPP.
    Whereas blood lead levels fluctuate over short time spans, ZPP 
levels remain relatively stable. ZPP is measured directly in red blood 
cells and is present for the cell's entire 120 day life-span. Therefore, 
the ZPP level in blood reflects the average ZPP production over the 
previous 3-4 months and consequently the average lead exposure during 
that time interval.
    It is recommended that a hematocrit be determined whenever a 
confirmed ZPP of 50 <greek-m> g/100 ml whole blood is obtained to rule 
out a significant underlying anemia. If the ZPP is in excess of 100 
<greek-m> g/100 ml and not associated with abnormal elevations in blood 
lead levels, the laboratory should be checked to be sure that blood 
leads were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry anodic 
stripping voltammetry, or any method which meets the accuracy 
requirements set forth by the standard by a CDC approved laboratory 
which is experienced in lead level determinations. Repeat periodic blood 
lead studies should be obtained in all individuals with elevated ZPP 
levels to be certain that an associated elevated blood lead level has 
not been missed due to transient fluctuations in blood leads.
    ZPP has a characteristic fluorescence spectrum with a peak at 594 nm 
which is detectable with a hematofluorimeter. The hematofluorimeter is 
accurate and portable and can provide on-site, instantaneous results for 
workers who can be frequently tested via a finger prick.
    However, careful attention must be given to calibration and quality 
control procedures. Limited data on blood lead--ZPP correlations and the 
ZPP levels which are associated with the adverse health effects 
discussed in Section 2 are the major limitations of the test. Also it is 
difficult to correlate ZPP levels with environmental exposure and there 
is some variation of response with age and sex. Nevertheless, the ZPP 
promises to be an important diagnostic test for the early detection of 
lead toxicity and its value will increase as more data is collected 
regarding its relationship to other manifestations of lead poisoning.
    Levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the urine are also used 
as a measure of lead exposure. Increasing concentrations of ALA are 
believed to result from the inhibition of the enzyme delta-
aminolevulinic acid dehydrase (ALA-D). Although the test is relatively 
easy to perform, inexpensive, and rapid, the disadvantages include 
variability in results, the necessity to collect a complete 24 hour 
urine sample which has a specific gravity greater than 1.010, and also 
the fact that ALA decomposes in the presence of light.
    The pattern of porphyrin excretion in the urine can also be helpful 
in identifying lead intoxication. With lead poisoning, the urine 
concentrations of coproporphyrins I and II, porphobilinogen and 
uroporphyrin I rise. The most important increase, however, is that of 
coproporphyrin III; levels may exceed 5,000 <greek-m> g/1 in the urine 
in lead poisoned individuals, but its correlation with blood lead levels 
and ZPP are not as good as those of ALA. Increases in urinary porphyrins 
are not diagnostic of lead toxicity and may be seen in porphyria, some 
liver diseases, and in patients with high reticulocyte counts.
    Summary. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's 
standard for inorganic lead places significant emphasis on the medical 
surveillance of all workers exposed to levels of inorganic lead above 
the action level of 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> TWA. The physician has a 
fundamental role in this surveillance program, and in the operation of 
the medical removal protection program.
    Even with adequate worker education on the adverse health effects of 
lead and appropriate training in work practices, personal hygiene and 
other control measures, the physician has a primary responsibility for 
evaluating potential lead toxicity in the worker. It is only through a 
careful and detailed medical and work history, a complete physical 
examination and appropriate laboratory testing that an accurate 
assessment can be made. Many of the adverse health effects of lead 
toxicity are either irreversible or only partially reversible and 
therefore early detection of disease is very important.
    This document outlines the medical monitoring program as defined by 
the occupational safety and health standard for inorganic lead. It 
reviews the adverse health effects of lead poisoning and describes the 
important elements of the history and physical examinations as they 
relate to these adverse effects. Finally, the appropriate laboratory 
testing for evaluating lead exposure and toxicity is presented.
    It is hoped that this review and discussion will give the physician 
a better understanding of the OSHA standard with the ultimate goal of 
protecting the health and well-being of the worker exposed to lead under 
his or her care.

Sec. 1910.1025 see the List of CFR Sections Afffected in the Finding 
Aids section of this volume.


<R05>
Sec. 1910.1027  Cadmium.

    (a) Scope. This standard applies to all occupational exposures to 
cadmium and cadmium compounds, in all forms,

[[Page 136]]

and in all industries covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 
except the construction-related industries, which are covered under 29 
CFR 1926.63.
    (b) Definitions.
    Action level (AL) is defined as an airborne concentration of cadmium 
of 2.5 micrograms per cubic meter of air (2.5 <greek-m>g/m\3\), 
calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA).
    Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee.
    Authorized person means any person authorized by the employer and 
required by work duties to be present in regulated areas or any person 
authorized by the OSH Act or regulations issued under it to be in 
regulated areas.
    Director means the Director of the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services, or designee.
    Employee exposure and similar language referring to the air cadmium 
level to which an employee is exposed means the exposure to airborne 
cadmium that would occur if the employee were not using respiratory 
protective equipment.
    Final medical determination is the written medical opinion of the 
employee's health status by the examining physician under paragraphs 
(l)(3)-(12) of this section or, if multiple physician review under 
paragraph (l)(13) of this section or the alternative physician 
determination under paragraph (l)(14) of this section is invoked, it is 
the final, written medical finding, recommendation or determination that 
emerges from that process.
    High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter means a filter capable 
of trapping and retaining at least 99.97 percent of mono-dispersed 
particles of 0.3 micrometers in diameter.
    Regulated area means an area demarcated by the employer where an 
employee's exposure to airborne concentrations of cadmium exceeds, or 
can reasonably be expected to exceed the permissible exposure limit 
(PEL).
    This section means this cadmium standard.
    (c) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). The employer shall assure that 
no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of cadmium in excess 
of five micrograms per cubic meter of air (5 <greek-m>g/m\3\), 
calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average exposure (TWA).
    (d) Exposure monitoring--(1) General. (i) Each employer who has a 
workplace or work operation covered by this section shall determine if 
any employee may be exposed to cadmium at or above the action level.
    (ii) Determinations of employee exposure shall be made from 
breathing zone air samples that reflect the monitored employee's 
regular, daily 8-hour TWA exposure to cadmium.
    (iii) Eight-hour TWA exposures shall be determined for each employee 
on the basis of one or more personal breathing zone air samples 
reflecting full shift exposure on each shift, for each job 
classification, in each work area. Where several employees perform the 
same job tasks, in the same job classification, on the same shift, in 
the same work area, and the length, duration, and level of cadmium 
exposures are similar, an employer may sample a representative fraction 
of the employees instead of all employees in order to meet this 
requirement. In representative sampling, the employer shall sample the 
employee(s) expected to have the highest cadmium exposures.
    (2) Specific. (i) Initial monitoring. Except as provided for in 
paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the employer 
shall monitor employee exposures and shall base initial determinations 
on the monitoring results.
    (ii) Where the employer has monitored after September 14, 1991, 
under conditions that in all important aspects closely resemble those 
currently prevailing and where that monitoring satisfies all other 
requirements of this section, including the accuracy and confidence 
levels of paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the employer may rely on 
such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 
(d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Where the employer has objective data, as defined in paragraph 
(n)(2) of this section, demonstrating that employee exposure to cadmium 
will not

[[Page 137]]

exceed the action level under the expected conditions of processing, 
use, or handling, the employer may rely upon such data instead of 
implementing initial monitoring.
    (3) Monitoring Frequency (periodic monitoring). (i) If the initial 
monitoring or periodic monitoring reveals employee exposures to be at or 
above the action level, the employer shall monitor at a frequency and 
pattern needed to represent the levels of exposure of employees and 
where exposures are above the PEL to assure the adequacy of respiratory 
selection and the effectiveness of engineering and work practice 
controls. However, such exposure monitoring shall be performed at least 
every six months. The employer, at a minimum, shall continue these semi-
annual measurements unless and until the conditions set out in paragraph 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section are met.
    (ii) If the initial monitoring or the periodic monitoring indicates 
that employee exposures are below the action level and that result is 
confirmed by the results of another monitoring taken at least seven days 
later, the employer may discontinue the monitoring for those employees 
whose exposures are represented by such monitoring.
    (4) Additional Monitoring. The employer also shall institute the 
exposure monitoring required under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(3) of 
this section whenever there has been a change in the raw materials, 
equipment, personnel, work practices, or finished products that may 
result in additional employees being exposed to cadmium at or above the 
action level or in employees already exposed to cadmium at or above the 
action level being exposed above the PEL, or whenever the employer has 
any reason to suspect that any other change might result in such further 
exposure.
    (5) Employee Notification of Monitoring Results. (i) Within 15 
working days after the receipt of the results of any monitoring 
performed under this section, the employer shall notify each affected 
employee individually in writing of the results. In addition, within the 
same time period the employer shall post the results of the exposure 
monitoring in an appropriate location that is accessible to all affected 
employees.
    (ii) Wherever monitoring results indicate that employee exposure 
exceeds the PEL, the employer shall include in the written notice a 
statement that the PEL has been exceeded and a description of the 
corrective action being taken by the employer to reduce employee 
exposure to or below the PEL.
    (6) Accuracy of measurement. The employer shall use a method of 
monitoring and analysis that has an accuracy of not less than plus or 
minus 25 percent (<plus-minus>25%), with a confidence level of 95 
percent, for airborne concentrations of cadmium at or above the action 
level, the permissible exposure limit (PEL), and the separate 
engineering control air limit (SECAL).
    (e) Regulated areas--(1) Establishment. The employer shall establish 
a regulated area wherever an employee's exposure to airborne 
concentrations of cadmium is, or can reasonably be expected to be in 
excess of the permissible exposure limit (PEL).
    (2) Demarcation. Regulated areas shall be demarcated from the rest 
of the workplace in any manner that adequately establishes and alerts 
employees of the boundaries of the regulated area.
    (3) Access. Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons.
    (4) Provision of respirators. Each person entering a regulated area 
shall be supplied with and required to use a respirator, selected in 
accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (5) Prohibited activities. The employer shall assure that employees 
do not eat, drink, smoke, chew tobacco or gum, or apply cosmetics in 
regulated areas, carry the products associated with these activities 
into regulated areas, or store such products in those areas.
    (f) Methods of compliance--(1) Compliance hierarchy. (i) Except as 
specified in paragraphs (f)(1) (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section the 
employer shall implement engineering and work practice controls to 
reduce and maintain employee exposure to cadmium at or below the PEL, 
except to the extent that the employer can demonstrate that such 
controls are not feasible.
    (ii) Except as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this 
section, in industries where a separate engineering control air limit 
(SECAL) has been

[[Page 138]]

specified for particular processes (See Table 1 in this paragraph 
(f)(1)(ii)), the employer shall implement engineering and work practice 
controls to reduce and maintain employee exposure at or below the SECAL, 
except to the extent that the employer can demonstrate that such 
controls are not feasible.

*Processes in these industries that are not specified in this table must
  achieve the PEL using engineering controls and work practices as
  required in f(1)(i).

    (iii) The requirement to implement engineering and work practice 
controls to achieve the PEL or, where applicable, the SECAL does not 
apply where the employer demonstrates the following:
    (A) The employee is only intermittently exposed; and
    (B) The employee is not exposed above the PEL on 30 or more days per 
year (12 consecutive months).
    (iv) Wherever engineering and work practice controls are required 
and are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the PEL 
or, where applicable, the SECAL, the employer nonetheless shall 
implement such controls to reduce exposures to the lowest levels 
achievable. The employer shall supplement such controls with respiratory 
protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this 
section and the PEL.
    (v) The employer shall not use employee rotation as a method of 
compliance.
    (2) Compliance program. (i) Where the PEL is exceeded, the employer 
shall establish and implement a written compliance program to reduce 
employee exposure to or below the PEL by means of engineering and work 
practice controls, as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section. To 
the extent that engineering and work practice controls cannot reduce 
exposures to or below the PEL, the employer shall include in the written 
compliance program the use of appropriate respiratory protection to 
achieve compliance with the PEL.
    (ii) Written compliance programs shall include at least the 
following:
    (A) A description of each operation in which cadmium is emitted; 
e.g., machinery used, material processed, controls in place, crew size, 
employee job responsibilities, operating procedures, and maintenance 
practices;
    (B) A description of the specific means that will be employed to 
achieve compliance, including engineering plans and studies used to 
determine methods selected for controlling exposure to cadmium, as well 
as, where necessary, the use of appropriate respiratory protection to 
achieve the PEL;
    (C) A report of the technology considered in meeting the PEL;
    (D) Air monitoring data that document the sources of cadmium 
emissions;
    (E) A detailed schedule for implementation of the program, including 
documentation such as copies of purchase orders for equipment, 
construction contracts, etc.;
    (F) A work practice program that includes items required under 
paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of this section;
    (G) A written plan for emergency situations, as specified in 
paragraph (h) of this section; and
    (H) Other relevant information.
    (iii) The written compliance programs shall be reviewed and updated 
at

[[Page 139]]

least annually, or more often if necessary, to reflect significant 
changes in the employer's compliance status.
    (iv) Written compliance programs shall be provided upon request for 
examination and copying to affected employees, designated employee 
representatives as well as to the Assistant Secretary, and the Director.
    (3) Mechanical ventilation. (i) When ventilation is used to control 
exposure, measurements that demonstrate the effectiveness of the system 
in controlling exposure, such as capture velocity, duct velocity, or 
static pressure shall be made as necessary to maintain its 
effectiveness.
    (ii) Measurements of the system's effectiveness in controlling 
exposure shall be made as necessary within five working days of any 
change in production, process, or control that might result in a 
significant increase in employee exposure to cadmium.
    (iii) Recirculation of air. If air from exhaust ventilation is 
recirculated into the workplace, the system shall have a high efficiency 
filter and be monitored to assure effectiveness.
    (iv) Procedures shall be developed and implemented to minimize 
employee exposure to cadmium when maintenance of ventilation systems and

    (g) Respiratory protection--(1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering 
and work-practice controls when employee exposure levels exceed the PEL.
    (ii) Maintenance and repair activities, and brief or intermittent 
operations, for which employee exposures exceed the PEL and engineering 
and work-practice controls are not feasible or are not required.
    (iii) Activities in regulated areas specified in paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (iv) Work operations for which the employer has implemented all 
feasible engineering and work-practice controls and such controls are 
not sufficient to reduce employee exposures to or below the PEL.
    (v) Work operations for which an employee is exposed to cadmium at 
or above the action level, and the employee requests a respirator.
    (vi) Work operations for which an employee is exposed to cadmium 
above the PEL and engineering controls are not required by paragraph 
(f)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (vii) Emergencies.
    (2) Respirator program. (i) The employer must implement a 
respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b) 
through (d) (except (d)(1)(iii)), and (f) through (m).
    (ii) No employees must use a respirator if, based on their most 
recent medical examination, the examining physician determines that they 
will be unable to continue to function normally while using a 
respirator. If the physician determines that the employee must be 
limited in, or removed from, their current job because of their 
inability to use a respirator, the limitation or removal must be in 
accordance with paragraphs (l) (11) and (12) of this section.
    (iii) If an employee has breathing difficulty during fit testing or 
respirator use, the employer must provide the employee with a medical 
examination in accordance with paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section to 
determine if the employee can use a respirator while performing the 
required duties.

    (l) Medical surveillance--(1) General--(i) Scope. (A) Currently 
exposed--The employer shall institute a medical surveillance program for 
all employees who are or may be exposed to cadmium at or above the 
action level unless the employer demonstrates that the employee is not, 
and will not be, exposed at or above the action level on 30 or more days 
per year (twelve consecutive months); and,
    (B) Previously exposed--The employer shall also institute a medical 
surveillance program for all employees who prior to the effective date 
of this section might previously have been exposed to cadmium at or 
above the action level by the employer, unless the employer demonstrates 
that the employee did not prior to the effective date of this section 
work for the employer in jobs with exposure to cadmium for an aggregated 
total of more than 60 months.
    (ii) To determine an employee's fitness for using a respirator, the 
employer shall provide the limited medical examination specified in 
paragraph (l)(6) of this section.
    (iii) The employer shall assure that all medical examinations and 
procedures required by this standard are performed by or under the 
supervision of a licensed physician, who has read and is familiar with 
the health effects section of appendix A to this section, the regulatory 
text of this section, the protocol for sample handling and laboratory 
selection in appendix F to this section, and the questionnaire of 
appendix D to this section. These examinations and procedures shall be 
provided without cost to the employee and at a time and place that is 
reasonable and convenient to employees.
    (iv) The employer shall assure that the collecting and handling of 
biological samples of cadmium in urine (CdU), cadmium in blood (CdB), 
and beta-2 microglobulin in urine (<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M) taken from 
employees under this section is done in a manner that assures their 
reliability and that analysis of biological samples of cadmium in urine 
(CdU), cadmium in blood (CdB), and beta-2 microglobulin in urine 
(<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M) taken from employees under this section is 
performed in laboratories with demonstrated proficiency for that 
particular analyte. (See appendix F to this section.)
    (2) Initial examination. (i) The employer shall provide an initial 
(preplacement) examination to all employees covered by the medical 
surveillance program required in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section. 
The examination shall be provided to those employees within 30 days 
after initial assignment to a job with exposure to cadmium or no later 
than 90 days after the effective date of this section, whichever date is 
later.
    (ii) The initial (preplacement) medical examination shall include:
    (A) A detailed medical and work history, with emphasis on: Past, 
present, and anticipated future exposure to cadmium; any history of 
renal, cardiovascular, respiratory, hematopoietic, reproductive, and/or 
musculo-skeletal system dysfunction; current usage of medication with 
potential nephrotoxic side-effects; and smoking history and current 
status; and
    (B) Biological monitoring that includes the following tests:
    (1) Cadmium in urine (CdU), standardized to grams of creatinine (g/
Cr);
    (2) Beta-2 microglobulin in urine (<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M), 
standardized to grams of creatinine (g/Cr), with pH specified, as 
described in appendix F to this section; and
    (3) Cadmium in blood (CdB), standardized to liters of whole blood 
(lwb).
    (iii) Recent Examination: An initial examination is not required to 
be provided if adequate records show that the employee has been examined 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this 
section within the past 12 months. In that case, such records shall be 
maintained as part of the employee's medical record and the

[[Page 143]]

prior exam shall be treated as if it were an initial examination for the 
purposes of paragraphs (l)(3) and (4) of this section.
    (3) Actions triggered by initial biological monitoring: (i) If the 
results of the initial biological monitoring tests show the employee's 
CdU level to be at or below 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M 
level to be at or below 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr and CdB level to be at or 
below 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, then:
    (A) For currently exposed employees, who are subject to medical 
surveillance under paragraph (l)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the employer 
shall provide the minimum level of periodic medical surveillance in 
accordance with the requirements in paragraph (l)(4)(i) of this section; 
and
    (B) For previously exposed employees, who are subject to medical 
surveillance under paragraph (l)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the employer 
shall provide biological monitoring for CdU, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M, 
and CdB one year after the initial biological monitoring and then the 
employer shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(v) of 
this section.
    (ii) For all employees who are subject to medical surveillance under 
paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, if the results of the initial 
biological monitoring tests show the level of CdU to exceed 3 
<greek-m>g/g Cr, the level of <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M to exceed 300 
<greek-m>g/g Cr, or the level of CdB to exceed 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, the 
employer shall:
    (A) Within two weeks after receipt of biological monitoring results, 
reassess the employee's occupational exposure to cadmium as follows:
    (1) Reassess the employee's work practices and personal hygiene;
    (2) Reevaluate the employee's respirator use, if any, and the 
respirator program;
    (3) Review the hygiene facilities;
    (4) Reevaluate the maintenance and effectiveness of the relevant 
engineering controls;
    (5) Assess the employee's smoking history and status;
    (B) Within 30 days after the exposure reassessment, specified in 
paragraph (l)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, take reasonable steps to 
correct any deficiencies found in the reassessment that may be 
responsible for the employee's excess exposure to cadmium; and,
    (C) Within 90 days after receipt of biological monitoring results, 
provide a full medical examination to the employee in accordance with 
the requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section. After 
completing the medical examination, the examining physician shall 
determine in a written medical opinion whether to medically remove the 
employee. If the physician determines that medical removal is not 
necessary, then until the employee's CdU level falls to or below 3 
<greek-m>g/g Cr, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M level falls to or below 300 
<greek-m>g/g Cr and CdB level falls to or below 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, the 
employer shall:
    (1) Provide biological monitoring in accordance with paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section on a semiannual basis; and
    (2) Provide annual medical examinations in accordance with paragraph 
(l)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) For all employees who are subject to medical surveillance 
under paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, if the results of the initial 
biological monitoring tests show the level of CdU to be in excess of 15 
<greek-m>g/g Cr, or the level of CdB to be in excess of 15 <greek-m>g/
lwb, or the level of <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M to be in excess of 1,500 
<greek-m>g/g Cr, the employer shall comply with the requirements of 
paragraphs (l)(3)(ii)(A)-(B) of this section. Within 90 days after 
receipt of biological monitoring results, the employer shall provide a 
full medical examination to the employee in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section. After completing 
the medical examination, the examining physician shall determine in a 
written medical opinion whether to medically remove the employee. 
However, if the initial biological monitoring results and the biological 
monitoring results obtained during the medical examination both show 
that: CdU exceeds 15 <greek-m>g/g Cr; or CdB exceeds 15 <greek-m>g/lwb; 
or <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M exceeds 1500 <greek-m>g/g Cr, and in addition 
CdU exceeds 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr or CdB exceeds 5 <greek-m>g/liter of whole 
blood, then the physician shall medically remove the employee from 
exposure to cadmium at or above the action level. If the second set of 
biological monitoring results obtained during the medical examination 
does not show that a mandatory removal trigger level has been exceeded,

[[Page 144]]

then the employee is not required to be removed by the mandatory 
provisions of this paragraph. If the employee is not required to be 
removed by the mandatory provisions of this paragraph or by the 
physician's determination, then until the employee's CdU level falls to 
or below 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M level falls to or 
below 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr and CdB level falls to or below 5 <greek-m>g/
lwb, the employer shall:
    (A) Periodically reassess the employee's occupational exposure to 
cadmium;
    (B) Provide biological monitoring in accordance with paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section on a quarterly basis; and
    (C) Provide semiannual medical examinations in accordance with 
paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) For all employees to whom medical surveillance is provided, 
beginning on January 1, 1999, and in lieu of paragraphs (l)(3)(i)-(iii) 
of this section:
    (A) If the results of the initial biological monitoring tests show 
the employee's CdU level to be at or below 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr, 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M level to be at or below 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr and 
CdB level to be at or below 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, then for currently exposed 
employees, the employer shall comply with the requirements of paragraph 
(l)(3)(i)(A) of this section, and for previously exposed employees, the 
employer shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (l)(3)(i)(B) of 
this section;
    (B) If the results of the initial biological monitoring tests show 
the level of CdU to exceed 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr, the level of 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M to exceed 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr, or the level of 
CdB to exceed 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, the employer shall comply with the 
requirements of paragraphs (l)(3)(ii)(A)-(C) of this section; and,
    (C) If the results of the initial biological monitoring tests show 
the level of CdU to be in excess of 7 <greek-m>g/g Cr, or the level of 
CdB to be in excess of 10 <greek-m>g/lwb, or the level of 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M to be in excess of 750 <greek-m>g/g Cr, the 
employer shall: Comply with the requirements of paragraphs 
(l)(3)(ii)(A)-(B) of this section; and, within 90 days after receipt of 
biological monitoring results, provide a full medical examination to the 
employee in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of 
this section. After completing the medical examination, the examining 
physician shall determine in a written medical opinion whether to 
medically remove the employee. However, if the initial biological 
monitoring results and the biological monitoring results obtained during 
the medical examination both show that: CdU exceeds 7 <greek-m>g/g Cr; 
or CdB exceeds 10 <greek-m>g/lwb; or <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M exceeds 750 
<greek-m>g/g Cr, and in addition CdU exceeds 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr or CdB 
exceeds 5 <greek-m>g/liter of whole blood, then the physician shall 
medically remove the employee from exposure to cadmium at or above the 
action level. If the second set of biological monitoring results 
obtained during the medical examination does not show that a mandatory 
removal trigger level has been exceeded, then the employee is not 
required to be removed by the mandatory provisions of this paragraph. If 
the employee is not required to be removed by the mandatory provisions 
of this paragraph or by the physician's determination, then until the 
employee's CdU level falls to or below 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr, 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M level falls to or below 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr and 
CdB level falls to or below 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, the employer shall: 
periodically reassess the employee's occupational exposure to cadmium; 
provide biological monitoring in accordance with paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(B) 
of this section on a quarterly basis; and provide semiannual medical 
examinations in accordance with paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (4) Periodic medical surveillance. (i) For each employee who is 
covered under paragraph (l)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the employer shall

    (H) For males over 40 years old, prostate palpation, or other at 
least as effective diagnostic test(s); and
    (I) Any additional tests deemed appropriate by the examining 
physician.
    (iii) Periodic biological monitoring shall be provided in accordance 
with paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (iv) If the results of periodic biological monitoring or the results 
of biological monitoring performed as part of the periodic medical 
examination show the level of the employee's CdU, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-
M, or CdB to be in excess of the levels specified in paragraphs 
(l)(3)(ii) or (iii); or, beginning on January 1, 1999, in excess of the 
levels specified in paragraphs (l)(3)(ii) or (iv) of this section, the 
employer shall take the appropriate actions specified in paragraphs 
(l)(3)(ii)-(iv) of this section.
    (v) For previously exposed employees under paragraph (l)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section:
    (A) If the employee's levels of CdU did not exceed 3 <greek-m>g/g 
Cr, CdB did not exceed 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, and <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M did 
not exceed 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr in the initial biological monitoring 
tests, and if the results of the followup biological monitoring required 
by paragraph (l)(3)(i)(B) of this section one year after the initial 
examination confirm the previous results, the employer may discontinue 
all periodic medical surveillance for that employee.
    (B) If the initial biological monitoring results for CdU, CdB, or 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M were in excess of the levels specified in 
paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section, but subsequent biological 
monitoring results required by paragraph (l)(3)(ii)-(iv) of this section 
show that the employee's CdU levels no longer exceed 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr, 
CdB levels no longer exceed 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, and <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-
M levels no longer exceed 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr, the employer shall 
provide biological monitoring for CdU, CdB, and <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M 
one year after these most recent biological monitoring results. If the 
results of the followup biological monitoring, specified in this 
paragraph, confirm the previous results, the employer may discontinue 
all periodic medical surveillance for that employee.
    (C) However, if the results of the follow-up tests specified in 
paragraph (l)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section indicate that the level of 
the employee's CdU, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M, or CdB exceeds these same 
levels, the employer is required to provide annual medical examinations 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this 
section until the results of biological monitoring are consistently 
below these levels or the examining physician determines in a written 
medical opinion that further medical surveillance is not required to 
protect the employee's health.
    (vi) A routine, biennial medical examination is not required to be 
provided in accordance with paragraphs (l)(3)(i) and (l)(4) of this 
section if adequate medical records show that the employee has been 
examined in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of 
this section within the past 12 months. In that case, such

[[Page 146]]

records shall be maintained by the employer as part of the employee's 
medical record, and the next routine, periodic medical examination shall 
be made available to the employee within two years of the previous 
examination.
    (5) Actions triggered by medical examinations. (i) If the results of 
a medical examination carried out in accordance with this section 
indicate any laboratory or clinical finding consistent with cadmium 
toxicity that does not require employer action under paragraph (l)(2), 
(3) or (4) of this section, the employer, within 30 days, shall reassess 
the employee's occupational exposure to cadmium and take the following 
corrective action until the physician determines they are no longer 
necessary:
    (A) Periodically reassess: The employee's work practices and 
personal hygiene; the employee's respirator use, if any; the employee's 
smoking history and status; the respiratory protection program; the 
hygiene facilities; and the maintenance and effectiveness of the 
relevant engineering controls;
    (B) Within 30 days after the reassessment, take all reasonable steps 
to correct the deficiencies found in the reassessment that may be 
responsible for the employee's excess exposure to cadmium;
    (C) Provide semiannual medical reexaminations to evaluate the 
abnormal clinical sign(s) of cadmium toxicity until the results are 
normal or the employee is medically removed; and
    (D) Where the results of tests for total proteins in urine are 
abnormal, provide a more detailed medical evaluation of the toxic 
effects of cadmium on the employee's renal system.
    (6) Examination for respirator use. (i) To determine an employee's 
fitness for respirator use, the employer shall provide a medical 
examination that includes the elements specified in paragraph 
(l)(6)(i)(A)-(D) of this section. This examination shall be provided 
prior to the employee's being assigned to a job that requires the use of 
a respirator or no later than 90 days after this section goes into 
effect, whichever date is later, to any employee without a medical 
examination within the preceding 12 months that satisfies the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (A) A detailed medical and work history, or update thereof, with 
emphasis on: Past exposure to cadmium; smoking history and current 
status; any history of renal, cardiovascular, respiratory, 
hematopoietic, and/or musculoskeletal system dysfunction; a description 
of the job for which the respirator is required; and questions 3-11 and 
25-32 in appendix D to this section;
    (B) A blood pressure test;
    (C) Biological monitoring of the employee's levels of CdU, CdB and 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, unless such results already have been 
obtained within the previous 12 months; and
    (D) Any other test or procedure that the examining physician deems 
appropriate.
    (ii) After reviewing all the information obtained from the medical 
examination required in paragraph (l)(6)(i) of this section, the 
physician shall determine whether the employee is fit to wear a 
respirator.
    (iii) Whenever an employee has exhibited difficulty in breathing 
during a respirator fit test or during use of a respirator, the 
employer, as soon as possible, shall provide the employee with a 
periodic medical examination in accordance with paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of 
this section to determine the employee's fitness to wear a respirator.
    (iv) Where the results of the examination required under paragraph 
(l)(6)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section are abnormal, medical 
limitation or prohibition of respirator use shall be considered. If the 
employee is allowed to wear a respirator, the employee's ability to 
continue to do so shall be periodically evaluated by a physician.
    (7) Emergency examinations. (i) In addition to the medical 
surveillance required in paragraphs (l)(2)-(6) of this section, the 
employer shall provide a medical examination as soon as possible to any 
employee who may have been acutely exposed to cadmium because of an 
emergency.
    (ii) The examination shall include the requirements of paragraph 
(l)(4)(ii) of this section, with emphasis on the respiratory system, 
other organ systems considered appropriate by the examining physician, 
and symptoms of

[[Page 147]]

acute overexposure, as identified in paragraphs II (B)(1)-(2) and IV of 
appendix A to this section.
    (8) Termination of employment examination. (i) At termination of 
employment, the employer shall provide a medical examination in 
accordance with paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section, including a chest 
X-ray, to any employee to whom at any prior time the employer was 
required to provide medical surveillance under paragraphs (l)(1)(i) or 
(l)(7) of this section. However, if the last examination satisfied the 
requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section and was less than 
six months prior to the date of termination, no further examination is 
required unless otherwise specified in paragraphs (l)(3) or (l)(5) of 
this section;
    (ii) However, for employees covered by paragraph (l)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section, if the employer has discontinued all periodic medical 
surveillance under paragraph (l)(4)(v) of this section, no termination 
of employment medical examination is required.
    (9) Information provided to the physician. The employer shall 
provide the following information to the examining physician:
    (i) A copy of this standard and appendices;
    (ii) A description of the affected employee's former, current, and 
anticipated duties as they relate to the employee's occupational 
exposure to cadmium;
    (iii) The employee's former, current, and anticipated future levels 
of occupational exposure to cadmium;
    (iv) A description of any personal protective equipment, including 
respirators, used or to be used by the employee, including when and for 
how long the employee has used that equipment; and
    (v) relevant results of previous biological monitoring and medical 
examinations.
    (10) Physician's written medical opinion. (i) The employer shall 
promptly obtain a written, signed medical opinion from the examining 
physician for each medical examination performed on each employee. This 
written opinion shall contain:
    (A) The physician's diagnosis for the employee;
    (B) The physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any 
detected medical condition(s) that would place the employee at increased 
risk of material impairment to health from further exposure to cadmium, 
including any indications of potential cadmium toxicity;
    (C) The results of any biological or other testing or related 
evaluations that directly assess the employee's absorption of cadmium;
    (D) Any recommended removal from, or limitation on the activities or 
duties of the employee or on the employee's use of personal protective 
equipment, such as respirators;
    (E) A statement that the physician has clearly and carefully 
explained to the employee the results of the medical examination, 
including all biological monitoring results and any medical conditions 
related to cadmium exposure that require further evaluation or 
treatment, and any limitation on the employee's diet or use of 
medications.
    (ii) The employer promptly shall obtain a copy of the results of any 
biological monitoring provided by an employer to an employee 
independently of a medical examination under paragraphs (l)(2) and 
(l)(4) of this section, and, in lieu of a written medical opinion, an 
explanation sheet explaining those results.
    (iii) The employer shall instruct the physician not to reveal orally 
or in the written medical opinion given to the employer specific 
findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposure to cadmium.
    (11) Medical Removal Protection (MRP)--(i) General. (A) The employer 
shall temporarily remove an employee from work where there is excess 
exposure to cadmium on each occasion that medical removal is required 
under paragraph (l)(3), (l)(4), or (l)(6) of this section and on each 
occasion that a physician determines in a written medical opinion that 
the employee should be removed from such exposure. The physician's 
determination may be based on biological monitoring results, inability 
to wear a respirator, evidence of illness, other signs or symptoms of

[[Page 148]]

cadmium-related dysfunction or disease, or any other reason deemed 
medically sufficient by the physician.
    (B) The employer shall medically remove an employee in accordance 
with paragraph (l)(11) of this section regardless of whether at the time 
of removal a job is available into which the removed employee may be 
transferred.
    (C) Whenever an employee is medically removed under paragraph 
(l)(11) of this section, the employer shall transfer the removed 
employee to a job where the exposure to cadmium is within the 
permissible levels specified in that paragraph as soon as one becomes 
available.
    (D) For any employee who is medically removed under the provisions 
of paragraph (l)(11)(i) of this section, the employer shall provide 
follow-up biological monitoring in accordance with (l)(2)(ii)(B) of this 
section at least every three months and follow-up medical examinations 
semi-annually at least every six months until in a written medical 
opinion the examining physician determines that either the employee may 
be returned to his/her former job status as specified under paragraph 
(l)(11)(iv)-(v) of this section or the employee must be permanently 
removed from excess cadmium exposure.
    (E) The employer may not return an employee who has been medically 
removed for any reason to his/her former job status until a physician 
determines in a written medical opinion that continued medical removal 
is no longer necessary to protect the employee's health.
    (ii) Where an employee is found unfit to wear a respirator under 
paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section, the employer shall remove the 
employee from work where exposure to cadmium is above the PEL.
    (iii) Where removal is based on any reason other than the employee's 
inability to wear a respirator, the employer shall remove the employee 
from work where exposure to cadmium is at or above the action level.
    (iv) Except as specified in paragraph (l)(11)(v) of this section, no 
employee who was removed because his/her level of CdU, CdB and/or 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M exceeded the medical removal trigger levels in 
paragraph (l)(3) or (l)(4) of this section may be returned to work with 
exposure to cadmium at or above the action level until the employee's 
levels of CdU fall to or below 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr, CdB falls to or below 
5 <greek-m>g/lwb, and <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M falls to or below 300 
<greek-m>g/g Cr.
    (v) However, when in the examining physician's opinion continued 
exposure to cadmium will not pose an increased risk to the employee's 
health and there are special circumstances that make continued medical 
removal an inappropriate remedy, the physician shall fully discuss these 
matters with the employee, and then in a written determination may 
return a worker to his/her former job status despite what would 
otherwise be unacceptably high biological monitoring results. 
Thereafter, the returned employee shall continue to be provided with 
medical surveillance as if he/she were still on medical removal until 
the employee's levels of CdU fall to or below 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr, CdB 
falls to or below 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, and <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M falls to 
or below 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr.
    (vi) Where an employer, although not required by paragraph 
(l)(11)(i)-(iii) of this section to do so, removes an employee from 
exposure to cadmium or otherwise places limitations on an employee due 
to the effects of cadmium exposure on the employee's medical condition, 
the employer shall provide the same medical removal protection benefits 
to that employee under paragraph (l)(12) of this section as would have 
been provided had the removal been required under paragraph (l)(11)(i)-
(iii) of this section.
    (12) Medical Removal Protection Benefits (MRPB). (i) The employer 
shall provide MRPB for up to a maximum of 18 months to an employee each 
time and while the employee is temporarily medically removed under 
paragraph (l)(11) of this section.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, the requirement that the employer 
provide MRPB means that the employer shall maintain the total normal 
earnings, seniority, and all other employee rights and benefits of the 
removed employee, including the employee's right to his/her former job 
status, as if the employee had not been removed from the employee's job 
or otherwise medically limited.

[[Page 149]]

    (iii) Where, after 18 months on medical removal because of elevated 
biological monitoring results, the employee's monitoring results have 
not declined to a low enough level to permit the employee to be returned 
to his/her former job status:
    (A) The employer shall make available to the employee a medical 
examination pursuant to this section in order to obtain a final medical 
determination as to whether the employee may be returned to his/her 
former job status or must be permanently removed from excess cadmium 
exposure; and
    (B) The employer shall assure that the final medical determination 
indicates whether the employee may be returned to his/her former job 
status and what steps, if any, should be taken to protect the employee's 
health.
    (iv) The employer may condition the provision of MRPB upon the 
employee's participation in medical surveillance provided in accordance 
with this section.
    (13) Multiple physician review. (i) If the employer selects the 
initial physician to conduct any medical examination or consultation 
provided to an employee under this section, the employee may designate a 
second physician to:
    (A) Review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the 
initial physician; and
    (B) Conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory tests 
as the second physician deems necessary to facilitate this review.
    (ii) The employer shall promptly notify an employee of the right to 
seek a second medical opinion after each occasion that an initial 
physician provided by the employer conducts a medical examination or 
consultation pursuant to this section. The employer may condition its 
participation in, and payment for, multiple physician review upon the 
employee doing the following within fifteen (15) days after receipt of 
this notice, or receipt of the initial physician's written opinion, 
whichever is later:
    (A) Informing the employer that he or she intends to seek a medical 
opinion; and
    (B) Initiating steps to make an appointment with a second physician.
    (iii) If the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the 
second physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the 
employer and the employee shall assure that efforts are made for the two 
physicians to resolve any disagreement.
    (iv) If the two physicians have been unable to quickly resolve their 
disagreement, then the employer and the employee, through their 
respective physicians, shall designate a third physician to:
    (A) Review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the 
other two physicians; and
    (B) Conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests, and 
discussions with the other two physicians as the third physician deems 
necessary to resolve the disagreement among them.
    (v) The employer shall act consistently with the findings, 
determinations, and recommendations of the third physician, unless the 
employer and the employee reach an agreement that is consistent with the 
recommendations of at least one of the other two physicians.
    (14) Alternate physician determination. The employer and an employee 
or designated employee representative may agree upon the use of any 
alternate form of physician determination in lieu of the multiple 
physician review provided by paragraph (l)(13) of this section, so long 
as the alternative is expeditious and at least as protective of the 
employee.
    (15) Information the employer must provide the employee. (i) The 
employer shall provide a copy of the physician's written medical opinion 
to the examined employee within two weeks after receipt thereof.
    (ii) The employer shall provide the employee with a copy of the 
employee's biological monitoring results and an explanation sheet 
explaining the results within two weeks after receipt thereof.
    (iii) Within 30 days after a request by an employee, the employer 
shall provide the employee with the information the employer is required 
to provide the examining physician under paragraph (l)(9) of this 
section.

[[Page 150]]

    (16) Reporting. In addition to other medical events that are 
required to be reported on the OSHA Form No. 200, the employer shall

        Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1027--Substance Safety Data Sheet

                                 Cadmium

                       I. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: Cadmium.
    B. 8-Hour, Time-weighted-average, Permissible Exposure Limit (TWA 
PEL):
    1. TWA PEL: Five micrograms of cadmium per cubic meter of air 5 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>, time-weighted average (TWA) for an 8-hour 
workday.
    C. Appearance: Cadmium metal--soft, blue-white, malleable, lustrous 
metal or grayish-white powder. Some cadmium compounds may also appear as 
a brown, yellow, or red powdery substance.

                         II. Health Hazard Data

    A. Routes of Exposure. Cadmium can cause local skin or eye 
irritation. Cadmium can affect your health if you inhale it or if you 
swallow it.
    B. Effects of Overexposure.
    1. Short-term (acute) exposure: Cadmium is much more dangerous by 
inhalation than by ingestion. High exposures to cadmium that may be 
immediately dangerous to life or health occur in jobs where workers 
handle large quantities of cadmium dust or fume; heat cadmium-containing 
compounds or cadmium-coated surfaces; weld with cadmium solders or cut 
cadmium-containing materials such as bolts.
    2. Severe exposure may occur before symptoms appear. Early symptoms 
may include mild irritation of the upper respiratory tract, a sensation 
of constriction of the throat, a metallic taste and/or a cough. A period 
of 1-10 hours may precede the onset of rapidly progressing shortness of 
breath, chest pain, and flu-like symptoms with weakness, fever, 
headache, chills, sweating and muscular pain. Acute pulmonary edema 
usually develops within 24 hours and reaches a maximum by three days. If 
death from asphyxia does not occur, symptoms may resolve within a week.
    3. Long-term (chronic) exposure. Repeated or long-term exposure to 
cadmium, even at relatively low concentrations, may result in kidney 
damage and an increased risk of cancer of the lung and of the prostate.
    C. Emergency First Aid Procedures.
    1. Eye exposure: Direct contact may cause redness or pain. Wash eyes 
immediately with large amounts of water, lifting the upper and lower 
eyelids. Get medical attention immediately.
    2. Skin exposure: Direct contact may result in irritation. Remove 
contaminated clothing and shoes immediately. Wash affected area with 
soap or mild detergent and large amounts of water. Get medical attention 
immediately.
    3. Ingestion: Ingestion may result in vomiting, abdominal pain, 
nausea, diarrhea, headache and sore throat. Treatment for symptoms must 
be administered by medical personnel. Under no circumstances should the 
employer allow any person whom he retains, employs, supervises or 
controls to engage in therapeutic chelation. Such treatment is likely to 
translocate cadmium from pulmonary or other tissue to renal tissue. Get 
medical attention immediately.
    4. Inhalation: If large amounts of cadmium are inhaled, the exposed 
person must be moved to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, 
perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Administer oxygen if available. 
Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Get medical attention 
immediately.
    5. Rescue: Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure. If 
the exposed person has been overcome, attempt rescue only after 
notifying at least one other person of the emergency and putting into 
effect established emergency procedures. Do not become

[[Page 154]]

a casualty yourself. Understand your emergency rescue procedures and 
know the location of the emergency equipment before the need arises.

                        III. Employee Information

    A. Protective Clothing and Equipment.
    1. Respirators: You may be required to wear a respirator for non-
routine activities; in emergencies; while your employer is in the 
process of reducing cadmium exposures through engineering controls; and 
where engineering controls are not feasible. If respirators are worn in 
the future, they must have a joint Mine Safety and Health Administration 
(MSHA) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 
label of approval. Cadmium does not have a detectable odor except at 
levels well above the permissible exposure limits. If you can smell 
cadmium while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If 
you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, tell 
your employer.
    2. Protective Clothing: You may be required to wear impermeable 
clothing, gloves, foot gear, a face shield, or other appropriate 
protective clothing to prevent skin contact with cadmium. Where 
protective clothing is required, your employer must provide clean 
garments to you as necessary to assure that the clothing protects you 
adequately. The employer must replace or repair protective clothing that 
has become torn or otherwise damaged.
    3. Eye Protection: You may be required to wear splash-proof or dust 
resistant goggles to prevent eye contact with cadmium.
    B. Employer Requirements.
    1. Medical: If you are exposed to cadmium at or above the action 
level, your employer is required to provide a medical examination, 
laboratory tests and a medical history according to the medical 
surveillance provisions under paragraph (1) of this standard. (See 
summary chart and tables in this appendix A.) These tests shall be 
provided without cost to you. In addition, if you are accidentally 
exposed to cadmium under conditions known or suspected to constitute 
toxic exposure to cadmium, your employer is required to make special 
tests available to you.
    2. Access to Records: All medical records are kept strictly 
confidential. You or your representative are entitled to see the records 
of measurements of your exposure to cadmium. Your medical examination 
records can be furnished to your personal physician or designated 
representative upon request by you to your employer.
    3. Observation of Monitoring: Your employer is required to perform 
measurements that are representative of your exposure to cadmium and you 
or your designated representative are entitled to observe the monitoring 
procedure. You are entitled to observe the steps taken in the 
measurement procedure, and to record the results obtained. When the 
monitoring procedure is taking place in an area where respirators or 
personal protective clothing and equipment are required to be worn, you 
or your representative must also be provided with, and must wear the 
protective clothing and equipment.
    C. Employee Requirements--You will not be able to smoke, eat, drink, 
chew gum or tobacco, or apply cosmetics while working with cadmium in 
regulated areas. You will also not be able to carry or store tobacco 
products, gum, food, drinks or cosmetics in regulated areas because 
these products easily become contaminated with cadmium from the 
workplace and can therefore create another source of unnecessary cadmium 
exposure.
    Some workers will have to change out of work clothes and shower at 
the end of the day, as part of their workday, in order to wash cadmium 
from skin and hair. Handwashing and cadmium-free eating facilities shall 
be provided by the employer and proper hygiene should always be 
performed before eating. It is also recommended that you do not smoke or 
use tobacco products, because among other things, they naturally contain 
cadmium. For further information, read the labeling on such products.

                        IV. Physician Information

    A. Introduction.--The medical surveillance provisions of paragraph 
(1) generally are aimed at accomplishing three main interrelated 
purposes: First, identifying employees at higher risk of adverse health 
effects from excess, chronic exposure to cadmium; second, preventing 
cadmium-induced disease; and third, detecting and minimizing existing 
cadmium-induced disease. The core of medical surveillance in this 
standard is the early and periodic monitoring of the employee's 
biological indicators of: (a) Recent exposure to cadmium; (b) cadmium 
body burden; and (c) potential and actual kidney damage associated with 
exposure to cadmium.
    The main adverse health effects associated with cadmium overexposure 
are lung cancer and kidney dysfunction. It is not yet known how to 
adequately biologically monitor human beings to specifically prevent 
cadmium-induced lung cancer. By contrast, the kidney can be monitored to 
provide prevention and early detection of cadmium-induced kidney damage. 
Since, for non-carcinogenic effects, the kidney is considered the 
primary target organ of chronic exposure to cadmium, the medical 
surveillance provisions of this standard effectively focus on cadmium-
induced kidney disease. Within that focus, the aim, where possible, is 
to prevent the onset of such disease and, where necessary, to minimize 
such disease as may already exist. The by-products of successful 
prevention of kidney disease are anticipated to be

[[Page 155]]

the reduction and prevention of other cadmium-induced diseases.
    B. Health Effects.--The major health effects associated with cadmium 
overexposure are described below.
    1. Kidney: The most prevalent non-malignant disease observed among 
workers chronically exposed to cadmium is kidney dysfunction. Initially, 
such dysfunction is manifested as proteinuria. The proteinuria 
associated with cadmium exposure is most commonly characterized by 
excretion of low-molecular weight proteins (15,000 to 40,000 MW) 
accompanied by loss of electrolytes, uric acid, calcium, amino acids, 
and phosphate. The compounds commonly excreted include: beta-2-
microglobulin (<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M), retinol binding protein (RBP), 
immunoglobulin light chains, and lysozyme. Excretion of low molecular 
weight proteins are characteristic of damage to the proximal tubules of 
the kidney (Iwao et al., 1980).
    It has also been observed that exposure to cadmium may lead to 
urinary excretion of high-molecular weight proteins such as albumin, 
immunoglobulin G, and glycoproteins (Ex. 29). Excretion of high-
molecular weight proteins is typically indicative of damage to the 
glomeruli of the kidney. Bernard et al., (1979) suggest that damage to 
the glomeruli and damage to the proximal tubules of the kidney may both 
be linked to cadmium exposure but they may occur independently of each 
other.
    Several studies indicate that the onset of low-molecular weight 
proteinuria is a sign of irreversible kidney damage (Friberg et al., 
1974; Roels et al., 1982; Piscator 1984; Elinder et al., 1985; Smith et 
al., 1986). Above specific levels of <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M associated 
with cadmium exposure it is unlikely that <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M levels 
return to normal even when cadmium exposure is eliminated by removal of 
the individual from the cadmium work environment (Friberg, Ex. 29, 
1990).
    Some studies indicate that such proteinuria may be progressive; 
levels of <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M observed in the urine increase with 
time even after cadmium exposure has ceased. See, for example, Elinder 
et al., 1985. Such observations, however, are not universal, and it has 
been suggested that studies in which proteinuria has not been observed 
to progress may not have tracked patients for a sufficiently long time 
interval (Jarup, Ex. 8-661).
    When cadmium exposure continues after the onset of proteinuria, 
chronic nephrotoxicity may occur (Friberg, Ex. 29). Uremia results from 
the inability of the glomerulus to adequately filter blood. This leads 
to severe disturbance of electrolyte concentrations and may lead to 
various clinical complications including kidney stones (L-140-50).
    After prolonged exposure to cadmium, glomerular proteinuria, 
glucosuria, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, and hypercalciuria may develop 
(Exs. 8-86, 4-28, 14-18). Phosphate, calcium, glucose, and amino acids 
are essential to life, and under normal conditions, their excretion 
should be regulated by the kidney. Once low molecular weight proteinuria 
has developed, these elements dissipate from the human body. Loss of 
glomerular function may also occur, manifested by decreased glomerular 
filtration rate and increased serum creatinine. Severe cadmium-induced 
renal damage may eventually develop into chronic renal failure and 
uremia (Ex. 55).
    Studies in which animals are chronically exposed to cadmium confirm 
the renal effects observed in humans (Friberg et al., 1986). Animal 
studies also confirm problems with calcium metabolism and related 
skeletal effects which have been observed among humans exposed to 
cadmium in addition to the renal effects. Other effects commonly 
reported in chronic animal studies include anemia, changes in liver 
morphology, immunosuppression and hypertension. Some of these effects 
may be associated with co-factors. Hypertension, for example, appears to 
be associated with diet as well as cadmium exposure. Animals injected 
with cadmium have also shown testicular necrosis (Ex. 8-86B).

                          2. Biological Markers

    It is universally recognized that the best measures of cadmium 
exposures and its effects are measurements of cadmium in biological 
fluids, especially urine and blood. Of the two, CdU is conventionally 
used to determine body burden of cadmium in workers without kidney 
disease. CdB is conventionally used to monitor for recent exposure to 
cadmium. In addition, levels of CdU and CdB historically have been used 
to predict the percent of the population likely to develop kidney 
disease (Thun et al., Ex. L-140-50; WHO, Ex. 8-674; ACGIH, Exs. 8-667, 
140-50).
    The third biological parameter upon which OSHA relies for medical 
surveillance is Beta-2-microglobulin in urine (<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M), 
a low molecular weight protein. Excess <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M has been 
widely accepted by physicians and scientists as a reliable indicator of 
functional damage to the proximal tubule of the kidney (Exs. 8-447, 144-
3-C, 4-47, L-140-45, 19-43-A).
    Excess <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M is found when the proximal tubules 
can no longer reabsorb this protein in a normal manner. This failure of 
the proximal tubules is an early stage of a kind of kidney disease that 
commonly occurs among workers with excessive cadmium exposure. Used in 
conjunction with biological test results indicating abnormal levels of 
CdU and CdB, the finding of excess <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M can establish 
for an examining physician that any existing kidney disease is probably 
cadmium-related (Trs. 6/6/90, pp. 82-86, 122, 134). The upper limits of 
normal levels for cadmium in urine and

[[Page 156]]

cadmium in blood are 3 <greek-m>g Cd/gram creatinine in urine and 5 
<greek-m>gCd/liter whole blood, respectively. These levels were derived 
from broad-based population studies.
    Three issues confront the physicians in the use of 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M as a marker of kidney dysfunction and material 
impairment. First, there are a few other causes of elevated levels of 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M not related to cadmium exposures, some of which 
may be rather common diseases and some of which are serious diseases 
(e.g., myeloma or transient flu, Exs. 29 and 8-086). These can be 
medically evaluated as alternative causes (Friberg, Ex. 29). Also, there 
are other factors that can cause <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M to degrade so 
that low levels would result in workers with tubular dysfunction. For 
example, regarding the degradation of <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M, workers 
with acidic urine (pH<6) might have <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M levels that 
are within the ``normal'' range when in fact kidney dysfunction has 
occurred (Ex. L-140-1) and the low molecular weight proteins are 
degraded in acid urine. Thus, it is very important that the pH of urine 
be measured, that urine samples be buffered as necessary (See appendix 
F.), and that urine samples be handled correctly, i.e., measure the pH 
of freshly voided urine samples, then if necessary, buffer to pH>6 (or 
above for shipping purposes), measure pH again and then, perhaps, freeze 
the sample for storage and shipping. (See also appendix F.) Second, 
there is debate over the pathological significance of proteinuria, 
however, most world experts believe that <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M levels 
greater than 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr are abnormal (Elinder, Ex. 55, Friberg, 
Ex. 29). Such levels signify kidney dysfunction that constitutes 
material impairment of health. Finally, detection of 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M at low levels has often been considered 
difficult, however, many laboratories have the capability of detecting 
excess <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M using simple kits, such as the Phadebas 
Delphia test, that are accurate to levels of 100 <greek-m>g 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M/g Cr U (Ex. L-140-1).
    Specific recommendations for ways to measure <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M 
and proper handling of urine samples to prevent degradation of 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M have been addressed by OSHA in appendix F, in 
the section on laboratory standardization. All biological samples must 
be analyzed in a laboratory that is proficient in the analysis of that 
particular analyte, under paragraph (l)(1)(iv). (See appendix F). 
Specifically, under paragraph (l)(1)(iv), the employer is to assure that 
the collecting and handling of biological samples of cadmium in urine 
(CdU), cadmium in blood (CdB), and beta-2 microglobulin in urine 
(<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M) taken from employees is collected in a manner 
that assures reliability. The employer must also assure that analysis of 
biological samples of cadmium in urine (CdU), cadmium in blood (CdB), 
and beta-2 microglobulin in urine (<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M) taken from 
employees is performed in laboratories with demonstrated proficiency for 
that particular analyte. (See appendix F.)

                       3. Lung and Prostate Cancer

    The primary sites for cadmium-associated cancer appear to be the 
lung and the prostate (L-140-50). Evidence for an association between 
cancer and cadmium exposure derives from both epidemiological studies 
and animal experiments. Mortality from prostate cancer associated with 
cadmium is slightly elevated in several industrial cohorts, but the 
number of cases is small and there is not clear dose-response 
relationship. More substantive evidence exists for lung cancer.
    The major epidemiological study of lung cancer was conducted by Thun 
et al., (Ex. 4-68). Adequate data on cadmium exposures were available to 
allow evaluation of dose-response relationships between cadmium exposure 
and lung cancer. A statistically significant excess of lung cancer 
attributed to cadmium exposure was observed in this study even when 
confounding variables such as co-exposure to arsenic and smoking habits 
were taken into consideration (Ex. L-140-50).
    The primary evidence for quantifying a link between lung cancer and 
cadmium exposure from animal studies derives from two rat bioassay 
studies; one by Takenaka et al., (1983), which is a study of cadmium 
chloride and a second study by Oldiges and Glaser (1990) of four cadmium 
compounds.
    Based on the above cited studies, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) classified cadmium as ``B1'', a probable human carcinogen, 
in 1985 (Ex. 4-4). The International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) in 1987 also recommended that cadmium be listed as ``2A'', a 
probable human carcinogen (Ex. 4-15). The American Conference of 
Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has recently recommended that 
cadmium be labeled as a carcinogen. Since 1984, NIOSH has concluded that 
cadmium is possibly a human carcinogen and has recommended that 
exposures be controlled to the lowest level feasible.

                       4. Non-carcinogenic Effects

    Acute pneumonitis occurs 10 to 24 hours after initial acute 
inhalation of high levels of cadmium fumes with symptoms such as fever 
and chest pain (Exs. 30, 8-86B). In extreme exposure cases pulmonary 
edema may develop and cause death several days after exposure. Little 
actual exposure measurement data is available on the level of airborne 
cadmium exposure that causes such immediate adverse lung effects, 
nonetheless, it is reasonable to believe a cadmium concentration of 
approximately 1 mg/m<SUP>3</SUP> over an eight hour period is 
``immediately dangerous'' (55 FR 4052, ANSI; Ex. 8-86B).
    In addition to acute lung effects and chronic renal effects, long 
term exposure to cadmium may cause other severe effects on the 
respiratory system. Reduced pulmonary function and chronic lung disease 
indicative

[[Page 157]]

of emphysema have been observed in workers who have had prolonged 
exposure to cadmium dust or fumes (Exs. 4-29, 4-22, 4-42, 4-50, 4-63). 
In a study of workers conducted by Kazantzis et al., a statistically 
significant excess of worker deaths due to chronic bronchitis was found, 
which in his opinion was directly related to high cadmium exposures of 1 
mg/m<SUP>3</SUP> or more (Tr. 6/8/90, pp. 156-157).
    Cadmium need not be respirable to constitute a hazard. Inspirable 
cadmium particles that are too large to be respirable but small enough 
to enter the tracheobronchial region of the lung can lead to 
bronchoconstriction, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer of that 
portion of the lung. All of these diseases have been associated with 
occupational exposure to cadmium (Ex. 8-86B). Particles that are 
constrained by their size to the extra-thoracic regions of the 
respiratory system such as the nose and maxillary sinuses can be 
swallowed through mucocillary clearance and be absorbed into the body 
(ACGIH, Ex. 8-692). The impaction of these particles in the upper 
airways can lead to anosmia, or loss of sense of smell, which is an 
early indication of overexposure among workers exposed to heavy metals. 
This condition is commonly reported among cadmium-exposed workers (Ex. 
8-86-B).

                         C. Medical Surveillance

    In general, the main provisions of the medical surveillance section 
of the standard, under paragraphs (l)(1)-(17) of the regulatory text, 
are as follows:
    1. Workers exposed above the action level are covered;
    2. Workers with intermittent exposures are not covered;
    3. Past workers who are covered receive biological monitoring for at 
least one year;
    4. Initial examinations include a medical questionnaire and 
biological monitoring of cadmium in blood (CdB), cadmium in urine (CdU), 
and Beta-2-microglobulin in urine (<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M);
    5. Biological monitoring of these three analytes is performed at 
least annually; full medical examinations are performed biennially;
    6. Until five years from the effective date of the standard, medical 
removal is required when CdU is greater than 15 <greek-m>g/gram 
creatinine (g Cr), or CdB is greater than 15 <greek-m>g/liter whole 
blood (lwb), or <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M is greater than 1500 <greek-m>g/
g Cr, and CdB is greater than 5 <greek-m>g/lwb or CdU is greater than 3 
<greek-m>g/g Cr;
    7. Beginning five years after the standard is in effect, medical 
removal triggers will be reduced;
    8. Medical removal protection benefits are to be provided for up to 
18 months;
    9. Limited initial medical examinations are required for respirator 
usage;
    10. Major provisions are fully described under section (l) of the 
regulatory text; they are outlined here as follows:
    A. Eligibility
    B. Biological monitoring
    C. Actions triggered by levels of CdU, CdB, and 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M (See Summary Charts and Tables in Attachment-1.)
    D. Periodic medical surveillance

    M. Multiple physician review
    N. Alternate physician review
    O. Information employer gives to employee
    P. Recordkeeping
    Q. Reporting on OSHA form 200
    11. The above mentioned summary of the medical surveillance 
provisions, the summary chart, and tables for the actions triggered at 
different levels of CdU, CdB and <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M (in appendix A 
Attachment-1) are included only for the purpose of facilitating 
understanding of the provisions of paragraphs (l)(3) of the final 
cadmium standard. The summary of the provisions, the summary chart, and 
the tables do not add to or reduce the requirements in paragraph (l)(3).

                    D. Recommendations to Physicians

    1. It is strongly recommended that patients with tubular proteinuria 
are counseled on: The hazards of smoking; avoidance of nephrotoxins and 
certain prescriptions and over-the-counter medications that may 
exacerbate kidney symptoms; how to control diabetes and/or blood 
pressure; proper hydration, diet, and exercise (Ex. 19-2). A list of 
prominent or common nephrotoxins is attached. (See appendix A 
Attachment-2.)
    2. DO NOT CHELATE; KNOW WHICH DRUGS ARE NEPHROTOXINS OR ARE 
ASSOCIATED WITH NEPHRITIS.
    3. The gravity of cadmium-induced renal damage is compounded by the 
fact there is no medical treatment to prevent or reduce the accumulation 
of cadmium in the kidney (Ex. 8-619). Dr. Friberg, a leading world 
expert on cadmium toxicity, indicated in 1992, that there is no form of 
chelating agent that could be used without substantial risk. He stated 
that tubular proteinuria has to be treated in the same way as other 
kidney disorders (Ex. 29).
    4. After the results of a workers' biological monitoring or medical 
examination are received the employer is required to provide an 
information sheet to the patient, briefly explaining the significance of 
the results. (See Attachment 3 of this appendix A.)

Next biological monitoring or medical examination scheduled for_________
    The biological monitoring program has been designed for three main 
purposes: 1) to identify employees at risk of adverse health effects 
from excess, chronic exposure to cadmium; 2) to prevent cadmium-induced 
disease(s); and 3) to detect and minimize existing cadmium-induced 
disease(s).
    The levels of cadmium in the urine and blood provide an estimate of 
the total amount of cadmium in the body. The amount of a specific 
protein in the urine (beta-2-microglobulin) indicates changes in kidney 
function. All three tests must be evaluated together. A single mildly 
elevated result may not be important if testing at a later time 
indicates that the results are normal and the workplace has been 
evaluated to decrease possible sources of cadmium exposure. The levels 
of cadmium or beta-2-microglobulin may change over a period of days to 
months and the time needed for those changes to occur is different for 
each worker.
    If the results for biological monitoring are above specific ``high 
levels'' [cadmium urine greater than 10 micrograms per gram of 
creatinine (<greek-m>g/g Cr), cadmium blood greater than 10 micrograms 
per liter of whole blood (<greek-m>g/lwb), or beta-2-microglobulin 
greater than 1000 micrograms per gram of creatinine (<greek-m>g/g Cr)], 
the worker has a much greater chance of developing other kidney 
diseases.
    One way to measure for kidney function is by measuring beta-2-
microglobulin in the urine. Beta-2-microglobulin is a protein which is 
normally found in the blood as it is being filtered in the kidney, and 
the kidney reabsorbs or returns almost all of the beta-2-microglobulin 
to the blood. A very small amount (less than 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr in the 
urine) of beta-2-microglobulin is not reabsorbed into the blood, but is 
released in the urine. If cadmium damages the kidney, the amount of 
beta-2-microglobulin in the urine increases because the kidney cells are 
unable to reabsorb the beta-2-microglobulin normally. An increase in the 
amount of beta-2-microglobulin in the urine is a very early sign of 
kidney dysfunction. A small increase in beta-2-microglobulin in the 
urine will serve as an early warning sign that the worker may be 
absorbing cadmium from the air, cigarettes contaminated in the 
workplace, or eating in areas that are cadmium contaminated.
    Even if cadmium causes permanent changes in the kidney's ability to 
reabsorb beta-2-microglobulin, and the beta-2-microglobulin is above the 
``high levels'', the loss of kidney function may not lead to any serious 
health problems. Also, renal function naturally declines as people age. 
The risk for changes in kidney function for workers who have biological 
monitoring results between the ``normal values'' and the ``high levels'' 
is not well known. Some people are more cadmium-tolerant, while others 
are more cadmium-susceptible.
    For anyone with even a slight increase of beta-2-microglobulin, 
cadmium in the urine, or cadmium in the blood, it is very important to 
protect the kidney from further damage. Kidney damage can come from 
other sources than excess cadmium-exposure so it is also recommended 
that if a worker's levels are ``high'' he/she should receive counseling 
about drinking more water; avoiding cadmium-tainted tobacco and certain 
medications (nephrotoxins, acetaminophen); controlling diet, vitamin 
intake, blood pressure and diabetes; etc.

    C. Spill Leak and Disposal Procedures.
    1. Steps to be taken if the material is released or spilled. Do not 
touch spilled material. Stop leak if you can do it without risk. For 
small spills, take up with sand or other absorbent material and place 
into containers for later disposal. For small dry spills, use a clean 
shovel to place material into clean, dry container and then cover. Move 
containers from spill area. For larger spills, dike far ahead of spill 
for later disposal. Keep unnecessary people away. Isolate hazard area 
and deny entry. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986

Appendix D to Sec. 1910.1027--Occupational Health History Interview With 
                      Reference to Cadmium Exposure

                               Directions

(To be read by employee and signed prior to the interview)

    Please answer the questions you will be asked as completely and 
carefully as you can. These questions are asked of everyone who works 
with cadmium. You will also be asked to give blood and urine samples. 
The doctor will give your employer a written opinion on whether you are 
physically capable of working with cadmium. Legally, the doctor cannot 
share personal information you may tell him/her with your employer. The 
following information is considered strictly confidential. The results 
of the tests

[[Page 163]]

will go to you, your doctor and your employer. You will also receive an 
information sheet explaining the results of any biological monitoring or 
physical examinations performed.
    If you are just being hired, the results of this interview and 
examination will be used to:
    (1) Establish your health status and see if working with cadmium 
might be expected to cause unusual problems,
    (2) Determine your health status today and see if there are changes 
over time,
    (3) See if you can wear a respirator safely.
    If you are not a new hire:
    OSHA says that everyone who works with cadmium can have periodic 
medical examinations performed by a doctor. The reasons for this are:
    (a) If there are changes in your health, either because of cadmium 
or some other reason, to find them early,
    (b) to prevent kidney damage.

                             1. Introduction

                               1.1. Scope

    This method describes the collection of airborne elemental cadmium 
and cadmium compounds on 0.8-<greek-m>m mixed cellulose ester membrane 
filters and their subsequent analysis by either flame atomic absorption 
spectroscopy (AAS) or flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy using a 
heated graphite furnace atomizer (AAS-HGA). It is applicable for both 
TWA and Action Level TWA Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) measurements. 
The two atomic absorption analytical techniques included in the method 
do not differentiate between cadmium fume and cadmium dust samples. They 
also do not differentiate between elemental cadmium and its compounds.

                             1.2. Principle

    Airborne elemental cadmium and cadmium compounds are collected on a 
0.8-<greek-m>m mixed cellulose ester membrane filter (MCEF). The air 
filter samples are digested with concentrated nitric acid to destroy the 
organic matrix and dissolve the cadmium analytes. After digestion, a 
small amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to help dissolve 
other metals which may be present. The samples are diluted to volume 
with deionized water and then aspirated into the oxidizing air/acetylene 
flame of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer for analysis of 
elemental cadmium.
    If the concentration of cadmium in a sample solution is too low for 
quantitation by this flame AAS analytical technique, and the sample is 
to be averaged with other samples for TWA calculations, aliquots of the 
sample and a matrix modifier are later injected onto a L'vov platform in 
a pyrolytically-coated graphite tube of a Zeeman atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer/graphite furnace assembly for analysis of elemental 
cadmium. The matrix modifier is added to stabilize the cadmium metal and 
minimize sodium chloride as an interference during the high temperature 
charring step of the analysis (5.1., 5.2.).

                              1.3. History

    Previously, two OSHA sampling and analytical methods for cadmium 
were used concurrently (5.3., 5.4.). Both of these methods also required 
0.8-<greek-m>m mixed cellulose ester membrane filters for the collection 
of air samples. These cadmium air filter samples were analyzed by either 
flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (5.3.) or inductively coupled 
plasma/atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (5.4.). Neither of these 
two analytical methods have adequate sensitivity for measuring workplace 
exposure to airborne cadmium at the new lower TWA and Action Level TWA 
PEL levels when consecutive samples are taken on one employee and the 
sample results need to be averaged with other samples to determine a 
single TWA.
    The inclusion of two atomic absorption analytical techniques in the 
new sampling and analysis method for airborne cadmium permits 
quantitation of sample results over a broad range of exposure levels and 
sampling periods. The flame AAS analytical technique included in this 
method is similar to the previous procedure given in the General Metals 
Method ID-121 (5.3.) with some modifications. The sensitivity of the 
AAS-HGA analytical technique included in this method is adequate to 
measure exposure levels at 1/10 the Action Level TWA, or lower, when 
less than full-shift samples need to be averaged together.

                         1.4. Properties (5.5.)

    Elemental cadmium is a silver-white, blue-tinged, lustrous metal 
which is easily cut with a knife. It is slowly oxidized by moist air to 
form cadmium oxide. It is insoluble in water, but reacts readily with 
dilute nitric acid. Some of the physical properties and other 
descriptive information of elemental cadmium are given below:

CAS No.........................................................7440-43-9
Atomic Number.........................................................48
Atomic Symbol.........................................................Cd
Atomic Weight.....................................................112.41
  Melting Point.....................................................321 
                                                                   deg.C

                                                                   deg.C
   Density................................................8.65 g/mL (25 
                                                                  deg.C)

    The properties of specific cadmium compounds are described in 
reference 5.5.

                         1.5. Method Performance

    A synopsis of method performance is presented below. Further 
information can be found in Section 4.
    1.5.1. The qualitative and quantitative detection limits for the 
flame AAS analytical technique are 0.04 <greek-m>g (0.004 <greek-m>g/mL) 
and 0.14 <greek-m>g (0.014 <greek-m>g/mL) cadmium, respectively, for a 
10 mL solution volume. These correspond, respectively, to 0.2 
<greek-m>g/m\3\ and 0.70 <greek-m>g/m\3\ for a 200 L air volume.
    1.5.2. The qualitative and quantitative detection limits for the 
AAS-HGA analytical technique are 0.44 ng (0.044 ng/mL) and 1.5 ng (0.15 
ng/mL) cadmium, respectively, for a 10 mL solution volume. These 
correspond, respectively, to 0.007 <greek-m>g/m\3\ and 0.025 <greek-m>g/
m\3\ for a 60 L air volume.
    1.5.3. The average recovery by the flame AAS analytical technique of 
17 spiked MCEF

[[Page 167]]

samples containing cadmium in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 times the TWA 
target concentration of 5 <greek-m>g/m\3\ (assuming a 400 L air volume) 
was 104.0% with a pooled coefficient of variation (CV<INF>1</INF>) of 
0.010. The flame analytical technique exhibited a positive bias of +4.0% 
for the validated concentration range. The overall analytical error 
(OAE) for the flame AAS analytical technique was <plus-minus>6.0%.
    1.5.4. The average recovery by the AAS-HGA analytical technique of 
18 spiked MCEF samples containing cadmium in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 
times the Action Level TWA target concentration of 2.5 <greek-m>g/m\3\ 
(assuming a 60 L air volume) was 94.2% with a pooled coefficient of 
variation (CV<INF>1</INF>) of 0.043. The AAS-HGA analytical technique 
exhibited a negative bias of -5.8% for the validated concentration 
range. The overall analytical error (OAE) for the AAS-HGA analytical 
technique was <plus-minus>14.2%.
    1.5.5. Sensitivity in flame atomic absorption is defined as the 
characteristic concentration of an element required to produce a signal 
of 1% absorbance (0.0044 absorbance units). Sensitivity values are 
listed for each element by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer 
manufacturer and have proved to be a very valuable diagnostic tool to 
determine if instrumental parameters are optimized and if the instrument 
is performing up to specification. The sensitivity of the 
spectrophotometer used in the validation of the flame AAS analytical 
technique agreed with the manufacturer specifications (5.6.); the 2 
<greek-m>g/mL cadmium standard gave an absorbance reading of 0.350 abs. 
units.
    1.5.6. Sensitivity in graphite furnace atomic absorption is defined 
in terms of the characteristic mass, the number of picograms required to 
give an integrated absorbance value of 0.0044 absorbance-second (5.7.). 
Data suggests that under Stabilized Temperature Platform Furnace (STPF) 
conditions (see Section 1.6.2.), characteristic mass values are 
transferable between properly functioning instruments to an accuracy of 
about 20% (5.2.). The characteristic mass for STPF analysis of cadmium 
with Zeeman background correction listed by the manufacturer of the 
instrument used in the validation of the AAS-HGA analytical technique 
was 0.35 pg. The experimental characteristic mass value observed during 
the determination of the working range and detection limits of the AAS-
HGA analytical technique was 0.41 pg.

                           1.6. Interferences

    1.6.1. High concentrations of silicate interfere in determining 
cadmium by flame AAS (5.6.). However, silicates are not significantly 
soluble in the acid matrix used to prepare the samples.

                         1.7. Toxicology (5.14.)

    Information listed within this section is synopsis of current 
knowledge of the physiological effects of cadmium and is not intended to 
be used as the basis for OSHA policy. IARC classifies cadmium and 
certain of its compounds as Group 2A carcinogens (probably carcinogenic 
to humans). Cadmium fume is intensely irritating to the respiratory 
tract. Workplace exposure to cadmium can cause both chronic and acute 
effects. Acute effects include tracheobronchitis, pneumonitis, and 
pulmonary edema. Chronic effects include anemia, rhinitis/anosmia, 
pulmonary emphysema, proteinuria and lung cancer. The primary target 
organs for chronic disease are the kidneys (non-carcinogenic) and the 
lungs (carcinogenic).

                               2. Sampling

                             2.1. Apparatus

    2.1.1. Filter cassette unit for air sampling: A 37-mm diameter mixed 
cellulose ester membrane filter with a pore size of 0.8-<greek-m>m 
contained in a 37-mm polystyrene two- or three-piece cassette filter 
holder (part no. MAWP 037 A0, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filter 
is supported with a cellulose backup pad. The cassette is sealed prior 
to use with a shrinkable gel band.
    2.1.2. A calibrated personal sampling pump whose flow is determined 
to an accuracy of <plus-minus>5% at the recommended flow rate with the 
filter cassette unit in line.

                             2.2. Procedure

    2.2.1. Attach the prepared cassette to the calibrated sampling pump 
(the backup pad should face the pump) using flexible tubing. Place the 
sampling device on the employee such that air is sampled from the 
breathing zone.
    2.2.2. Collect air samples at a flow rate of 2.0 L/min. If the 
filter does not become overloaded, a full-shift (at least seven hours) 
sample is strongly recommended for TWA and Action Level TWA measurements 
with a maximum air volume of 960 L. If overloading occurs, collect 
consecutive air samples for shorter sampling periods to cover the full 
workshift.

[[Page 168]]

    2.2.3. Replace the end plugs into the filter cassettes immediately 
after sampling. Record the sampling conditions.
    2.2.4. Securely wrap each sample filter cassette end-to-end with an 
OSHA Form 21 sample seal.
    2.2.5. Submit at least one blank sample with each set of air 
samples. The blank sample should be handled the same as the other 
samples except that no air is drawn through it.
    2.2.6. Ship the samples to the laboratory for analysis as soon as 
possible in a suitable container designed to prevent damage in transit.

                         3.1. Safety Precautions

    3.1.1. Wear safety glasses, protective clothing and gloves at all 
times.
    3.1.2. Handle acid solutions with care. Handle all cadmium samples 
and solutions with extra care (see Sect. 1.7.). Avoid their direct 
contact with work area surfaces, eyes, skin and clothes. Flush acid 
solutions which contact the skin or eyes with copious amounts of water.
    3.1.3. Perform all acid digestions and acid dilutions in an exhaust 
hood while wearing a face shield. To avoid exposure to acid vapors, do 
not remove beakers containing concentrated acid solutions from the 
exhaust hood until they have returned to room temperature and have been 
diluted or emptied.
    3.1.4. Exercise care when using laboratory glassware. Do not use 
chipped pipets, volumetric flasks, beakers or any glassware with sharp 
edges exposed in order to avoid the possibility of cuts or abrasions.
    3.1.5. Never pipet by mouth.
    3.1.6. Refer to the instrument instruction manuals and SOPs (5.8., 
5.9.) for proper and safe operation of the atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer, graphite furnace atomizer and associated equipment.
    3.1.7. Because metallic elements and other toxic substances are 
vaporized during AAS flame or graphite furnace atomizer operation, it is 
imperative that an exhaust vent be used. Always ensure that the exhaust 
system is operating properly during instrument use.

    Store the working standards in narrow-mouth polyethylene or glass 
bottles with leakproof caps. Prepare monthly.

                         3.9. Sample Preparation

    3.9.1. Carefully transfer each sample filter with forceps from its 
filter cassette unit to a clean, separate 125-mL Phillips beaker along 
with any loose dust found in the cassette. Label each Phillips beaker 
with the appropriate sample number.
    3.9.2. Digest the sample by adding 5 mL of concentrated nitric acid 
(HNO<INF>3</INF>) to each Phillips beaker containing an air filter 
sample. Place the Phillips beakers on a hot plate in an exhaust hood and 
heat the samples until approximately 0.5 mL remains. The sample

[[Page 170]]

solution in each Phillips beaker should become clear. If it is not 
clear, digest the sample with another portion of concentrated nitric 
acid.
    3.9.3. After completing the HNO<INF>3</INF> digestion and cooling 
the samples, add 40 <greek-m> L (2 drops) of concentrated HCl to each 
air sample solution and then swirl the contents. Carefully add about 5 
mL of deionized water by pouring it down the inside of each beaker.
    3.9.4. Quantitatively transfer each cooled air sample solution from 
each Phillips beaker to a clean 10-mL volumetric flask. Dilute each 
flask to volume with deionized water and mix well.

                        3.10. Flame AAS Analysis

    Analyze all of the air samples for their cadmium content by flame 
atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) according to the instructions given 
below.
    3.10.1. Set up the atomic absorption spectrophotometer for the air/
acetylene flame analysis of cadmium according to the SOP (5.8.) or the 
manufacturer's operational instructions. For the source lamp, use the 
cadmium hollow cathode or electrodeless discharge lamp operated at the 
manufacturer's recommended rating for continuous operation. Allow the 
lamp to warm up 10 to 20 min or until the energy output stabilizes. 
Optimize conditions such as lamp position, burner head alignment, fuel 
and oxidant flow rates, etc. See the SOP or specific instrument manuals 
for details. Instrumental parameters for the Perkin-Elmer Model 603 used 
in the validation of this method are given in Attachment 1.
    3.10.2. Aspirate and measure the absorbance of a standard solution 
of cadmium. The standard concentration should be within the linear 
range. For the instrumentation used in the validation of this method a 2 
<greek-m>g/mL cadmium standard gives a net absorbance reading of about 
0.350 abs. units (see Section 1.5.5.) when the instrument and the source 
lamp are performing to manufacturer specifications.
    3.10.3. To increase instrument response, scale expand the absorbance 
reading of the aspirated 2 <greek-m>g/mL working standard approximately 
four times. Increase the integration time to at least 3 seconds to 
reduce signal noise.
    3.10.4. Autozero the instrument while aspirating a deionized water 
blank. Monitor the variation in the baseline absorbance reading 
(baseline noise) for a few minutes to insure that the instrument, source 
lamp and associated equipment are in good operating condition.
    3.10.5. Aspirate the working standards and samples directly into the 
flame and record their absorbance readings. Aspirate the deionized water 
blank immediately after every standard or sample to correct for and 
monitor any baseline drift and noise. Record the baseline absorbance 
reading of each deionized water blank. Label each standard and sample 
reading and its accompanying baseline reading.
    3.10.6. It is recommended that the entire series of working 
standards be analyzed at the beginning and end of the analysis of a set 
of samples to establish a concentration-response curve, ensure that the 
standard readings agree with each other and are reproducible. Also, 
analyze a working standard after every five or six samples to monitor 
the performance of the spectrophotometer. Standard readings should agree 
within <plus-minus>10 to 15% of the readings obtained at the beginning 
of the analysis.
    3.10.7. Bracket the sample readings with standards during the 
analysis. If the absorbance reading of a sample is above the absorbance 
reading of the highest working standard, dilute the sample with diluting 
solution and reanalyze. Use the appropriate dilution factor in the 
calculations.
    3.10.8. Repeat the analysis of approximately 10% of the samples for 
a check of precision.
    3.10.9. If possible, analyze quality control samples from an 
independent source as a check on analytical recovery and precision.
    3.10.10. Record the final instrument settings at the end of the 
analysis. Date and label the output.

                         3.11. AAS-HGA Analysis

    Initially analyze all of the air samples for their cadmium content 
by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) according to the 
instructions given in Section 3.10. If the concentration of cadmium in a 
sample solution is less than three times the quantitative detection 
limit [0.04 <greek-m>g/mL (40 ng/mL) for the instrumentation used in the 
validation] and the sample results are to be averaged with other samples 
for TWA calculations, proceed with the AAS-HGA analysis of the sample as 
described below.
    3.11.1. Set up the atomic absorption spectrophotometer and HGA for 
flameless atomic absorption analysis of cadmium according to the SOP 
(5.9.) or the manufacturer's operational instructions and allow the 
instrument to stabilize. The graphite furnace atomizer is equipped with 
a pyrolytically coated graphite tube containing a pyrolytic platform. 
For the source lamp, use a cadmium hollow cathode or electrodeless 
discharge lamp operated at the manufacturer's recommended setting for 
graphite furnace operation. The Zeeman background corrector and EDL are 
recommended for use with the L'vov platform. Instrumental parameters for 
the Perkin-Elmer Model 5100 spectrophotometer and Zeeman HGA-600 
graphite furnace used in the validation of this method are given in 
Attachment 2.
    3.11.2. Optimize the energy reading of the spectrophotometer at 
228.8 nm by adjusting

[[Page 171]]

the lamp position and the wavelength according to the manufacturer's 
instructions.
    3.11.3. Set up the autosampler to inject a 5-<greek-m> L aliquot of 
the working standard, sample or reagent blank solution onto the L'vov 
platform along with a 10-<greek-m> L overlay of the matrix modifier.
    3.11.4. Analyze the reagent blank (diluting solution, Section 
3.5.6.) and then autozero the instrument before starting the analysis of 
a set of samples. It is recommended that the reagent blank be analyzed 
several times during the analysis to assure the integrated absorbance 
(peak area) reading remains at or near zero.
    3.11.5. Analyze a working standard approximately midway in the 
linear portion of the working standard range two or three times to check 
for reproducibility and sensitivity (see sections 1.5.5. and 1.5.6.) 
before starting the analysis of samples. Calculate the experimental 
characteristic mass value from the average integrated absorbance reading 
and injection volume of the analyzed working standard. Compare this 
value to the manufacturer's suggested value as a check of proper 
instrument operation.
    3.11.6. Analyze the reagent blank, working standard, and sample 
solutions. Record and label the peak area (abs-sec) readings and the 
peak and background peak profiles on the printer/plotter.
    3.11.7. It is recommended the entire series of working standards be 
analyzed at the beginning and end of the analysis of a set of samples. 
Establish a concentration-response curve and ensure standard readings 
agree with each other and are reproducible. Also, analyze a working 
standard after every five or six samples to monitor the performance of 
the system. Standard readings should agree within <plus-minus>15% of the 
readings obtained at the beginning of the analysis.
    3.11.8. Bracket the sample readings with standards during the 
analysis. If the peak area reading of a sample is above the peak area 
reading of the highest working standard, dilute the sample with the 
diluting solution and reanalyze. Use the appropriate dilution factor in 
the calculations.
    3.11.9. Repeat the analysis of approximately 10% of the samples for 
a check of precision.
    3.11.10. If possible, analyze quality control samples from an 
independent source as a check of analytical recovery and precision.
    3.11.11. Record the final instrument settings at the end of the 
analysis. Date and label the output.

                           3.12. Calculations

    Note: Standards used for HGA analysis are in ng/mL. Total amounts of 
cadmium from calculations will be in ng (not <greek-m>g) unless a prior 
conversion is made.
    3.12.1. Correct for baseline drift and noise in flame AAS analysis 
by subtracting each baseline absorbance reading from its corresponding 
working standard or sample absorbance reading to obtain the net 
absorbance reading for each standard and sample.
    3.12.2. Use a least squares regression program to plot a 
concentration-response curve of net absorbance reading (or peak area for 
HGA analysis) versus concentration (<greek-m>g/mL or ng/mL) of cadmium 
in each working standard.
    3.12.3. Determine the concentration (<greek-m>g/mL or ng/mL) of 
cadmium in each sample from the resulting concentration-response curve. 
If the concentration of cadmium in a sample solution is less than three 
times the quantitative detection limit [0.04 <greek-m>g/mL (40 ng/mL) 
for the instrumentation used in the validation of the method] and if 
consecutive samples were taken on one employee and the sample results 
are to be averaged with other samples to determine a single TWA, 
reanalyze the sample by AAS-HGA as described in Section 3.11. and report 
the AAS-HGA analytical results.
    3.12.4. Calculate the total amount (<greek-m>g or ng) of cadmium in 
each sample from the sample solution volume (mL):
W = (C)(sample vol, mL)(DF)

Where:
W = Total cadmium in sample
C = Calculated concentration of cadmium
DF = Dilution Factor (if applicable)
    3.12.5. Make a blank correction for each air sample by subtracting 
the total amount of cadmium in the corresponding blank sample from the 
total amount of cadmium in the sample.
    3.12.6. Calculate the concentration of cadmium in an air sample (mg/
m\3\ or <greek-m>g/m\3\) by using one of the following equations:

mg/m\3\ = W<INF>bc</INF>/(Air vol sampled, L)

or

<greek-m>g/m\3\ = (W<INF>bc</INF>)(1,000 ng/<greek-m>g)/(Air vol 
          sampled, L)
Where:
W<INF>bc</INF> = blank corrected total <greek-m>g cadmium in the sample. 
(1<greek-m>g=1,000 ng)

                             4. Backup Data

                            4.1. Introduction

    4.1.1. The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the analytical 
method recovery, working standard range, and qualitative and 
quantitative detection limits of the two atomic absorption analytical 
techniques included in this method. The evaluation consisted of the 
following experiments:
    1. An analysis of 24 samples (six samples each at 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 
times the TWA-PEL) for the analytical method recovery study of the flame 
AAS analytical technique.
    2. An analysis of 18 samples (six samples each at 0.5, 1 and 2 times 
the Action Level TWA-PEL) for the analytical method recovery study of 
the AAS-HGA analytical technique.

[[Page 172]]

    3. Multiple analyses of the reagent blank and a series of standard 
solutions to determine the working standard range and the qualitative 
and quantitative detection limits for both atomic absorption analytical 
techniques.
    4.1.2. The analytical method recovery results at all test levels 
were calculated from concentration-response curves and statistically 
examined for outliers at the 99% confidence level. Possible outliers 
were determined using the Treatment of Outliers test (5.10.). In 
addition, the sample results of the two analytical techniques, at 0.5, 
1.0 and 2.0 times their target concentrations, were tested for 
homogeneity of variances also at the 99% confidence level. Homogeneity 
of the coefficients of variation was determined using the Bartlett's 
test (5.11.). The overall analytical error (OAE) at the 95% confidence 
level was calculated using the equation (5.12.):

OAE = <plus-minus>[| Bias|+(1.96)(CV<INF>1</INF>(pooled))(100%)]
    4.1.3. A derivation of the International Union of Pure and Applied 
Chemistry (IUPAC) detection limit equation (5.13.) was used to determine 
the qualitative and quantitative detection limits for both atomic 
absorption analytical techniques:

C<INF>ld</INF> = k(sd)/m        (Equation 1)

Where:

C<INF>ld</INF> = the smallest reliable detectable concentration an 
analytical instrument can determine at a given confidence level.
k = 3 for the Qualitative Detection Limit at the 99.86% Confidence Level
= 10 for the Quantitative Detection Limit at the 99.99% Confidence 
Level.
sd = standard deviation of the reagent blank (Rbl) readings.
m = analytical sensitivity or slope as calculated by linear regression.
    4.1.4. Collection efficiencies of metallic fume and dust atmospheres 
on 0.8-<greek-m> m mixed cellulose ester membrane filters are well 
documented and have been shown to be excellent (5.11.). Since elemental 
cadmium and the cadmium component of cadmium compounds are nonvolatile, 
stability studies of cadmium spiked MCEF samples were not performed.

                             4.2. Equipment

    4.2.1. A Perkin-Elmer (PE) Model 603 spectrophotometer equipped with 
a manual gas control system, a stainless steel nebulizer, a burner 
mixing chamber, a flow spoiler and a 10 cm. (one-slot) burner head was 
used in the experimental validation of the flame AAS analytical 
technique. A PE cadmium hollow cathode lamp, operated at the 
manufacturer's recommended current setting for continuous operation (4 
mA), was used as the source lamp. Instrument parameters are listed in 
Attachment 1.
    4.2.2. A PE Model 5100 spectrophotometer, Zeeman HGA-600 graphite 
furnace atomizer and AS-60 HGA autosampler were used in the experimental 
validation of the AAS-HGA analytical technique. The spectrophotometer 
was equipped with a PE Series 7700 professional computer and Model PR-
310 printer. A PE System 2 cadmium electrodeless discharge lamp, 
operated at the manufacturer's recommended current setting for modulated 
operation (170 mA), was used as the source lamp. Instrument parameters 
are listed in Attachment 2.

                              4.3. Reagents

    4.3.1. J.T. Baker Chem. Co. (Analyzed grade) concentrated nitric 
acid, 69.0-71.0%, and concentrated hydrochloric acid, 36.5-38.0%, were 
used to prepare the samples and standards.
    4.3.2. Ammonium phosphate, monobasic, NH<INF>4</INF> H<INF>2</INF> 
PO<INF>4</INF> and magnesium nitrate, 
Mg(NO<INF>3</INF>)<INF>2</INF>6H<INF>2</INF> O, both manufactured by the 
Mallinckrodt Chem. Co., were used to prepare the matrix modifier for 
AAS-HGA analysis.

            4.4. Standard Preparation for Flame AAS Analysis

    4.4.1. Dilute stock solutions: Prepared 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 
<greek-m>g/mL cadmium standard stock solutions by making appropriate 
serial dilutions of a commercially available 1,000 <greek-m>g/mL cadmium 
standard stock solution (RICCA Chemical Co., Lot A102) with the 
diluting solution (4% HNO<INF>3</INF>, 0.4% HCl).
    4.4.2. Analyzed Standards: Prepared cadmium standards in the range 
of 0.001 to 2.0 <greek-m>g/mL by pipetting 2 to 10 mL of the appropriate 
dilute cadmium stock solution into a 100-mL volumetric flask and 
diluting to volume with the diluting solution. (See Section 3.7.2.)

             4.5. Standard Preparation for AAS-HGA Analysis

    4.5.1. Dilute stock solutions: Prepared 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 ng/mL 
cadmium standard stock solutions by making appropriate serial dilutions 
of a commercially available 1,000 <greek-m>g/mL cadmium standard stock 
solution (J.T. Baker Chemical Co., Instra-analyzed, Lot D22642) with 
the diluting solution (4% HNO<INF>3</INF>, 0.4% HCl).
    4.5.2. Analyzed Standards: Prepared cadmium standards in the range 
of 0.1 to 40 ng/mL by pipetting 2 to 10 mL of the appropriate dilute 
cadmium stock solution into a 100-mL volumetric flask and diluting to 
volume with the diluting solution. (See Section 3.8.2.)

 4.6. Detection Limits and Standard Working Range for Flame AAS Analysis

    4.6.1. Analyzed the reagent blank solution and the entire series of 
cadmium standards in the range of 0.001 to 2.0 <greek-m>g/mL three to 
six times according to the instructions given in

[[Page 173]]

Section 3.10. The diluting solution (4% HNO<INF>3</INF>, 0.4% HCl) was 
used as the reagent blank. The integration time on the PE 603 
spectrophotometer was set to 3.0 seconds and a four-fold expansion of 
the absorbance reading of the 2.0 <greek-m>g/mL cadmium standard was 
made prior to analysis. The 2.0 <greek-m>g/mL standard gave a net 
absorbance reading of 0.350 abs. units prior to expansion in agreement 
with the manufacturer's specifications (5.6.).
    4.6.2. The net absorbance readings of the reagent blank and the low 
concentration Cd standards from 0.001 to 0.1 <greek-m>g/mL and the 
statistical analysis of the results are shown in Table I. The standard 
deviation, sd, of the six net absorbance readings of the reagent blank 
is 1.05 abs. units. The slope, m, as calculated by a linear regression 
plot of the net absorbance readings (shown in Table II) of the 0.02 to 
1.0 <greek-m>g/mL cadmium standards versus their concentration is 772.7 
abs. units/(<greek-m>g/mL).
    4.6.3. If these values for sd and the slope, m, are used in Eqn. 1 
(Sect. 4.1.3.), the qualitative and quantitative detection limits as 
determined by the IUPAC Method are:

C<INF>ld</INF>=(3)(1.05 abs. units)/(772.7 abs. units/(<greek-m>g/mL))
    = 0.0041 <greek-m>g/mL for the qualitative detection limit.
C<INF>ld</INF>=(10)(1.05 abs. units)/(772.7 abs. units/<greek-m>g/mL))
    =0.014 <greek-m>g/mL for the quantitative detection limit.

The qualitative and quantitative detection limits for the flame AAS 
analytical technique are 0.041 <greek-m>g and 0.14 <greek-m>g cadmium, 
respectively, for a 10 mL solution volume. These correspond, 
respectively, to 0.2 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> and 0.70 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP> for a 200 L air volume.
    4.6.4. The recommended Cd standard working range for flame AAS 
analysis is 0.02 to 2.0 <greek-m>g/mL. The net absorbance readings of 
the reagent blank and the recommended working range standards and the 
statistical analysis of the results are shown in Table II. The standard 
of lowest concentration in the working range, 0.02 <greek-m>g/mL, is 
slightly greater than the calculated quantitative detection limit, 0.014 
<greek-m>g/mL. The standard of highest concentration in the working 
range, 2.0 <greek-m>g/mL, is at the upper end of the linear working 
range suggested by the manufacturer (5.6.). Although the standard net 
absorbance readings are not strictly linear at concentrations above 0.5 
<greek-m>g/mL, the deviation from linearity is only about 10% at the 
upper end of the recommended standard working range. The deviation from 
linearity is probably caused by the four-fold expansion of the signal 
suggested in the method. As shown in Table II, the precision of the 
standard net absorbance readings are excellent throughout the 
recommended working range; the relative standard deviations of the 
readings range from 0.009 to 0.064.

 4.7.  Detection Limits and Standard Working Range for AAS-HGA Analysis

    4.7.1. Analyzed the reagent blank solution and the entire series of 
cadmium standards in the range of 0.1 to 40 ng/mL according to the 
instructions given in Section 3.11. The diluting solution (4% 
HNO<INF>3</INF>, 0.4% HCl) was used as the reagent blank. A fresh 
aliquot of the reagent blank and of each standard was used for every 
analysis. The experimental characteristic mass value was 0.41 pg, 
calculated from the average peak area (abs-sec) reading of the 5 ng/mL 
standard which is approximately midway in the linear portion of the 
working standard range. This agreed within 20% with the characteristic 
mass value, 0.35 pg, listed by the manufacturer of the instrument 
(5.2.).
    4.7.2. The peak area (abs-sec) readings of the reagent blank and the 
low concentration Cd standards from 0.1 to 2.0 ng/mL and statistical 
analysis of the results are shown in Table III. Five of the reagent 
blank peak area readings were zero and the sixth reading was 1 and was 
an outlier. The near lack of a blank signal does not satisfy a strict 
interpretation of the IUPAC method for determining the detection limits. 
Therefore, the standard deviation of the six peak area readings of the 
0.2 ng/mL cadmium standard, 0.75 abs-sec, was used to calculate the 
detection limits by the IUPAC method. The slope, m, as calculated by a 
linear regression plot of the peak area (abs-sec) readings (shown in 
Table IV) of the 0.2 to 10 ng/mL cadmium standards versus their 
concentration is 51.5 abs-sec/(ng/mL).
    4.7.3. If 0.75 abs-sec (sd) and 51.5 abs-sec/(ng/mL) (m) are used in 
Eqn. 1 (Sect. 4.1.3.), the qualitative and quantitative detection limits 
as determined by the IUPAC method are:

C<INF>ld</INF> = (3)(0.75 abs-sec)/(51.5 abs-sec/(ng/mL)
    = 0.044 ng/mL for the qualitative detection limit.

C<INF>ld</INF>= (10)(0.75 abs-sec)/(51.5 abs-sec/(ng/mL) = 0.15 ng/mL 
          for the quantitative detection limit.
The qualitative and quantitative detection limits for the AAS-HGA 
analytical technique are 0.44 ng and 1.5 ng cadmium, respectively, for a 
10 mL solution volume. These correspond, respectively, to 0.007 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> and 0.025 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> for a 60 L 
air volume.
    4.7.4. The peak area (abs-sec) readings of the Cd standards from 0.2 
to 40 ng/mL and the statistical analysis of the results are given in 
Table IV. The recommended standard working range for AAS-HGA analysis is 
0.2 to 20 ng/mL. The standard of lowest concentration in the recommended 
working range is slightly greater than the calculated quantitative 
detection limit, 0.15 ng/mL. The deviation from linearity of the peak 
area readings of the 20 ng/mL standard, the highest concentration 
standard in the recommended working range, is approximately

[[Page 174]]

10%. The deviations from linearity of the peak area readings of the 30 
and 40 ng/mL standards are significantly greater than 10%. As shown in 
Table IV, the precision of the peak area readings are satisfactory 
throughout the recommended working range; the relative standard 
deviations of the readings range from 0.025 to 0.083.

         4.8. Analytical Method Recovery for Flame AAS Analysis

    4.8.1. Four sets of spiked MCEF samples were prepared by injecting 
20 <greek-m>L of 10, 50, 100 and 200 <greek-m>g/mL dilute cadmium stock 
solutions on 37 mm diameter filters (part no. AAWP 037 00, Millipore 
Corp., Bedford, MA) with a calibrated micropipet. The dilute stock 
solutions were prepared by making appropriate serial dilutions of a 
commercially available 1,000 <greek-m>g/mL cadmium standard stock 
solution (RICCA Chemical Co., Lot A102) with the diluting solution (4% 
HNO<INF>3</INF>, 0.4% HCl). Each set contained six samples and a sample 
blank. The amount of cadmium in the prepared sets were equivalent to 
0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 times the TWA PEL target concentration of 5 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> for a 400 L air volume.
    4.8.2. The air-dried spiked filters were digested and analyzed for 
their cadmium content by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) 
following the procedure described in Section 3. The 0.02 to 
2.0<greek-m>g/mL cadmium standards (the suggested working range) were 
used in the analysis of the spiked filters.
    4.8.3. The results of the analysis are given in Table V. One result 
at 0.5 times the TWA PEL target concentration was an outlier and was 
excluded from statistical analysis. Experimental justification for 
rejecting it is that the outlier value was probably due to a spiking 
error. The coefficients of variation for the three test levels at 0.5 to 
2.0 times the TWA PEL target concentration passed the Bartlett's test 
and were pooled.
    4.8.4. The average recovery of the six spiked filter samples at 0.1 
times the TWA PEL target concentration was 118.2% with a coefficient of 
variation (CV<INF>1</INF>) of 0.128. The average recovery of the spiked 
filter samples in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 times the TWA target 
concentration was 104.0% with a pooled coefficient of variation 
(CV<INF>1</INF>) of 0.010. Consequently, the analytical bias found in 
these spiked sample results over the tested concentration range was 
+4.0% and the OAE was <plus-minus>6.0%.

          4.9. Analytical Method Recovery for AAS-HGA Analysis

    4.9.1. Three sets of spiked MCEF samples were prepared by injecting 
15<greek-m> L of 5, 10 and 20 <greek-m>g/mL dilute cadmium stock 
solutions on 37 mm diameter filters (part no. AAWP 037 00, Millipore 
Corp., Bedford, MA) with a calibrated micropipet. The dilute stock 
solutions were prepared by making appropriate serial dilutions of a 
commercially available certified 1,000 <greek-m>g/mL cadmium standard 
stock solution (Fisher Chemical Co., Lot 913438-24) with the diluting 
solution (4% HNO<INF>3</INF>, 0.4% HCl). Each set contained six samples 
and a sample blank. The amount of cadmium in the prepared sets were 
equivalent to 0.5, 1 and 2 times the Action Level TWA target 
concentration of 2.5 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> for a 60 L air volume.
    4.9.2. The air-dried spiked filters were digested and analyzed for 
their cadmium content by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy using 
a heated graphite furnace atomizer following the procedure described in 
Section 3. A five-fold dilution of the spiked filter samples at 2 times 
the Action Level TWA was made prior to their analysis. The 0.05 to 20 
ng/mL cadmium standards were used in the analysis of the spiked filters.
    4.9.3. The results of the analysis are given in Table VI. There were 
no outliers. The coefficients of variation for the three test levels at 
0.5 to 2.0 times the Action Level TWA PEL passed the Bartlett's test and 
were pooled. The average recovery of the spiked filter samples was 94.2% 
with a pooled coefficient of variation (CV<INF>1</INF>) of 0.043. 
Consequently, the analytical bias was -5.8% and the OAE was 
<plus-minus>14.2%.

                            4.10. Conclusions

    The experiments performed in this evaluation show the two atomic 
absorption analytical techniques included in this method to be precise 
and accurate and have sufficient sensitivity to measure airborne cadmium 
over a broad range of exposure levels and sampling periods.

   Appendix F to Sec. 1910.1027--Nonmandatory Protocol for Biological 
                               Monitoring

                           1.00  Introduction

    Under the final OSHA cadmium rule (29 CFR part 1910), monitoring of 
biological specimens and several periodic medical examinations are 
required for eligible employees. These medical examinations are to be 
conducted regularly, and medical monitoring is to include the periodic 
analysis of cadmium in blood (CDB), cadmium in urine (CDU) and beta-2-
microglobulin in urine (B2MU). As CDU and B2MU are to be normalized to 
the concentration of creatinine in urine (CRTU), then CRTU must be 
analyzed in conjunction with CDU and B2MU analyses.
    The purpose of this protocol is to provide procedures for 
establishing and maintaining the quality of the results obtained from 
the analyses of CDB, CDU and B2MU by commercial laboratories. 
Laboratories conforming to the provisions of this nonmandatory protocol 
shall be known as ``participating laboratories.'' The biological 
monitoring data from these laboratories will be evaluated by physicians 
responsible for biological monitoring to determine the conditions under 
which employees may continue to work in locations exhibiting airborne-
cadmium concentrations at or above defined actions levels (see 
paragraphs (l)(3) and (l)(4) of the final rule). These results also may 
be used to support a decision to remove workers from such locations.
    Under the medical monitoring program for cadmium, blood and urine 
samples must be collected at defined intervals from workers by 
physicians responsible for medical monitoring; these samples are sent to 
commerical laboratories that perform the required analyses and report 
results of these analyses to the responsible physicians. To ensure the 
accuracy and reliability of these laboratory analyses, the laboratories 
to which samples are submitted should participate in an ongoing and 
efficacious proficiency testing program. Availability of proficiency 
testing programs may vary with the analyses performed.
    To test proficiency in the analysis of CDB, CDU and B2MU, a 
laboratory should participate either in the interlaboratory comparison 
program operated by the Centre de Toxicologie du Quebec (CTQ) or an 
equivalent program. (Currently, no laboratory in the U.S. performs 
proficiency testing on CDB, CDU or B2MU.) Under this program, CTQ sends 
participating laboratories 18 samples of each analyte (CDB, CDU and/or 
B2MU) annually for analysis. Participating laboratories must return the 
results of these analyses to CTQ within four to five weeks after 
receiving the samples.
    The CTQ program pools analytical results from many participating 
laboratories to derive consensus mean values for each of the samples 
distributed. Results reported by each laboratory then are compared 
against these consensus means for the analyzed samples to determine the 
relative performance of each laboratory. The proficiency of a 
participating laboratory is a function of the extent of agreement 
between results submitted by the participating laboratory and the 
consensus values for the set of samples analyzed.
    Proficiency testing for CRTU analysis (which should be performed 
with CDU and B2MU analyses to evaluate the results properly) also is 
recommended. In the U.S., only the College of American Pathologists 
(CAP) currently conducts CRTU proficiency testing; participating 
laboratories should be accredited for CRTU analysis by the CAP.
    Results of the proficiency evaluations will be forwarded to the 
participating laboratory by the proficiency-testing laboratory, as well 
as to physicians designated by the participating laboratory to receive 
this information. In addition, the participating laboratory should, on 
request, submit the results of their internal Quality Assurance/Quality 
Control (QA/QC) program for each analytic procedure (i.e., CDB, CDU and/
or B2MU) to physicians designated to receive the proficiency results. 
For participating laboratories offering CDU and/or B2MU analyses, QA/QC 
documentation also should be provided for CRTU analysis. (Laboratories 
should provide QA/QC information regarding CRTU analysis directly to the 
requesting physician if they perform the analysis in-house; if CRTU 
analysis is performed by another laboratory under contract, this 
information should be provided to the physician by the contract 
laboratory.)
    QA/QC information, along with the actual biological specimen 
measurements, should be provided to the responsible physician using 
standard formats. These physicians then may collate the QA/QC 
information with proficiency test results to compare the relative 
performance of laboratories, as well as to facilitate evaluation of the 
worker monitoring data. This information supports decisions made by the 
physician with regard to the biological monitoring program, and for 
mandating medical removal.
    This protocol describes procedures that may be used by the 
responsible physicians to identify laboratories most likely to be 
proficient in the analysis of samples used in the biological monitoring 
of cadmium; also provided are procedures for record keeping and 
reporting by laboratories participating in proficiency testing programs, 
and recommendations to assist these physicians in interpreting 
analytical results determined by participating laboratories. As the 
collection and handling of samples affects the

[[Page 179]]

quality of the data, recommendations are made for these tasks. 
Specifications for analytical methods to be used in the medical 
monitoring program are included in this protocol as well.
    In conclusion, this document is intended as a supplement to 
characterize and maintain the quality of medical monitoring data 
collected under the final cadmium rule promulgated by OSHA (29 CFR part 
1910). OSHA has been granted authority under the Occupational Safety and 
Health Act of 1970 to protect workers from the effects of exposure to 
hazardous substances in the work place and to mandate adequate 
monitoring of workers to determine when adverse health effects may be 
occurring. This nonmandatory protocol is intended to provide guidelines 
and recommendations to improve the accuracy and reliability of the 
procedures used to analyze the biological samples collected as part of 
the medical monitoring program for cadmium.

                            2.0  Definitions

    When the terms below appear in this protocol, use the following 
definitions.
    Accuracy: A measure of the bias of a data set. Bias is a systematic 
error that is either inherent in a method or caused by some artifact or 
idiosyncracy of the measurement system. Bias is characterized by a 
consistent deviation (positive or negative) in the results from an 
accepted reference value.
    Arithmetic Mean: The sum of measurements in a set divided by the 
number of measurements in a set.
    Blind Samples: A quality control procedure in which the 
concentration of analyte in the samples should be unknown to the analyst 
at the time that the analysis is performed.
    Coefficient of Variation: The ratio of the standard deviation of a 
set of measurements to the mean (arithmetic or geometric) of the 
measurements.
    Compliance Samples: Samples from exposed workers sent to a 
participating laboratory for analysis.
    Control Charts: Graphic representations of the results for quality 
control samples being analyzed by a participating laboratory.
    Control Limits: Statistical limits which define when an analytic 
procedure exceeds acceptable parameters; control limits provide a method 
of assessing the accuracy of analysts, laboratories, and discrete 
analytic runs.
    Control Samples: Quality control samples.
    F/T: The measured amount of an analyte divided by the theoretical 
value (defined below) for that analyte in the sample analyzed; this 
ratio is a measure of the recovery for a quality control sample.
    Geometric Mean: The natural antilog of the mean of a set of natural 
log-transformed data.
    Geometric Standard Deviation: The antilog of the standard deviation 
of a set of natural log-transformed data.
    Limit of Detection: Using a predefined level of confidence, this is 
the lowest measured value at which some of the measured material is 
likely to have come from the sample.
    Mean: A central tendency of a set of data; in this protocol, this 
mean is defined as the arithmetic mean (see definition of arithmetic 
mean above) unless stated otherwise.
    Performance: A measure of the overall quality of data reported by a 
laboratory.
    Pools: Groups of quality-control samples to be established for each 
target value (defined below) of an analyte. For the protocol provided in 
attachment 3, for example, the theoretical value of the quality control 
samples of the pool must be within a range defined as plus or minus 
(<plus-minus>) 50% of the target value. Within each analyte pool, there 
must be quality control samples of at least 4 theoretical values.
    Precision: The extent of agreement between repeated, independent 
measurements of the same quantity of an analyte.
    Proficiency: The ability to satisfy a specified level of analyte 
performance.
    Proficiency Samples: Specimens, the values of which are unknown to 
anyone at a participating laboratory, and which are submitted by a 
participating laboratory for proficiency testing.
    Quality or Data Quality: A measure of the confidence in the 
measurement value.
    Quality Control (QC) Samples: Specimens, the value of which is 
unknown to the analyst, but is known to the appropriate QA/QC personnel 
of a participating laboratory; when used as part of a laboratory QA/QC 
program, the theoretical values of these samples should not be known to 
the analyst until the analyses are complete. QC samples are to be run in 
sets consisting of one QC sample from each pool (see definition of 
``pools'' above).
    Sensitivity: For the purposes of this protocol, the limit of 
detection.
    Standard Deviation: A measure of the distribution or spread of a 
data set about the mean; the standard deviation is equal to the positive 
square root of the variance, and is expressed in the same units as the 
original measurements in the data set.
    Standards: Samples with values known by the analyst and used to 
calibrate equipment and to check calibration throughout an analytic run. 
In a laboratory QA/QC program, the values of the standards must exceed 
the values obtained for compliance samples such that the lowest standard 
value is near the limit of detection and the highest standard is higher 
than the highest compliance sample or QC sample. Standards of at least 
three different values are to be used for calibration, and should be 
constructed from at least 2 different sources.

[[Page 180]]

    Target Value: Those values of CDB, CDU or B2MU which trigger some 
action as prescribed in the medical surveillance section of the 
regulatory text of the final cadmium rule. For CDB, the target values 
are 5, 10 and 15 <greek-m>g/l. For CDU, the target values are 3, 7, and 
15 <greek-m>g/g CRTU. For B<INF>2</INF> MU, the target values are 300, 
750 and 1500 <greek-m>g/g CRTU. (Note that target values may vary as a 
function of time.)
    Theoretical Value (or Theoretical Amount): The reported 
concentration of a quality-control sample (or calibration standard) 
derived from prior characterizations of the sample.
    Value or Measurement Value: The numerical result of a measurement.
    Variance: A measure of the distribution or spread of a data set 
about the mean; the variance is the sum of the squares of the 
differences between the mean and each discrete measurement divided by 
one less than the number of measurements in the data set.

                              3.0  Protocol

    This protocol provides procedures for characterizing and maintaining 
the quality of analytic results derived for the medical monitoring 
program mandated for workers under the final cadmium rule.

                              3.1  Overview

    The goal of this protocol is to assure that medical monitoring data 
are of sufficient quality to facilitate proper interpretation. The data 
quality objectives (DQOs) defined for the medical monitoring program are 
summarized in Table 1. Based on available information, the DQOs 
presented in Table 1 should be achievable by the majority of 
laboratories offering the required analyses commercially; OSHA 
recommends that only laboratories meeting these DQOs be used for the 
analysis of biological samples collected for monitoring cadmium 
exposure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To satisfy the DQOs presented in Table 1, OSHA provides the 
following guidelines:
    1. Procedures for the collection and handling of blood and urine are 
specified (Section 3.4.1 of this protocol);
    2. Preferred analytic methods for the analysis of CDB, CDU and B2MU 
are defined (and a method for the determination of CRTU also is 
specified since CDU and B2MU results are to be normalized to the level 
of CRTU).
    3. Procedures are described for identifying laboratories likely to 
provide the required analyses in an accurate and reliable manner;
    4. These guidelines (Sections 3.2.1 to 3.2.3, and Section 3.3) 
include recommendations regarding internal QA/QC programs for 
participating laboratories, as well as levels of proficiency through 
participation in an interlaboratory proficiency program;
    5. Procedures for QA/QC record keeping (Section 3.3.2), and for 
reporting QC/QA results are described (Section 3.3.3); and,
    6. Procedures for interpreting medical monitoring results are 
specified (Section 3.4.3).
    Methods recommended for the biological monitoring of eligible 
workers are:
    1. The method of Stoeppler and Brandt (1980) for CDB determinations 
(limit of detection: 0.5 <greek-m>g/l);
    2. The method of Pruszkowska et al. (1983) for CDU determinations 
(limit of detection: 0.5 <greek-m>g/l of urine); and,
    3. The Pharmacia Delphia test kit (Pharmacia 1990) for the 
determination of B2MU (limit of detection: 100 <greek-m>g/l urine).
    Because both CDU and B2MU should be reported in <greek-m>g/g CRTU, 
an independent determination of CRTU is recommended. Thus, both the OSHA 
Salt Lake City Technical Center (OSLTC) method (OSHA, no date) and the 
Jaffe method (Du Pont, no date) for the determination of CRTU are 
specified under this protocol (i.e., either of these 2 methods may be 
used). Note that although detection limits are not reported for either 
of these CRTU methods, the range of measurements expected for CRTU (0.9-
1.7 <greek-m>g/l) are well above the likely limit of detection for 
either of these methods (Harrison, 1987).
    Laboratories using alternate methods should submit sufficient data 
to the responsible physicians demonstrating that the alternate method is 
capable of satisfying the

[[Page 181]]

defined data quality objectives of the program. Such laboratories also 
should submit a QA/QC plan that documents the performance of the 
alternate method in a manner entirely equivalent to the QA/QC plans 
proposed in Section 3.3.1.
    3.2  Duties of the Responsible Physician
    The responsible physician will evaluate biological monitoring 
results provided by participating laboratories to determine whether such 
laboratories are proficient and have satisfied the QA/QC 
recommendations. In determining which laboratories to employ for this 
purpose, these physicians should review proficiency and QA/QC data 
submitted to them by the participating laboratories.
    Participating laboratories should demonstrate proficiency for each 
analyte (CDU, CDB and B2MU) sampled under the biological monitoring 
program. Participating laboratories involved in analyzing CDU and B2MU 
also should demonstrate proficiency for CRTU analysis, or provide 
evidence of a contract with a laboratory proficient in CRTU analysis.

    3.2.1  Recommendations for Selecting Among Existing Laboratories

    OSHA recommends that existing laboratories providing commercial 
analyses for CDB, CDU and/or B2MU for the medical monitoring program 
satisfy the following criteria:
    1. Should have performed commercial analyses for the appropriate 
analyte (CDB, CDU and/or B2MU) on a regular basis over the last 2 years;
    2. Should provide the responsible physician with an internal QA/QC 
plan;
    3. If performing CDU or B2MU analyses, the participating laboratory 
should be accredited by the CAP for CRTU analysis, and should be 
enrolled in the corresponding CAP survey (note that alternate 
credentials may be acceptable, but acceptability is to be determined by 
the responsible physician); and,
    4. Should have enrolled in the CTQ interlaboratory comparison 
program for the appropriate analyte (CDB, CDU and/or B2MU).
    Participating laboratories should submit appropriate documentation 
demonstrating compliance with the above criteria to the responsible 
physician. To demonstrate compliance with the first of the above 
criteria, participating laboratories should submit the following 
documentation for each analyte they plan to analyze (note that each 
document should cover a period of at least 8 consecutive quarters, and 
that the period designated by the term ``regular analyses'' is at least 
once a quarter):
    1. Copies of laboratory reports providing results from regular 
analyses of the appropriate analyte (CDB, CDU and/or B2MU);
    2. Copies of 1 or more signed and executed contracts for the 
provision of regular analyses of the appropriate analyte (CDB, CDU and/
or B2MU); or,
    3. Copies of invoices sent to 1 or more clients requesting payment 
for the provision of regular analyses of the appropriate analyte (CDB, 
CDU and/or B2MU). Whatever the form of documentation submitted, the 
specific analytic procedures conducted should be identified directly. 
The forms that are copied for submission to the responsible physician 
also should identify the laboratory which provided these analyses.
    To demonstrate compliance with the second of the above criteria, a 
laboratory should submit to the responsible physician an internal QA/QC 
plan detailing the standard operating procedures to be adopted for 
satisfying the recommended QA/QC procedures for the analysis of each 
specific analyte (CDB, CDU and/or B2MU). Procedures for internal QA/QC 
programs are detailed in Section 3.3.1 below.
    To satisfy the third of the above criteria, laboratories analyzing 
for CDU or B2MU also should submit a QA/QC plan for creatinine analysis 
(CRTU); the QA/QC plan and characterization analyses for CRTU must come 
from the laboratory performing the CRTU analysis, even if the CRTU 
analysis is being performed by a contract laboratory.
    Laboratories enrolling in the CTQ program (to satisfy the last of 
the above criteria) must remit, with the enrollment application, an 
initial fee of approximately $100 per analyte. (Note that this fee is 
only an estimate, and is subject to revision without notice.) 
Laboratories should indicate on the application that they agree to have 
proficiency test results sent by the CTQ directly to the physicians 
designated by participating laboratories.
    Once a laboratory's application is processed by the CTQ, the 
laboratory will be assigned a code number which will be provided to the 
laboratory on the initial confirmation form, along with identification 
of the specific analytes for which the laboratory is participating. 
Confirmation of participation will be sent by the CTQ to physicians 
designated by the applicant laboratory.

 3.2.2  Recommended Review of Laboratories Selected to Perform Analyses

    Six months after being selected initially to perform analyte 
determinations, the status of participating laboratories should be 
reviewed by the responsible physicians. Such reviews should then be 
repeated every 6 months or whenever additional proficiency or QA/QC 
documentation is received (whichever occurs first).
    As soon as the responsible physician has received the CTQ results 
from the first 3 rounds of proficiency testing (i.e., 3 sets of 3 
samples each for CDB, CDU and/or B2MU) for a participating laboratory, 
the status of the laboratory's continued participation should

[[Page 182]]

be reviewed. Over the same initial 6-month period, participating 
laboratories also should provide responsible physicians the results of 
their internal QA/QC monitoring program used to assess performance for 
each analyte (CDB, CDU and/or B2MU) for which the laboratory performs 
determinations. This information should be submitted using appropriate 
forms and documentation.
    The status of each participating laboratory should be determined for 
each analyte (i.e., whether the laboratory satisfies minimum proficiency 
guidelines based on the proficiency samples sent by the CTQ and the 
results of the laboratory's internal QA/QC program). To maintain 
competency for analysis of CDB, CDU and/or B2MU during the first review, 
the laboratory should satisfy performance requirements for at least 2 of 
the 3 proficiency samples provided in each of the 3 rounds completed 
over the 6-month period. Proficiency should be maintained for the 
analyte(s) for which the laboratory conducts determinations.
    To continue participation for CDU and/or B2MU analyse, laboratories 
also should either maintain accreditation for CRTU analysis in the CAP 
program and participate in the CAP surveys, or they should contract the 
CDU and B2MU analyses to a laboratory which satisfies these requirements 
(or which can provide documentation of accreditation/participation in an 
equivalent program).
    The performance requirement for CDB analysis is defined as an 
analytical result within <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g/l blood or 15% of the 
consensus mean (whichever is greater). For samples exhibiting a 
consensus mean less than 1 <greek-m>g/l, the performance requirement is 
defined as a concentration between the detection limit of the analysis 
and a maximum of 2 <greek-m>g/l. The purpose for redefining the 
acceptable interval for low CDB values is to encourage proper reporting 
of the actual values obtained during measurement; laboratories, 
therefore, will not be penalized (in terms of a narrow range of 
acceptability) for reporting measured concentrations smaller than 1 
<greek-m>g/l.
    The performance requirement for CDU analysis is defined as an 
analytical result within <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g/l urine or 15% of the 
consensus mean (whichever is greater). For samples exhibiting a 
consensus mean less than 1 <greek-m>g/l urine, the performance 
requirement is defined as a concentration between the detection limit of 
the analysis and a maximum of 2 <greek-m>g/l urine. Laboratories also 
should demonstrate proficiency in creatinine analysis as defined by the 
CAP. Note that reporting CDU results, other than for the CTQ proficiency 
samples (i.e., compliance samples), should be accompanied with results 
of analyses for CRTU, and these 2 sets of results should be combined to 
provide a measure of CDU in units of <greek-m>g/g CRTU.
    The performance requirement for B2MU is defined as analytical 
results within <plus-minus> 15% of the consensus mean. Note that 
reporting B2MU results, other than for CTQ proficiency samples (i.e., 
compliance samples), should be accompanied with results of analyses for 
CRTU, and these 2 sets of results should be combined to provide a 
measure of B2MU in units of <greek-m>g/g CRTU.
    There are no recommended performance checks for CRTU analyses. As 
stated previously, laboratories performing CRTU analysis in support of 
CDU or B2MU analyses should be accredited by the CAP, and participating 
in the CAP's survey for CRTU.
    Following the first review, the status of each participating 
laboratory should be reevaluated at regular intervals (i.e., 
corresponding to receipt of results from each succeeding round of 
proficiency testing and submission of reports from a participating 
laboratory's internal QA/QC program).
    After a year of collecting proficiency test results, the following 
proficiency criterion should be added to the set of criteria used to 
determine the participating laboratory's status (for analyzing CDB, CDU 
and/or B2MU): A participating laboratory should not fail performance 
requirements for more than 4 samples from the 6 most recent consecutive 
rounds used to assess proficiency for CDB, CDU and/or B2MU separately 
(i.e., a total of 18 discrete proficiency samples for each analyte). 
Note that this requirement does not replace, but supplements, the 
recommendation that a laboratory should satisfy the performance criteria 
for at least 2 of the 3 samples tested for each round of the program.

3.2.3  Recommendations for Selecting Among Newly-Formed Laboratories (or 
  Laboratories that Previously Failed to Meet the Protocol Guidelines)

    OSHA recommends that laboratories that have not previously provided 
commercial analyses of CDB, CDU and/or B2MU (or have done so for a 
period less than 2 years), or which have provided these analyses for 2 
or more years but have not conformed previously with these protocol 
guidelines, should satisfy the following provisions for each analyte for 
which determinations are to be made prior to being selected to analyze 
biological samples under the medical monitoring program:
    1. Submit to the responsible physician an internal QA/QC plan 
detailing the standard operating procedures to be adopted for satisfying 
the QA/QC guidelines (guidelines for internal QA/QC programs are 
detailed in Section 3.3.1);
    2. Submit to the responsible physician the results of the initial 
characterization analyses for each analyte for which determinations are 
to be made;
    3. Submit to the responsible physician the results, for the initial 
6-month period, of the internal QA/QC program for each analyte for

[[Page 183]]

which determinations are to be made (if no commercial analyses have been 
conducted previously, a minimum of 2 mock standardization trials for 
each analyte should be completed per month for a 6-month period);
    4. Enroll in the CTQ program for the appropriate analyte for which 
determinations are to be made, and arrange to have the CTQ program 
submit the initial confirmation of participation and proficiency test 
results directly to the designated physicians. Note that the designated 
physician should receive results from 3 completed rounds from the CTQ 
program before approving a laboratory for participation in the 
biological monitoring program;
    5. Laboratories seeking participation for CDU and/or B2MU analyses 
should submit to the responsible physician documentation of 
accreditation by the CAP for CRTU analyses performed in conjunction with 
CDU and/or B2MU determinations (if CRTU analyses are conducted by a 
contract laboratory, this laboratory should submit proof of CAP 
accreditation to the responsible physician); and,
    6. Documentation should be submitted on an appropriate form.
    To participate in CDB, CDU and/or B2MU analyses, the laboratory 
should satisfy the above criteria for a minimum of 2 of the 3 
proficiency samples provided in each of the 3 rounds of the CTQ program 
over a 6-month period; this procedure should be completed for each 
appropriate analyte. Proficiency should be maintained for each analyte 
to continue participation. Note that laboratories seeking participation 
for CDU or B2MU also should address the performance requirements for 
CRTU, which involves providing evidence of accreditation by the CAP and 
participation in the CAP surveys (or an equivalent program).
    The performance requirement for CDB analysis is defined as an 
analytical result within <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g/l or 15% of the 
consensus mean (whichever is greater). For samples exhibiting a 
consensus mean less than 1 <greek-m>g/l, the performance requirement is 
defined as a concentration between the detection limit of the analysis 
and a maximum of 2 <greek-m>g/l. The purpose of redefining the 
acceptable interval for low CDB values is to encourage proper reporting 
of the actual values obtained during measurement; laboratories, 
therefore, will not be penalized (in terms of a narrow range of 
acceptability) for reporting measured concentrations less than 1 
<greek-m>g/l.
    The performance requirement for CDU analysis is defined as an 
analytical result within <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g/l urine or 15% of the 
consensus mean (whichever is greater). For samples exhibiting a 
consensus mean less than 1 <greek-m>g/l urine, the performance 
requirement is defined as a concentration that falls between the 
detection limit of the analysis and a maximum of 2 <greek-m>g/l urine. 
Performance requirements for the companion CRTU analysis (defined by the 
CAP) also should be met. Note that reporting CDU results, other than for 
CTQ proficiency testing should be accompanied with results of CRTU 
analyses, and these 2 sets of results should be combined to provide a 
measure of CDU in units of <greek-m>g/g CRTU.
    The performance requirement for B2MU is defined as an analytical 
result within <plus-minus>15% of the consensus mean. Note that reporting 
B2MU results, other than for CTQ proficiency testing should be 
accompanied with results of CRTU analysis, these 2 sets of results 
should be combined to provide a measure of B2MU in units of <greek-m>g/g 
CRTU.
    Once a new laboratory has been approved by the responsible physician 
for conducting analyte determinations, the status of this approval 
should be reviewed periodically by the responsible physician as per the 
criteria presented under Section 3.2.2.
    Laboratories which have failed previously to gain approval of the 
responsible physician for conducting determinations of 1 or more 
analytes due to lack of compliance with the criteria defined above for 
existing laboratories (Section 3.2.1), may obtain approval by satisfying 
the criteria for newly-formed laboratories defined under this section; 
for these laboratories, the second of the above criteria may be 
satisfied by submitting a new set of characterization analyses for each 
analyte for which determinations are to be made.
    Reevaluation of these laboratories is discretionary on the part of 
the responsible physician. Reevaluation, which normally takes about 6 
months, may be expedited if the laboratory can achieve 100% compliance 
with the proficiency test criteria using the 6 samples of each analyte 
submitted to the CTQ program during the first 2 rounds of proficiency 
testing.
    For laboratories seeking reevaluation for CDU or B2MU analysis, the 
guidelines for CRTU analyses also should be satisfied, including 
accreditation for CRTU analysis by the CAP, and participation in the CAP 
survey program (or accreditation/participation in an equivalent 
program).

         3.2.4  Future Modifications to the Protocol Guidelines

    As participating laboratories gain experience with analyses for CDB, 
CDU and B2MU, it is anticipated that the performance achievable by the 
majority of laboratories should improve until it approaches that 
reported by the research groups which developed each method. OSHA, 
therefore, may choose to recommend stricter performance guidelines in 
the future as the overall performance of participating laboratories 
improves.

[[Page 184]]

            3.3  Guidelines for Record Keeping and Reporting

    To comply with these guidelines, participating laboratories should 
satisfy the above-stated performance and proficiency recommendations, as 
well as the following internal QA/QC, record keeping, and reporting 
provisions.
    If a participating laboratory fails to meet the provisions of these 
guidelines, it is recommended that the responsible physician disapprove 
further analyses of biological samples by that laboratory until it 
demonstrates compliance with these guidelines. On disapproval, 
biological samples should be sent to a laboratory that can demonstrate 
compliance with these guidelines, at least until the former laboratory 
is reevaluated by the responsible physician and found to be in 
compliance.
    The following record keeping and reporting procedures should be 
practiced by participating laboratories.

      3.3.1  Internal Quality Assurance/Quality Control Procedures

    Laboratories participating in the cadmium monitoring program should 
develop and maintain an internal quality assurance/quality control (QA/
QC) program that incorporates procedures for establishing and 
maintaining control for each of the analytic procedures (determinations 
of CDB, CDU and/or B2MU) for which the laboratory is seeking 
participation. For laboratories analyzing CDU and/or B2MU, a QA/QC 
program for CRTU also should be established.
    Written documentation of QA/QC procedures should be described in a 
formal QA/QC plan; this plan should contain the following information: 
Sample acceptance and handling procedures (i.e., chain-of-custody); 
sample preparation procedures; instrument parameters; calibration 
procedures; and, calculations. Documentation of QA/QC procedures should 
be sufficient to identify analytical problems, define criteria under 
which analysis of compliance samples will be suspended, and describe 
procedures for corrective actions.

   3.3.1.1  QA/QC procedures for establishing control of CDB and CDU 
                                analyses

    The QA/QC program for CDB and CDU should address, at a minimum, 
procedures involved in calibration, establishment of control limits, 
internal QC analyses and maintaining control, and corrective-action 
protocols. Participating laboratory should develop and maintain 
procedures to assure that analyses of compliance samples are within 
control limits, and that these procedures are documented thoroughly in a 
QA/QC plan.
    A nonmandatory QA/QC protocol is presented in Attachment 1. This 
attachment is illustrative of the procedures that should be addressed in 
a proper QA/QC program.
    Calibration. Before any analytic runs are conducted, the analytic 
instrument should be calibrated. Calibration should be performed at the 
beginning of each day on which QC and/or compliance samples are run. 
Once calibration is established, QC or compliance samples may be run. 
Regardless of the type of samples run, about every fifth sample should 
serve as a standard to assure that calibration is being maintained.
    Calibration is being maintained if the standard is within 
<plus-minus>15% of its theoretical value. If a standard is more than 
<plus-minus>15% of its theoretical value, the run has exceeded control 
limits due to calibration error; the entire set of samples then should 
be reanalyzed after recalibrating or the results should be recalculated 
based on a statistical curve derived from that set of standards.
    It is essential that the value of the highest standard analyzed be 
higher than the highest sample analyzed; it may be necessary, therefore, 
to run a high standard at the end of the run, which has been selected 
based on results obtained over the course of the run (i.e., higher than 
any standard analyzed to that point).
    Standards should be kept fresh; as samples age, they should be 
compared with new standards and replaced if necessary.
    Internal Quality Control Analyses. Internal QC samples should be 
determined interspersed with analyses of compliance samples. At a 
minimum, these samples should be run at a rate of 5% of the compliance 
samples or at least one set of QC samples per analysis of compliance 
samples, whichever is greater. If only 2 samples are run, they should 
contain different levels of cadmium.
    Internal QC samples may be obtained as commercially-available 
reference materials and/or they may be internally prepared. Internally-
prepared samples should be well characterized and traced, or compared to 
a reference material for which a consensus value is available.
    Levels of cadmium contained in QC samples should not be known to the 
analyst prior to reporting the results of the analysis.
    Internal QC results should be plotted or charted in a manner which 
describes sample recovery and laboratory control limits.
    Internal Control Limits. The laboratory protocol for evaluating 
internal QC analyses per control limits should be clearly defined. 
Limits may be based on statistical methods (e.g., as 2<greek-ss from the 
laboratory mean recovery), or on proficiency testing limits 
(e.g.,<plus-minus>1<greek-m>g or 15% of the mean, whichever is greater). 
Statistical limits that exceed <plus-minus>40% should be reevaluated to 
determine the source error in the analysis.
    When laboratory limits are exceeded, analytic work should terminate 
until the source

[[Page 185]]

of error is determined and corrected; compliance samples affected by the 
error should be reanalyzed. In addition, the laboratory protocol should 
address any unusual trends that develop which may be biasing the 
results. Numerous, consecutive results above or below laboratory mean 
recoveries, or outside laboratory statistical limits, indicate that 
problems may have developed.
    Corrective Actions. The QA/QC plan should document in detail 
specific actions taken if control limits are exceeded or unusual trends 
develop. Corrective actions should be noted on an appropriate form, 
accompanied by supporting documentation.
    In addition to these actions, laboratories should include whatever 
additional actions are necessary to assure that accurate data are 
reported to the responsible physicians.
    Reference Materials. The following reference materials may be 
available:

       3.3.1.2  QA/QC procedures for establishing control of B2MU

    A written, detailed QA/QC plan for B2MU analysis should be 
developed. The QA/QC plan should contain a protocol similar to those 
protocols developed for the CDB/CDU analyses. Differences in analyses 
may warrant some differences in the QA/QC protocol, but procedures to 
ensure analytical integrity should be developed and followed.
    Examples of performance summaries that can be provided include 
measurements of accuracy (i.e., the means of measured values versus 
target values for the control samples) and precision (i.e., based on 
duplicate analyses). It is recommended that the accuracy and precision 
measurements be compared to those reported as achievable by the 
Pharmacia Delphia kit (Pharmacia 1990) to determine if and when 
unsatisfactory analyses have arisen. If the measurement error of 1 or 
more of the control samples is more than 15%, the run exceeds control 
limits. Similarly, this decision is warranted when the average CV for 
duplicate samples is greater than 5%.

                  3.3.2  Procedures for Record Keeping

    To satisfy reporting requirements for commercial analyses of CDB, 
CDU and/or B2MU performed for the medical monitoring program mandated 
under the cadmium rule, participating laboratories should maintain the 
following documentation for each analyte:
    1. For each analytic instrument on which analyte determinations are 
made, records relating to the most recent calibration and QC sample 
analyses;
    2. For these instruments, a tabulated record for each analyte of 
those determinations found to be within and outside of control limits 
over the past 2 years;
    3. Results for the previous 2 years of the QC sample analyses 
conducted under the internal QA/QC program (this information should be: 
Provided for each analyte for which determinations are made and for each 
analytic instrument used for this purpose, sufficient to demonstrate 
that internal QA/QC programs are being executed properly, and consistent 
with data sent to responsible physicians.
    4. Duplicate copies of monitoring results for each analyte sent to 
clients during the previous 5 years, as well as associated information; 
supporting material such as chain-of-custody forms also should be 
retained; and,
    5. Proficiency test results and related materials received while 
participating in the CTQ interlaboratory program over the past 2 years; 
results also should be tabulated to provide a serial record of relative 
error (derived per Section 3.3.3 below).

                       3.3.3  Reporting Procedures

    Participating laboratories should maintain these documents: QA/QC 
program plans; QA/QC status reports; CTQ proficiency program reports; 
and, analytical data reports. The information that should be included in 
these reports is summarized in Table 2; a copy of each report should be 
sent to the responsible physician.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted in Section 3.3.1, a QA/QC program plan should be developed 
that documents internal QA/QC procedures (defined under Section 3.3.1) 
to be implemented by the participating laboratory for each analyte; this 
plan should provide a list identifying each instrument used in making 
analyte determinations.
    A QA/QC status report should be written bimonthly for each analyte. 
In this report, the results of the QC program during the reporting 
period should be reported for each analyte in the following manner: The 
number (N) of QC samples analyzed during the period; a table of the 
target levels defined for each sample and the corresponding measured 
values; the mean of F/T value (as defined below) for the set of QC 
samples run during the period; and, use of X <plus-minus>2<greek-ss (as 
defined below) for the set of QC samples run during the period as a 
measure of precision.
    As noted in Section 2, an F/T value for a QC sample is the ratio of 
the measured concentration of analyte to the established (i.e., 
reference) concentration of analyte for that QC sample. The equation 
below describes the derivation of the mean for F/T values, X, (with N 
being the total number of samples analyzed):
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28OC91.012

The standard deviation, <greek-ss, for these measurements is derived 
using the following equation (note that 2<greek-ss is twice this value):
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28OC91.013

    The nonmandatory QA/QC protocol (see Attachment 1) indicates that QC 
samples should be divided into several discrete pools, and a separate 
estimate of precision for each pools then should be derived. Several 
precision estimates should be provided for concentrations which differ 
in average value. These precision measures may be used to document 
improvements in performance with regard to the combined pool.
    Participating laboratories should use the CTQ proficiency program 
for each analyte. Results of the this program will be sent by CTQ 
directly to physicians designated by the participating laboratories. 
Proficiency results from the CTQ program are used to establish the 
accuracy of results from each participating laboratory, and should be 
provided to responsible physicians for use in trend analysis. A 
proficiency report consisting of these proficiency results should 
accompany data reports as an attachment.
    For each analyte, the proficiency report should include the results 
from the 6 previous proficiency rounds in the following format:
    1. Number (N) of samples analyzed;
    2. Mean of the target levels, (1/N)<greek-S><INF>i</INF>, with 
T<INF>i</INF> being a consensus mean for the sample;
    3. Mean of the measurements, (1/N)<greek-S><INF>i</INF>, with 
M<INF>i</INF> being a sample measurement;
    4. A measure of error defined by:

      (1/N)<greek-S>(T<INF>i</INF>- M<INF>i</INF>)\2\
    Analytical data reports should be submitted to responsible 
physicians directly. For each sample, report the following information: 
The date the sample was received; the date the sample was analyzed; 
appropriate chain-of-custody information; the type(s) of analyses 
performed; and, the results of the analyses. This information should be 
reported on a form similar to the form provided an appropriate form. The 
most recent proficiency program report should accompany the analytical 
data reports (as an attachment).
    Confidence intervals for the analytical results should be reported 
as X<plus-minus>2<greek-ss, with X being the measured value and 
2<greek-ss the standard deviation calculated as described above.

    For CDU or B2MU results, which are combined with CRTU measurements 
for proper reporting, the 95% confidence limits are derived from the 
limits for CDU or B2MU, (p), and the limits for CRTU, (q), as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28OC91.014

For these calculations, X<plus-minus> p is the measurement and 
confidence limits for CDU or B2MU, and Y<plus-minus> q is the 
measurement and confidence limit for CRTU.
    Participating laboratories should notify responsible physicians as 
soon as they receive information indicating a change in their 
accreditation status with the CTQ or the CAP. These physicians should 
not be expected to wait until formal notice of a status change has been 
received from the CTQ or the CAP.

                     3.4  Instructions to Physicians

    Physicians responsible for the medical monitoring of cadmium-exposed 
workers must collect the biological samples from workers; they then 
should select laboratories to perform the required analyses, and should 
interpret the analytic results.

             3.4.1  Sample Collection and Holding Procedures

    Blood Samples. The following procedures are recommended for the 
collection, shipment and storage of blood samples for CDB analysis to 
reduce analytical variablility; these recommendations were obtained 
primarily through personal communications with J.P. Weber of the CTQ 
(1991), and from reports by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 1986) 
and Stoeppler and Brandt (1980).
    To the extent possible, blood samples should be collected from 
workers at the same time of day. Workers should shower or thoroughly 
wash their hands and arms before blood samples are drawn. The following 
materials are needed for blood sample collection: Alcohol wipes; sterile 
gauze sponges; band-aids; 20-gauge, 1.5-in. stainless steel needles 
(sterile); preprinted labels; tourniquets; vacutainer holders; 3-ml 
``metal free'' vacutainer tubes (i.e., dark-blue caps), with EDTA as an 
anti-coagulant; and, styrofoam vacutainer shipping containers.
    Whole blood samples are taken by venipuncture. Each blue-capped tube 
should be labeled or coded for the worker and company before the sample 
is drawn. (Blue-capped tubes are recommended instead of red-capped tubes 
because the latter may consist of red coloring pigment containing 
cadmium, which could contaminate the samples.) Immediately after 
sampling, the vacutainer tubes must be thoroughly mixed by inverting the 
tubes at least 10 times manually or mechanically using a Vortex device 
(for 15 sec). Samples should be refrigerated immediately or stored on 
ice until they can be packed for shipment to the participating 
laboratory for analysis.
    The CDC recommends that blood samples be shipped with a ``cool pak'' 
to keep the samples cold during shipment. However, the CTQ routinely 
ships and receives blood samples for cadmium analysis that have not been 
kept cool during shipment. The CTQ has found no deterioration of cadmium 
in biological fluids that were shipped via parcel post without a cooling 
agent, even though these deliveries often take 2 weeks to reach their 
destination.
    Urine Samples. The following are recommended procedures for the 
collection, shipment and storage of urine for CDU and B2MU analyses, and 
were obtained primarily through personal communications with J.P. Weber 
of the CTQ (1991), and from reports by the CDC (1986) and Stoeppler and 
Brandt (1980).
    Single ``spot'' samples are recommended. As B2M can degrade in the 
bladder, workers should first empty their bladder and then drink a large 
glass of water at the start of the visit. Urine samples then should be 
collected within 1 hour. Separate samples should be collected for CDU 
and B2MU using the following materials: Sterile urine collection cups 
(250 ml); small sealable plastic bags; preprinted labels; 15-ml 
polypropylene or polyethylene screw-cap tubes; lab gloves (``metal 
free''); and, preservatives (as indicated).
    The sealed collection cup should be kept in the plastic bag until 
collection time. The workers should wash their hands with soap and water 
before receiving the collection cup. The collection cup should not be 
opened until just before voiding and the cup should be sealed 
immediately after filling. It is important that the inside of the 
container and cap are not touched by, or come into contact with, the 
body, clothing or other surfaces.
    For CDU analyzes, the cup is swirled gently to resuspend any solids, 
and the 15-ml tube is filled with 10-12 ml urine. The CDC recommends the 
addition of 100 <greek-m> l concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> as a 
preservative before sealing the tube and then freezing the sample. The 
CTQ recommends minimal handling and does not acidify their 
interlaboratory urine reference materials prior to shipment, nor do they 
freeze the sample for shipment. At the CTQ, if the urine sample has much 
sediment, the sample is acidified in the lab to free any cadmium in the 
precipitate.
    For B2M, the urine sample should be collected directly into a 
polyethylene bottle previously washed with dilute nitric acid. The pH of 
the urine should be measured and adjusted to 8.0 with 0.1 N NaOH 
immediately

[[Page 188]]

following collection. Samples should be frozen and stored at -20  deg.C 
until testing is performed. The B2M in the samples should be stable for 
2 days when stored at 2-8  deg.C, and for at least 2 months at -20 
deg.C. Repeated freezing and thawing should be avoided to prevent 
denaturing the B2M (Pharmacia 1990).

           3.4.2  Recommendations for Evaluating Laboratories

    Using standard error data and the results of proficiency testing 
obtained from CTQ, responsible physicians can make an informed choice of 
which laboratory to select to analyze biological samples. In general, 
laboratories with small standard errors and little disparity between 
target and measured values tend to make precise and accurate sample 
determinations. Estimates of precision provided to the physicians with 
each set of monitoring results can be compared to previously-reported 
proficiency and precision estimates. The latest precision estimates 
should be at least as small as the standard error reported previously by 
the laboratory. Moreover, there should be no indication that precision 
is deteriorating (i.e., increasing values for the precision estimates). 
If precision is deteriorating, physicians may decide to use another 
laboratory for these analyses. QA/QC information provided by the 
participating laboratories to physicians can, therefore, assist 
physicians in evaluating laboratory performance.

                3.4.3  Use and Interpretation of Results

    When the responsible physician has received the CDB, CDU and/or B2MU 
results, these results must be compared to the action levels discussed 
in the final rule for cadmium. The comparison of the sample results to 
action levels is straightforward. The measured value reported from the 
laboratory can be compared directly to the action levels; if the 
reported value exceeds an action level, the required actions must be 
initiated.

                             4.0  Background

    Cadmium is a naturally-occurring environmental contaminant to which 
humans are continually exposed in food, water, and air. The average 
daily intake of cadmium by the U.S. population is estimated to be 10-20 
<greek-m>g/day. Most of this intake is via ingestion, for which 
absorption is estimated at 4-7% (Kowal et al. 1979). An additional 
nonoccupational source of cadmium is smoking tobacco; smoking a pack of 
cigarettes a day adds an additional 2-4 <greek-m>g cadmium to the daily 
intake, assuming absorption via inhalation of 25-35% (Nordberg and 
Nordberg 1988; Friberg and Elinder 1988; Travis and Haddock 1980).
    Exposure to cadmium fumes and dusts in an occupational setting where 
air concentrations are 20-50 <greek-m>g/m\3\ results in an additional 
daily intake of several hundred micrograms (Friberg and Elinder 1988, p. 
563). In such a setting, occupational exposure to cadmium occurs 
primarily via inhalation, although additional exposure may occur through 
the ingestion of material via contaminated hands if workers eat or smoke 
without first washing. Some of the particles that are inhaled initially 
may be ingested when the material is deposited in the upper respiratory 
tract, where it may be cleared by mucociliary transport and subsequently 
swallowed.
    Cadmium introduced into the body through inhalation or ingestion is 
transported by the albumin fraction of the blood plasma to the liver, 
where it accumulates and is stored principally as a bound form complexed 
with the protein metallothionein. Metallothionein-bound cadmium is the 
main form of cadmium subsequently transported to the kidney; it is these 
2 organs, the liver and kidney, in which the majority of the cadmium 
body burden accumulates. As much as one half of the total body burden of 
cadmium may be found in the kidneys (Nordberg and Nordberg 1988).
    Once cadmium has entered the body, elimination is slow; about 0.02% 
of the body burden is excreted per day via urinary/fecal elimination. 
The whole-body half-life of cadmium is 10-35 years, decreasing slightly 
with increasing age (Travis and Haddock 1980).
    The continual accumulation of cadmium is the basis for its chronic 
noncarcinogenic toxicity. This accumulation makes the kidney the target 
organ in which cadmium toxicity usually is first observed (Piscator 
1964). Renal damage may occur when cadmium levels in the kidney cortex 
approach 200 <greek-m>g/g wet tissue-weight (Travis and Haddock 1980).
    The kinetics and internal distribution of cadmium in the body are 
complex, and depend on whether occupational exposure to cadmium is 
ongoing or has terminated. In general, cadmium in blood is related 
principally to recent cadmium exposure, while cadmium in urine reflects 
cumulative exposure (i.e., total body burden) (Lauwerys et al. 1976; 
Friberg and Elinder 1988).

                           4.1  Health Effects

    Studies of workers in a variety of industries indicate that chronic 
exposure to cadmium may be linked to several adverse health effects 
including kidney dysfunction, reduced pulmonary function, chronic lung 
disease and cancer (Federal Register 1990). The primary sites for 
cadmium-associated cancer appear to be the lung and the prostate.
    Cancer. Evidence for an association between cancer and cadmium 
exposure comes from both epidemiological studies and animal experiments. 
Pott (1965) found a statistically significant elevation in the incidence

[[Page 189]]

of prostate cancer among a cohort of cadmium workers. Other epidemiology 
studies also report an elevated incidence of prostate cancer; however, 
the increases observed in these other studies were not statistically 
significant (Meridian Research, Inc. 1989).
    One study (Thun et al. 1985) contains sufficiently quantitative 
estimates of cadmium exposure to allow evaluation of dose-response 
relationships between cadmium exposure and lung cancer. A statistically 
significant excess of lung cancer attributed to cadmium exposure was 
found in this study, even after accounting for confounding variables 
such as coexposure to arsenic and smoking habits (Meridian Research, 
Inc. 1989).
    Evidence for quantifying a link between lung cancer and cadmium 
exposure comes from a single study (Takenaka et al. 1983). In this 
study, dose-response relationships developed from animal data were 
extrapolated to humans using a variety of models. OSHA chose the 
multistage risk model for estimating the risk of cancer for humans using 
these animal data. Animal injection studies also suggest an association 
between cadmium exposure and cancer, particularly observations of an 
increased incidence of tumors at sites remote from the point of 
injection. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 
(Supplement 7, 1987) indicates that this, and related, evidence is 
sufficient to classify cadmium as an animal carcinogen. However, the 
results of these injection studies cannot be used to quantify risks 
attendant to human occupational exposures due to differences in routes 
of exposure (Meridian Research, Inc. 1989).
    Based on the above-cited studies, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) classifies cadmium as ``B1,'' a probable human carcinogen 
(USEPA 1985). IARC in 1987 recommended that cadmium be listed as a 
probable human carcinogen.
    Kidney Dysfunction. The most prevalent nonmalignant effect observed 
among workers chronically exposed to cadmium is kidney dysfunction. 
Initially, such dysfunction is manifested by proteinuria (Meridian 
Research, Inc. 1989; Roth Associates, Inc. 1989). Proteinuria associated 
with cadmium exposure is most commonly characterized by excretion of 
low-molecular weight proteins (15,000-40,000 MW), accompanied by loss of 
electrolytes, uric acid, calcium, amino acids, and phosphate. Proteins 
commonly excreted include <greek-b>-2-microglobulin (B2M), retinol-
binding protein (RBP), immunoglobulin light chains, and lysozyme. 
Excretion of low molecular weight proteins is characteristic of damage 
to the proximal tubules of the kidney (Iwao et al. 1980).
    Exposure to cadmium also may lead to urinary excretion of high-
molecular weight proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulin G, and 
glycoproteins (Meridian Research, Inc. 1989; Roth Associates, Inc. 
1989). Excretion of high-molecular weight proteins is indicative of 
damage to the glomeruli of the kidney. Bernard et al. (1979) suggest 
that cadmium-associated damage to the glomeruli and damage to the 
proximal tubules of the kidney develop independently of each other, but 
may occur in the same individual.
    Several studies indicate that the onset of low-molecular weight 
proteinuria is a sign of irreversible kidney damage (Friberg et al. 
1974; Roels et al. 1982; Piscator 1984; Elinder et al. 1985; Smith et 
al. 1986). For many workers, once sufficiently elevated levels of B2M 
are observed in association with cadmium exposure, such levels do not 
appear to return to normal even when cadmium exposure is eliminated by 
removal of the worker from the cadmium-contaminated work environment 
(Friberg, exhibit 29, 1990).
    Some studies indicate that cadmium-induced proteinuria may be 
progressive; levels of B2MU increase even after cadmium exposure has 
ceased (Elinder et al. 1985). Other researchers have reached similar 
conclusions (Frieburg testimony, OSHA docket exhibit 29, Elinder 
testimony, OSHA docket exhibit 55, and OSHA docket exhibits 8-86B). Such 
observations are not universal, however (Smith et al. 1986; Tsuchiya 
1976). Studies in which proteinuria has not been observed, however, may 
have initiated the reassessment too early (Meridian Research, Inc.1989; 
Roth Associates, Inc. 1989; Roels 1989).
    A quantitative assessment of the risks of developing kidney 
dysfunction as a result of cadmium exposure was performed using the data 
from Ellis et al. (1984) and Falck et al. (1983). Meridian Research, 
Inc. (1989) and Roth Associates, Inc. (1989) employed several 
mathematical models to evaluate the data from the 2 studies, and the 
results indicate that cumulative cadmium exposure levels between 5 and 
100 <greek-m>g-years/m\3\ correspond with a one-in-a-thousand 
probability of developing kidney dysfunction.
    When cadmium exposure continues past the onset of early kidney 
damage (manifested as proteinuria), chronic nephrotoxicity may occur 
(Meridian Research, Inc. 1989; Roth Associates, Inc. 1989). Uremia, 
which is the loss of the glomerulus' ability to adequately filter blood, 
may result. This condition leads to severe disturbance of electrolyte 
concentrations, which may result in various clinical complications 
including atherosclerosis, hypertension, pericarditis, anemia, 
hemorrhagic tendencies, deficient cellular immunity, bone changes, and 
other problems. Progression of the disease may require dialysis or a 
kidney transplant.
    Studies in which animals are chronically exposed to cadmium confirm 
the renal effects observed in humans (Friberg et al. 1986). Animal 
studies also confirm cadmium-related problems with calcium metabolism 
and associated skeletal effects, which also

[[Page 190]]

have been observed among humans. Other effects commonly reported in 
chronic animal studies include anemia, changes in liver morphology, 
immunosuppression and hypertension. Some of these effects may be 
associated with cofactors; hypertension, for example, appears to be 
associated with diet, as well as with cadmium exposure. Animals injected 
with cadmium also have shown testicular necrosis.

                 4.2  Objectives for Medical Monitoring

    In keeping with the observation that renal disease tends to be the 
earliest clinical manifestation of cadmium toxicity, the final cadmium 
standard mandates that eligible workers must be medically monitored to 
prevent this condition (as well as cadmimum-induced cancer). The 
objectives of medical-monitoring, therefore, are to: Identify workers at 
significant risk of adverse health effects from excess, chronic exposure 
to cadmium; prevent future cases of cadmium-induced disease; detect and 
minimize existing cadmium-induced disease; and, identify workers most in 
need of medical intervention.
    The overall goal of the medical monitoring program is to protect 
workers who may be exposed continuously to cadmium over a 45-year 
occupational lifespan. Consistent with this goal, the medical monitoring 
program should assure that:
    1. Current exposure levels remain sufficiently low to prevent the 
accumulation of cadmium body burdens sufficient to cause disease in the 
future by monitoring CDB as an indicator of recent cadmium exposure;
    2. Cumulative body burdens, especially among workers with undefined 
historical exposures, remain below levels potentially capable of leading 
to damage and disease by assessing CDU as an indicator of cumulative 
exposure to cadmium; and,
    3. Health effects are not occurring among exposed workers by 
determining B2MU as an early indicator of the onset of cadmium-induced 
kidney disease.

             4.3  Indicators of Cadmium Exposure and Disease

    Cadmium is present in whole blood bound to albumin, in erythrocytes, 
and as a metallothionein-cadmium complex. The metallothionein-cadmium 
complex that represents the primary transport mechanism for cadmium 
delivery to the kidney. CDB concentrations in the general, nonexposed 
population average 1 <greek-m>g Cd/l whole blood, with smokers 
exhibiting higher levels (see Section 5.1.6). Data presented in Section 
5.1.6 shows that 95% of the general population not occupationally 
exposed to cadmium have CDB levels less than 5 <greek-m>g Cd/l.
    If total body burdens of cadmium remain low, CDB concentrations 
indicate recent exposure (i.e., daily intake). This conclusion is based 
on data showing that cigarette smokers exhibit CDB concentrations of 2-7 
<greek-m>g/l depending on the number of cigarettes smoked per day 
(Nordberg and Nordberg 1988), while CDB levels for those who quit 
smoking return to general population values (approximately 1 <greek-m>g/
l) within several weeks (Lauwerys et al. 1976). Based on these 
observations, Lauwerys et al. (1976) concluded that CDB has a biological 
half-life of a few weeks to less than 3 months. As indicated in Section 
3.1.6, the upper 95th percentile for CDB levels observed among those who 
are not occupationally exposed to cadmium is 5 <greek-m>g/l, which 
suggests that the absolute upper limit to the range reported for smokers 
by Nordberg and Nordberg may have been affected by an extreme value 
(i.e., beyond 2<greek-s> above the mean).
    Among occupationally-exposed workers, the occupational history of 
exposure to cadmium must be evaluated to interpret CDB levels. New 
workers, or workers with low exposures to cadmium, exhibit CDB levels 
that are representative of recent exposures, similar to the general 
population. However, for workers with a history of chronic exposure to 
cadmium, who have accumulated significant stores of cadmium in the 
kidneys/liver, part of the CDB concentrations appear to indicate body 
burden. If such workers are removed from cadmium exposure, their CDB 
levels remain elevated, possibly for years, reflecting prior long-term 
accumulation of cadmium in body tissues. This condition tends to occur, 
however, only beyond some threshold exposure value, and possibly 
indicates the capacity of body tissues to accumulate cadmium which 
cannot be excreted readily (Friberg and Elinder 1988; Nordberg and 
Nordberg 1988).
    CDU is widely used as an indicator of cadmium body burdens (Nordberg 
and Nordberg 1988). CDU is the major route of elimination and, when CDU 
is measured, it is commonly expressed either as <greek-m>g Cd/l urine 
(unadjusted), <greek-m>g Cd/l urine (adjusted for specific gravity), or 
<greek-m>g Cd/g CRTU (see Section 5.2.1). The metabolic model for CDU is 
less complicated than CDB, since CDU is dependentin large part on the 
body (i.e., kidney) burden of cadmium. However, a small proportion of 
CDU still be attributed to recent cadmium exposure, particularly if 
exposure to high airborne concentrations of cadmium occurred. Note that 
CDU is subject to larger interindividual and day-to-day variations than 
CDB, so repeated measurements are recommended for CDU evaluations.
    CDU is bound principally to metallothionein, regardless of whether 
the cadmium originates from metallothionein in plasma or from the 
cadmium pool accumulated in the renal tubules. Therefore, measurement of 
metallothionein in urine may provide information similar to CDU, while 
avoiding the contamination problems that

[[Page 191]]

may occur during collection and handling urine for cadmium analysis 
(Nordberg and Nordberg 1988). However, a commercial method for the 
determination of metallothionein at the sensitivity levels required 
under the final cadmium rule is not currently available; therefore, 
analysis of CDU is recommended.
    Among the general population not occupationally exposed to cadmium, 
CDU levels average less than 1 <greek-m>g/l (see Section 5.2.7). 
Normalized for creatinine (CRTU), the average CDU concentration of the 
general population is less than 1 <greek-m>g/g CRTU. As cadmium 
accumulates over the lifespan, CDU increases with age. Also, cigarette 
smokers may eventually accumulate twice the cadmium body burden of 
nonsmokers, CDU is slightly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, even 
several years after smoking cessation (Nordberg and Nordberg 1988). 
Despite variations due to age and smoking habits, 95% of those not 
occupationally exposed to cadmium exhibit levels of CDU less than 3 
<greek-m>g/g CRTU (based on the data presented in Section 5.2.7).
    About 0.02% of the cadmium body burden is excreted daily in urine. 
When the critical cadmium concentration (about 200 ppm) in the kidney is 
reached, or if there is sufficient cadmium-induced kidney dysfunction, 
dramatic increases in CDU are observed (Nordberg and Nordberg 1988). 
Above 200 ppm, therefore, CDU concentrations cease to be an indicator of 
cadmium body burden, and are instead an index of kidney failure.
    Proteinuria is an index of kidney dysfunction, and is defined by 
OSHA to be a material impairment. Several small proteins may be 
monitored as markers for proteinuria. Below levels indicative of 
proteinuria, these small proteins may be early indicators of increased 
risk of cadmium-induced renal tubular disease. Analytes useful for 
monitoring cadmium-induced renal tubular damage include:
    1. <greek-b>-2-Microglobulin (B2M), currently the most widely used 
assay for detecting kidney dysfunction, is the best characterized 
analyte available (Iwao et al. 1980; Chia et al. 1989);
    2. Retinol Binding Protein (RBP) is more stable than B2M in acidic 
urine (i.e., B2M breakdown occurs if urinary pH is less than 5.5; such 
breakdown may result in false [i.e., low] B2M values [Bernard and 
Lauwerys, 1990]);
    3. N-Acetyl-B-Glucosaminidase (NAG) is the analyte of an assay that 
is simple, inexpensive, reliable, and correlates with cadmium levels 
under 10 <greek-m>g/g CRTU, but the assay is less sensitive than RBP or 
B2M (Kawada et al. 1989);
    4. Metallothionein (MT) correlates with cadmium and B2M levels, and 
may be a better predictor of cadmium exposure than CDU and B2M (Kawada 
et al. 1989);
    5. Tamm-Horsfall Glycoprotein (THG) increases slightly with elevated 
cadmium levels, but this elevation is small compared to increases in 
urinary albumin, RBP, or B2M (Bernard and Lauwerys 1990);
    6. Albumin (ALB), determined by the biuret method, is not 
sufficiently sensitive to serve as an early indicator of the onset of 
renal disease (Piscator 1962);
    7. Albumin (ALB), determined by the Amido Black method, is sensitive 
and reproducible, but involves a time-consuming procedure (Piscator 
1962);
    8. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) increases among cadmium workers, but the 
significance of this effect is unknown because no relationship has been 
found between elevated GAG and other indices of tubular damage (Bernard 
and Lauwerys 1990);
    9. Trehalase seems to increase earlier than B2M during cadmium 
exposure, but the procedure for analysis is complicated and unreliable 
(Iwata et al. 1988); and,
    10. Kallikrein is observed at lower concentrations among cadmium-
exposed workers than among normal controls (Roels et al. 1990).
    Of the above analytes, B2M appears to be the most widely used and 
best characterized analyte to evaluate the presence/absence, as well as 
the extent of, cadmium-induced renal tubular damage (Kawada, Koyama, and 
Suzuki 1989; Shaikh and Smith 1984; Nogawa 1984). However, it is 
important that samples be collected and handled so as to minimize B2M 
degradation under acidic urine conditions.
    The threshold value of B2MU commonly used to indicate the presence 
of kidney damage 300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU (Kjellstrom et al. 1977a; Buchet 
et al. 1980; and Kowal and Zirkes 1983). This value represents the upper 
95th or 97.5th percentile level of urinary excretion observed among 
those without tubular dysfunction (Elinder, exbt L-140-45, OSHA docket 
H057A). In agreement with these conclusions, the data presented in 
Section 5.3.7 of this protocol generally indicate that the level of 300 
<greek-m>g/g CRTU appears to define the boundary for kidney dysfunction. 
It is not clear, however, that this level represents the upper 95th 
percentile of values observed among those who fail to demonstrate 
proteinuria effects.
    Although elevated B2MU levels appear to be a fairly specific 
indicator of disease associated with cadmium exposure, other conditions 
that may lead to elevated B2MU levels include high fevers from 
influenza, extensive physical exercise, renal disease unrelated to 
cadmium exposure, lymphomas, and AIDS (Iwao et al. 1980; Schardun and 
van Epps 1987). Elevated B2M levels observed in association with high 
fevers from influenza or from extensive physical exercise are transient, 
and will return to normal levels once

[[Page 192]]

the fever has abated or metabolic rates return to baseline values 
following exercise. The other conditions linked to elevated B2M levels 
can be diagnosed as part of a properly-designed medical examination. 
Consequently, monitoring B2M, when accompanied by regular medical 
examinations and CDB and CDU determinations (as indicators of present 
and past cadmium exposure), may serve as a specific, early indicator of 
cadmium-induced kidney damage.

         4.4  Criteria for Medical Monitoring of Cadmium Workers

    Medical monitoring mandated by the final cadmium rule includes a 
combination of regular medical examinations and periodic monitoring of 3 
analytes: CDB, CDU and B2MU. As indicated above, CDB is monitored as an 
indicator of current cadmium exposure, while CDU serves as an indicator 
of the cadmium body burden; B2MU is assessed as an early marker of 
irreversible kidney damage and disease.
    The final cadmium rule defines a series of action levels that have 
been developed for each of the 3 analytes to be monitored. These action 
levels serve to guide the responsible physician through a decision-
making process. For each action level that is exceeded, a specific 
response is mandated. The sequence of action levels, and the attendant 
actions, are described in detail in the final cadmium rule.
    Other criteria used in the medical decision-making process relate to 
tests performed during the medical examination (including a 
determination of the ability of a worker to wear a respirator). These 
criteria, however, are not affected by the results of the analyte 
determinations addressed in the above paragraphs and, consequently, will 
not be considered further in these guidelines.

 4.5  Defining to Quality and Proficiency of the Analyte Determinations

    As noted above in Sections 2 and 3, the quality of a measurement 
should be defined along with its value to properly interpret the 
results. Generally, it is necessary to know the accuracy and the 
precision of a measurement before it can be properly evaluated. The 
precision of the data from a specific laboratory indicates the extent to 
which the repeated measurements of the same sample vary within that 
laboratory. The accuracy of the data provides an indication of the 
extent to which these results deviate from average results determined 
from many laboratories performing the same measurement (i.e., in the 
absence of an independent determination of the true value of a 
measurement). Note that terms are defined operationally relative to the 
manner in which they will be used in this protocol. Formal definitions 
for the terms in italics used in this section can be found in the list 
of definitions (Section 2).
    Another data quality criterion required to properly evaluate 
measurement results is the limit of detection of that measurement. For 
measurements to be useful, the range of the measurement which is of 
interest for biological monitoring purposes must lie entirely above the 
limit of detection defined for that measurement.
    The overall quality of a laboratory's results is termed the 
performance of that laboratory. The degree to which a laboratory 
satisfies a minimum performance level is referred to as the proficiency 
of the laboratory. A successful medical monitoring program, therefore, 
should include procedures developed for monitoring and recording 
laboratory performance; these procedures can be used to identify the 
most proficient laboratories.

  5.0  Overview of Medical Monitoring Tests for CDB, CDU, B2MU and CRTU

    To evaluate whether available methods for assessing CDB, CDU, B2MU 
and CRTU are adequate for determining the parameters defined by the 
proposed action levels, it is necessary to review procedures available 
for sample collection, preparation and analysis. A variety of techniques 
for these purposes have been used historically for the determination of 
cadmium in biological matrices (including CDB and CDU), and for the 
determination of specific proteins in biological matrices (including 
B2MU). However, only the most recent techniques are capable of 
satisfying the required accuracy, precision and sensitivity (i.e., limit 
of detection) for monitoring at the levels mandated in the final cadmium 
rule, while still facilitating automated analysis and rapid processing.

                  5.1  Measuring Cadmium in Blood (CDB)

    Analysis of biological samples for cadmium requires strict 
analytical discipline regarding collection and handling of samples. In 
addition to occupational settings, where cadmium contamination would be 
apparent, cadmium is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, and much 
care should be exercised to ensure that samples are not contaminated 
during collection, preparation or analysis. Many common chemical 
reagents are contaminated with cadmium at concentrations that will 
interfere with cadmium analysis; because of the widespread use of 
cadmium compounds as colored pigments in plastics and coatings, the 
analyst should continually monitor each manufacturer's chemical reagents 
and collection containers to prevent contamination of samples.
    Guarding against cadmium contamination of biological samples is 
particularly important when analyzing blood samples because cadmium 
concentrations in blood samples

[[Page 193]]

from nonexposed populations are generally less than 2 <greek-m>g/l (2 
ng/ml), while occupationally-exposed workers can be at medical risk to 
cadmium toxicity if blood concentrations exceed 5 <greek-m>g/l (ACGIH 
1991 and 1992). This narrow margin between exposed and unexposed samples 
requires that exceptional care be used in performing analytic 
determinations for biological monitoring for occupational cadmium 
exposure.
    Methods for quantifying cadmium in blood have improved over the last 
40 years primarily because of improvements in analytical 
instrumentation. Also, due to improvements in analytical techniques, 
there is less need to perform extensive multi-step sample preparations 
prior to analysis. Complex sample preparation was previously required to 
enhance method sensitivity (for cadmium), and to reduce interference by 
other metals or components of the sample.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A number of analytical techniques have been used for determining 
cadmium concentrations in biological materials. A summary of the 
characteristics of the most widely employed techniques is presented in 
Table 3. The technique most suitable for medical monitoring for cadmium 
is atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).
    To obtain a measurement using AAS, a light source (i.e., hollow 
cathode or lectrode-free discharge lamp) containing the element of 
interest as the cathode, is energized and the lamp emits a spectrum that 
is unique for that element. This light source is focused through a 
sample cell, and a selected wavelength is monitored by a monochrometer 
and photodetector cell. Any ground state atoms in the sample that match 
those of the lamp element and are in the path of the emitted light may 
absorb some of the light and decrease the amount of light that reaches 
the photodetector cell. The amount of light absorbed at each 
characteristic wavelength is proportional to the number of ground state 
atoms of the corresponding element that are in the pathway of the light 
between the source and detector.
    To determine the amount of a specific metallic element in a sample 
using AAS, the sample is dissolved in a solvent and aspirated into a 
high-temperature flame as an aerosol. At high temperatures, the solvent 
is rapidly evaporated or decomposed and the solute is initially 
solidified; the majority of the sample elements then are transformed 
into an atomic vapor. Next, a light beam is focused above the flame and 
the amount of metal in the sample can be determined by measuring the 
degree of absorbance of the atoms of the target element released by the 
flame at a characteristic wavelength.

[[Page 194]]

    A more refined atomic absorption technique, flameless AAS, 
substitutes an electrothermal, graphite furnace for the flame. An 
aliquot (10-100 <greek-m>l) of the sample is pipetted into the cold 
furnace, which is then heated rapidly to generate an atomic vapor of the 
element.
    AAS is a sensitive and specific method for the elemental analysis of 
metals; its main drawback is nonspecific background absorbtion and 
scattering of the light beam by particles of the sample as it decomposes 
at high temperatures; nonspecific absorbance reduces the sensitivity of 
the analytical method. The problem of nonspecific absorbance and 
scattering can be reduced by extensive sample pretreatment, such as 
ashing and/or acid digestion of the sample to reduce its organic 
content.
    Current AAS instruments employ background correction devices to 
adjust electronically for background absorbtion and scattering. A common 
method to correct for background effects is to use a deuterium arc lamp 
as a second light source. A continuum light source, such as the 
deuterium lamp, emits a broad spectrum of wavelengths instead of 
specific wavelengths characteristic of a particular element, as with the 
hollow cathode tube. With this system, light from the primary source and 
the continuum source are passed alternately through the sample cell. The 
target element effectively absorbs light only from the primary source 
(which is much brighter than the continuum source at the characteristic 
wavelengths), while the background matrix absorbs and scatters light 
from both sources equally. Therefore, when the ratio of the two beams is 
measured electronically, the effect of nonspecific background absorption 
and scattering is eliminated. A less common, but more sophisticated, 
backgrond correction system is based on the Zeeman effect, which uses a 
magnetically-activated light polarizer to compensate electronically for 
nonspecific absorbtion and scattering.
    Atomic emission spectroscopy with inductively-coupled argon plasma 
(AES-ICAP) is widely used to analyze for metals. With this instrument, 
the sample is aspirated into an extremely hot argon plasma flame, which 
excites the metal atoms; emission spectra specific for the sample 
element then are generated. The quanta of emitted light passing through 
a monochrometer are amplified by photomultiplier tubes and measured by a 
photodetector to determine the amount of metal in the sample. An 
advantage of AES-ICAP over AAS is that multi-elemental analyses of a 
sample can be performed by simultaneously measuring specific elemental 
emission energies. However, AES-ICAP lacks the sensitivity of AAS, 
exhibiting a limit of detection which is higher than the limit of 
detection for graphite-furnace AAS (Table 3).
    Neutron activation (NA) analysis and isotope dilution mass 
spectrometry (IDMS) are 2 additional, but highly specialized, methods 
that have been used for cadmium determinations. These methods are 
expensive because they require elaborate and sophisticated 
instrumentation.
    NA analysis has the distinct advantage over other analytical methods 
of being able to determine cadmium body burdens in specific organs 
(e.g., liver, kidney) in vivo (Ellis et al. 1983). Neutron bombardment 
of the target transforms cadmium-113 to cadmium-114, which promptly 
decays (<10<SUP>-14</SUP> sec) to its ground state, emitting gamma rays 
that are measured using large gamma detectors; appropriate shielding and 
instrumentation are required when using this method.
    IDMS analysis, a definitive but laborious method, is based on the 
change in the ratio of 2 isotopes of cadmium (cadmium 111 and 112) that 
occurs when a known amount of the element (with an artificially altered 
ratio of the same isotopes [i.e., a cadmium 111 ``spike''] is added to a 
weighed aliquot of the sample (Michiels and De Bievre 1986).

             5.1.2  Methods Developed for CDB Determinations

    A variety of methods have been used for preparing and analyzing CDB 
samples; most of these methods rely on one of the analytical techniques 
described above. Among the earliest reports, Princi (1947) and Smith et 
al. (1955) employed a colorimetric procedure to analyze for CDB and CDU. 
Samples were dried and digested through several cycles with concentrated 
mineral acids (HNO<INF>3</INF> and H<INF>2</INF> SO<INF>4</INF>) and 
hydrogen peroxide (H<INF>2</INF> O<INF>2</INF>). The digest was 
neutralized, and the cadmium was complexed with diphenylthiocarbazone 
and extracted with chloroform. The dithizone-cadmium complex then was 
quantified using a spectrometer.
    Colorimetric procedures for cadmium analyses were replaced by 
methods based on atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) in the early 
1960s, but many of the complex sample preparation procedures were 
retained. Kjellstrom (1979) reports that in Japanese, American and 
Swedish laboratories during the early 1970s, blood samples were wet 
ashed with mineral acids or ashed at high temperature and wetted with 
nitric acid. The cadmium in the digest was complexed with metal 
chelators including diethyl dithiocarbamate (DDTC), ammonium pyrrolidine 
dithiocarbamate (APDC) or diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone) in ammonia-
citrate buffer and extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). The 
resulting solution then was analyzed by flame AAS or graphite-furnace 
AAS forcadmium determinations using deuterium-lamp background 
correction.
    In the late 1970s, researchers began developing simpler preparation 
procedures. Roels

[[Page 195]]

et al. (1978) and Roberts and Clark (1986) developed simplified 
digestion procedures. Using the Roberts and Clark method, a 0.5 ml 
aliquot of blood is collected and transferred to a digestion tube 
containing 1 ml concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF>. The blood is then digested 
at 110  deg.C for 4 hours. The sample is reduced in volume by continued 
heating, and 0.5 ml 30% H<INF>2</INF> O<INF>2</INF> is added as the 
sample dries. The residue is dissolved in 5 ml dilute (1%) 
HNO<INF>3</INF>, and 20 <greek-m>l of sample is then analyzed by 
graphite-furnace AAS with deuterium-background correction.
    The current trend in the preparation of blood samples is to dilute 
the sample and add matrix modifiers to reduce background interference, 
rather than digesting the sample to reduce organic content. The method 
of Stoeppler and Brandt (1980), and the abbreviated procedure published 
in the American Public Health Association's (APHA) Methods for 
Biological Monitoring (1988), are straightforward and are nearly 
identical. For the APHA method, a small aliquot (50-300 <greek-m> l) of 
whole blood that has been stabilized with ethylenediaminetetraacetate 
(EDTA) is added to 1.0 ml 1MHNO<INF>3</INF>, vigorously shaken and 
centrifuged. Aliquots (10-25 <greek-m> l) of the supernatant then are 
then analyzed by graphite-furnace AAS with appropriate background 
correction.
    Using the method of Stoeppler and Brandt (1980), aliquots (50-200 
<greek-m> l) of whole blood that have been stabilized with EDTA are 
pipetted into clean polystyrene tubes and mixed with 150-600 <greek-m> l 
of 1 M HNO<INF>3</INF>. After vigorous shaking, the solution is 
centrifuged and a 10-25 <greek-m> l aliquot of the supernatant then is 
analyzed by graphite-furnace AAS with appropriate background correction.
    Claeys-Thoreau (1982) and DeBenzo et al. (1990) diluted blood 
samples at a ratio of 1:10 with a matrix modifier (0.2% Triton X-100, a 
wetting agent) for direct determinations of CDB. DeBenzo et al. also 
demonstrated that aqueous standards of cadmium, instead of spiked, 
whole-blood samples, could be used to establish calibration curves if 
standards and samples are treated with additional small volumes of 
matrix modifiers (i.e., 1% HNO<INF>3</INF>, 0.2% ammonium 
hydrogenphosphate and 1 mg/ml magnesium salts).
    These direct dilution procedures for CDB analysis are simple and 
rapid. Laboratories can process more than 100 samples a day using a 
dedicated graphite-furnace AAS, an auto-sampler, and either a Zeeman- or 
a deuterium-background correction system. Several authors emphasize 
using optimum settings for graphite-furnace temperatures during the 
drying, charring, and atomization processes associated with the 
flameless AAS method, and the need to run frequent QC samples when 
performing automated analysis.

                  5.1.3  Sample Collection and Handling

    Sample collection procedures are addressed primarily to identify 
ways to minimize the degree of variability that may be introduced by 
sample collection during medical monitoring. It is unclear at this point 
the extent to which collection procedures contribute to variability 
among CDB samples. Sources of variation that may result from sampling 
procedures include time-of-day effects and introduction of external 
contamination during the collection process. To minimize these sources, 
strict adherence to a sample collection protocol is recommended. Such a 
protocol must include provisions for thorough cleaning of the site from 
which blood will be extracted; also, every effort should be made to 
collect samples near the same time of day. It is also important to 
recognize that under the recent OSHA blood-borne pathogens standard (29 
CFR 1910.1030), blood samples and certain body fluids must be handled 
and treated as if they are infectious.

                   5.1.4  Best Achievable Performance

    The best achievable performance using a particular method for CDB 
determinations is assumed to be equivalent to the performance reported 
by research laboratories in which the method was developed.
    For their method, Roberts and Clark (1986) demonstrated a limit of 
detection of 0.4 <greek-m>g Cd/l in whole blood, with a linear response 
curve from 0.4 to 16.0 <greek-m>g Cd/l. They report a coefficient of 
variation (CV) of 6.7% at 8.0 <greek-m>g/l.
    The APHA (1988) reports a range of 1.0-25 <greek-m>g/l, with a CV of 
7.3% (concentration not stated). Insufficient documentation was 
available to critique this method.
    Stoeppler and Brandt (1980) achieved a detection limit of 0.2 
<greek-m>g Cd/l whole blood, with a linear range of 0.4-12.0 <greek-m>g 
Cd/l, and a CV of 15-30%, for samples at <1.0 <greek-m>g/l. Improved 
precision (CV of 3.8%) was reported for CDB concentrations at 9.3 
<greek-m>g/l.

                    5.1.5  General Method Performance

    For any particular method, the performance expected from commercial 
laboratories may be somewhat lower than that reported by the research 
laboratory in which the method was developed. With participation in 
appropriate proficiency programs and use of a proper in-house QA/QC 
program incorporating provisions for regular corrective actions, the 
performance of commercial laboratories is expected to approach that 
reported by research laboratories. Also, the results reported for 
existing proficiency programs serve as a gauge of the likely level of 
performance that currently can be expected from commercial laboratories 
offering these analyses.
    Weber (1988) reports on the results of the proficiency program run 
by the Centre de

[[Page 196]]

Toxicologie du Quebec (CTQ). As indicated previously, participants in 
that program receive 18 blood samples per year having cadmium 
concentrations ranging from 0.2-20 <greek-m>g/l. Currently, 76 
laboratories are participating in this program. The program is 
established for several analytes in addition to cadmium, and not all of 
these laboratories participate in the cadmium proficiency-testing 
program.
    Under the CTQ program, cadmium results from individual laboratories 
are compared against the consensus mean derived for each sample. Results 
indicate that after receiving 60 samples (i.e., after participation for 
approximately three years), 60% of the laboratories in the program are 
able to report results that fall within <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g/l or 
15% of the mean, whichever is greater. (For this procedure, the 15% 
criterion was applied to concentrations exceeding 7 <greek-m>g/l.) On 
any single sample of the last 20 samples, the percentage of laboratories 
falling within the specified range is between 55 and 80%.
    The CTQ also evaluates the performance of participating laboratories 
against a less severe standard: <plus-minus>2 <greek-m>g/l or 15% of the 
mean, whichever is greater (Weber 1988); 90% of participating 
laboratories are able to satisfy this standard after approximately 3 
years in the program. (The 15% criterion is used for concentrations in 
excess of 13 <greek-m>g/l.) On any single sample of the last 15 samples, 
the percentage of laboratories falling within the specified range is 
between 80 and 95% (except for a single test for which only 60% of the 
laboratories achieved the desired performance).
    Based on the data presented in Weber (1988), the CV for analysis of 
CDB is nearly constant at 20% for cadmium concentrations exceeding 5 
<greek-m>g/l, and increases for cadmium concentrations below 5 
<greek-m>g/l. At 2 <greek-m>g/l, the reported CV rises to approximately 
40%. At 1 <greek-m>g/l, the reported CV is approximately 60%.
    Participating laboratories also tend to overestimate concentrations 
for samples exhibiting concentrations less than 2 <greek-m>g/l (see 
Figure 11 of Weber 1988). This problem is due in part to the proficiency 
evaluation criterion that allows reporting a minimum <plus-minus>2.0 
<greek-m>g/l for evaluated CDB samples. There is currently little 
economic or regulatory incentive for laboratories participating in the 
CTQ program to achieve greater accuracy for CDB samples containing 
cadmium at concentrations less than 2.0 <greek-m>g/l, even if the 
laboratory has the experience and competency to distinguish among lower 
concentrations in the samples obtained from the CTQ.
    The collective experience of international agencies and 
investigators demonstrate the need for a vigorous QC program to ensure 
that CDB values reported by participating laboratories are indeed 
reasonably accurate. As Friberg (1988) stated:

``Information about the quality of published data has often been 
lacking. This is of concern as assessment of metals in trace 
concentrations in biological media are fraught with difficulties from 
the collection, handling, and storage of samples to the chemical 
analyses. This has been proven over and over again from the results of 
interlaboratory testing and quality control exercises. Large variations 
in results were reported even from `experienced' laboratories.''

    The UNEP/WHO global study of cadmium biological monitoring set a 
limit for CDB accuracy using the maximum allowable deviation method at 
Y=X<plus-minus>(0.1X+1) for a targeted concentration of 10 <greek-m>g 
Cd/l (Friberg and Vahter 1983). The performance of participating 
laboratories over a concentration range of 1.5-12 <greek-m>g/l was 
reported by Lind et al. (1987). Of the 3 QC runs conducted during 1982 
and 1983, 1 or 2 of the 6 laboratories failed each run. For the years 
1983 and 1985, between zero and 2 laboratories failed each of the 
consecutive QC runs.
    In another study (Vahter and Friberg 1988), QC samples consisting of 
both external (unknown) and internal (stated) concentrations were 
distributed to laboratories participating in the epidemiology research. 
In this study, the maximum acceptable deviation between the regression 
analysis of reported results and reference values was set at 
Y=X<plus-minus>(0.05X+0.2) for a concentration range of 0.3-5.0 
<greek-m>g Cd/l. It is reported that only 2 of 5 laboratories had 
acceptable data after the first QC set, and only 1 of 5 laboratories had 
acceptable data after the second QC set. By the fourth QC set, however, 
all 5 laboratories were judged proficient.
    The need for high quality CDB monitoring is apparent when the 
toxicological and biological characteristics of this metal are 
considered; an increase in CDB from 2 to 4 <greek-m>g/l could cause a 
doubling of the cadmium accumulation in the kidney, a critical target 
tissue for selective cadmium accumulation (Nordberg and Nordberg 1988).
    Historically, the CDC's internal QC program for CDB cadmium 
monitoring program has found achievable accuracy to be <plus-minus>10% 
of the true value at CDB concentrations <gr-thn-eq>5.0 <greek-m>g/l 
(Paschal 1990). Data on the performance of laboratories participating in 
this program currently are not available.

                   5.1.6  Observed CDB Concentrations

    As stated in Section 4.3, CDB concentrations are representative of 
ongoing levels of exposure to cadmium. Among those who have been exposed 
chronically to cadmium for extended periods, however, CDB may contain a 
component attributable to the general cadmium body burden.

           5.1.6.1  CDB Concentrations Among Unexposed Samples

    Numerous studies have been conducted examining CDB concentrations in 
the general

[[Page 197]]

population, and in control groups used for comparison with cadmium-
exposed workers. A number of reports have been published that present 
erroneously high values of CDB (Nordberg and Nordberg 1988). This 
problem was due to contamination of samples during sampling and 
analysis, and to errors in analysis. Early AAS methods were not 
sufficiently sensitive to accurately estimate CDB concentrations.
    Table 4 presents results of recent studies reporting CDB levels for 
the general U.S. population not exposed occupationally to cadmium. Other 
surveys of tissue cadmium using U.S. samples and conducted as part of a 
cooperative effort among Japan, Sweden and the U.S., did not collect CDB 
data because standard analytical methodologies were unavailable, and 
because of analytic problems (Kjellstrom 1979; SWRI 1978).

    Arithmetic and/or geometric means and standard deviations are 
provided in Table 4 for measurements among the populations defined in 
each study listed. The range of reported measurements and/or the 95% 
upper and lower confidence intervals for the means are presented when 
this information was reported in a study. For studies reporting either 
an arithmetic or geometric standard deviation along with a mean, the 
lower and upper 95th percentile for the distribution also were derived 
and reported in the table.
    The data provided in table 4 from Kowal et al. (1979) are from 
studies conducted between 1974 and 1976 evaluating CDB levels for the 
general population in Chicago, and are considered to be representative 
of the U.S. population. These studies indicate that the average CDB 
concentration among those not occupationally exposed to cadmium is 
approximately 1 <greek-m>g/l.
    In several other studies presented in Table 4, measurements are 
reported separately for males and females, and for smokers and 
nonsmokers. The data in this table indicate that similar CDB levels are 
observed among males and females in the general population, but that 
smokers tend to exhibit higher CDB levels than nonsmokers. Based on the 
Kowal et al. (1979) study, smokers not occupationally exposed to cadmium 
exhibit an average CDB level of 1.4 <greek-m>g/l.
    In general, nonsmokers tend to exhibit levels ranging to 2 
<greek-m>g/l, while levels observed among smokers range to 5 <greek-m>g/
l. Based on the data presented in Table 4, 95% of those not 
occupationally exposed to cadmium exhibit CDB levels less than 5 
<greek-m>g/l.

            5.1.6.2  CDB concentrations among exposed workers

    Table 5 is a summary of results from studies reporting CDB levels 
among workers exposed to cadmium in the work place. As in Table 4, 
arithmetic and/or geometric means and standard deviations are provided 
if reported in the listed studies. The absolute range, or the 95% 
confidence interval around the mean, of the data in each study are 
provided when reported. In addition, the lower and upper 95th percentile 
of the distribution are presented for each study i which a mean and 
corresponding standard deviation were reported. Table 5 also provides 
estimates of the duration, and level, of exposure to cadmium in the work 
place if these data were reported in the listed studies. The data 
presented in table 5 suggest that CDB levels are dose related. Sukuri et 
al. (1983) show that higher CDB levels are observed among workers 
experiencing higher work place exposure. This trend appears to be true 
of the studies listed in the table.
    CDB levels reported in table 5 are higher among those showing signs 
of cadmium-related kidney damage than those showing no such damage. 
Lauwerys et al. (1976) report CDB levels among workers with kidney 
lesions that generally are above the levels reported for workers without 
kidney lesions. Ellis et al. (1983) report a similar observation 
comparing workers with and without renal dysfunction, although they 
found more overlap between the 2 groups than Lauwerys et al.

    The data in table 5 also indicate that CDB levels are higher among 
those experiencing current occupational exposure than those who have 
been removed from such exposure. Roels et al. (1982) indicate that CDB 
levels observed among workers experiencing ongoing exposure in the work 
place are almost entirely above levels observed among workers removed 
from such exposure. This finding suggests that CDB levels decrease once 
cadmium exposure has ceased.
    A comparison of the data presented in tables 4 and 5 indicates that 
CDB levels observed among cadmium-exposed workers is significantly 
higher than levels observed among the unexposed groups. With the 
exception of 2 studies presented in table 5 (1 of which includes former 
workers in the sample group tested), the lower 95th percentile for CDB 
levels among exposed workers are greater than 5 <greek-m>g/l, which is 
the value of the upper 95th percentile for CDB levels observed among 
those who are not occupationally exposed. Therefore, a CDB level of 5 
<greek-m>g/l represents a threshold above which significant work place 
exposure to cadmium may be occurring.

             5.1.7  Conclusions and Recommendations for CDB

    Based on the above evaluation, the following recommendations are 
made for a CDB proficiency program.

                       5.1.7.1  Recommended method

    The method of Stoeppler and Brandt (1980) should be adopted for 
analyzing CDB. This method was selected over other methods for its 
straightforward sample-preparation procedures, and because limitations 
of the method were described adequately. It also is the method used by a 
plurality of laboratories currently participating in the CTQ proficiency 
program. In a recent CTQ interlaboratory comparison report (CTQ 1991), 
analysis of the methods used by laboratories to measure CDB indicates 
that 46% (11 of 24) of the participating laboratories used the Stoeppler 
and Brandt methodology (HNO<INF>3</INF> deproteinization of blood 
followed by analysis of the supernatant by GF-AAS). Other CDB methods 
employed by participating laboratories identified in the CTQ report 
include dilution of blood (29%), acid digestion (12%) and miscellaneous 
methods (12%).
    Laboratories may adopt alternate methods, but it is the 
responsibility of the laboratory to demonstrate that the alternate 
methods meet the data quality objectives defined for the Stoeppler and 
Brandt method (see Section 5.1.7.2 below).

                    5.1.7.2  Data quality objectives

    Based on the above evaluation, the following data quality objectives 
(DQOs) should facilitate interpretation of analytical results.
    Limit of Detection. 0.5 <greek-m>g/l should be achievable using the 
Stoeppler and Brandt method. Stoeppler and Brandt (1980) report a limit 
of detection equivalent to <ls-thn-eq>0.2 <greek-m>g/l in whole blood 
using 25 <greek-m> l aliquots of deproteinized, diluted blood samples.
    Accuracy. Initially, some of the laboratories performing CDB 
measurements may be expected to satisfy criteria similar to the less 
severe criteria specified by the CTQ program, i.e., measurements within 
2 <greek-m>g/l or 15% (whichever is greater) of the target value. About 
60% of the laboratories enrolled in the CTQ program could meet this 
criterion on the first proficiency test (Weber 1988).
    Currently, approximately 12 laboratories in the CTQ program are 
achieving an accuracy for CDB analysis within the more severe 
constraints of <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g/l or 15% (whichever is greater). 
Later, as laboratories gain experience, they should achieve the level of 
accuracy exhibited by these 12 laboratories. The experience in the CTQ 
program has shown that, even without incentives, laboratories benefit 
from the feedback of the program; after they have analyzed 40-50 control 
samples from the program, performance improves to the point where about 
60% of the laboratories can meet the stricter criterion of <plus-minus>1 
<greek-m>g/l or 15% (Weber 1988). Thus, this stricter target accuracy is 
a reasonable DQO.
    Precision. Although Stoeppler and Brandt (1980) suggest that a 
coefficient of variation (CV) near 1.3% (for a 10 <greek-m>g/l 
concentration) is achievable for within-run reproducibility, it is 
recognized that other factors affecting within- and between-run 
comparability will increase the achievable CV. Stoeppler and Brandt 
(1980) observed CVs that were as high as 30% for low concentrations (0.4 
<greek-m>g/l), and CVs of less than 5% for higher concentrations.
    For internal QC samples (see Section 3.3.1), laboratories should 
attain an overall precision near 25%. For CDB samples with 
concentrations less than 2 <greek-m>g/l, a target precision of 40% is 
reasonable, while precisions of 20% should be achievable for 
concentrations greater than 2 <greek-m>g/l. Although these values are 
more strict than values observed in the CTQ interlaboratory program 
reported by Webber (1988), they are within the achievable limits 
reported by Stoeppler and Brandt (1980).

               5.1.7.3  Quality assurance/quality control

    Commercial laboratories providing measurement of CDB should adopt an 
internal QA/QC program that incorporates the following components: 
Strict adherence to the selected method, including all calibration 
requirements; regular incorporation of QC samples during actual runs; a 
protocol for corrective actions, and documentation of

[[Page 202]]

these actions; and, participation in an interlaboratory proficiency 
program. Note that the nonmandatory QA/QC program presented in 
Attachment 1 is based on the Stoeppler and Brandt method for CDB 
analysis. Should an alternate method be adopted, the laboratory should 
develop a QA/QC program satisfying the provisions of Section 3.3.1.

                  5.2 Measuring Cadmium in Urine (CDU)

    As in the case of CDB measurement, proper determination of CDU 
requires strict analytical discipline regarding collection and handling 
of samples. Because cadmium is both ubiquitous in the environment and 
employed widely in coloring agents for industrial products that may be 
used during sample collection, preparation and analysis, care should be 
exercised to ensure that samples are not contaminated during the 
sampling procedure.
    Methods for CDU determination share many of the same features as 
those employed for the determination of CDB. Thus, changes and 
improvements to methods for measuring CDU over the past 40 years 
parallel those used to monitor CDB. The direction of development has 
largely been toward the simplification of sample preparation techniques 
made possible because of improvements in analytic techniques.

                     5.2.1  Units of CDU Measurement

    Procedures adopted for reporting CDU concentrations are not uniform. 
In fact, the situation for reporting CDU is more complicated than for 
CDB, where concentrations are normalized against a unit volume of whole 
blood.
    Concentrations of solutes in urine vary with several biological 
factors (including the time since last voiding and the volume of liquid 
consumed over the last few hours); as a result, solute concentrations 
should be normalized against another characteristic of urine that 
represents changes in solute concentrations. The 2 most common 
techniques are either to standardize solute concentrations against the 
concentration of creatinine, or to standardize solute concentrations 
against the specific gravity of the urine. Thus, CDU concentrations have 
been reported in the literature as ``uncorrected'' concentrations of 
cadmium per volume of urine (i.e., <greek-m>g Cd/l urine), ``corrected'' 
concentrations of cadmium per volume of urine at a standard specific 
gravity (i.e., <greek-m>g Cd/l urine at a specific gravity of 1.020), or 
``corrected'' mass concentration per unit mass of creatinine (i.e., 
<greek-m>g Cd/g creatinine). (CDU concentrations [whether uncorrected or 
corrected for specific gravity, or normalized to creatinine] 
occasionally are reported in nanomoles [i.e., nmoles] of cadmium per 
unit mass or volume. In this protocol, these values are converted to 
<greek-m>g of cadmium per unit mass or volume using 89 nmoles of 
cadmium=10 <greek-m>g.)
    While it is agreed generally that urine values of analytes should be 
normalized for reporting purposes, some debate exists over what 
correction method should be used. The medical community has long favored 
normalization based on creatinine concentration, a common urinary 
constituent. Creatinine is a normal product of tissue catabolism, is 
excreted at a uniform rate, and the total amount excreted per day is 
constant on a day-to-day basis (NIOSH 1984b). While this correction 
method is accepted widely in Europe, and within some occupational health 
circles, Kowals (1983) argues that the use of specific gravity (i.e., 
total solids per unit volume) is more straightforward and practical 
(than creatinine) in adjusting CDU values for populations that vary by 
age or gender.
    Kowals (1983) found that urinary creatinine (CRTU) is lower in 
females than males, and also varies with age. Creatinine excretion is 
highest in younger males (20-30 years old), decreases at middle age (50-
60 years), and may rise slightly in later years. Thus, cadmium 
concentrations may be underestimated for some workers with high CRTU 
levels.
    Within a single void urine collection, urine concentration of any 
analyte will be affected by recent consumption of large volumes of 
liquids, and by heavy physical labor in hot environments. The absolute 
amount of analyte excreted may be identical, but concentrations will 
vary widely so that urine must be corrected for specific gravity (i.e., 
to normalize concentrations to the quantity of total solute) using a 
fixed value (e.g., 1.020 or 1.024). However, since heavy-metal exposure 
may increase urinary protein excretion, there is a tendency to 
underestimate cadmium concentrations in samples with high specific 
gravities when specific-gravity corrections are applied.
    Despite some shortcomings, reporting solute concentrations as a 
function of creatinine concentration is accepted generally; OSHA 
therefore recommends that CDU levels be reported as the mass of cadmium 
per unit mass of creatinine (<greek-m>g/g CTRU).
    Reporting CDU as <greek-m>g/g CRTU requires an additional analytical 
process beyond the analysis of cadmium: Samples must be analyzed 
independently for creatinine so that results may be reported as the 
ratio of cadmium to creatinine concentrations found in the urine sample. 
Consequently, the overall quality of the analysis depends on the 
combined performance by a laboratory on these 2 determinations. The 
analysis used for CDU determinations is addressed below in terms of 
<greek-m>g Cd/l, with analysis of creatinine addressed separately. 
Techniques for assessing creatinine are discussed in Section 5.4.

[[Page 203]]

    Techniques for deriving cadmium as a ratio of CRTU, and the 
confidence limits for independent measurements of cadmium and CRTU, are 
provided in Section 3.3.3.

            5.2.2  Analytical Techniques Used to Monitor CDU

    Analytical techniques used for CDU determinations are similar to 
those employed for CDB determinations; these techniques are summarized 
in Table 3. As with CDB monitoring, the technique most suitable for CDU 
determinations is atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). AAS methods used 
for CDU determinations typically employ a graphite furnace, with 
background correction made using either the deuterium-lamp or Zeeman 
techniques; Section 5.1.1 provides a detailed description of AAS 
methods.

             5.2.3  Methods Developed for CDU Determinations

    Princi (1947), Smith et al. (1955), Smith and Kench (1957), and 
Tsuchiya (1967) used colorimetric procedures similar to those described 
in the CDB section above to estimate CDU concentrations. In these 
methods, urine (50 ml) is reduced to dryness by heating in a sand bath 
and digested (wet ashed) with mineral acids. Cadmium then is complexed 
with dithiazone, extracted with chloroform and quantified by 
spectrophotometry. These early studies typically report reagent blank 
values equivalent to 0.3 <greek-m>g Cd/l, and CDU concentrations among 
nonexposed control groups at maximum levels of 10 <greek-m>g Cd/l-- 
erroneously high values when compared to more recent surveys of cadmium 
concentrations in the general population.
    By the mid-1970s, most analytical procedures for CDU analysis used 
either wet ashing (mineral acid) or high temperatures (>400  deg.C) to 
digest the organic matrix of urine, followed by cadmium chelation with 
APDC or DDTC solutions and extraction with MIBK. The resulting aliquots 
were analyzed by flame or graphite-furnace AAS (Kjellstrom 1979).
    Improvements in control over temperature parameters with 
electrothermal heating devices used in conjunction with flameless AAS 
techniques, and optimization of temperature programs for controlling the 
drying, charring, and atomization processes in sample analyses, led to 
improved analytical detection of diluted urine samples without the need 
for sample digestion or ashing. Roels et al. (1978) successfully used a 
simple sample preparation, dilution of 1.0 ml aliquots of urine with 0.1 
N HNO<INF>3</INF>, to achieve accurate low-level determinations of CDU.
    In the method described by Pruszkowska et al. (1983), which has 
become the preferred method for CDU analysis, urine samples were diluted 
at a ratio of 1:5 with water; diammonium hydrogenphosphate in dilute 
HNO<INF>3</INF> was used as a matrix modifier. The matrix modifier 
allows for a higher charring temperature without loss of cadmium through 
volatilization during preatomization. This procedure also employs a 
stabilized temperature platform in a graphite furnace, while nonspecific 
background absorbtion is corrected using the Zeeman technique. This 
method allows for an absolute detection limit of approximately 0.04 
<greek-m>g Cd/l urine.

                  5.2.4  Sample Collection and Handling

    Sample collection procedures for CDU may contribute to variability 
observed among CDU measurements. Sources of variation attendant to 
sampling include time-of-day, the interval since ingestion of liquids, 
and the introduction of external contamination during the collection 
process. Therefore, to minimize contributions from these variables, 
strict adherence to a sample-collection protocol is recommended. This 
protocol should include provisions for normalizing the conditions under 
which urine is collected. Every effort also should be made to collect 
samples during the same time of day.
    Collection of urine samples from an industrial work force for 
biological monitoring purposes usually is performed using ``spot'' 
(i.e., single-void) urine with the pH of the sample determined 
immediately. Logistic and sample-integrity problems arise when efforts 
are made to collect urine over long periods (e.g., 24 hrs). Unless 
single-void urines are used, there are numerous opportunities for 
measurement error because of poor control over sample collection, 
storage and environmental contamination.
    To minimize the interval during which sample urine resides in the 
bladder, the following adaption to the ``spot'' collection procedure is 
recommended: The bladder should first be emptied, and then a large glass 
of water should be consumed; the sample may be collected within an hour 
after the water is consumed.

                   5.2.5  Best Achievable Performance

    Performance using a particular method for CDU determinations is 
assumed to be equivalent to the performance reported by the research 
laboratories in which the method was developed. Pruszkowska et al. 
(1983) report a detection limit of 0.04 <greek-m>g/l CDU, with a CV of 
<4% between 0-5 <greek-m>g/l. The CDC reports a minimum CDU detection 
limit of 0.07 <greek-m>g/l using a modified method based on Pruszkowska 
et al. (1983). No CV is stated in this protocol; the protocol contains 
only rejection criteria for internal QC parameters used during accuracy 
determinations with known standards (Attachment 8 of exhibit 106 of OSHA 
docket H057A). Stoeppler and Brandt (1980) report a CDU detection limit 
of 0.2 <greek-m>/l for their methodology.

[[Page 204]]

                    5.2.6  General Method Performance

    For any particular method, the expected initial performance from 
commercial laboratories may be somewhat lower than that reported by the 
research laboratory in which the method was developed. With 
participation in appropriate proficiency programs, and use of a proper 
in-house QA/QC program incorporating provisions for regular corrective 
actions, the performance of commercial laboratories may be expected to 
improve and approach that reported by a research laboratories. The 
results reported for existing proficiency programs serve to specify the 
initial level of performance that likely can be expected from commercial 
laboratories offering analysis using a particular method.
    Weber (1988) reports on the results of the CTQ proficiency program, 
which includes CDU results for laboratories participating in the 
program. Results indicate that after receiving 60 samples (i.e., after 
participating in the program for approximately 3 years), approximately 
80% of the participating laboratories report CDU results ranging between 
<plus-minus>2 <greek-m>g/l or 15% of the consensus mean, whichever is 
greater. On any single sample of the last 15 samples, the proportion of 
laboratories falling within the specified range is between 75 and 95%, 
except for a single test for which only 60% of the laboratories reported 
acceptable results. For each of the last 15 samples, approximately 60% 
of the laboratories reported results within <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g or 
15% of the mean, whichever is greater. The range of concentrations 
included in this set of samples was not reported.
    Another report from the CTQ (1991) summarizes preliminary CDU 
results from their 1991 interlaboratory program. According to the 
report, for 3 CDU samples with values of 9.0, 16.8, 31.5 <greek-m>g/l, 
acceptable results (target of <plus-minus>2 <greek-m>g/l or 15 % of the 
consensus mean, whichever is greater) were achieved by only 44-52% of 
the 34 laboratories participating in the CDU program. The overall CVs 
for these 3 CDU samples among the 34 participating laboratories were 
31%, 25%, and 49%, respectively. The reason for this poor performance 
has not been determined.
    A more recent report from the CTQ (Weber, private communication) 
indicates that 36% of the laboratories in the program have been able to 
achieve the target of <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g/l or 15% for more than 
75% of the samples analyzed over the last 5 years, while 45% of 
participating laboratories achieved a target of <plus-minus>2 
<greek-m>g/l or 15% for more than 75% of the samples analyzed over the 
same period.
    Note that results reported in the interlaboratory programs are in 
terms of <greek-m>g Cd/l of urine, unadjusted for creatinine. The 
performance indicated, therefore, is a measure of the performance of the 
cadmium portion of the analyses, and does not include variation that may 
be introduced during the analysis of CRTU.

                   5.2.7  Observed CDU Concentrations

    Prior to the onset of renal dysfunction, CDU concentrations provide 
a general indication of the exposure history (i.e., body burden) (see 
Section 4.3). Once renal dysfunction occurs, CDU levels appear to 
increase and are no longer indicative solely of cadmium body burden 
(Friberg and Elinder 1988).

  5.2.7.1  Range of CDU concentrations observed among unexposed samples

    Surveys of CDU concentrations in the general population were first 
reported from cooperative studies among industrial countries (i.e., 
Japan, U.S. and Sweden) conducted in the mid-1970s. In summarizing these 
data, Kjellstrom (1979) reported that CDU concentrations among Dallas, 
Texas men (age range: <9-59 years; smokers and nonsmokers) varied from 
0.11-1.12 <greek-m>g/l (uncorrected for creatinine or specific gravity). 
These CDU concentrations are intermediate between population values 
found in Sweden (range: 0.11-0.80 <greek-m>g/l) and Japan (range: 0.14-
2.32 <greek-m>g/l).
    Kowal and Zirkes (1983) reported CDU concentrations for almost 1,000 
samples collected during 1978-79 from the general U.S. adult population 
(i.e., nine states; both genders; ages 20-74 years). They report that 
CDU concentrations are lognormally distributed; low levels predominated, 
but a small proportion of the population exhibited high levels. These 
investigators transformed the CDU concentrations values, and reported 
the same data 3 different ways: <greek-m>g/l urine (unadjusted), 
<greek-m>g/l (specific gravity adjusted to 1.020), and <greek-m>g/g 
CRTU. These data are summarized in Tables 6 and 7.
    Based on further statistical examination of these data, including 
the lifestyle characteristics of this group, Kowal (1988) suggested 
increased cadmium absorption (i.e., body burden) was correlated with low 
dietary intakes of calcium and iron, as well as cigarette smoking.
    CDU levels presented in Table 6 are adjusted for age and gender. 
Results suggest that CDU levels may be slightly different among men and 
women (i.e., higher among men when values are unadjusted, but lower 
among men when the values are adjusted, for specific gravity or CRTU). 
Mean differences among men and women are small compared to the standard 
deviations, and therefore may not be significant. Levels of CDU also 
appear to increase with age. The data in Table 6 suggest as well that 
reporting CDU levels adjusted for specific gravity or as a function of 
CRTU results in reduced variability.

    The data in the Table 6 indicate the geometric mean of CDU levels 
observed among the general population is 0.52 <greek-m>/g Cd/l urine 
(unadjusted), with a geometric standard deviation of 3.0. Normalized for 
creatinine, the geometric mean for the population is 0.66 <greek-m>/g 
CRTU, with a geometric standard deviation of 2.7. Table 7 provides the 
distributions of CDU concentrations for the general population studied 
by Kowal and Zirkes. The data in this table indicate that 95% of the CDU 
levels observed among those not occupationally exposed to cadmium are 
below 3 <greek-m>/g CRTU.

   5.2.7.2  Range of CDU concentrations observed among exposed workers

    Table 8 is a summary of results from available studies of CDU 
concentrations observed among cadmium-exposed workers. In this table, 
arithmetic and/or geometric means and standard deviations are provided 
if reported in these studies. The absolute range for the data in each 
study, or the 95% confidence interval around the mean of each study, 
also are provided when reported. The lower and upper 95th percentile of 
the distribution are presented for each study in which a mean and 
corresponding standard deviation were reported. Table 8 also provides 
estimates of the years of exposure, and the levels of exposure, to 
cadmium in the work place if reported in these studies. Concentrations 
reported in this table are in <greek-m>/g CRTU, unless otherwise stated.

    Data in Table 8 from Lauwerys et al. (1976) and Ellis et al. (1983) 
indicate that CDU concentrations are higher among those exhibiting 
kidney lesions or dysfunction than among those lacking these symptoms. 
Data from the study by Roels et al. (1982) indicate that CDU levels 
decrease among workers removed from occupational exposure to cadmium in 
comparison to workers experiencing ongoing exposure. In both cases, 
however, the distinction between the 2 groups is not as clear as with 
CDB; there is more overlap in CDU levels observed among each of the 
paired populations than is true for corresponding CDB levels. As with 
CDB levels, the data in Table 8 suggest increased CDU concentrations 
among workers who experienced increased overall exposure.
    Although a few occupationally-exposed workers in the studies 
presented in Table 8 exhibit CDU levels below 3 <greek-m>g/g CRTU, most 
of those workers exposed to cadmium levels in excess of the PEL defined 
in the final cadmium rule exhibit CDU levels above 3 <greek-m>g/g CRTU; 
this level represents the upper 95th percentile of the CDU distribution 
observed among those who are not occupationally exposed to cadmium 
(Table 7).
    The mean CDU levels reported in Table 8 among occupationally-exposed 
groups studied (except 2) exceed 3 <greek-m>g/g CRTU. Correspondingly, 
the level of exposure reported in these studies (with 1 exception) are 
significantly higher than what workers will experience under the final 
cadmium rule. The 2 exceptions are from the studies by Mueller et al. 
(1989) and Kawada et al. (1990); these studies indicate that workers 
exposed to cadmium during pigment manufacture do not exhibit CDU levels 
as high as those levels observed among workers exposed to cadmium in 
other occupations. Exposure levels, however, were lower in the pigment 
manufacturing plants studied. Significantly, workers removed from 
occupational cadmium exposure for an average of 4 years still exhibited 
CDU levels in excess of 3 <greek-m>g/g CRTU (Roels et al. 1982). In the 
single-exception study with a reported level of cadmium exposure lower 
than levels proposed in the final rule (i.e., the study of a pigment 
manufacturing plant by Kawada et al. 1990), most of the workers 
exhibited CDU levels less than 3 <greek-m>g/g CRTU (i.e., the mean value 
was only 1.3 <greek-m>g/g CRTU). CDU levels among workers with such 
limited cadmium exposure are expected to be significantly lower than 
levels of other studies reported in Table 8.
    Based on the above data, a CDU level of 3 <greek-m>g/g CRTU appear 
to represent a threshold above which significant work place exposure to 
cadmium occurs over the work span of those being monitored. Note that 
this threshold is not as distinct as the corresponding threshold 
described for CDB. In general, the variability associated with CDU 
measurements among exposed workers appears to be higher than the 
variability associated with CDB measurements among similar workers.

             5.2.8  Conclusions and Recommendations for CDU

    The above evaluation supports the following recommendations for a 
CDU proficiency program. These recommendations address only sampling and 
analysis procedures for CDU determinations specifically, which are to be 
reported as an unadjusted <greek-m>g Cd/l urine. Normalizing this result 
to creatinine requires a second analysis for CRTU so that the ratio of 
the 2 measurements can be obtained. Creatinine analysis is addressed in 
Section 5.4. Formal procedures for combining the 2 measurements to 
derive a value and a confidence limit for CDU in <greek-m>g/g CRTU are 
provided in Section 3.3.3.

                       5.2.8.1  Recommended method

    The method of Pruszkowska et al. (1983) should be adopted for CDU 
analysis. This method is recommended because it is simple, 
straightforward and reliable (i.e., small variations in experimental 
conditions do not affect the analytical results).
    A synopsis of the methods used by laboratories to determine CDU 
under the interlaboratory program administered by the CTQ (1991) 
indicates that more than 78% (24 of 31) of the participating 
laboratories use a dilution method to prepare urine samples for CDU 
analysis. Laboratories may adopt alternate methods, but it is the 
responsibility of the laboratory to demonstrate that the alternate 
methods provide results of comparable quality to the Pruszkowska method.

                    5.2.8.2  Data quality objectives

    The following data quality objectives should facilitate 
interpretation of analytical results, and are achievable based on the 
above evaluation.
    Limit of Detection. A level of 0.5 <greek-m>g/l (i.e., corresponding 
to a detection limit of 0.5 <greek-m>g/g CRTU, assuming 1 g CRT/l urine) 
should be achievable. Pruszkowska et al. (1983) achieved a limit of 
detection of 0.04 <greek-m>g/l for CDU based on the slope of the curve 
for their working standards (0.35 pg Cd/0.0044, A signal=1% absorbance 
using GF-AAS).
    The CDC reports a minimum detection limit for CDU of 0.07 
<greek-m>g/l using a modified Pruszkowska method. This limit of 
detection was defined as 3 times the standard deviation calculated from 
10 repeated measurements of a ``low level'' CDU test sample (Attachment 
8 of exhibit 106 of OSHA docket H057A).
    Stoeppler and Brandt (1980) report a limit of detection for CDU of 
0.2 <greek-m>g/l using an aqueous dilution (1:2) of the urine samples.
    Accuracy. A recent report from the CTQ (Weber, private 
communication) indicates that 36% of the laboratories in the program

[[Page 208]]

achieve the target of <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g/l or 15% for more than 
75% of the samples analyzed over the last 5 years, while 45% of 
participating laboratories achieve a target of <plus-minus>2 <greek-m>g/
l or 15% for more than 75% of the samples analyzed over the same period. 
With time and a strong incentive for improvement, it is expected that 
the proportion of laboratories successfully achieving the stricter level 
of accuracy should increase. It should be noted, however, these indices 
of performance do not include variations resulting from the ancillary 
measurement of CRTU (which is recommended for the proper recording of 
results). The low cadmium levels expected to be measured indicate that 
the analysis of creatinine will contribute relatively little to the 
overall variability observed among creatinine-normalized CDU levels (see 
Section 5.4). The initial target value for reporting CDU under this 
program, therefore, is set at <plus-minus>1 <greek-m>g/g CRTU or 15% 
(whichever is greater).
    Precision. For internal QC samples (which are recommended as part of 
an internal QA/QC program, Section 3.3.1), laboratories should attain an 
overall precision of 25%. For CDB samples with concentrations less than 
2 <greek-m>g/l, a target precision of 40% is acceptable, while 
precisions of 20% should be achievable for CDU concentrations greater 
than 2 <greek-m>g/l. Although these values are more stringent than those 
observed in the CTQ interlaboratory program reported by Webber (1988), 
they are well within limits expected to be achievable for the method as 
reported by Stoeppler and Brandt (1980).

               5.2.8.3  Quality assurance/quality control

    Commercial laboratories providing CDU determinations should adopt an 
internal QA/QC program that incorporates the following components: 
Strict adherence to the selected method, including calibration 
requirements; regular incorporation of QC samples during actual runs; a 
protocol for corrective actions, and documentation of such actions; and, 
participation in an interlaboratory proficiency program. Note that the 
nonmandatory program presented in Attachment 1 as an example of an 
acceptable QA/QC program, is based on using the Pruszkowska method for 
CDU analysis. Should an alternate method be adopted by a laboratory, the 
laboratory should develop a QA/QC program equivalent to the nonmandatory 
program, and which satisfies the provisions of Section 3.3.1.

        5.3  Monitoring <greek-b>-2-Microglobulin in Urine (B2MU)

    As indicated in Section 4.3, B2MU appears to be the best of several 
small proteins that may be monitored as early indicators of cadmium-
induced renal damage. Several analytic techniques are available for 
measuring B2M.

                    5.3.1  Units of B2MU Measurement

    Procedures adopted for reporting B2MU levels are not uniform. In 
these guidelines, OSHA recommends that B2MU levels be reported as 
<greek-m>g/g CRTU, similar to reporting CDU concentrations. Reporting 
B2MU normalized to the concentration of CRTU requires an additional 
analytical process beyond the analysis of B2M: Independent analysis for 
creatinine so that results may be reported as a ratio of the B2M and 
creatinine concentrations found in the urine sample. Consequently, the 
overall quality of the analysis depends on the combined performance on 
these 2 analyses. The analysis used for B2MU determinations is described 
in terms of <greek-m>g B2M/l urine, with analysis of creatinine 
addressed separately. Techniques used to measure creatinine are provided 
in Section 5.4. Note that Section 3.3.3 provides techniques for deriving 
the value of B2M as function of CRTU, and the confidence limits for 
independent measurements of B2M and CRTU.

            5.3.2  Analytical Techniques Used to Monitor B2MU

    One of the earliest tests used to measure B2MU was the radial 
immunodiffusion technique. This technique is a simple and specific 
method for identification and quantitation of a number of proteins found 
in human serum and other body fluids when the protein is not readily 
differentiated by standard electrophoretic procedures. A quantitative 
relationship exists between the concentration of a protein deposited in 
a well that is cut into a thin agarose layer containing the 
corresponding monospecific antiserum, and the distance that the 
resultant complex diffuses. The wells are filled with an unknown serum 
and the standard (or control), and incubated in a moist environment at 
room temperature. After the optimal point of diffusion has been reached, 
the diameters of the resulting precipition rings are measured. The 
diameter of a ring is related to the concentration of the constituent 
substance. For B2MU determinations required in the medical monitoring 
program, this method requires a process that may be insufficient to 
concentrate the protein to levels that are required for detection.
    Radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques are used widely in immunologic 
assays to measure the concentration of antigen or antibody in body-fluid 
samples. RIA procedures are based on competitive-binding techniques. If 
antigen concentration is being measured, the principle underlying the 
procedure is that radioactive-labeled antigen competes with the sample's 
unlabeled antigen for binding sites on a known amount of immobile 
antibody. When these 3 components are present in the system, an 
equilibrium exists. This equilibrium is followed by a separation of

[[Page 209]]

the free and bound forms of the antigen. Either free or bound 
radioactive-labeled antigen can be assessed to determine the amount of 
antigen in the sample. The analysis is performed by measuring the level 
of radiation emitted either by the bound complex following removal of 
the solution containing the free antigen, or by the isolated solution 
containing the residual-free antigen. The main advantage of the RIA 
method is the extreme sensitivity of detection for emitted radiation and 
the corresponding ability to detect trace amounts of antigen. 
Additionally, large numbers of tests can be performed rapidly.
    The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques are similar 
to RIA techniques except that nonradioactive labels are employed. This 
technique is safe, specific and rapid, and is nearly as sensitive as RIA 
techniques. An enzyme-labeled antigen is used in the immunologic assay; 
the labeled antigen detects the presence and quantity of unlabeled 
antigen in the sample. In a representative ELISA test, a plastic plate 
is coated with antibody (e.g., antibody to B2M). The antibody reacts 
with antigen (B2M) in the urine and forms an antigen-antibody complex on 
the plate. A second anti-B2M antibody (i.e., labeled with an enzyme) is 
added to the mixture and forms an antibody-antigen-antibody complex. 
Enzyme activity is measured spectrophotometrically after the addition of 
a specific chromogenic substrate which is activated by the bound enzyme. 
The results of a typical test are calculated by comparing the 
spectrophotometric reading of a serum sample to that of a control or 
reference serum. In general, these procedures are faster and require 
less laboratory work than other methods.
    In a fluorescent ELISA technique (such as the one employed in the 
Pharmacia Delphia test for B2M), the labeled enzyme is bound to a strong 
fluorescent dye. In the Pharmacia Delphia test, an antigen bound to a 
fluorescent dye competes with unlabeled antigen in the sample for a 
predetermined amount of specific, immobile antibody. Once equilibrium is 
reached, the immobile phase is removed from the labeled antigen in the 
sample solution and washed; an enhancement solution then is added that 
liberates the fluorescent dye from the bound antigen-antibody complex. 
The enhancement solution also contains a chelate that complexes with the 
fluorescent dye in solution; this complex increases the fluorescent 
properties of the dye so that it is easier to detect.
    To determine the quantity of B2M in a sample using the Pharmacia 
Delphia test, the intensity of the fluorescence of the enhancement 
solution is measured. This intensity is proportional to the 
concentration of labeled antigen that bound to the immobile antibody 
phase during the initial competition with unlabeled antigen from the 
sample. Consequently, the intensity of the fluorescence is an inverse 
function of the concentration of antigen (B2M) in the original sample. 
The relationship between the fluorescence level and the B2M 
concentration in the sample is determined using a series of graded 
standards, and extrapolating these standards to find the concentration 
of the unknown sample.

             5.3.3 Methods Developed for B2MU Determinations

    B2MU usually is measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA); however, other methods (including gel 
electrophoresis, radial immunodiffusion, and nephelometric assays) also 
have been described (Schardun and van Epps 1987). RIA and ELISA methods 
are preferred because they are sensitive at concentrations as low as 
micrograms per liter, require no concentration processes, are highly 
reliable and use only a small sample volume.
    Based on a survey of the literature, the ELISA technique is 
recommended for monitoring B2MU. While RIAs provide greater sensitivity 
(typically about 1 <greek-m>g/l, Evrin et al. 1971), they depend on the 
use of radioisotopes; use of radioisotopes requires adherence to rules 
and regulations established by the Atomic Energy Commission, and 
necessitates an expensive radioactivity counter for testing. 
Radioisotopes also have a relatively short half-life, which corresponds 
to a reduced shelf life, thereby increasing the cost and complexity of 
testing. In contrast, ELISA testing can be performed on routine 
laboratory spectrophotometers, do not necessitate adherence to 
additional rules and regulations governing the handling of radioactive 
substances, and the test kits have long shelf lives. Further, the range 
of sensitivity commonly achieved by the recommended ELISA test (i.e., 
the Pharmacia Delphia test) is approximately 100 <greek-m>g/l (Pharmacia 
1990), which is sufficient for monitoring B2MU levels resulting from 
cadmium exposure. Based on the studies listed in Table 9 (Section 
5.3.7), the average range of B2M concentrations among the general, 
nonexposed population falls between 60 and 300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU. The 
upper 95th percentile of distributions, derived from studies in Table 9 
which reported standard deviations, range between 180 and 1,140 
<greek-m>g/g CRTU. Also, the Pharmacia Delphia test currently is the 
most widely used test for assessing B2MU.

[[Page 210]]

                  5.3.4  Sample Collection and Handling

    As with CDB or CDU, sample collection procedures are addressed 
primarily to identify ways to minimize the degree of variability 
introduced by sample collection during medical monitoring. It is unclear 
the extent to which sample collection contributes to B2MU variability. 
Sources of variation include time-of-day effects, the interval since 
consuming liquids and the quantity of liquids consumed, and the 
introduction of external contamination during the collection process. A 
special problem unique to B2M sampling is the sensitivity of this 
protein to degradation under acid conditions commonly found in the 
bladder. To minimize this problem, strict adherence to a sampling 
protocol is recommended. The protocol should include provisions for 
normalizing the conditions under which the urine is collected. Clearly, 
it is important to minimize the interval urine spends in the bladder. It 
also is recommended that every effort be made to collect samples during 
the same time of day.
    Collection of urine samples for biological monitoring usually is 
performed using ``spot'' (i.e., single-void) urine. Logistics and sample 
integrity become problems when efforts are made to collect urine over 
extended periods (e.g., 24 hrs). Unless single-void urines are used, 
numerous opportunities exist for measurement error because of poor 
control over sample collection, storage and environmental contamination.
    To minimize the interval that sample urine resides in the bladder, 
the following adaption to the ``spot'' collection procedure is 
recommended: The bladder should be emptied and then a large glass of 
water should be consumed; the sample then should be collected within an 
hour after the water is consumed.

                   5.3.5  Best Achievable Performance

    The best achievable performance is assumed to be equivalent to the 
performance reported by the manufacturers of the Pharmacia Delphia test 
kits (Pharmacia 1990). According to the insert that comes with these 
kits, QC results should be within <plus-minus>2 SDs of the mean for each 
control sample tested; a CV of less than or equal to 5.2% should be 
maintained. The total CV reported for test kits is less than or equal to 
7.2%.

                    5.3.6  General Method Performance

    Unlike analyses for CDB and CDU, the Pharmacia Delphia test is 
standardized in a commercial kit that controls for many sources of 
variation. In the absence of data to the contrary, it is assumed that 
the achievable performance reported by the manufacturer of this test kit 
will serve as an achievable performance objective. The CTQ proficiency 
testing program for B2MU analysis is expected to use the performance 
parameters defined by the test kit manufacturer as the basis of the B2MU 
proficiency testing program.
    Note that results reported for the test kit are expressed in terms 
of <greek-m>g B2M/l of urine, and have not been adjusted for creatinine. 
The indicated performance, therefore, is a measure of the performance of 
the B2M portion of the analyses only, and does not include variation 
that may have been introduced during the analysis of creatinine.

                   5.3.7  Observed B2MU Concentrations

    As indicated in Section 4.3, the concentration of B2MU may serve as 
an early indicator of the onset of kidney damage associated with cadmium 
exposure.

      5.3.7.1  Range of B2MU Concentrations Among Unexposed Samples

    Most of the studies listed in Table 9 report B2MU levels for those 
who were not occupationally exposed to cadmium. Studies noted in the 
second column of this table (which contain the footnote ``d'') reported 
B2MU concentrations among cadmium-exposed workers who, nonetheless, 
showed no signs of proteinuria. These latter studies are included in 
this table because, as indicated in Section 4.3, monitoring B2MU is 
intended to provide advanced warning of the onset of kidney dysfunction 
associated with cadmium exposure, rather than to distinguish relative 
exposure. This table, therefore, indicates the range of B2MU levels 
observed among those who had no symptoms of renal dysfunction (including 
cadmium-exposed workers with none of these symptoms).

                                          Table 9--B-2-Microglobulin Concentrations Observed in Urine Among Those not Occupationally Exposed to Cadmium

    To the extent possible, the studies listed in Table 9 provide 
geometric means and geometric standard deviations for measurements among 
the groups defined in each study. For studies reporting a geometric 
standard deviation along with a mean, the lower and upper 95th 
percentile for these distributions were derived and reported in the 
table.
    The data provided from 15 of the 19 studies listed in Table 9 
indicate that the geometric mean concentration of B2M observed among 
those who were not occupationally exposed to cadmium is 70-170 
<greek-m>g/g CRTU. Data from the 4 remaining studies indicate that 
exposed workers who exhibit no signs of proteinuria show mean B2MU 
levels of 60-300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU. B2MU values in the study by Thun et 
al. (1989), however, appear high in comparison to the other 3 studies. 
If this study is removed, B2MU levels for those who are not 
occupationally exposed to cadmium are similar to B2MU levels found among 
cadmium-exposed workers who exhibit no signs of kidney dysfunction. 
Although the mean is high in the study by Thun et al., the range of 
measurements reported in this study is within the ranges reported for 
the other studies.
    Determining a reasonable upper limit from the range of B2M 
concentrations observed among those who do not exhibit signs of 
proteinuria is problematic. Elevated B2MU levels are among the signs 
used to define the onset of kidney dysfunction. Without access to the 
raw data from the studies listed in Table 9, it is necessary to rely on 
reported standard deviations to estimate an upper limit for normal B2MU 
concentrations (i.e., the upper 95th percentile for the distributions 
measured). For the 8 studies reporting a geometric standard deviation, 
the upper 95th percentiles for the distributions are 180-

[[Page 212]]

1140 <greek-m>g/g CRTU. These values are in general agreement with the 
upper 95th percentile for the distribution (i.e., 631 <greek-m>g/g CRTU) 
reported by Buchet et al. (1980). These upper limits also appear to be 
in general agreement with B2MU values (i.e., 100-690 <greek-m>g/g CRTU) 
reported as the normal upper limit by Iwao et al. (1980), Kawada et al. 
(1989), Wibowo et al. (1982), and Schardun and van Epps (1987). These 
values must be compared to levels reported among those exhibiting kidney 
dysfunction to define a threshold level for kidney dysfunction related 
to cadmium exposure.

       5.3.7.2  Range of B2MU Concentrations Among Exposed Workers

    Table 10 presents results from studies reporting B2MU determinations 
among those occupationally exposed to cadmium in the work place; in some 
of these studies, kidney dysfunction was observed among exposed workers, 
while other studies did not make an effort to distinguish among exposed 
workers based on kidney dysfunction. As with Table 9, this table 
provides geometric means and geometric standard deviations for the 
groups defined in each study if available. For studies reporting a 
geometric standard deviation along with a mean, the lower and upper 95th 
percentiles for the distributions are derived and reported in the table.

    The data provided in Table 10 indicate that the mean B2MU 
concentration observed among workers experiencing occupational exposure 
to cadmium (but with undefined levels of proteinuria) is 160-7400 
<greek-m>g/g CRTU. One of these studies reports geometric means lower 
than this range (i.e., as low as 71 <greek-m>g/g CRTU); an explanation 
for this wide spread in average concentrations is not available.
    Seven of the studies listed in Table 10 report a range of B2MU 
levels among those diagnosed as having renal dysfunction. As indicated 
in this table, renal dysfunction (proteinuria) is defined in several of 
these studies by B2MU levels in excess of 300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU

[[Page 213]]

(see footnote ``c'' of Table 10); therefore, the range of B2MU levels 
observed in these studies is a function of the operational definition 
used to identify those with renal dysfunction. Nevertheless, a B2MU 
level of 300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU appears to be a meaningful threshold for 
identifying those having early signs of kidney damage. While levels much 
higher than 300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU have been observed among those with 
renal dysfunction, the vast majority of those not occupationally exposed 
to cadmium exhibit much lower B2MU concentrations (see Table 9). 
Similarly, the vast majority of workers not exhibiting renal dysfunction 
are found to have levels below 300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU (Table 9).
    The 300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU level for B2MU proposed in the above 
paragraph has support among researchers as the threshold level that 
distinguishes between cadmium-exposed workers with and without kidney 
dysfunction. For example, in the guide for physicians who must evaluate 
cadmium-exposed workers written for the Cadmium Council by Dr. Lauwerys, 
levels of B2M greater than 200-300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU are considered to 
require additional medical evaluation for kidney dysfunction (exhibit 8-
447, OSHA docket H057A). The most widely used test for measuring B2M 
(i.e., the Pharmacia Delphia test) defines B2MU levels above 300 
<greek-m>g/l as abnormal (exhibit L-140-1, OSHA docket H057A).
    Dr. Elinder, chairman of the Department of Nephrology at the 
Karolinska Institute, testified at the hearings on the proposed cadmium 
rule. According to Dr. Elinder (exhibit L-140-45, OSHA docket H057A), 
the normal concentration of B2MU has been well documented (Evrin and 
Wibell 1972; Kjellstrom et al. 1977a; Elinder et al. 1978, 1983; Buchet 
et al. 1980; Jawaid et al. 1983; Kowal and Zirkes, 1983). Elinder stated 
that the upper 95 or 97.5 percentiles for B2MU among those without 
tubular dysfunction is below 300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU (Kjellstrom et al. 
1977a; Buchet et al. 1980; Kowal and Zirkes, 1983). Elinder defined 
levels of B2M above 300 <greek-m>g/g CRTU as ``slight'' proteinuria.

             5.3.8  Conclusions and Recommendations for B2MU

    Based on the above evaluation, the following recommendations are 
made for a B2MU proficiency testing program. Note that the following 
discussion addresses only sampling and analysis for B2MU determinations 
(i.e., to be reported as an unadjusted <greek-m>g B2M/l urine). 
Normalizing this result to creatinine requires a second analysis for 
CRTU (see Section 5.4) so that the ratio of the 2 measurements can be 
obtained.

                       5.3.8.1  Recommended method

    The Pharmacia Delphia method (Pharmacia 1990) should be adopted as 
the standard method for B2MU determinations. Laboratories may adopt 
alternate methods, but it is the responsibility of the laboratory to 
demonstrate that alternate methods provide results of comparable quality 
to the Pharmacia Delphia method.

                    5.3.8.2  Data quality objectives

    The following data quality objectives should facilitate 
interpretation of analytical results, and should be achievable based on 
the above evaluation.
    Limit of Detection. A limit of 100 <greek-m>g/l urine should be 
achievable, although the insert to the test kit (Pharmacia 1990) cites a 
detection limit of 150 <greek-m>g/l; private conversations with 
representatives of Pharmacia, however, indicate that the lower limit of 
100 <greek-m>g/l should be achievable provided an additional standard of 
100 <greek-m>g/l B2M is run with the other standards to derive the 
calibration curve (Section 3.3.1.1). The lower detection limit is 
desirable due to the proximity of this detection limit to B2MU values 
defined for the cadmium medical monitoring program.
    Accuracy. Because results from an interlaboratory proficiency 
testing program are not available currently, it is difficult to define 
an achievable level of accuracy. Given the general performance 
parameters defined by the insert to the test kits, however, an accuracy 
of <plus-minus>15% of the target value appears achievable.
    Due to the low levels of B2MU to be measured generally, it is 
anticipated that the analysis of creatinine will contribute relatively 
little to the overall variability observed among creatinine-normalized 
B2MU levels (see Section 5.4). The initial level of accuracy for 
reporting B2MU levels under this program should be set at 
<plus-minus>15%.
    Precision. Based on precision data reported by Pharmacia (1990), a 
precision value (i.e., CV) of 5% should be achievable over the defined 
range of the analyte. For internal QC samples (i.e., recommended as part 
of an internal QA/QC program, Section 3.3.1), laboratories should attain 
precision near 5% over the range of concentrations measured.

               5.3.8.3  Quality assurance/quality control

    Commercial laboratories providing measurement of B2MU should adopt 
an internal QA/QC program that incorporates the following components: 
Strict adherence to the Pharmacia Delphia method, including calibration 
requirements; regular use of QC samples during routine runs; a protocol 
for corrective actions, and documentation of these actions; and, 
participation in an interlaboratory proficiency program. Procedures that 
may be used to address internal QC requirements are presented in 
Attachment 1. Due to differences between analyses for B2MU and CDB/CDU, 
specific values presented in Attachment 1 may have to be modified. Other

[[Page 214]]

components of the program (including characterization runs), however, 
can be adapted to a program for B2MU.

               5.4  Monitoring Creatinine in Urine (CRTU)

    Because CDU and B2MU should be reported relative to concentrations 
of CRTU, these concentrations should be determined in addition CDU and 
B2MU determinations.

                    5.4.1  Units of CRTU Measurement

    CDU should be reported as <greek-m>g Cd/g CRTU, while B2MU should be 
reported as <greek-m>g B2M/g CRTU. To derive the ratio of cadmium or B2M 
to creatinine, CRTU should be reported in units of g crtn/l of urine. 
Depending on the analytical method, it may be necessary to convert 
results of creatinine determinations accordingly.

            5.4.2  Analytical Techniques Used to Monitor CRTU

    Of the techniques available for CRTU determinations, an absorbance 
spectrophotometric technique and a high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) technique are identified as acceptable in this 
protocol.

            5.4.3  Methods Developed for CRTU Determinations

    CRTU analysise performed in support of either CDU or B2MU 
determinations should be performed using either of the following 2 
methods:
    1. The Du Pont method (i.e., Jaffe method), in which creatinine in a 
sample reacts with picrate under alkaline conditions, and the resulting 
red chromophore is monitored (at 510 nm) for a fixed interval to 
determine the rate of the reaction; this reaction rate is proportional 
to the concentration of creatinine present in the sample (a copy of this 
method is provided in Attachment 2 of this protocol); or,
    2. The OSHA SLC Technical Center (OSLTC) method, in which creatinine 
in an aliquot of sample is separated using an HPLC column equipped with 
a UV detector; the resulting peak is quantified using an electrical 
integrator (a copy of this method is provided in Attachment 3 of this 
protocol).

                  5.4.4  Sample Collection and Handling

    CRTU samples should be segregated from samples collected for CDU or 
B2MU analysis. Sample-collection techniques have been described under 
Section 5.2.4. Samples should be preserved either to stabilize CDU (with 
HNO<INF>3</INF>) or B2MU (with NaOH). Neither of these procedures should 
adversely affect CRTU analysis (see Attachment 3).

                    5.4.5  General Method Performance

    Data from the OSLTC indicate that a CV of 5% should be achievable 
using the OSLTC method (Septon, L private communication). The achievable 
accuracy of this method has not been determined.
    Results reported in surveys conducted by the CAP (CAP 1991a, 1991b 
and 1992) indicate that a CV of 5% is achievable. The accuracy 
achievable for CRTU determinations has not been reported.
    Laboratories performing creatinine analysis under this protocol 
should be CAP accredited and should be active participants in the CAP 
surveys.

                   5.4.6  Observed CRTU Concentrations

    Published data suggest the range of CRTU concentrations is 1.0-1.6 g 
in 24-hour urine samples (Harrison 1987). These values are equivalent to 
about 1 g/l urine.

             5.4.7  Conclusions and Recommendations for CRTU

                       5.4.7.1  Recommended method

    Use either the Jaffe method (Attachment 2) or the OSLTC method 
(Attachment 3). Alternate methods may be acceptable provided adequate 
performance is demonstrated in the CAP program.

                    5.4.7.2  Data quality objectives

    Limit of Detection. This value has not been formally defined; 
however, a value of 0.1 g/l urine should be readily achievable.
    Accuracy. This value has not been defined formally; accuracy should 
be sufficient to retain accreditation from the CAP.
    Precision. A CV of 5% should be achievable using the recommended 
methods.

 Attachment 1: Nonmandatory Protocol for an Internal Quality Assurance/
                         Quality Control Program

    The following is an example of the type of internal quality 
assurance/quality control program that assures adequate control to 
satisfy OSHA requirements under this protocol. However, other approaches 
may also be acceptable.
    As indicated in Section 3.3.1 of the protocol, the QA/QC program for 
CDB and CDU should address, at a minimum, the following:
    <bullet> calibration;
    <bullet> establishment of control limits;
    <bullet> internal QC analyses and maintaining control; and
    <bullet> corrective action protocols.
    This illustrative program includes both initial characterization 
runs to establish the performance of the method and ongoing analysis of 
quality control samples intermixed with compliance samples to maintain 
control.

                               Calibration

    Before any analytical runs are conducted, the analytic instrument 
must be calibrated. This is to be done at the beginning of each day on 
which quality control samples and/or compliance samples are run. Once 
calibration is established, quality control samples or compliance 
samples may be run. Regardless of the type of samples run, every fifth 
sample must be a standard to assure that the calibration is holding.
    Calibration is defined as holding if every standard is within plus 
or minus (<plus-minus>) 15% of its theoretical value. If a standard is 
more than plus or minus 15% of its theoretical value, then the run is 
out of control due to calibration error and the entire set of samples 
must either be reanalyzed after recalibrating or results should be 
recalculated based on a statistical curve derived from the measurement 
of all standards.
    It is essential that the highest standard run is higher than the 
highest sample run. To assure that this is the case, it may be necessary 
to run a high standard at the end of the run, which is selected based on 
the results obtained over the course of the run.
    All standards should be kept fresh, and as they get old, they should 
be compared with new standards and replaced if they exceed the new 
standards by <plus-minus> 15%.

         Initial Characterization Runs and Establishing Control

    A participating laboratory should establish four pools of quality 
control samples for each of the analytes for which determinations will 
be made. The concentrations of quality control samples within each pool 
are to be centered around each of the four target levels for the 
particular analyte identified in Section 4.4 of the protocol.
    Within each pool, at least 4 quality control samples need to be 
established with varying concentrations ranging between plus or minus 
50% of the target value of that pool. Thus for the medium-high cadmium 
in blood pool, the theoretical values of the quality control samples may 
range from 5 to 15 <greek-m>g/l, (the target value is 10 <greek-m>g/l). 
At least 4 unique theoretical values must be represented in this pool.
    The range of theoretical values of plus or minus 50% of the target 
value of a pool means that there will be overlap of the pools. For 
example, the range of values for the medium-low pool for cadmium in 
blood is 3.5 to 10.5 <greek-m>g/l while the range of values for the 
medium-high pool is 5 to 15 <greek-m>g/l. Therefore, it is possible for 
a quality control sample from the medium-low pool to have a higher 
concentration of cadmium than a quality control sample from the medium-
high pool.
    Quality control samples may be obtained as commercially available 
reference materials, internally prepared, or both. Internally prepared 
samples should be well characterized and traced or compared to a 
reference material for which a consensus value for concentration is 
available. Levels of analyte in the quality control samples must be 
concealed from the analyst prior to the reporting of analytical results. 
Potential sources of materials that may be used to construct quality 
control samples are listed in Section 3.3.1 of the protocol.
    Before any compliance samples are analyzed, control limits must be 
established. Control limits should be calculated for every pool of each 
analyte for which determinations will be made and control charts should 
be kept for each pool of each analyte. A separate set of control charts 
and control limits should be established for each analytical instrument 
in a laboratory that will be used for analysis of compliance samples.
    At the beginning of this QA/QC program, control limits should be 
based on the results of the analysis of 20 quality control samples from 
each pool of each analyte. For any given pool, the 20 quality control 
samples should be run on 20 different days. Although no more than one 
sample should be run from

[[Page 219]]

any single pool on a particular day, a laboratory may run quality 
control samples from different pools on the same day. This constitutes a 
set of initial characterization runs.
    For each quality control sample analyzed, the value F/T (defined in 
the glossary) should be calculated. To calculate the control limits for 
a pool of an analyte, it is first necessary to calculate the mean, X, of 
the F/T values for each quality control sample in a pool and then to 
calculate its standard deviation <greek-s>. Thus, for the control limit 
for a pool, X is calculated as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.186

    and <greek-s> is calculated as
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.187
    
    Where N is the number of quality control samples run for a pool.
    The control limit for a particular pool is then given by the mean 
plus or minus 2 standard deviations (X <plus-minus> 3<greek-s>).
    The control limits may be no greater than 40% of the mean F/T value. 
If three standard deviations are greater than 40% of the mean F/T value, 
then analysis of compliance samples may not begin.\1\ Instead, an 
investigation into the causes of the large standard deviation should 
begin, and the inadequacies must be remedied. Then, control limits must 
be reestablished which will mean repeating the running 20 quality 
control samples from each pool over 20 days.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Note that the value,``40%'' may change over time as experience 
is gained with the program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Internal Quality Control Analyses and Maintaining Control

    Once control limits have been established for each pool of an 
analyte, analysis of compliance samples may begin. During any run of 
compliance samples, quality control samples are to be interspersed at a 
rate of no less than 5% of the compliance sample workload. When quality 
control samples are run, however, they should be run in sets consisting 
of one quality control sample from each pool. Therefore, it may be 
necessary, at times, to intersperse quality control samples at a rate 
greater than 5%.
    There should be at least one set of quality control samples run with 
any analysis of compliance samples. At a minimum, for example, 4 quality 
control samples should be run even if only 1 compliance sample is run. 
Generally, the number of quality control samples that should be run are 
a multiple of four with the minimum equal to the smallest multiple of 
four that is greater than 5% of the total number of samples to be run. 
For example, if 300 compliance samples of an analyte are run, then at 
least 16 quality control samples should be run (16 is the smallest 
multiple of four that is greater than 15, which is 5% of 300).
    Control charts for each pool of an analyte (and for each instrument 
in the laboratory to be used for analysis of compliance samples) should 
be established by plotting F/T versus date as the quality control sample 
results are reported. On the graph there should be lines representing 
the control limits for the pool, the mean F/T limits for the pool, and 
the theoretical F/T of 1.000. Lines representing plus or minus 
(<plus-minus>) 2<greek-ss should also be represented on the charts. A 
theoretical example of a control chart is presented in Figure 1.

[[Page 220]]

    All quality control samples should be plotted on the chart, and the 
charts should be checked for visual trends. If a quality control sample 
falls above or below the control limits for its pool, then corrective 
steps must be taken (see the section on corrective actions below). Once 
a laboratory's program has been established, control limits should be 
updated every 2 months.
    The updated control limits should be calculated from the results of 
the last 100 quality control samples run for each pool. If 100 quality 
control samples from a pool have not been run at the time of the update, 
then the limits should be based on as many as have been run provided at 
least 20 quality control samples from each pool have been run over 20 
different days.
    The trends that should be looked for on the control charts are:
    1. 10 consecutive quality control samples falling above or below the 
mean;
    2. 3 consecutive quality control samples falling more than 
2<greek-s> from the mean (above or below the 2<greek-s> lines of the 
chart); or
    3. the mean calculated to update the control limits falls more than 
10% above or below the theoretical mean of 1.000.
    If any of these trends is observed, then all analysis must be 
stopped, and an investigation into the causes of the errors must begin. 
Before the analysis of compliance samples may resume, the inadequacies 
must be remedied and the control limits must be reestablished for that 
pool of an analyte. Reestablishment of control limits will entail 
running 20 sets of quality control samples over 20 days.
    Note that alternative procedures for defining internal quality 
control limits may also be acceptable. Limits may be based, for example, 
on proficiency testing, such as <plus-minus> 1 <greek-m>g or 15% of the 
mean (whichever is greater). These should be clearly defined.

                           Corrective actions

    Corrective action is the term used to describe the identification 
and remediation of errors occurring within an analysis. Corrective 
action is necessary whenever the result of the analysis of any quality 
control sample falls outside of the established control limits. The 
steps involved may include simple things like checking calculations of 
basic instrument maintenance, or it may involve more complicated actions 
like major instrument repair. Whatever the source of error, it must be 
identified and corrected (and a Corrective Action Report (CAR) must be 
completed. CARs should be kept on file by the laboratory.

           Attachment 2--Creatinine in Urine (Jaffe Procedure)

    Intended use: The CREA pack is used in the Du Pont ACA<Register> 
discrete clinical analyzer to quantitatively measure creatinine in serum 
and urine.
    Summary: The CREA method employs a modification of the kinetic Jaffe 
reaction reported by Larsen. This method has been reported to be less 
susceptible than conventional methods to interference from non-
creatinine, Jaffe-positive compounds.\1\
    A split sample comparison between the CREA method and a conventional 
Jaffe procedure on Autoanalyzer<Register> showed a good correlation. 
(See Specific Performance Characteristics).
    * Note: Numbered subscripts refer to the bibliography and lettered 
subscripts refer to footnotes.
    Autoanalyzer,<Register> is a registered trademark of Technicon 
Corp., Tarrytown, NY.
    Principles of Procedure: In the presence of a strong base such as 
NaOH, picrate reacts with creatinine to form a red chromophore. The rate 
of increasing absorbance at 510 nm due to the formation of this 
chromophore during a 17.07-second measurement period is directly 
proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.

                    Known Interfering Substances \3\

    <bullet> Serum Protein Influence--Serum protein levels exert a 
direct influence on the CREA assay. The following should be taken into 
account when this method is used for urine samples and when it is 
calibrated:
    Aqueous creatinine standards or urine specimens will give CREA 
results depressed by approximately 0.7 mg/dL [62 <greek-m>mol/
L]<SUP>d</SUP> and will be less precise than samples containing more 
than 3 g/dL [30 g/L] protein.
    All urine specimens should be diluted with an albumin solution to 
give a final protein concentration of at least 3 g/dL [30 g/L]. Du Pont 
Enzyme Diluent (Cat. #790035-901) may be used for this purpose.
    <bullet> High concentration of endrogenous bilirubin (>20 mg/dL 
[>342 <greek-m>mol/L]) will give depressed CREA results (average 
depression 0.8 mg/dL [71 <greek-m>mol/L]).\4\
    <bullet> Grossly hemolyzed (hemoglobin >100 mg/dL [>62 <greek-m>mol/
L]) or visibly lipemic specimens may cause falsely elevated CREA 
results.<SUP>5,6</SUP>

    h. The preset scale factor (linear term) was derived from the molar 
absorptivity of the indicator and is based on an absorbance to activity 
relationship (sensitivity) of 0.596 (mA/min)/(U/L). Due to small 
differences in filters and electronic components between instruments, 
the actual scale factor (linear term) may differ slightly from that 
given above.
    Quality Control: Two types of quality control procedures are 
recommended:
    <bullet> General Instrument Check. Refer to the Filter Balance 
Procedure and the Absorbance Test Method described in the ACA Analyzer 
Instrument Manual. Refer also to the ABS Test Methodology literature.
    <bullet> Creatinine Method Check. At least once daily run a CREA 
test on a solution of

known creatinine activity such as an assayed control or calibration 
standard other than that used to calibrate the CREA method. For further 
details review the Quality Assurance Section of the Chemistry Manual. 
The result obtained should fall within acceptable limits defined by the 
day-to-day variability of the system as measured in the user's 
laboratory. (See SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS for guidance.) If 
the result falls outside the laboratory's acceptable limits, follow the 
procedure outlined in the Chemistry Troubleshooting Section of the 
Chemistry Manual.

 Attachment 3--Analysis of Creatinine for the Normalization of Cadmium 
   and Beta-2-Microglobulin Concentrations in Urine (OSLTC Procedure).

    Matrix: Urine.
    Target concentration: 1.1 g/L (this amount is representative of 
creatinine concentrations found in urine).
    Procedure: A 1.0 mL aliquot of urine is passed through a C18 SEP-
PAK<SUP></SUP> (Waters Associates). Approximately 30 mL of HPLC (high 
performance liquid chromatography) grade water is then run through the 
SEP-PAK. The resulting solution is diluted to volume in a 100-mL 
volumetric flask and analyzed by HPLC using an ultraviolet (UV) 
detector.
    Special requirements: After collection, samples should be 
appropriately stabilized for cadmium (Cd) analysis by using 10% high 
purity (with low Cd background levels) nitric acid (exactly 1.0 mL of 
10% nitric acid per 10 mL of urine) or stabilized for Beta-2-
Microglobulin (B2M) by taking to pH 7 with dilute NaOH (exactly 1.0 mL 
of 0.11 N NaOH per 10 mL of urine). If not immediately analyzed, the 
samples should be frozen and shipped by overnight mail in an insulated 
container.

                          1. General Discussion

1.1  Background
    1.1.1. History of procedure
    Creatinine has been analyzed by several methods in the past. The 
earliest methods were of the wet chemical type. As an example, 
creatinine reacts with sodium picrate in basic solution to form a red 
complex, which is then analyzed colorimetrically (Refs. 5.1. and 5.2.).
    Since industrial hygiene laboratories will be analyzing for Cd and 
B2M in urine, they will be normalizing those concentrations to the 
concentration of creatinine in urine. A literature search revealed 
several HPLC methods (Refs. 5.3., 5.4., 5.5. and 5.6.) for creatinine in 
urine and because many industrial hygiene laboratories have HPLC 
equipment, it was desirable to develop an industrial hygiene HPLC method 
for creatinine in urine. The method of Hausen, Fuchs, and Wachter was 
chosen as the starting point for method development. SEP-PAKs were used 
for sample clarification and cleanup in this method to protect the 
analytical column. The urine aliquot which has been passed through the 
SEP-PAK is then analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using ion-pair 
techniques.
    This method is very similar to that of Ogata and Taguchi (Ref. 
5.6.), except they used centrifugation for sample clean-up. It is also 
of note that they did a comparison of their HPLC results to those of the 
Jaffe method (a picric acid method commonly used in the health care 
industry) and found a linear relationship of close to 1:1. This 
indicates that either HPLC or colorimetric methods may be used to 
measure creatinine concentrations in urine.
    1.1.2. Physical properties (Ref. 5.7.)

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28OC91.015

1.2. Advantages
    1.2.1. This method offers a simple, straightforward, and specific 
alternative method to the Jaffe method.
    1.2.2. HPLC instrumentation is commonly found in many industrial 
hygiene laboratories.

                    2. Sample stabilization procedure

2.1. Apparatus
    Metal-free plastic container for urine sample.
2.2. Reagents
    2.2.1. Stabilizing Solution--
    (1) Nitric acid (10%, high purity with low Cd background levels) for 
stabilizing urine for Cd analysis or
    (2) NaOH, 0.11 N, for stabilizing urine for B2M analysis.
    2.2.2. HPLC grade water
2.3. Technique
    2.3.1. Stabilizing solution is added to the urine sample (see 
section 2.2.1.). The stabilizing solution should be such that for each 
10 mL of urine, add exactly 1.0 mL of stabilizer solution. (Never add 
water or urine to acid or base. Always add acid or base to water or 
urine.) Exactly 1.0 mL of 0.11 N NaOH added to 10 mL of urine should 
result in a pH of 7. Or add 1.0 mL of 10% nitric acid to 10 mL of urine.
    2.3.2. After sample collection seal the plastic bottle securely and 
wrap it with an appropriate seal. Urine samples should be frozen and 
then shipped by overnight mail (if shipping is necessary) in an 
insulated container. (Do not fill plastic bottle too full. This will 
allow for expansion of contents during the freezing process.)
2.4. The Effect of Preparation and Stabilization Techniques on 
          Creatinine Concentrations
    Three urine samples were prepared by making one sample acidic, not 
treating a second sample, and adjusting a third sample to pH 7. The 
samples were analyzed in duplicate by two different procedures. For the 
first procedure a 1.0 mL aliquot of urine was put in a 100-mL volumetric 
flask, diluted to volume with HPLC grade water, and then analyzed 
directly on an HPLC. The other procedure used SEP-PAKs. The SEP-PAK was 
rinsed with approximately 5 mL of methanol followed by approximately 10 
mL of HPLC grade water and both rinses were discarded. Then, 1.0 mL of 
the urine sample was put through the SEP-PAK, followed by 30 mL of HPLC 
grade water. The urine and water were transferred to a 100-mL volumetric 
flask, diluted to volume with HPLC grade water, and analyzed by HPLC. 
These three urine samples were analyzed on the day they were obtained 
and then frozen. The results show that whether the urine is acidic, 
untreated or adjusted to pH 7, the resulting answer for creatinine is 
essentially unchanged. The purpose of stabilizing the urine by making it 
acidic or neutral is for the analysis of Cd or B2M respectively.

2.5. Storage
    After 4 days and 54 days of storage in a freezer, the samples were 
thawed, brought to room temperature and analyzed using the same 
procedures as in section 2.4. The results of several days of storage 
show that the resulting answer of creatinine is essentially unchanged.

2.6. Interferences
    None.
2.7. Safety precautions
    2.7.1. Make sure samples are properly sealed and frozen before 
shipment to avoid leakage.
    2.7.2. Follow the appropriate shipping procedures.
    The following modified special safety precautions are based on those 
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (Ref. 5.8.). and 
OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogens standard (29 CFR 1910.1039).
    2.7.3. Wear gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses while handling all 
human urine products. Disposable plastic, glass, and paper (pipet tips, 
gloves, etc.) that contact urine should be placed in a biohazard 
autoclave bag. These bags should be kept in appropriate containers until 
sealed and autoclaved. Wipe down all work surfaces with 10% sodium 
hypochlorite solution when work is finished.
    2.7.4. Dispose of all biological samples and diluted specimens in a 
biohazard autoclave bag at the end of the analytical run.
    2.7.5. Special care should be taken when handling and dispensing 
nitric acid. Always remember to add acid to water (or urine). Nitric 
acid is a corrosive chemical capable of severe eye and skin damage. Wear 
metal-free gloves, a lab coat, and safety glasses. If the nitric acid 
comes in contact with any part of the body, quickly wash with copious 
quantities of water for at least 15 minutes.
    2.7.6. Special care should be taken when handling and dispensing 
NaOH. Always remember to add base to water (or urine). NaOH can cause 
severe eye and skin damage. Always wear the appropriate gloves, a lab 
coat, and safety glasses. If the NaOH comes in contact with any part of 
the body, quickly wash with copious quantities of water for at least 15 
minutes.

                         3. Analytical procedure

3.1. Apparatus
    3.1.1. A high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with pump, 
sample injector and UV detector.
    3.1.2. A C18 HPLC column; 25 cm x 4.6 mm I.D.
    3.1.3. An electronic integrator, or some other suitable means of 
determining analyte response.
    3.1.4. Stripchart recorder.
    3.1.5. C18 SEP-PAKs (Waters Associates) or equivalent.
    3.1.6. Luer-lock syringe for sample preparation (5 mL or 10 mL).
    3.1.7. Volumetric pipettes and flasks for standard and sample 
preparation.
    3.1.8. Vacuum system to aid sample preparation (optional).
3.2. Reagents
    3.2.1. Water, HPLC grade.
    3.2.2. Methanol, HPLC grade.
    3.2.3. PIC B-7<SUP></SUP> (Waters Associates) in small vials.
    3.2.4. Creatinine, anhydrous, Sigma hemical Corp., purity not 
listed.
    3.2.5. 1-Heptanesulfonic acid, sodium salt monohydrate.
    3.2.6. Phosphoric acid.
    3.2.7. Mobile phase. It can be prepared by mixing one vial of PIC B-
7 into a 1 L solution of 50% methanol and 50% water. The mobile phase 
can also be made by preparing a solution that is 50% methanol and 50% 
water with 0.005M heptanesulfonic acid and adjusting the pH of the 
solution to 3.5 with phosphoric acid.
3.3. Standard preparation
    3.3.1. Stock standards are prepared by weighing 10 to 15 mg of 
creatinine. This is transferred to a 25-mL volumetric flask and diluted 
to volume with HPLC grade water.

[[Page 227]]

    3.3.2. Dilutions to a working range of 3 to 35 <greek-m>g/mL are 
made in either HPLC grade water or HPLC mobile phase (standards give the 
same detector response in either solution).
3.4. Sample preparation
    3.4.1. The C18 SEP-PAK is connected to a Luer-lock syringe. It is 
rinsed with 5 mL HPLC grade methanol and then 10 mL of HPLC grade water. 
These rinses are discarded.
    3.4.2. Exactly 1.0 mL of urine is pipetted into the syringe. The 
urine is put through the SEP-PAK into a suitable container using a 
vacuum system.
    3.4.3. The walls of the syringe are rinsed in several stages with a 
total of approximately 30 mL of HPLC grade water. These rinses are put 
through the SEP-PAK into the same container. The resulting solution is 
transferred to a 100-mL volumetric flask and then brought to volume with 
HPLC grade water.
3.5. Analysis (conditions and hardware are those used in this 
          evaluation.)
    3.5.1. Instrument conditions

    Column: Zorbax<SUP></SUP> ODS, 5-6 <greek-m>m particle size; 25 cm 
x 4.6 mm I.D.
    Mobile phase: See Section 3.2.7.
    Detector: Dual wavelength UV; 229 nm (primary) 254 nm (secondary)
    Flow rate: 0.7 mL/ minute
    Retention time: 7.2 minutes
    Sensitivity: 0.05 AUFS
    Injection volume: 20<greek-m>l

    3.5.2. Chromatogram (see Figure #2)

[[Page 228]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28OC91.016

3.6. Interferences
    3.6.1. Any compound that has the same retention time as creatinine 
and absorbs at 229 nm is an interference.
    3.6.2. HPLC conditions may be varied to circumvent interferences. In 
addition, analysis at another UV wavelength (i.e. 254 nm) would allow a 
comparison of the ratio of response of a standard to that of a sample. 
Any deviations would indicate an interference.
3.7. Calculations

[[Page 229]]

    3.7.1. A calibration curve is constructed by plotting detector 
response versus standard concentration (See Figure #3).
    3.7.2. The concentration of creatinine in a sample is determined by 
finding the concentration corresponding to its detector response. (See 
Figure <SUP><greek-i></SUP>3).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28OC91.017


[[Page 230]]


    3.7.3. The <greek-m>g/mL creatinine from section 3.7.2. is then 
multiplied by 100 (the dilution factor). This value is equivalent to the 
micrograms of creatinine in the 1.0 mL stabilized urine aliquot or the 
milligrams of creatinine per liter of urine. The desired units, g/L, is 
determined by the following relationship:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.190

    3.7.4. The resulting value for creatinine is used to normalize the 
urinary concentration of the desired analyte (A) (Cd or B2M) by using 
the following formula.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.191

Where A is the desired analyte. The protocol of reporting such 
normalized results is <greek-m>g A/g creatinine.

                3.8. Safety precautions See section 2.7.

                             4. Conclusions

    The determination of creatinine in urine by HPLC is a good 
alternative to the Jaffe method for industrial hygiene laboratories. 
Sample clarification with SEP-PAKs did not change the amount of 
creatinine found in urine samples. However, it does protect the 
analytical column. The results of this creatinine in urine procedure are 
unaffected by the pH of the urine sample under the conditions tested by 
this procedure. Therefore, no special measures are required for 
creatinine analysis whether the urine sample has been stabilized with 
10% nitric acid for the Cd analysis or brought to a pH of 7 with 0.11 N 
NaOH for the B2M analysis.

    Director means the Director of the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, or designee.
    Emergency means any occurrence such as, but not limited to, 
equipment failure, rupture of containers, or failure of control 
equipment which may or does result in an unexpected significant release 
of benzene.
    Employee exposure means exposure to airborne benzene which would 
occur if the employee were not using respiratory protective equipment.
    Regulated area means any area where airborne concentrations of 
benzene exceed or can reasonably be expected to exceed, the permissible 
exposure limits, either the 8-hour time weighted average exposure of 1 
ppm or the short-term exposure limit of 5 ppm for 15 minutes.
    Vapor control system means any equipment used for containing the 
total vapors displaced during the loading of gasoline, motor fuel or 
other fuel tank trucks and the displacing of these vapors through a 
vapor processing system or balancing the vapor with the storage tank. 
This equipment also includes systems containing the vapors displaced 
from the storage tank during the unloading of the tank truck which 
balance the vapors back to the tank truck.
    (c) Permissible exposure limits (PELs)--(1) Time-weighted average 
limit (TWA). The employer shall assure that no employee is exposed to an 
airborne concentration of benzene in excess of one part of benzene per 
million parts of air (1 ppm) as an 8-hour time-weighted average.

[[Page 232]]

    (2) Short-term exposure limit (STEL). The employer shall assure that 
no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of benzene in excess 
of five (5) ppm as averaged over any 15 minute period.
    (d) Regulated areas. (1) The employer shall establish a regulated 
area wherever the airborne concentration of benzene exceeds or can 
reasonably be expected to exceed the permissible exposure limits, either 
the 8-hour time weighted average exposure of 1 ppm or the short-term 
exposure limit of 5 ppm for 15 minutes.
    (2) Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons.
    (3) Regulated areas shall be determined from the rest of the 
workplace in any manner that minimizes the number of employees exposed 
to benzene within the regulated area.
    (e) Exposure monitoring--(1) General. (i) Determinations of employee 
exposure shall be made from breathing zone air samples that are 
representative of each employee's average exposure to airborne benzene.
    (ii) Representative 8-hour TWA employee exposures shall be 
determined on the basis of one sample or samples representing the full 
shift exposure for each job classification in each work area.
    (iii) Determinations of compliance with the STEL shall be made from 
15 minute employee breathing zone samples measured at operations where 
there is reason to believe exposures are high, such as where tanks are 
opened, filled, unloaded or gauged; where containers or process 
equipment are opened and where benzene is used for cleaning or as a 
solvent in an uncontrolled situation. The employer may use objective 
data, such as measurements from brief period measuring devices, to 
determine where STEL monitoring is needed.
    (iv) Except for initial monitoring as required under paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section, where the employer can document that one shift 
will consistently have higher employee exposures for an operation, the 
employer shall only be required to determine representative employee 
exposure for that operation during the shift on which the highest 
exposure is expected.
    (2) Initial monitoring. (i) Each employer who has a place of 
employment covered under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall monitor 
each of these workplaces and work operations to determine accurately the 
airborne concentrations of benzene to which employees may be exposed.
    (ii) The initial monitoring required under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of 
this section shall be completed by 60 days after the effective date of 
this standard or within 30 days of the introduction of benzene into the 
workplace. Where the employer has monitored within one year prior to the 
effective date of this standard and the monitoring satisfies all other 
requirements of this section, the employer may rely on such earlier 
monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of 
this section.
    (3) Periodic monitoring and monitoring frequency. (i) If the 
monitoring required by paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section reveals 
employee exposure at or above the action level but at or below the TWA, 
the employer shall repeat such monitoring for each such employee at 
least every year.
    (ii) If the monitoring required by paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section reveals employee exposure above the TWA, the employer shall 
repeat such monitoring for each such employee at least every six (6) 
months.
    (iii) The employer may alter the monitoring schedule from every six 
months to annually for any employee for whom two consecutive 
measurements taken at least 7 days apart indicate that the employee 
exposure has decreased to the TWA or below, but is at or above the 
action level.
    (iv) Monitoring for the STEL shall be repeated as necessary to 
evaluate exposures of employees subject to short term exposures.
    (4) Termination of monitoring. (i) If the initial monitoring 
required by paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section reveals employee 
exposure to be below the action level the employer may discontinue the 
monitoring for that employee, except as otherwise required by paragraph 
(e)(5) of this section.
    (ii) If the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section reveals that employee exposures,

[[Page 233]]

as indicated by at least two consecutive measurements taken at least 7 
days apart, are below the action level the employer may discontinue the 
monitoring for that employee, except as otherwise required by paragraph 
(e)(5).
    (5) Additional monitoring. (i) The employer shall institute the 
exposure monitoring required under paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this 
section when there has been a change in the production, process, control 
equipment, personnel or work practices which may result in new or 
additional exposures to benzene, or when the employer has any reason to 
suspect a change which may result in new or additional exposures.
    (ii) Whenever spills, leaks, ruptures or other breakdowns occur that 
may lead to employee exposure, the employer shall monitor (using area or 
personal sampling) after the cleanup of the spill or repair of the leak, 
rupture or other breakdown to ensure that exposures have returned to the 
level that existed prior to the incident.
    (6) Accuracy of monitoring. Monitoring shall be accurate, to a 
confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for 
airborne concentrations of benzene.
    (7) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) The employer 
shall, within 15 working days after the receipt of the results of any 
monitoring performed under this standard, notify each employee of these 
results in writing either individually or by posting of results in an 
appropriate location that is accessible to affected employees.
    (ii) Whenever the PELs are exceeded, the written notification 
required by paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section shall contain the 
corrective action being taken by the employer to reduce the employee 
exposure to or below the PEL, or shall refer to a document available to 
the employee which states the corrective actions to be taken.
    (f) Methods of compliance--(1) Engineering controls and work 
practices. (i) The employer shall institute engineering controls and 
work practices to reduce and maintain employee exposure to benzene at or 
below the permissible exposure limits, except to the extent that the 
employer can establish that these controls are not feasible or where the 
provisions of paragraph (f)(1)(iii) or (g)(1) of this section apply.
    (ii) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work practices 
which can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure 
to or below the PELs, the employer shall use them to reduce employee 
exposure to the lowest levels achievable by these controls and shall 
supplement them by the use of respiratory protection which complies with 
the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (iii) Where the employer can document that benzene is used in a 
workplace less than a total of 30 days per year, the employer shall use 
engineering controls, work practice controls or respiratory protection 
or any combination of these controls to reduce employee exposure to 
benzene to or below the PELs, except that employers shall use 
engineering and work practice controls, if feasible, to reduce exposure 
to or below 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.
    (2) Compliance program. (i) When any exposures are over the PEL, the 
employer shall establish and implement a written program to reduce 
employee exposure to or below the PEL primarily by means of engineering 
and work practice controls, as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section.
    (ii) The written program shall include a schedule for development 
and implementation of the engineering and work practice controls. These 
plans shall be reviewed and revised as appropriate based on the most 
recent exposure monitoring data, to reflect the current status of the 
program.
    (iii) Written compliance programs shall be furnished upon request 
for examination and copying to the Assistant Secretary, the Director, 
affected employees and designated employee representatives.
    (g) Respiratory protection--(1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering 
and work-practice controls.
    (ii) Work operations for which the employer establishes that 
compliance

[[Page 234]]

with either the TWA or STEL through the use of engineering and work-
practice controls is not feasible; for example, some maintenance and 
repair activities, vessel cleaning, or other operations for which 
engineering and work-practice controls are infeasible because exposures 
are intermittent and limited in duration.
    (iii) Work operations for which feasible engineering and work-
practice controls are not yet sufficient, or are not required under 
paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, to reduce employee exposure to or

then the blood count shall be repeated within 2 weeks.
    (A) The hemoglobin level or the hematocrit falls below the normal 
limit [outside the 95% confidence interval (C.I.)] as determined by the 
laboratory for the particular geographic area and/or these indices show 
a persistent downward trend from the individual's pre-exposure norms; 
provided these findings cannot be explained by other medical reasons.
    (B) The thrombocyte (platelet) count varies more than 20 percent 
below the employee's most recent values or falls outside the normal 
limit (95% C.I.) as determined by the laboratory.
    (C) The leukocyte count is below 4,000 per mm\3\ or there is an 
abnormal differential count.
    (ii) If the abnormality persists, the examining physician shall 
refer the employee to a hematologist or an internist for further 
evaluation unless the physician has good reason to believe such referral 
is unnecessary. (See Appendix C for examples of conditions where a 
referral may be unnecessary.)
    (iii) The employer shall provide the hematologist or internist with

examination. The written opinion shall be limited to the following 
information:
    (A) The occupationally pertinent results of the medical examination 
and tests;
    (B) The physician's opinion concerning whether the employee has any 
detected medical conditions which would place the employee's health at 
greater than normal risk of material impairment from exposure to 
benzene;
    (C) The physician's recommended limitations upon the employee's 
exposure to benzene or upon the employee's use of protective clothing or 
equipment and respirators.
    (D) A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician 
of the results of the medical examination and any medical conditions 
resulting from benzene exposure which require further explanation or 
treatment.
    (ii) The written opinion obtained by the employer shall not reveal 
specific records, findings and diagnoses that have no bearing on the

[[Page 237]]

    (8) Medical removal plan. (i) When a physician makes a referral to a 
hematologist/internist as required under paragraph (i)(5)(ii) of this 
section, the employee shall be removed from areas where exposures may 
exceed the action level until such time as the physician makes a 
determination under paragraph (i)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Following the examination and evaluation by the hematologist/
internist, a decision to remove an employee from areas where benzene 
exposure is above the action level or to allow the employee to return to 
areas where benzene exposure is above the action level shall be made by 
the physician in consultation with the hematologist/internist. This 
decision shall be communicated in writing to the employer and employee. 
In the case of removal, the physician shall state the required probable 
duration of removal from occupational exposure to benzene above the 
action level and the requirements for future medical examinations to 
review the decision.
    (iii) For any employee who is removed pursuant to paragraph 
(i)(8)(ii) of this section, the employer shall provide a follow-up 
examination. The physician, in consultation with the hematologist/
internist, shall make a decision within 6 months of the date the 
employee was removed as to whether the employee shall be returned to the 
usual job or whether the employee should be removed permanently.
    (iv) Whenever an employee is temporarily removed from benzene 
exposure pursuant to paragraph (i)(8)(i) or (i)(8)(ii) of this section, 
the employer shall transfer the employee to a comparable job for which 
the employee is qualified (or can be trained for in a short period) and 
where benzene exposures are as low as possible, but in no event higher 
than the action level. The employer shall maintain the employee's 
current wage rate, seniority and other benefits. If there is no such job 
available, the employer shall provide medical removal protection 
benefits until such a job becomes available or for 6 months, whichever 
comes first.
    (v) Whenever an employee is removed permanently from benzene 
exposure based on a physician's recommendation pursuant to paragraph 
(i)(8)(iii) of this section, the employee shall be given the opportunity 
to transfer to another position which is available or later becomes 
available for which the employee is qualified (or can be trained for in 
a short period) and where benzene exposures are as low as possible but 
in no event higher than the action level. The employer shall assure that 
such employee suffers no reduction in current wage rate, seniority or 
other benefits as a result of the transfer.
    (9) Medical removal protection benefits. (i) The employer shall 
provide to an employee 6 months of medical removal protection benefits 
immediately following each occasion an employee is removed from exposure 
to benzene because of hematological findings pursuant to paragraphs 
(i)(8) (i) and (ii) of this section, unless the employee has been 
transferred to a comparable job where benzene exposures are below the 
action level.
    (ii) For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an 
employer provide medical removal protection benefits means that the 
employer shall maintain the current wage rate, seniority and other 
benefits of an employee as though the employee had not been removed.
    (iii) The employer's obligation to provide medical removal 
protection benefits to a removed employee shall be reduced to the extent 
that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost during the 
period of removal either from a publicly or employer-funded compensation 
program, or from employment with another employer made possible by 
virtue of the employee's removal.
    (j) Communication of benzene hazards to employees--(1) Signs and 
labels. (i) The employer shall post signs at entrances to regulated

   Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1028--Substance Safety Data Sheet, Benzene

                       I. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: Benzene.
    B. Permissible Exposure: Except as to the use of gasoline, motor 
fuels and other fuels subsequent to discharge from bulk terminals and 
other exemptions specified in Sec. 1910.1028(a)(2):
    1. Airborne: The maximum time-weighted average (TWA) exposure limit 
is 1 part of benzene vapor per million parts of air (1 ppm) for an 8-
hour workday and the maximum short-term exposure limit (STEL) is 5 ppm 
for any 15-minute period.
    2. Dermal: Eye contact shall be prevented and skin contact with 
liquid benzene shall be limited.
    C. Appearance and odor: Benzene is a clear, colorless liquid with a 
pleasant, sweet odor. The odor of benzene does not provide adequate 
warning of its hazard.

                         II. Health Hazard Data

    A. Ways in which benzene affects your health. Benzene can affect 
your health if you inhale it, or if it comes in contact with your skin 
or eyes. Benzene is also harmful if you happen to swallow it.
    B. Effects of overexposure. 1. Short-term (acute) overexposure: If 
you are overexposed to high concentrations of benzene, well above the 
levels where its odor is first recognizable, you may feel breathless, 
irritable, euphoric, or giddy; you may experience irritation in eyes, 
nose, and respiratory tract.

[[Page 240]]

You may develop a headache, feel dizzy, nauseated, or intoxicated. 
Severe exposures may lead to convulsions and loss of consciousness.
    2. Long-term (chronic) exposure. Repeated or prolonged exposure to 
benzene, even at relatively low concentrations, may result in various 
blood disorders, ranging from anemia to leukemia, an irreversible, fatal 
disease. Many blood disorders associated with benzene exposure may occur 
without symptoms.

                 III. Protective Clothing and Equipment

    A. Respirators. Respirators are required for those operations in 
which engineering controls or work practice controls are not feasible to 
reduce exposure to the permissible level. However, where employers can 
document that benzene is present in the workplace less than 30 days a 
year, respirators may be used in lieu of engineering controls. If 
respirators are worn, they must have joint Mine Safety and Health 
Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH) seal of approval, and cartridge or canisters must be 
replaced before the end of their service life, or the end of the shift, 
whichever occurs first. If you experience difficulty breathing while 
wearing a respirator, you may request a positive pressure respirator 
from your employer. You must be thoroughly trained to use the assigned 
respirator, and the training will be provided by your employer.
    B. Protective Clothing. You must wear appropriate protective 
clothing (such as boots, gloves, sleeves, aprons, etc.) over any parts 
of your body that could be exposed to liquid benzene.
    C. Eye and Face Protection. You must wear splash-proof safety 
goggles if it is possible that benzene may get into your eyes. In 
addition, you must wear a face shield if your face could be splashed 
with benzene liquid.

                 IV. Emergency and First Aid Procedures

    A. Eye and face exposure. If benzene is splashed in your eyes, wash 
it out immediately with large amounts of water. If irritation persists 
or vision appears to be affected see a doctor as soon as possible.
    B. Skin exposure. If benzene is spilled on your clothing or skin, 
remove the contaminated clothing and wash the exposed skin with large 
amounts of water and soap immediately. Wash contaminated clothing before 
you wear it again.
    C. Breathing. If you or any other person breathes in large amounts 
of benzene, get the exposed person to fresh air at once. Apply 
artificial respiration if breathing has stopped. Call for medical 
assistance or a doctor as soon as possible. Never enter any vessel or 
confined space where the benzene concentration might be high without 
proper safety equipment and at least one other person present who will 
stay outside. A life line should be used.
    D. Swallowing. If benzene has been swallowed and the patient is 
conscious, do not induce vomiting. Call for medical assistance or a 
doctor immediately.

                         V. Medical Requirements

    If you are exposed to benzene at a concentration at or above 0.5 ppm 
as an 8-hour time-weighted average, or have been exposed at or above 10 
ppm in the past while employed by your current employer, your employer 
is required to provide a medical examination and history and laboratory 
tests within 60 days of the effective date of this standard and annually 
thereafter. These tests shall be provided without cost to you. In 
addition, if you are accidentally exposed to benzene (either by 
ingestion, inhalation, or skin/eye contact) under emergency conditions 
known or suspected to constitute toxic exposure to benzene, your 
employer is required to make special laboratory tests available to you.

                      VI. Observation of Monitoring

    Your employer is required to perform measurements that are 
representative of your exposure to benzene and you or your designated 
representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are 
entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to 
record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking 
place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and 
equipment are required to be worn, you or your representative must also 
be provided with, and must wear the protective clothing and equipment.

                         VII. Access to Records

    You or your representative are entitled to see the records of 
measurements of your exposure to benzene upon written request to your 
employer. Your medical examination records can be furnished to yourself, 
your physician or designated representative upon request by you to your 
employer.

          VIII. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling and Storage

    Benzene liquid is highly flammable. It should be stored in tightly 
closed containers in a cool, well ventilated area. Benzene vapor may 
form explosive mixtures in air. All sources of ignition must be 
controlled. Use nonsparking tools when opening or closing benzene 
containers. Fire extinguishers, where provided, must be readily 
available. Know where they are located and how to operate them. Smoking 
is prohibited in areas where benzene is used or stored. Ask your 
supervisor where benzene is used in your area and for additional plant 
safety rules.

             II. Fire, Explosion, and Reactivity Hazard Data

    A. Fire.
    1. Flash Point (closed cup): -11  deg. C (12  deg. F)
    2. Autoignition Temperature: 580  deg. C (1076  deg. F)
    3. Flammable limits in Air. % by Volume: Lower: 1.3%, Upper: 7.5%
    4. Extinguishing Media: Carbon dioxide, dry chemical, or foam.
    5. Special Fire-Fighting procedures: Do not use solid stream of 
water, since stream will scatter and spread fire. Fine water spray can 
be used to keep fire-exposed containers cool.
    6. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: Benzene is a flammable 
liquid. Its vapors can form explosive mixtures. All ignition sources 
must be controlled when benzene is used, handled, or stored. Where 
liquid or vapor may be released, such areas shall be considered as 
hazardous locations. Benzene vapors are heavier than air; thus the 
vapors may travel along the ground and be ignited by open flames or 
sparks at locations remote from the site at which benzene is handled.
    7. Benzene is classified as a 1 B flammable liquid for the purpose 
of conforming to the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.106. A concentration 
exceeding 3,250 ppm is considered a potential fire explosion hazard. 
Locations where benzene may be present in quantities sufficient to 
produce explosive or ignitable mixtures are considered Class I Group D 
for the purposes of conforming to the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.309.
    B. Reactivity.
    1. Conditions contributing to instability: Heat.
    2. Incompatibility: Heat and oxidizing materials.
    3. Hazardous decomposition products: Toxic gases and vapors (such as 
carbon monoxide).

                     III. Spill and Leak Procedures

    A. Steps to be taken if the material is released or spilled. As much 
benzene as possible should be absorbed with suitable materials, such as 
dry sand or earth. That remaining must be flushed with large amounts of 
water. Do not flush benzene into a confined space, such as a sewer, 
because of explosion danger. Remove all ignition sources. Ventilate 
enclosed places.
    B. Waste disposal method. Disposal methods must conform to other 
jurisdictional regulations. If allowed, benzene may be disposed of: (a) 
By absorbing it in dry sand or earth and disposing in a sanitary 
landfill; (b) if small quantities, by removing it to a safe location 
from buildings or other combustible sources, pouring it in dry sand or 
earth and cautiously igniting it; and (c) if large quantities, by 
atomizing it in a suitable combustion chamber.

                      IV. Miscellaneous Precautions

    A. High exposure to benzene can occur when transferring the liquid 
from one container to another. Such operations should be well ventilated 
and good work practices must be established to avoid spills.
    B. Use non-sparking tools to open benzene containers which are 
effectively grounded and bonded prior to opening and pouring.
    C. Employers must advise employees of all plant areas and operations 
where exposure to benzene could occur. Common operations in which high 
exposures to benzene may be encountered are: the primary production and 
utilization of benzene, and transfer of benzene.

   Appendix C to Sec. 1910.1028--Medical Surveillance Guidelines for 
                                 Benzene

                            I. Route of Entry

    Inhalation; skin absorption.

                             II. Toxicology

    Benzene is primarily an inhalation hazard. Systemic absorption may 
cause depression of the hematopoietic system, pancytopenia, aplastic 
anemia, and leukemia. Inhalation of high concentrations can affect 
central nervous system function. Aspiration of small amounts of liquid 
benzene immediately causes pulmonary edema and hemorrhage of pulmonary 
tissue. There is some absorption through the skin. Absorption may be 
more rapid in the case of abraded skin, and benzene may be more readily 
absorbed if it is present in a mixture or as a contaminant in solvents 
which are readily absorbed. The defatting action of benzene may produce 
primary irritation due to repeated or prolonged

[[Page 242]]

contact with the skin. High concentration are irritating to the eyes and 
the mucuous membranes of the nose, and respiratory tract.

                         III. Signs and Symptoms

    Direct skin contact with benzene may cause erythema. Repeated or 
prolonged contact may result in drying, scaling dermatitis, or 
development of secondary skin infections. In addition, there is benzene 
absorption through the skin. Local effects of benzene vapor or liquid on 
the eye are slight. Only at very high concentrations is there any 
smarting sensation in the eye. Inhalation of high concentrations of 
benzene may have an initial stimulatory effect on the central nervous 
system characterized by exhilaration, nervous excitation, and/or 
giddiness, followed by a period of depression, drowsiness, or fatigue. A 
sensation of tightness in the chest accompanied by breathlessness may 
occur and ultimately the victim may lose consciousness. Tremors, 
convulsions and death may follow from respiratory paralysis or 
circulatory collapse in a few minutes to several hours following severe 
exposures.
    The detrimental effect on the blood-forming system of prolonged 
exposure to small quantities of benzene vapor is of extreme importance. 
The hematopoietic system is the chief target for benzene's toxic effects 
which are manifested by alterations in the levels of formed elements in 
the peripheral blood. These effects have occurred at concentrations of 
benzene which may not cause irritation of mucous membranes, or any 
unpleasant sensory effects. Early signs and symptoms of benzene 
morbidity are varied, often not readily noticed and non-specific. 
Subjective complaints of headache, dizziness, and loss of appetite may 
precede or follow clinical signs. Rapid pulse and low blood pressure, in 
addition to a physical appearance of anemia, may accompany a subjective 
complaint of shortness of breath and excessive tiredness. Bleeding from 
the nose, gums, or mucous membranes, and the development of purpuric 
spots (small bruises) may occur as the condition progresses. Clinical 
evidence of leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, singly or in 
combination, has been frequently reported among the first signs.
    Bone marrow may appear normal, aplastic, or hyperplastic, and may 
not, in all situations, correlate with peripheral blood forming tissues. 
Because of variations in the susceptibility to benzene morbidity, there 
is no ``typical'' blood picture. The onset of effects of prolonged 
benzene exposure may be delayed for many months or years after the 
actual exposure has ceased and identification or correlation with 
benzene exposure must be sought out in the occupational history.

                  IV. Treatment of Acute Toxic Effects

    Remove from exposure immediately. Make sure you are adequately 
protected and do not risk being overcome by fumes. Give oxygen or 
artificial resuscitation if indicated. Flush eyes, wash skin if 
contaminated and remove all contaminated clothing. Symptoms of 
intoxication may persist following severe exposures. Recovery from mild 
exposures is usually rapid and complete.

              V. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations

                               A. General

    The principal effects of benzene exposure which form the basis for 
this regulation are pathological changes in the hematopoietic system, 
reflected by changes in the peripheral blood and manifesting clinically 
as pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, and leukemia. Consequently, the 
medical surveillance program is designed to observe, on a regular basis, 
blood indices for early signs of these effects, and although early signs 
of leukemia are not usually available, emerging diagnostic technology 
and innovative regimes make consistent surveillance for leukemia, as 
well as other hematopoietic effects, essential.
    Initial examinations are to be provided within 60 days of the 
effective date of this standard, or at the time of initial assignment, 
and periodic examinations annually thereafter. There are special 
provisions for medical tests in the event of hematologic abnormalities 
or for emergency situations.
    The blood values which require referral to a hematologist or 
internist are noted in the standard in paragraph (i)(5). The standard 
specifies that blood abnormalities that persist must be referred 
``unless the physician has good reason to believe such referral is 
unnecessary'' (paragraph (i)(5)). Examples of conditions that could make 
a referral unnecessary despite abnormal blood limits are iron or folate 
deficiency, menorrhagia, or blood loss due to some unrelated medical 
abnormality.
    Symptoms and signs of benzene toxicity can be non-specific. Only a 
detailed history and appropriate investigative procedures will enable a 
physician to rule out or confirm conditions that place the employee at 
increased risk. To assist the examining physician with regard to which 
laboratory tests are necessary and when to refer an employee to the 
specialist, OSHA has established the following guidelines.

                        B. Hematology Guidelines

    A minimum battery of tests is to be performed by strictly 
standardized methods.
    1. Red cell, white cell, platelet counts, white blood cell 
differential, hematacrit and

[[Page 243]]

red cell indices must be performed by an accredited laboratory. The 
normal ranges for the red cell and white cell counts are influenced by 
altitude, race, and sex, and therefore should be determined by the 
accredited laboratory in the specific area where the tests are 
performed.
    Either a decline from an absolute normal or an individual's base 
line to a subnormal value or a rise to a supra-normal value, are 
indicative of potential toxicity, particularly if all blood parameters 
decline. The normal total white blood count is approximately 7,200/mm 
\3\ plus or minus 3,000. For cigarette smokers the white count may be 
higher and the upper range may be 2,000 cells higher than normal for the 
laboratory. In addition, infection, allergies and some drugs may raise 
the white cell count. The normal platelet count is approximately 250,000 
with a range of 140,000 to 400,000. Counts outside this range should be 
regarded as possible evidence of benzene toxicity.
    Certain abnormalities found through routine screening are of greater 
significance in the benzene-exposed worker and require prompt 
consultation with a specialist, namely:
    a. Thrombocytopenia.
    b. A trend of decreasing white cell, red cell, or platelet indices 
in an individual over time is more worrisome than an isolated abnormal 
finding at one test time. The importance of trend highlights the need to 
compare an individual's test results to baseline and/or previous 
periodic tests.
    c. A constellation or pattern of abnormalities in the different 
blood indices is of more significance than a single abnormality. A low 
white count not associated with any abnormalities in other cell indices 
may be a normal statistical variation, whereas if the low white count is 
accompanied by decreases in the platelet and/or red cell indices, such a 
pattern is more likely to be associated with benzene toxicity and merits 
thorough investigation.
    Anemia, leukopenia, macrocytosis or an abnormal differential white 
blood cell count should alert the physician to further investigate and/
or refer the patient if repeat tests confirm the abnormalities. If 
routine screening detects an abnormality, follow-up tests which may be 
helpful in establishing the etiology of the abnormality are the 
peripheral blood smear and the reticulocyte count.
    The extreme range of normal for reticulocytes is 0.4 to 2.5 percent 
of the red cells, the usual range being 0.5 to 1.2 percent of the red 
cells, but the typical value is in the range of 0.8 to 1.0 percent. A 
decline in reticulocytes to levels of less than 0.4 percent is to be 
regarded as possible evidence (unless another specific cause is found) 
of benzene toxicity requiring accelerated surveillance. An increase in 
reticulocyte levels to about 2.5 percent may also be consistent with 
(but is not as characteristic of) benzene toxicity.
    2. An important diagnostic test is a careful examination of the 
peripheral blood smear. As with reticulocyte count the smear should be 
with fresh uncoagulated blood obtained from a needle tip following 
venipuncture or from a drop of earlobe blood (capillary blood). If 
necessary, the smear may, under certain limited conditions, be made from 
a blood sample anticoagulated with EDTA (but never with oxalate or 
heparin). When the smear is to be prepared from a specimen of venous 
blood which has been collected by a commercial Vacutainer <Register> 
type tube containing neutral EDTA, the smear should be made as soon as 
possible after the venesection. A delay of up to 12 hours is permissible 
between the drawing of the blood specimen into EDTA and the preparation 
of the smear if the blood is stored at refrigerator (not freezing) 
temperature.
    3. The minimum mandatory observations to be made from the smear are:
    a. The differential white blood cell count.
    b. Description of abnormalities in the appearance of red cells.
    c. Description of any abnormalities in the platelets.
    d. A careful search must be made throughout of every blood smear for 
immature white cells such as band forms (in more than normal proportion, 
i.e., over 10 percent of the total differential count), any number of 
metamyelocytes, myelocytes or myeloblasts. Any nucleate or 
multinucleated red blood cells should be reported. Large ``giant'' 
platelets or fragments of megakaryocytes must be recognized.
    An increase in the proportion of band forms among the neutrophilic 
granulocytes is an abnormality deserving special mention, for it may 
represent a change which should be considered as an early warning of 
benzene toxicity in the absence of other causative factors (most 
commonly infection). Likewise, the appearance of metamyelocytes, in the 
absence of another probable cause, is to be considered a possible 
indication of benzene-induced toxicity.
    An upward trend in the number of basophils, which normally do not 
exceed about 2.0 percent of the total white cells, is to be regarded as 
possible evidence of benzene toxicity. A rise in the eosinophil count is 
less specific but also may be suspicious of toxicity if the rises above 
6.0 percent of the total white count.
    The normal range of monocytes is from 2.0 to 8.0 percent of the 
total white count with an average of about 5.0 percent. About 20 percent 
of individuals reported to have mild but persisting abnormalities caused 
by exposure to benzene show a persistent monocytosis. The findings of a 
monocyte count which persists at more than 10 to 12 percent of the 
normal white cell count (when the total count is

[[Page 244]]

normal) or persistence of an absolute monocyte count in excess of 800/
mm<SUP> 3</SUP> should be regarded as a possible sign of benzene-induced 
toxicity.
    A less frequent but more serious indication of benzene toxicity is 
the finding in the peripheral blood of the so-called ``pseudo'' (or 
acquired) Pelger-Huet anomaly. In this anomaly many, or sometimes the 
majority, of the neutrophilic granulocytes possess two round nuclear 
segements--less often one or three round segments--rather than three 
normally elongated segments. When this anomaly is not hereditary, it is 
often but not invariably predictive of subsequent leukemia. However, 
only about two percent of patients who ultimately develop acute 
myelogenous leukemia show the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly. Other tests 
that can be administered to investigate blood abnormalities are 
discussed below; however, such procedures should be undertaken by the 
hematologist.
    An uncommon sign, which cannot be detected from the smear, but can 
be elicited by a ``sucrose water test'' of peripheral blood, is 
transient paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which may first 
occur insidiously during a period of established aplastic anemia, and 
may be followed within one to a few years by the appearance of rapidly 
fatal acute myelogenous leukemia. Clinical detection of PNH, which 
occurs in only one or two percent of those destined to have acute 
myelogenous leukemia, may be difficult; if the ``sucrose water test'' is 
positive, the somewhat more definitive Ham test, also known as the acid-
serum hemolysis test, may provide confirmation.
    e. Individuals documented to have developed acute myelogenous 
leukemia years after initial exposure to benzene may have progressed 
through a preliminary phase of hematologic abnormality. In some 
instances pancytopenia (i.e., a lowering in the counts of all 
circulating blood cells of bone marrow origin, but not to the extent 
implied by the term ``aplastic anemia'') preceded leukemia for many 
years. Depression of a single blood cell type or platelets may represent 
a harbinger of aplasia or leukemia. The finding of two or more 
cytopenias, or pancytopenia in a benzene-exposed individual, must be 
regarded as highly suspicious of more advanced although still 
reversible, toxicity. ``Pancytopenia'' coupled with the appearance of 
immature cells (myelocytes, myeloblasts, erythroblasts, etc.), with 
abnormal cells (pseudo Pelger-Huet anomaly, atypical nuclear 
heterochromatin, etc.), or unexplained elevations of white blood cells 
must be regarded as evidence of benzene overexposure unless proved 
otherwise. Many severely aplastic patients manifested the ominous 
finding of 5-10 percent myeloblasts in the marrow, occasional 
myeloblasts and myelocytes in the blood and 20-30% monocytes. It is 
evident that isolated cytopenias, pancytopenias, and even aplastic 
anemias induced by benzene may be reversible and complete recovery has 
been reported on cessation of exposure. However, since any of these 
abnormalities is serious, the employee must immediately be removed from 
any possible exposure to benzene vapor. Certain tests may substantiate 
the employee's prospects for progression or regression. One such test 
would be an examination of the bone marrow, but the decision to perform 
a bone marrow aspiration or needle biopsy is made by the hematologist.
    The findings of basophilic stippling in circulating red blood cells 
(usually found in 1 to 5% of red cells following marrow injury), and 
detection in the bone marrow of what are termed ``ringed sideroblasts'' 
must be taken seriously, as they have been noted in recent years to be 
premonitory signs of subsequent leukemia.
    Recently peroxidase-staining of circulating or marrow neutrophil 
granulocytes, employing benzidine dihydrochloride, have revealed the 
disappearance of, or diminution in, peroxidase in a sizable proportion 
of the granulocytes, and this has been reported as an early sign of 
leukemia. However, relatively few patients have been studied to date. 
Granulocyte granules are normally strongly peroxidase positive. A steady 
decline in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase has also been reported as 
suggestive of early acute leukemia. Exposure to benzene may cause an 
early rise in serum iron, often but not always associated with a fall in 
the reticulocyte count. Thus, serial measurements of serum iron levels 
may provide a means of determining whether or not there is a trend 
representing sustained suppression of erythropoiesis.
    Measurement of serum iron, determination of peroxidase and of 
alkaline phosphatase activity in peripheral granulocytes can be 
performed in most pathology laboratories. Peroxidase and alkaline 
phosphatase staining are usually undertaken when the index of suspecion 
for leukemia is high.

   Appendix D to Sec. 1910.1028--Sampling and Analytical Methods for 
              Benzene Monitoring and Measurement Procedures

    Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure 
to benzene are best taken so that the representative average 8-hour 
exposure may be determined from a single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour 
samples. Short-time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used 
to determine average exposure level if a minimum of five measurements 
are taken in a random manner over the 8-hour work shift. Random sampling 
means that any portion of the work shift has the same change of being 
sampled

[[Page 245]]

as any other. The arithmetic average of all such random samples taken on 
one work shift is an estimate of an employee's average level of exposure 
for that work shift. Air samples should be taken in the employee's 
breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the 
employee). Sampling and analysis must be performed with procedures 
meeting the requirements of the standard.
    There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee 
exposures to benzene. The sampling and analysis may be performed by 
collection of the benzene vaptor or charcoal absorption tubes, with 
subsequent chemical analysis by gas chromatography. Sampling and 
analysis may also be performed by portable direct reading instruments, 
real-time continuous monitoring systems, passive dosimeters or other 
suitable methods. The employer has the obligation of selecting a 
monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of 
the standard under his unique field conditions. The standard requires 
that the method of monitoring must have an accuracy, to a 95 percent 
confidence level, of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for 
concentrations of benzene greater than or equal to 0.5 ppm.
    The OSHA Laboratory modified NIOSH Method S311 and evaluated it at a 
benzene air concentration of 1 ppm. A procedure for determining the 
benzene concentration in bulk material samples was also evalauted. This 
work, reported in OSHA Laboratory Method No. 12, includes the following 
two analytical procedures:

                    I. OSHA Method 12 for Air Samples

Analyte: Benzene
Matrix: Air
Procedure: Adsorption on charcoal, desorption with carbon disulfide, 
analysis by GC.
Detection limit: 0.04 ppm
Recommended air volume and sampling rate: 10L to 0.2 L/min.
    1. Principle of the Method.
    1.1 A known volume of air is drawn through a charcoal tube to trap 
the organic vapors present.
    1.2. The charcoal in the tube is transferred to a small, stoppered 
vial, and the anlyte is desorbed with carbon disulfide.
    1.3. An aliquot of the desorbed sample is injected into a gas 
chromatograph.
    1.4 The area of the resulting peak is determined and compared with 
areas obtained from standards.
    2. Advantages and disadvantages of the method.
    2.1 The sampling device is small, portable, and involved no liquids. 
Interferences are minimal, and most of those which do occur can be 
eliminated by altering chromatographic conditions. The samples are 
analyzed by means of a quick, instrumental method.
    2.2 The amount of sample which can be taken is limited by the number 
of milligrams that the tube will hold before overloading. When the 
sample value obtained for the backup section of the charcoal tube 
exceeds 25 percent of that found on the front section, the possibility 
of sample loss exists.
    3. Apparatus.
    3.1 A calibrated personal sampling pump whose flow can be determined 
within <plus-minus>5 percent at the recommended flow rate.
    3.2. Charcoal tubes: Glass with both ends flame sealed, 7 cm long 
with a 6-mm O.D. and a 4-mm I.D., containing 2 sections of 20/40 mesh 
activated charcoal separated by a 2-mm portion of urethane foam. The 
activated charcoal is prepared from coconut shells and is fired at 600  
deg.C prior to packing. The adsorbing section contains 100 mg of 
charcoal, the back-up section 50 mg. A 3-mm portion of urethane foam is 
placed between the outlet end of the tube and the back-up section. A 
plug of silanized glass wool is placed in front of the adsorbing 
section. The pressure drop across the tube must be less than one inch of 
mercury at a flow rate of 1 liter per minute.
    3.3. Gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector.
    3.4. Column (10-ft  x  \1/8\-in stainless steel) packed with 80/100 
Supelcoport coated with 20 percent SP 2100, 0.1 percent CW 1500.
    3.5. An electronic integrator or some other suitable method for 
measuring peak area.
    3.6. Two-milliliter sample vials with Teflon-lined caps.
    3.7. Microliter syringes: 10-microliter (10-<greek-m>L syringe, and 
other convenient sizes for making standards, 1-<greek-m>L syringe for 
sample injections.
    3.8. Pipets: 1.0 mL delivery pipets
    3.9. Volumetric flasks: convenient sizes for making standard 
solutions.
    4. Reagents.
    4.1. Chromatographic quality carbon disulfide (CS<INF>2</INF>). Most 
commercially available carbon disulfide contains a trace of benzene 
which must be removed. It can be removed with the following procedure:
    Heat under reflux for 2 to 3 hours, 500 mL of carbon disulfide, 10 
mL concentrated sulfuric acid, and 5 drops of concentrated nitric acid. 
The benzene is converted to nitrobenzene. The carbon disulfide layer is 
removed, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled. The 
recovered carbon disulfide should be benzene free. (It has recently been 
determined that benzene can also be removed by passing the carbon 
disulfide through 13x molecular sieve).
    4.2. Benzene, reagent grade.
    4.3. p-Cymene, reagent grade, (internal standard).
    4.4. Desorbing reagent. The desorbing reagent is prepared by adding 
0.05 mL of p-cymene per milliliter of carbon disulfide. (The

[[Page 246]]

internal standard offers a convenient means correcting analytical 
response for slight inconsistencies in the size of sample injections. If 
the external standard technique is preferred, the internal standard can 
be eliminated).
    4.5. Purified GC grade helium, hydrogen and air.
    5. Procedure.
    5.1. Cleaning of equipment. All glassware used for the laboratory 
analysis should be properly cleaned and free of organics which could 
interfere in the analysis.
    5.2. Calibration of personal pumps. Each pump must be calibrated 
with a representative charcoal tube in the line.
    5.3. Collection and shipping of samples.
    5.3.1. Immediately before sampling, break the ends of the tube to 
provide an opening at least one-half the internal diameter of the tube 
(2 mm).
    5.3.2. The smaller section of the charcoal is used as the backup and 
should be placed nearest the sampling pump.
    5.3.3. The charcoal tube should be placed in a vertical position 
during sampling to minimize channeling through the charcoal.
    5.3.4 Air being sampled should not be passed through any hose or 
tubing before entering the charcoal tube.
    5.3.5. A sample size of 10 liters is recommended. Sample at a flow 
rate of approximately 0.2 liters per minute. The flow rate should be 
known with an accuracy of at least <plus-minus>5 percent.
    5.3.6. The charcoal tubes should be capped with the supplied plastic 
caps immediately after sampling.
    5.3.7. Submit at least one blank tube (a charcoal tube subjected to 
the same handling procedures, without having any air drawn through it) 
with each set of samples.
    5.3.8. Take necessary shipping and packing precautions to minimize 
breakage of samples.
    5.4. Analysis of samples.
    5.4.1. Preparation of samples. In preparation for analysis, each 
charcoal tube is scored with a file in front of the first section of 
charcoal and broken open. The glass wool is removed and discarded. The 
charcoal in the first (larger) section is transferred to a 2-ml vial. 
The separating section of foam is removed and discarded; the second 
section is transferred to another capped vial. These two sections are 
analyzed separately.
    5.4.2. Desorption of samples. Prior to analysis, 1.0 mL of desorbing 
solution is pipetted into each sample container. The desorbing solution 
consists of 0.05 <greek-m>L internal standard per mL of carbon 
disulfide. The sample vials are capped as soon as the solvent is added. 
Desorption should be done for 30 minutes with occasional shaking.
    5.4.3. GC conditions. Typical operating conditions for the gas 
chromatograph are:
    1.30 mL/min (60 psig) helium carrier gas flow.
    2.30 mL/min (40 psig) hydrogen gas flow to detector.
    3.240 mL/min (40 psig) air flow to detector.
    4.150  deg. C injector temperature.
    5.250  deg. C detector temperature.
    6.100  deg. C column temperature.
    5.4.4. Injection size. 1 <greek-m> L.
    5.4.5. Measurement of area. The peak areas are measured by an 
electronic integrator or some other suitable form of area measurement.
    5.4.6. An internal standard procedure is used. The integrator is 
calibrated to report results in ppm for a 10 liter air sample after 
correction for desorption efficiency.
    5.5. Determination of desorption efficiency.
    5.5.1. Importance of determination. The desorption efficiency of a 
particular compound can vary from one laboratory to another and from one 
lot of chemical to another. Thus, it is necessary to determine, at least 
once, the percentage of the specific compound that is removed in the 
desorption process, provided the same batch of charcoal is used.
    5.5.2. Procedure for determining desorption efficiency. The 
reference portion of the charcoal tube is removed. To the remaining 
portion, amounts representing 0.5X, 1X, and 2X and (X represents target 
concentration) based on a 10 L air sample are injected into several 
tubes at each level. Dilutions of benzene with carbon disulfide are made 
to allow injection of measurable quantities. These tubes are then 
allowed to equilibrate at least overnight. Following equilibration they 
are analyzed following the same procedure as the samples. Desorption 
efficiency is determined by dividing the amount of benzene found by 
amount spiked on the tube.
    6. Calibration and standards. A series of standards varying in 
concentration over the range of interest is prepared and analyzed under 
the same GC conditions that will be used on the samples. A calibration 
curve is prepared by plotting concentration (<greek-m>g/mL) versus peak 
area.
    7. Calculations. Benzene air concentration can be calculated from 
the following equation:

mg/m\3\=(A)(B)/(C)(D)

Where: A=<greek-m>g/mL benzene, obtained from the calibration curve
B=desorption volume (1 mL)
C=Liters of air sampled
D=desorption efficiency

    The concentration in mg/m\3\ can be converted to ppm (at 25 deg. and 
760 mm) with following equation:

ppm=(mg/m\3\)(24.46)/(78.11)

Where: 24.46=molar volume of an ideal gas
25  deg. C and 760 mm
78.11=molecular weight of benzene

    8. Backup Data.
    8.1 Detection limit--Air Samples.
    The detection limit for the analytical procedure is 1.28 ng with a 
coefficient of variation of 0.023 at this level. This would be 
equivalent to an air concentration of 0.04 ppm for a 10 L air sample. 
This amount provided a chromatographic peak that could be identifiable 
in the presence of possible interferences. The detection limit data were 
obtained by making 1 <greek-m>L injections of a 1.283 <greek-m>g/mL 
standard.

    8.3. Storage data--Air Samples
    Samples were generated at 1.03 ppm benzene at 80% relative humidity, 
22  deg. C, and 643 mm. All samples were taken for 50 minutes at 0.2 L/
min. Six samples were analyzed immediately and the rest of the samples 
were divided into two groups by fifteen samples each. One group was 
stored at refrigerated temperature of -25  deg. C, and the other group 
was stored at ambient temperature (approximately 23  deg. C). These 
samples were analyzed over a period of fifteen days. The results are 
tabulated below.

           II. OSHA Laboratory Method No. 12 for Bulk Samples

    Analyte: Benzene.
    Matrix: Bulk Samples.
    Procedure: Bulk Samples are analyzed directly by high performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC).
    Detection limits: 0.01% by volume.
    1. Principle of the method.
    1.1. An aliquot of the bulk sample to be analyzed is injected into a 
liquid chromatograph.
    1.2. The peak area for benzene is determined and compared to areas 
obtained from standards.
    2. Advantages and disadvantages of the method.
    2.1. The analytical procedure is quick, sensitive, and reproducible.
    2.2. Reanalysis of samples is possible.
    2.3. Interferences can be circumvented by proper selection of HPLC 
parameters.

[[Page 248]]

    2.4. Samples must be free of any particulates that may clog the 
capillary tubing in the liquid chromatograph. This may require 
distilling the sample or clarifying with a clarification kit.
    3. Apparatus.
    3.1. Liquid chromatograph equipped with a UV detector.
    3.2. HPLC Column that will separate benzene from other components in 
the bulk sample being analyzed. The column used for validation studies 
was a Waters uBondapack C18, 30 cm x 3.9 mm.
    3.3. A clarification kit to remove any particulates in the bulk if 
necessary.
    3.4. A micro-distillation apparatus to distill any samples if 
necessary.
    3.5. An electronic integrator or some other suitable method of 
measuring peak areas.
    3.6. Microliter syringes--10 <greek-m>L syringe and other convenient 
sizes for making standards. 10 <greek-m>L syringe for sample injections.
    3.7. Volumetric flasks, 5 mL and other convenient sizes for 
preparing standards and making dilutions.
    4. Reagents.
    4.1. Benzene, reagent grade.
    4.2. HPLC grade water, methyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol.
    5. Collection and shipment of samples.
    5.1. Samples should be transported in glass containers with Teflon-
lined caps.
    5.2. Samples should not be put in the same container used for air 
samples.
    6. Analysis of samples.
    6.1. Sample preparation.
    If necessary, the samples are distilled or clarified. Samples are 
analyzed undiluted. If the benzene concentration is out of the working 
range, suitable dilutions are made with isopropyl alcohol.
    6.2. HPLC conditions.
    The typical operating conditions for the high performance liquid 
chromatograph are:
    1. Mobile phase--Methyl alcohol/water, 50/50
    1. Analytical wavelength--254 nm
    3. Injection size--10 <greek-m>L
    6.3. Measurement of peak area and calibration.
    Peak areas are measured by an integrator or other suitable means. 
The integrator is calibrated to report results % in benzene by volume.
    7. Calculations.
    Since the integrator is programmed to report results in % benzene by 
volume in an undiluted sample, the following equation is used:

% Benzene by Volume=A x B

Where: A=% by volume on report
B=Dilution Factor
(B=1 for undiluted sample)

    8. Backup Data.
    8.1. Detection limit--Bulk Samples.
    The detection limit for the analytical procedure for bulk samples is 
0.88 <greek-m>g, with a coefficient of variation of 0.019 at this level. 
This amount provided a chromatographic peak that could be identifiable 
in the presence of possible interferences. The detection limit date were 
obtained by making 10 <greek-m>L injections of a 0.10% by volume 
standard.

earliest possible time for institution of engineering and work practice 
controls, the requirement, effective August 27, 1971, to implement 
feasible administrative or engineering controls to reduce exposures to 
coal tar pitch volatiles, shall be considered. Wherever the engineering 
and work practice controls which can be instituted are not sufficient to 
reduce employee exposures to or below the permissible exposure limit, 
the employer shall nonetheless use them to reduce exposures to the 
lowest level achievable by these controls and shall supplement them by 
the use of respiratory protection which complies with the requirements 
of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (b) If, after implementing all engineering and work practice 
controls required by paragraph (f)(1)(iii)(a) of this section, employee 
exposures still exceed the permissible exposure limit, the employer 
shall implement any other engineering and work practice controls 
necessary to reduce exposures to or below the permissible exposure limit 
except to the extent that the employer can establish that such controls

Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1029--Coke Oven Emissions Substance Information 
                                  Sheet

                       i. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: Coke Oven Emissions
    B. Definition: The benzene-soluble fraction of total particulate 
matter present during the destructive distillation or carbonization of 
coal for the production of coke.
    C. Permissible Exposure Limit: 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air 
determined as an average over an 8-hour period.
    D. Regulated areas: Only employees authorized by your employer 
should enter a regulated area. The employer is required to designate the 
following areas as regulated areas: the coke oven battery, including 
topside and its machinery, pushside and its machinery, cokeside and its 
machinery, and the battery ends; the screening station; and the wharf; 
and the beehive ovens and their machinery.

                         ii. Health Hazard Data

    Exposure to coke oven emissions is a cause of lung cancer, and 
kidney cancer, in humans. Although there have not been an excess number 
of skin cancer cases in humans, repeated skin contact with coke oven 
emissions should be avoided.

                 iii. Protective Clothing and Equipment

    A. Respirators: Respirators will be provided by your employer for 
routine use if your employer is in the process of implementing 
engineering and work practice controls or where engineering and work 
practice controls are not feasible or insufficient to reduce exposure to 
or below the PEL. You must wear respirators for non-routine activities 
or in emergency situations where you are likely to be exposed to levels 
of coke oven emissions in excess of the permissible exposure limit. 
Until January 20, 1978, the routine wearing of respirators is voluntary. 
Until that date, if you choose not to wear a respirator you do not have 
to do so. You must still have your respirator with you and you must 
still wear it if you are near visible emissions. Since how well your 
respirator fits your face is very important, your employer is required 
to conduct fit tests to make sure the respirator seals properly when you 
wear it. These tests are simple and rapid and will be explained to you 
during your training sessions.

[[Page 260]]

    B. Protective clothing: Your employer is required to provide, and 
you must wear, appropriate, clean, protective clothing and equipment to 
protect your body from repeated skin contact with coke oven emissions 
and from the heat generated during the coking process. This clothing 
should include such items as jacket and pants and flame resistant 
gloves. Protective equipment should include face shield or vented 
goggles, protective helmets and safety shoes, insulated from hot 
surfaces where appropriate.

                  iv. Hygiene Facilities and Practices

    You must not eat, drink, smoke, chew gum or tobacco, or apply 
cosmetics in the regulated area, except that drinking water is 
permitted. Your employer is required to provide lunchrooms and other 
areas for these purposes.
    Your employer is required to provide showers, washing facilities, 
and change rooms. If you work in a regulated area, you must wash your 
face, and hands before eating. You must shower at the end of the work 
shift. Do not take used protective clothing out of the change rooms 
without your employer's permission. Your employer is required to provide 
for laundering or cleaning of your protective clothing.

                           v. Signs and Labels

    Your employer is required to post warning signs and labels for your 
protection. Signs must be posted in regulated areas. The signs must warn 
that a cancer hazard is present, that only authorized employees may 
enter the area, and that no smoking or eating is allowed. In regulated 
areas where coke oven emissions are above the permissible exposure 
limit, the signs should also warn that respirators must be worn.

                        vi. Medical Examinations

    If you work in a regulated area at least 30 days per year, your 
employer is required to provide you with a medical examination every 
year. The medical examination must include a medical history, a chest x-
ray, pulmonary function test, weight comparison, skin examination, a 
urinalysis, and a urine cytology exam for early detection of urinary 
cancer. The urine cytology exam is only included in the initial exam 
until you are either 45 years or older, or have 5 or more years 
employment in the regulated areas when the medical exams including this 
test, but excepting the x-ray exam, are to be given every six months; 
under these conditions, you are to be given an x-ray exam at least once 
a year. The examining physician will provide a written opinion to your 
employer containing the results of the medical exams. You should also 
receive a copy of this opinion.

                     vii. Observation of Monitoring

    Your employer is required to monitor your exposure to coke oven 
emissions and you are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You 
are entitled to receive an explanation of the measurement procedure, 
observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to record the 
results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking place in an 
area where respirators or personal protective clothing and equipment are 
required to be worn, you must also be provided with and must wear the 
protective clothing and equipment.

                         viii. Access to Records

    You or your representative are entitled to records of your exposure 
to coke oven emissions upon request to your employer. Your medical 
examination records can be furnished to your physician upon request to 
your employer.

                       ix. Training and Education

    Additional information on all of these items plus training as to 
hazards of coke oven emissions and the engineering and work practice 
controls associated with your job will also be provided by your 
employer.

      Appendix B to Sec. 1910.1029--Industrial Hygiene and Medical 
                         Surveillance Guidelines

                    i. industrial hygiene guidelines

    A. Sampling (Benzene-Soluble Fraction Total Particulate Matter).
    Samples collected should be full shift (at least 7-hour) samples. 
Sampling should be done using a personal sampling pump with pulsation 
damper at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. Samples should be 
collected on 0.8 micrometer pore size silver membrane filters (37 mm 
diameter) preceded by Gelman glass fiber type A-E filters encased in 
three-piece plastic (polystyrene) field monitor cassettes. The cassette 
face cap should be on and the plug removed. The rotameter should be 
checked every hour to ensure that proper flow rates are maintained.
    A minimum of three full-shift samples should be collected for each 
job classification on each battery, at least one from each shift. If 
disparate results are obtained for particular job classification, 
sampling should be repeated. It is advisable to sample each shift on 
more than one day to account for environmental variables (wind, 
precipitation, etc.) which may affect sampling. Differences in exposures 
among different work shifts may indicate a need to improve work

[[Page 261]]

practices on a particular shift. Sampling results from different shifts 
for each job classification should not be averaged. Multiple samples 
from same shift on each battery may be used to calculate an average 
exposure for a particular job classification.

    B. Analysis.

    1. All extraction glassware is cleaned with dichromic acid cleaning 
solution, rinsed with tap water, then dionized water, acetone, and 
allowed to dry completely. The glassware is rinsed with nanograde 
benzene before use. The Teflon cups are cleaned with benzene then with 
acetone.
    2. Pre-weigh the 2 ml Teflon cups to one hundredth of a milligram 
(0.01 mg) on a autobalance AD 2 Tare weight of the cups is about 50 mg.
    3. Place the silver membrane filter and glass fiber filter into a 15 
ml test tube.
    4. Extract with 5 ml of benzene for five minutes in an ultrasonic 
cleaner.
    5. Filter the extract in 15 ml medium glass fritted funnels.
    6. Rinse test tube and filters with two 1.5 ml aliquots of benzene 
and filter through the fritted glass funnel.
    7. Collect the extract and two rinses in a 10 ml Kontes graduated 
evaporative concentrator.
    8. Evaporate down to 1 ml while rinsing the sides with benzene.
    9. Pipet 0.5 ml into the Teflon cup and evaporate to dryness in a 
vacuum oven at 40  deg.C for 3 hours.
    10. Weigh the Teflon cup and the weight gain is due to the benzene 
soluble residue in half the Sample.

                   ii. medical surveillance guidelines

    A. General. The minimum requirements for the medical examination for 
coke oven workers are given in paragraph (j) of the standard. The 
initial examination is to be provided to all coke oven workers who work 
at least 30 days in the regulated area. The examination includes a 14" X 
17" posterior-anterior chest x-ray reading and a ILO/UC rating to assure 
some standardization of x-ray reading, pulmonary function tests (FVC and 
FEV 1.0), weight, urinalysis, skin examination, and a urinary cytologic 
examination. These tests are needed to serve as the baseline for 
comparing the employee's future test results. Periodic exams include all 
the elements of the initial exam, except that the urine cytologic test 
is to be performed only on those employees who are 45 years or older or 
who have worked for 5 or more years in the regulated area; periodic 
exams, with the exception of x-rays, are to be performed semiannually 
for this group instead of annually; for this group, x-rays will continue 
to be given at least annually. The examination contents are minimum 
requirements; additional tests such as lateral and oblique x-rays or 
additional pulmonary function tests may be performed if deemed 
necessary.
    B. Pulmonary function tests.

    Pulmonary function tests should be performed in a manner which 
minimizes subject and operator bias. There has been shown to be learning 
effects with regard to the results obtained from certain tests, such as 
FEV 1.0. Best results can be obtained by multiple trials for each 
subject. The best of three trials or the average of the last three of 
five trials may be used in obtaining reliable results. The type of 
equipment used (manufacturer, model, etc.) should be recorded with the 
results as reliability and accuracy varies and such information may be 
important in the evaluation of test results. Care should be exercised to 
obtain the best possible testing equipment.

    (3) Personal protective equipment--(i) Provision. When there is 
occupational exposure, the employer shall provide, at no cost to the 
employee, appropriate personal protective equipment such as, but not 
limited to, gloves, gowns, laboratory coats, face shields or masks and 
eye protection, and mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, pocket masks, or 
other ventilation devices. Personal protective equipment will be 
considered ``appropriate'' only if it does not permit blood or other 
potentially infectious materials to pass through to or reach the 
employee's work clothes, street clothes, undergarments, skin, eyes, 
mouth, or other mucous membranes under normal conditions of use and for 
the duration of time which the protective equipment will be used.
    (ii) Use. The employer shall ensure that the employee uses 
appropriate personal protective equipment unless the employer shows that 
the employee temporarily and briefly declined to use personal protective 
equipment when, under rare and extraordinary circumstances, it was the 
employee's professional judgment that in the specific instance its use 
would have prevented the delivery of health care or public safety 
services or would have posed an increased hazard to the safety of the 
worker or co-worker. When the employee makes this judgement, the 
circumstances shall be investigated and documented in order to determine 
whether changes can be instituted to prevent such occurences in the 
future.
    (iii) Accessibility. The employer shall ensure that appropriate 
personal protective equipment in the appropriate sizes is readily

leaving the work area.
    (viii) When personal protective equipment is removed it shall be 
placed in an appropriately designated area or container for storage, 
washing, decontamination or disposal.
    (ix) Gloves. Gloves shall be worn when it can be reasonably 
anticipated that the employee may have hand contact with blood, other 
potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin; 
when performing vascular access procedures except as specified in 
paragraph (d)(3)(ix)(D); and when handling or touching contaminated 
items or surfaces.
    (A) Disposable (single use) gloves such as surgical or examination 
gloves, shall be replaced as soon as practical when contaminated or as 
soon as feasible if they are torn, punctured, or when their ability to 
function as a barrier is compromised.
    (B) Disposable (single use) gloves shall not be washed or 
decontaminated for re-use.
    (C) Utility gloves may be decontaminated for re-use if the integrity 
of the glove is not compromised. However, they must be discarded if they 
are cracked, peeling, torn, punctured, or exhibit other signs of 
deterioration or when their ability to function as a barrier is 
compromised.
    (D) If an employer in a volunteer blood donation center judges that 
routine gloving for all phlebotomies is not necessary then the employer 
shall:
    (1) Periodically reevaluate this policy;
    (2) Make gloves available to all employees who wish to use them for 
phlebotomy;
    (3) Not discourage the use of gloves for phlebotomy; and

[[Page 266]]

    (4) Require that gloves be used for phlebotomy in the following 
circumstances:
    (i) When the employee has cuts, scratches, or other breaks in his or 
her skin;
    (ii) When the employee judges that hand contamination with blood may 
occur, for example, when performing phlebotomy on an uncooperative 
source individual; and
    (iii) When the employee is receiving training in phlebotomy.
    (x) Masks, Eye Protection, and Face Shields. Masks in combination 
with eye protection devices, such as goggles or glasses with solid side 
shields, or chin-length face shields, shall be worn whenever splashes, 
spray, spatter, or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious 
materials may be generated and eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be 
reasonably anticipated.
    (xi) Gowns, Aprons, and Other Protective Body Clothing. Appropriate 
protective clothing such as, but not limited to, gowns, aprons, lab 
coats, clinic jackets, or similar outer garments shall be worn in 
occupational exposure situations. The type and characteristics will

instrument.
    (iii) The action level for the textile processes known as slashing 
and weaving is an airborne concentration of lint-free respirable cotton 
dust of 375 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> mean concentration, averaged over 
an eight-hour period, as measured by a vertical elutriator or an 
equivalent instrument.
    (d) Exposure monitoring and measurement--(1) General. (i) For the 
purposes of this section, employee exposure is that exposure which would 
occur if the employee were not using a respirator.
    (ii) The sampling device to be used shall be either the vertical 
elutriator cotton dust sampler or an equivalent instrument.
    (iii) If an alternative to the vertical elutriator cotton dust 
sampler is used, the employer shall establish equivalency by reference 
to an OSHA opinion or by documenting, based on data developed by the 
employer or supplied by the manufacturer, that the alternative sampling 
devices meets the following criteria:
    (A) It collects respirable particulates in the same range as the 
vertical elutriator (approximately 15 microns);
    (B) Replicate exposure data used to establish equivalency are 
collected in side-by-side field and laboratory comparisons; and
    (C) A minimum of 100 samples over the range of 0.5 to 2 times the 
permissible exposure limit are collected, and 90% of these samples have 
an accuracy range of plus or minus 25 per cent of the vertical 
elutriator reading with a 95% confidence level as demonstrated by a 
statistically valid protocol. (An acceptable protocol for demonstrating 
equivalency is described in Appendix E of this section.)
    (iv) OSHA will issue a written opinion stating that an instrument is 
equivalent to a vertical elutriator cotton dust sampler if
    (A) A manufacturer or employer requests an opinion in writing and 
supplies the following information:
    (1) Sufficient test data to demonstrate that the instrument meets 
the requirements specified in this paragraph and the protocol specified 
in Appendix E of this section;
    (2) Any other relevant information about the instrument and its 
testing requested by OSHA; and
    (3) A certification by the manufacturer or employer that the 
information supplied is accurate, and
    (B) if OSHA finds, based on information submitted about the 
instrument,

[[Page 276]]

that the instrument meets the requirements for equivalency specified by 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Initial monitoring. Each employer who has a place of employment 
within the scope of paragraph (a)(1), (a)(4), or (a)(5) of this section 
shall conduct monitoring by obtaining measurements which are 
representative of the exposure of all employees to airborne 
concentrations of lint-free respirable cotton dust over an eight-hour 
period. The sampling program shall include at least one determination 
during each shift for each work area.
    (3) Periodic monitoring. (i) If the initial monitoring required by 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section or any subsequent monitoring reveals 
employee exposure to be at or below the permissible exposure limit, the 
employer shall repeat the monitoring for those employees at least 
annually.
    (ii) If the initial monitoring required by paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section or any subsequent monitoring reveals employee exposure to be 
above the PEL, the employer shall repeat the monitoring for those 
employees at least every six months.
    (iii) Whenever there has been a production, process, or control 
change which may result in new or additional exposure to cotton dust, or 
whenever the employer has any other reason to suspect an increase in 
employee exposure, the employer shall repeat the monitoring and 
measurements for those employees affected by the change or increase.
    (4) Employee notification. (i) Within twenty working days after the 
receipt of monitoring results, the employer shall notify each employee 
in writing of the exposure measurements which represent that employee's 
exposure.
    (ii) Whenever the results indicate that the employee's exposure 
exceeds the applicable permissible exposure limit specified in paragraph 
(c) of this section, the employer shall include in the written notice a 
statement that the permissible exposure limit was exceeded and a 
description of the corrective action taken to reduce exposure below the 
permissible exposure limit.
    (e) Methods of compliance--(1) Engineering and work practice 
controls. The employer shall institute engineering and work practice 
controls to reduce and maintain employee exposure to cotton dust at or 
below the permissible exposure limit specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section, except to the extent that the employer can establish that such 
controls are not feasible.
    (2) Whenever feasible engineering and work practice controls are not 
sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the permissible 
exposure limit, the employer shall nonetheless institute these controls 
to reduce exposure to the lowest feasible level, and shall supplement 
these controls with the use of respirators which shall comply with the 
provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (3) Compliance program. (i) Where the most recent exposure 
monitoring data indicates that any employee is exposed to cotton dust 
levels greater than the permissible exposure limit, the employer shall 
establish and implement a written program sufficient to reduce exposures 
to or below the permissible exposure limit solely by means of 
engineering controls and work practices as required by paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section.
    (ii) The written program shall include at least the following:
    (A) A description of each operation or process resulting in employee

    (G) Other relevant information.
    (iii) The employer's schedule as set forth in the compliance 
program, shall project completion of the implementation of the 
compliance program no later than March 27, 1984 or as soon as possible 
if monitoring after March 27, 1984 reveals exposures over the PEL,

[[Page 277]]

except as provided in paragraph (m)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (iv) The employer shall complete the steps set forth in his program 
by the dates in the schedule.
    (v) Written programs shall be submitted, upon request, to the 
Assistant Secretary and the Director, and shall be available at the

section shall be revised and updated when necessary to reflect the 
current status of the program and current exposure levels.
    (4) Mechanical ventilation. When mechanical ventilation is used to 
control exposure, measurements which demonstrate the effectiveness of 
the system to control exposure, such as capture velocity, duct velocity, 
or static pressure shall be made at reasonable intervals.
    (f) Respiratory protection--(1) General. For employees who are 
required to use respirators by this section, the employer must provide

    (ii) Whenever a physician determines that an employee who works in 
an area in which the cotton-dust concentration exceeds the PEL is unable 
to use a respirator, including a powered air-purifying respirator, the 
employee must be given the opportunity to transfer to an available 
position, or to a position that becomes available later, that has a 
cotton-dust concentration at or below the PEL. The employer must ensure 
that such employees retain their current wage rate or other benefits as 
a result of the transfer.
    (3) Respirator selection. (i) The employer must select the 
appropriate respirator from Table I of this section.

Not greater than:
    (a) 5  x  the applicable   A disposable respirator with a
     permissible exposure       particulate filter.
     limit (PEL).
    (b) 10  x  the applicable  A quarter or half-mask respirator, other
     PEL.                       than a disposable respirator, equipped
                                with particulate filters.
    (c) 100  x  the            A full facepiece respirator equipped with

     the applicable PEL.        equipped with high-efficiency
                                particulate filters.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
 A1. A disposable respirator means the filter element is an inseparable
  part of the respirator.
 A2. Any respirators permitted at higher environmental concentrations
  can be used at lower concentrations.
 A3. Self-contained breathing apparatus are not required respirators but
  are permitted respirators.
 A4. Supplied air respirators are not required but are permitted under
  the following conditions: Cotton dust concentration not greater than
  10X the PEL--Any supplied air respirator; not greater than 100X the
  PEL--Any supplied air respirator with full facepiece, helmet or hood;
  greater than 100X the PEL--A supplied air respirator operated in
  positive pressure mode.

    (ii) Whenever respirators are required by this section for cotton-
dust concentrations that do not exceed the applicable permissible 
exposure limit by a multiple of 100 (100 X), the employer must, when 
requested by an employee, provide a powered air-purifying respirator 
with a high-efficiency particulate filter instead of the respirator

[[Page 278]]

specified in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of Table I of this section.

employee exposure, immediately establish and implement a written program 
of work practices which shall minimize cotton dust exposure. The 
following shall be included were applicable:
    (1) Compressed air ``blow down'' cleaning shall be prohibited where 
alternative means are feasible. Where compressed air is used for 
cleaning, the employees performing the ``blow down'' or ``blow off'' 
shall wear suitable respirators. Employees whose presence is not 
required to perform ``blow down'' or ``blow of'' shall be required to 
leave the area affected by the ``blow down'' or ``blow off'' during this 
cleaning operation.
    (2) Cleaning of clothing or floors with compressed air shall be 
prohibited.
    (3) Floor sweeping shall be performed with a vacuum or with methods 
designed to minimize dispersal of dust.
    (4) In areas where employees are exposed to concentrations of cotton 
dust greater than the permissible exposure limit, cotton and cotton 
waste shall be stacked, sorted, baled, dumped, removed or otherwise 
handled by mechanical means, except where the employer can show that it 
is infeasible to do so. Where infeasible, the method used for handling 
cotton and cotton waste shall be the method which reduces exposure to 
the lowest level feasible.
    (h) Medical survelliance--(1) General. (i) Each employer covered by 
the standard shall institute a program of medical surveillance for all 
employees exposed to cotton dust.
    (ii) The employer shall assure that all medical examinations and

    (ii) The standardized questionnaire contained in Appendix B; and
    (iii) A pulmonary function measurement, including a determination of 
forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second 
(FEV<INF>1</INF>), the FEV<INF>1</INF>/FVC ratio, and the percentage 
that the measured values of FEV<INF>1</INF> and FVC differ from the 
predicted values, using the standard tables in Appendix C. These 
determinations shall be made for each employee before the employee 
enters the workplace on the first day of the work week, preceded by at 
least 35 hours of no exposure to cotton dust. The tests shall be 
repeated during the shift, no less than 4 and no more than 10 hours 
after the beginning of the work shift; and, in any event, no more than 
one hour after cessation of exposure. Such exposure shall be typical of 
the employee's usual workplace exposure. The predicted FEV<INF>1</INF> 
and FVC for blacks shall be multiplied by 0.85 to adjust for ethnic 
differences.
    (iv) Based upon the questionnaire results, each employee shall be 
graded according to Schilling's byssinosis classification system.
    (3) Periodic examinations. (i) The employer shall provide at least 
annual medical surveillance for all employees exposed to cotton dust 
above the action level in yarn manufacturing, slashing and weaving, 
cotton washing and waste house operations. The employer shall provide 
medical surveillance at least every two years for all employees exposed 
to cotton dust at or below the action level, for all employees exposed 
to cotton dust from washed cotton (except from washed cotton defined in 
paragraph (n)(3) of this section), and for all employees exposed to 
cotton dust in cottonseed processing and waste processing operations. 
Periodic medical surveillance shall include at least an update of the 
medical history, standardized questionnaire (App. B-111), Schilling 
byssinosis grade, and the pulmonary function measurements in paragraph 
(h)(2)(iii) of this section.

a first working day;
    (B) An FEV<INF>1</INF> of less than 80 percent of the predicted 
value; or
    (C) Where, in the opinion of the physician, any significant change 
in questionnaire findings, pulmonary function results, or other 
diagnostic tests have occurred.
    (iii) An employee whose FEV<INF>1</INF> is less than 60 percent of 
the predicted value shall be referred to a physician for a detailed 
pulmonary examination.

it is demonstrated that they are statistically valid, meet the 
requirements in paragraph (d)(l)(iii) of this section, and are 
appropriate for demonstrating equivalency.

Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1043--Air Sampling and Analytical Procedures for 
                Determining Concentrations of Cotton Dust

                          i. sampling locations

    The sampling procedures must be designed so that samples of the 
actual dust concentrations are collected accurately and consistently and 
reflect the concentrations of dust at the place and time of sampling. 
Sufficient number of 6-hour area samples in each distinct work area of 
the plant should be collected at locations which provide representative 
samples of air to which the worker is exposed. In order to avoid filter 
overloading, sampling time may be shortened when sampling in dusty 
areas. Samples in each work area should be gathered simultaneously or 
sequentially during a normal operating period. The daily time-weighted 
average (TWA) exposure of each worker can then be determined by using 
the following formula:

Summation of hours spent in each location and the dust concentration in 
                             that location.

                           Total hours exposed

A time-weighted average concentration should be computed for each worker 
and properly logged and maintained on file for review.

                         ii. sampling equipment

    (a) Sampler. The instrument selected for monitoring is the Lumsden-
Lynch vertical elutriator. It should operate at a flow rate of 
7.4<plus-minus>0.2 liters/minute.

The samplers should be cleaned prior to sampling. The pumps should be 
monitored during sampling.
    (b) Filter Holder. A three-piece cassette constructed of polystyrene 
designed to hold a 37-mm diameter filter should be used. Care must be 
exercised to insure that an adequate seal exists between elements of the 
cassette.
    (c) Filers and Support Pads. The membrane filters used should be 
polyvinyl chloride with a 5-um pore size and 37-mm diameter. A support 
pad, commonly called a backup pad, should be used under the filter 
membrane in the field monitor cassette.
    (d) Balance. A balance sensitive to 10 micrograms should be used.
    (e) Monitoring equipment for use in Class III hazardous locations 
must be approved for use in such locations, in accordance with the 
requirements of the OSHA electrical standards in Subpart S of Part 1910.

                  iii. instrument calibration procedure

    Samplers shall be calibrated when first received from the factory, 
after repair, and after receiving any abuse. The samplers should be 
calibrated in the laboratory both before they are used in the field and 
after they have been used to collect a large number of field samples. 
The primary standard, such as a spirometer or other standard calibrating 
instruments such as a wet test meter or a large bubble meter or dry gas 
meter, should be used. Instructions for calibration with the wet test 
meter follow. If another calibration device is selected, equivalent 
procedures should be used:
    (a) Level wet test meter. Check the water level which should just 
touch the calibration point at the left side of the meter. If water 
level is low, add water 1-2  deg.F. warmer than room temperature of till 
point. Run the meter for 30 minutes before calibration;
    (b) Place the polyvinyl chloride membrane filter in the filter 
cassette;
    (c) Assemble the calibration sampling train;
    (d) Connect the wet test meter to the train.

The pointer on the meter should run clockwise and a pressure drop of not 
more than 1.0 inch of water indicated. If the pressure drop is greater 
than 1.0, disconnect and check the system;
    (e) Operate the system for ten minutes before starting the 
calibration;
    (f) Check the vacuum gauge on the pump to insure that the pressure 
drop across the orifice exceeds 17 inches of mercury;
    (g) Record the following on calibration data sheets:
    (1) Wet test meter reading, start and finish;
    (2) Elapsed time, start and finish (at least two minutes);
    (3) Pressure drop at manometer;
    (4) Air temperature;
    (5) Barometric pressure; and
    (6) Limiting orifice number;
    (h) Calculate the flow rate and compare against the flow of 
7.4<plus-minus>0.2 liters/minute. If flow is between these limits, 
perform calibration again, average results, and record orifice number 
and flow rate. If flow is not

[[Page 284]]

within these limits, discard or modify orifice and repeat procedure;
    (i) Record the name of the person performing the calibration, the 
date, serial number of the wet test meter, and the number of the 
critical orifices being calibrated.

                         iv. sampling procedure

    (a) Sampling data sheets should include a log of:
    (1) The date of the sample collection;
    (2) The time of sampling;
    (3) The location of the sampler;
    (4) The sampler serial number;
    (5) The cassette number;
    (6) The time of starting and stopping the sampling and the duration 
of sampling;
    (7) The weight of the filter before and after sampling;
    (8) The weight of dust collected (corrected for controls);
    (9) The dust concentration measured;
    (10) Other pertinent information; and
    (11) Name of person taking sample
    (b) Assembly of filter cassette should be as follows:
    (1) Loosely assemble 3-piece cassette;
    (2) Number cassette;
    (3) Place absorbant pad in cassette;
    (4) Weigh filter to an accuracy of 10 <greek-m>g;
    (5) Place filter in cassette;
    (6) Record weight of filter in log, using cassette number for 
identification;
    (7) Fully assemble cassette, using pressure to force parts tightly 
together;
    (8) Install plugs top and bottom;
    (9) Put shrink band on cassette, covering joint between center and 
bottom parts of cassette; and
    (10) Set cassette aside until shrink band dries thoroughly.
    (c) Sampling collection should be performed as follows:
    (1) Clean lint out of the motor and elutriator;
    (2) Install vertical elutriator in sampling locations specified 
above with inlet 4\1/2\ to 5\1/2\ feet from floor (breathing zone 
height);
    (3) Remove top section of cassette;
    (4) Install cassette in ferrule of elutriator;
    (5) Tape cassette to ferrule with masking tape or similar material 
for air-tight seal;
    (6) Remove bottom plug of cassette and attach hose containing 
critical orifice;
    (7) Start elutriator pump and check to see if gauge reads above 17 
in. of Hg vacuum;
    (8) Record starting time, cassette number, and sampler number;
    (9) At end of sampling period stop pump and record time; and
    (10) Controls with each batch of samples collected, two additional 
filter cassettes should be subjected to exactly the same handling as the 
samples, except that they are not opened. These control filters should 
be weighed in the same manner as the sample filters.

Any difference in weight in the control filters would indicate that the 
procedure for handling sample filters may not be adequate and should be 
evaluated to ascertain the cause of the difference, whether and what 
necessary corrections must be made, and whether additional samples must 
be collected.
    (d) Shipping. The cassette with samples should be collected, along 
with the appropriate number of blanks, and shipped to the analytical 
laboratory in a suitable container to prevent damage in transit.
    (e) Weighing of the sample should be achieved as follows:
    (1) Remove shrink band;
    (2) Remove top and middle sections of cassette and botton plug;
    (3) Remove filter from cassette and weigh to an accuracy of 10 
<greek-m>g; and
    (4) Record weight in log against original weight
    (f) Calculation of volume of air sampled should be determined as 
follows:
    (1) From starting and stopping times of sampling period, determine 
length of time in minutes of sampling period; and
    (2) Multiply sampling time in minutes by flow rate of critical 
orifice in liters per minute and divide by 1000 to find air quantity in 
cubic meters.
    (g) Calculation of Dust Concentrations should be made as follows:
    (1) Substract weight of clean filter from dirty filter and apply 
control correction to find actual weight of sample. Record this weight 
(in <greek-m>g) in log; and
    (2) Divide mass of sample in <greek-m>g by air volume in cubic 
meters to find dust concentration in <greek-m>g/m. Record in log.

 Appendix D to Sec. 1910.1043--Pulmonary Function Standards for Cotton 
                              Dust Standard

    The spirometric measurements of pulmonary function shall conform to 
the following minimum standards, and these standards are not intended to 
preclude additional testing or alternate methods which can be determined 
to be superior.

                              i. apparatus

    a. The instrument shall be accurate to within <plus-minus>50 
milliliters or within <plus-minus>3 percent of reading, whichever is 
greater.
    b. The instrument should be capable of measuring vital capacity from 
0 to 7 liters BTPS.
    c. The instrument shall have a low inertia and offer low resistance 
to airflow such that the resistance to airflow at 12 liters per second 
must be less than 1.5 cm H<INF>2</INF> O/(liter/sec).
    d. The zero time point for the purpose of timing the FEV<INF>1</INF> 
shall be determined by extrapolating the steepest portion of the volume 
time curve back to the maximal inspiration volume (1, 2, 3, 4) or by an 
equivalent method.
    e. Instruments incorporating measurements of airflow to determine 
volume shall conform to the same volume accuracy stated in (a) of this 
section when presented with flow rates from at least 0 to 12 liters per 
second.
    f. The instrument or user of the instrument must have a means of 
correcting volumes to body temperature saturated with water vapor (BTPS) 
under conditions of varying ambient spirometer temperatures and 
barometric pressures.
    g. The instrument used shall provide a tracing or display of either 
flow versus volume or volume versus time during the entire forced 
expiration. A tracing or display is necessary to determine whether the 
patient has performed the test properly. The tracing must be stored and 
available for recall and must be of sufficient size that hand 
measurements may be made within requirement of paragraph (a) of this 
section. If a paper record is made it must have a paper speed of at 
least 2 cm/sec and a volume sensitivity of at least 10.0 mm of chart per 
liter of volume.
    h. The instrument shall be capable of accumulating volume for a 
minimum of 10 seconds and shall not stop accumulating volume before (1) 
the volume change for a 0.5 second interval is less than 25 milliliters, 
or (2) the flow is less than 50 milliliters per second for a 0.5 second 
interval.
    i. The forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV<INF>1.0</INF>) measurements shall comply with the accuracy 
requirements stated in paragraph (a) of this section. That is, they 
should be accurately measured to within <plus-minus>50 ml or within 
<plus-minus>3 percent of reading, whichever is greater.
    j. The instrument must be capable of being calibrated in the field 
with respect to the FEV<INF>1</INF> and FVC. This calibration of the 
FEV<INF>1</INF> and FVC may be either directly or indirectly through 
volume and time base measurements. The volume calibration source should 
provide a volume displacement of at least 2 liters and should be 
accurate to within <plus-minus>30 milliliters.

     ii. technique for measurement of forced vital capacity maneuver

    a. Use of a nose clip is recommended but not required. The 
procedures shall be explained in simple terms to the patient who shall 
be instructed to loosen any tight clothing and stand in front of the 
apparatus. The subject may sit, but care should be taken on repeat 
testing that the same position be used and, if possible, the same 
spirometer. Particular attention shall be given to insure that the chin 
is slightly elevated with the neck slightly extended. The patient shall 
be instructed to make a full inspiration from a normal breathing pattern 
and then blow into the apparatus, without interruption, as hard, fast, 
and completely as possible. At least three forced expirations shall be 
carried out. During the maneuvers, the patient shall be observed for 
compliance with instruction. The expirations shall be checked visually 
for reproducibility from flow-volume or volume-time tracings or 
displays. The following efforts shall be judged unacceptable when the 
patient:
    1. Has not reached full inspiration preceding the forced expiration,
    2. Has not used maximal effort during the entire forced expiration,
    3. Has not continued the expiration for at least 5 seconds or until 
an obvious plateau in the volume time curve has occurred,
    4. Has coughed or closed his glottis,
    5. Has an obstructed mouthpiece or a leak around the mouthpiece 
(obstruction due to tongue being placed in front of mouthpiece, false 
teeth falling in front of mouthpiece, etc.)
    6. Has an unsatisfactory start of expiration, one characterized by 
excessive hesitation (or false starts), and therefore not allowing back 
extrapolation of time 0 (extrapolated volume on the volume time tracing 
must be less than 10 percent of the FVC.)
    7. Has an excessive variability between the three acceptable curves. 
The variation between the two largest FVC's and FEV<INF>1</INF>'s of the 
three satisfactory tracings should not exceed 10 percent or 
<plus-minus>100 milliliters, whichever is greater.
    b. Periodic and routine recalibration of the instrument or method 
for recording FVC and FEV<INF>1.0</INF> should be performed using a 
syringe or other volume source of at least 2 liters.

[[Page 303]]

                    iii. interpretation of spirogram

    a. The first step in evaluating a spirogram should be to determine 
whether or not the patient has performed the test properly or as 
described in II above. From the three satisfactory tracings, the forced 
vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV<INF>1.0</INF>) shall be measured and recorded. The largest observed 
FVC and largest observed FEV<INF>1</INF> shall be used in the analysis 
regardless of the curve(s) on which they occur.
    b. The following guidelines are recommended by NIOSH for the 
evaluation and management of workers exposed to cotton dust. It is 
important to note that employees who show reductions in FEV<INF>1</INF>/
FVC ratio below .75 or drops in Monday FEV<INF>1</INF> of 5 percent or 
greater on their initial screening exam, should be re-evaluated within a 
month of the first exam. Those who show consistent decrease in lung 
function, as shown on the following table, should be managed as 
recommended.

         iv. qualifications of personnel administering the test

    Technicians who perform pulmonary function testing should have the 
basic knowledge required to produce meaningful results. Training 
consisting of approximately 16 hours of formal instruction should cover 
the following areas.
    a. Basic physiology of the forced vital capacity maneuver and the 
determinants of airflow limitation with emphasis on the relation to 
reproducibility of results.
    b. Instrumentation requirements including calibration procedures, 
sources of error and their correction.
    c. Performance of the testing including subject coaching, 
recognition of improperly performed maneuvers and corrective actions.
    d. Data quality with emphasis on reproducibility.
    e. Actual use of the equipment under supervised conditions.
    f. Measurement of tracings and calculations of results.

 Appendix E to Sec. 1910.1043--Vertical Elutriator Equivalency Protocol

    a. Samples to be taken--In order to ascertain equivalency, it is 
necessary to collect a total of 100 samples from at least 10 sites in a 
mill. That is, there should be 10 replicate readings at each of 10 
sites. The sites should represent dust levels which vary over the 
allowable range of 0.5 to 2 times the permissible exposure limit. Each 
sample requires the use of two vertical elutriators (VE's) and at least 
one but not more than two alternative devices (AD's). Thus, the end 
result is 200 VE readings and either 100 or 200 AD readings. The 2 VE 
readings and the 1 or 2 AD readings at each time and site must be made 
simultaneously. That is, the two VE's and one or two AD's must be 
arranged together in such a way that they are measuring essentially the 
same dust levels.
    b. Data averaging--The two VE readings taken at each site are then 
averaged. These averages are to be used as the 100 VE readings. If two 
alternate devices were used, their test results are also averaged. Thus, 
after this step is accomplished, there will be 100 VE readings and 100 
AD readings.
    c. Differences--For each of the 100 sets of measurements (VE and AD) 
the difference is obtained as the average VE reading minus the AD 
reading. Call these differences D<INF>i</INF>. Thus, we have.

D<INF>i</INF> = VE<INF>i</INF> - AD<INF>i</INF>, i = 1,2, . . . ,100    
(1)

    Next we compute the arithmetic mean and standard deviations of the 
differences, using equations (2) and (3), respectively.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28OC91.038

    where N equals the number of differences (100 in this case), 
X<INF>D</INF> is the arithmetic mean and S<INF>D</INF> is the standard 
deviation.
    We next calculate the critical value as T = KS<INF>D</INF> + | 
X<INF>D</INF>| where K = 1.87, based on 100 samples.
    d. Equivalency test. The next step is to obtain the average of the 
100 VE readings. This is obtained by equation (4)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28OC91.039

    We next multiply 0.25 by X<INF>VE</INF>. If T <ls-thn-eq> 0.25 
X<INF>VE,</INF> we can say that the alternate device has passed the 
equivalency test.

   Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1044--Substance Safety Data Sheet For DBCP

                       i. Substance Identification

    A. Synonyms and trades names: DBCP; Dibromochloropropane; Fumazone 
(Dow Chemical Company TM); Nemafume; Nemagon (Shell Chemical Co. TM); 
Nemaset; BBC 12; and OS 1879.
    B. Permissible exposure:
    1. Airborne. 1 part DBCP vapor per billion parts of air (1 ppb); 
time-weighted average (TWA) for an 8-hour workday.
    2. Dermal. Eye contact and skin contact with DBCP are prohibited.
    C. Appearance and odor: Technical grade DBCP is a dense yellow or 
amber liquid with a pungent odor. It may also appear in granular form, 
or blended in varying concentrations with other liquids.
    D. Uses: DBCP is used to control nematodes, very small worm-like 
plant parasites, on crops including cotton, soybeans, fruits, nuts, 
vegetables and ornamentals.

                         ii. Health Hazard Data

    A. Routes of entry: Employees may be exposed:
    1. Through inhalation (breathing);
    2. Through ingestion (swallowing);
    3. Skin contact; and
    4. Eye contact.
    B. Effects of exposure:
    1. Acute exposure. DBCP may cause drowsiness, irritation of the 
eyes, nose, throat and skin, nausea and vomiting. In addition, 
overexposure may cause damage to the lungs, liver or kidneys.
    2. Chronic exposure. Prolonged or repeated exposure to DBCP has been 
shown to cause sterility in humans. It also has been shown to produce 
cancer and sterility in laboratory animals and has been determined to 
constitute an increased risk of cancer in man.
    3. Reporting Signs and Symptoms. If you develop any of the above 
signs or symptoms that you think are caused by exposure to DBCP, you 
should inform your employer.

                   iii. Emergency First Aid Procedures

    A. Eye exposure. If DBCP liquid or dust containing DBCP gets into 
your eyes, wash your eyes immediately with large amounts of water, 
lifting the lower and upper lids occasionally. Get medical attention 
immediately. Contact lenses should not be worn when working with DBCP.
    B. Skin exposure. If DBCP liquids or dusts containing DBCP get on 
your skin, immediately wash using soap or mild detergent and water. If 
DBCP liquids or dusts containing DBCP penetrate through your clothing, 
remove the clothing immediately and wash. If irritation is present after 
washing get medical attention.
    C. Breathing. If you or any person breathe in large amounts of DBCP, 
move the exposed person to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, 
perform artificial respiration. Do not use mouth-to-mouth. Keep the 
affected person warm and at rest. Get medical attention as soon as 
possible.
    D. Swallowing. When DBCP has been swallowed and the person is 
conscious, give the person large amounts of water immediately. After the 
water has been swallowed, try to

[[Page 311]]

get the person to vomit by having him touch the back of his throat with 
his finger. Do not make an unconscious person vomit. Get medical 
attention immediately.
    E. Rescue. Notify someone. Put into effect the established emergency 
rescue procedures. Know the locations of the emergency rescue equipment 
before the need arises.

                 iv. Respirators and Protective Clothing

    A. Respirators. You may be required to wear a respirator in 
emergencies and while your employer is in the process of reducing DBCP 
exposures through engineering controls. If respirators are worn, they 
must have a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH) approval label (Older respirators may have a Bureau of Mines 
Approval label). For effective protection, a respirator must fit your 
face and head snugly. The respirator should not be loosened or removed 
in work situations where its use is required. DBCP does not have a 
detectable odor except at 1,000 times or more above the permissible 
exposure limit. If you can smell DBCP while wearing a respirator, the 
respirator is not working correctly; go immediately to fresh air. If you 
experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your 
employer.
    B. Protective clothing. When working with DBCP you must wear for 
your protection impermeable work clothing provided by your employer. 
(Standard rubber and neoprene protective clothing do not offer adequate 
protection).
    DBCP must never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and shoes 
must not be allowed to become contaminated with DBCP, and if they do, 
they must be promptly removed and not worn again until completely free 
of DBCP. Turn in impermeable clothing that has developed leaks for 
repair or replacement.
    C. Eye protection. You must wear splash-proof safety goggles where 
there is any possibility of DBCP liquid or dust contacting your eyes.

           v. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling, and Storage

    A. DBCP must be stored in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-
ventilated area.
    B. If your work clothing may have become contaminated with DBCP, or 
liquids or dusts containing DBCP, you must change into uncontaminated 
clothing before leaving the work premises.
    C. You must promptly remove any protective clothing that becomes 
contaminated with DBCP. This clothing must not be reworn until the DBCP 
is removed from the clothing.
    D. If your skin becomes contaminated with DBCP, you must immediately 
and thoroughly wash or shower with soap or mild detergent and water to 
remove any DBCP from your skin.
    E. You must not keep food, beverages, cosmetics, or smoking 
materials, nor eat or smoke, in regulated areas.
    F. If you work in a regulated area, you must wash your hands 
thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water, before eating, smoking 
or using toilet facilities.
    G. If you work in a regulated area, you must remove any protective 
equipment or clothing before leaving the regulated area.
    H. Ask your supervisor where DBCP is used in your work area and for 
any additional safety and health rules.

                        vi. Access to Information

    A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the 
information contained in this Substance Safety Data Sheet for DBCP. In 
addition, your employer must instruct you in the safe use of DBCP, 
emergency procedures, and the correct use of protective equipment.
    B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being 
exposed to DBCP. You or your representative have the right to observe 
employee exposure measurements and to record the result obtained. Your 
employer is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer 
determines that you are being overexposed, he is required to inform you 
of the actions which are being taken to reduce your exposure.
    C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposure and 
medical examinations. Your employer is required to keep exposure and 
medical data for at least 40 years or the duration of your employment 
plus 20 years, whichever is longer.
    D. Your employer is required to release exposure and medical records 
to you, your physician, or other individual designated by you upon your 
written request.

              ii. Fire Explosion and Reactivity Hazard Data

    A. Fire
    1. Flash point: 170F (77C)
    2. Autoignition temperature: Data not available.
    3. Flammable limits in air, percent by volume: Data not available.
    4. Extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide, dry chemical.
    5. Special fire-fighting procedures: Do not use a solid stream of 
water since a stream will scatter and spread the fire. Use water spray 
to cool containers exposed to a fire.
    6. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: None known.
    7. For purposes of complying with the requirements of Sec. 1910.106, 
liquid DBCP is classified as a Class III A combustible liquid.
    8. For the purpose of complying with Sec. 1910.309, the 
classification of hazardous locations as described in article 500 of the 
National Electrical Code for DBCP shall be Class I, Group D.
    9. For the purpose of compliance with Sec. 1910.157, DBCP is 
classified as a Class B fire hazard.
    10. For the purpose of compliance with Sec. 1910.178, locations 
classified as hazardous locations due to the presence of DBCP shall be 
Class I, Group D.
    11. Sources of ignition are prohibited where DBCP presents a fire or 
explosion hazard.
    B. Reactivity
    1. Conditions contributing to instability: None known.
    2. Incompatibilities: Reacts with chemically active metals, such as 
aluminum, magnesium and tin alloys.
    3. Hazardous decomposition products: Toxic gases and vapors (such as 
HBr, HCl and carbon monoxide) may be released in a fire involving DBCP.
    4. Special precautions: DBCP will attack some rubber materials and 
coatings.

                iii. Spill, Leak and Disposal Procedures

    A. If DBCP is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be 
taken:
    1. The area should be evacuated at once and re-entered only after 
thorough ventilation.
    2. Ventilate area of spill or leak.
    3. If in liquid form, collect for reclamation or absorb in paper, 
vermiculite, dry sand, earth or similar material.
    4. If in solid form, collect spilled material in the most convenient 
and safe manner for reclamation or for disposal.
    B. Persons not wearing protective equipment must be restricted from 
areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been completed.
    C. Waste Disposal Methods:
    1. For small quantities of liquid DBCP, absorb on paper towels, 
remove to a safe place (such as a fume hood) and burn the paper. Large 
quantities can be reclaimed or collected and atomized in a suitable 
combustion chamber equipped with an appropriate effluent gas cleaning 
device. If liquid DBCP is absorbed in vermiculite, dry sand, earth or 
similar material and placed in sealed containers it may be disposed of 
in a State-approved sanitary landfill.
    2. If in solid form, for small quantities, place on paper towels, 
remove to a safe place (such as a fume hood) and burn. Large quantities 
may be reclaimed. However, if this is not practical, dissolve in a 
flammable solvent (such as alcohol) and atomize in a suitable combustion 
chamber equipped with an appropriate effluent gas cleaning device. DBCP 
in solid form may also be disposed in a state-approved sanitary 
landfill.

                iv. Monitoring and Measurement Procedures

    A. Exposure above the permissible exposure limit.
    1. Eight Hour Exposure Evaluation: Measurements taken for the 
purpose of determining employee exposure under this section are best 
taken so that the average 8-hour exposure may be determined from a 
single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour samples. Air samples should be 
taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly 
represent that inhaled by the employee).
    2. Monitoring Techniques: The sampling and analysis under this 
section may be performed by collecting the DBCP vapor on petroleum based 
charcoal absorption tubes with subsequent chemical analyses. The method 
of measurement chosen should determine the concentration of airborne 
DBCP at the permissible exposure limit to an accuracy of plus or minus 
25 percent. If charcoal tubes are used, a total volume of 10 liters 
should be collected at a flow rate of 50 cc. per minute for each tube. 
Analyze the resultant samples as you would samples of halogenated 
solvent.
    B. Since many of the duties relating to employee protection are 
dependent on the results of monitoring and measuring procedures, 
employers should assure that the evaluation of employee exposures is 
performed by a competent industrial hygienist or other technically 
qualified person.

                         v. Protective Clothing

    Employees should be required to wear appropriate protective clothing 
to prevent any possibility of skin contact with DBCP. Because DBCP is 
absorbed through the skin, it

[[Page 313]]

is important to prevent skin contact with both liquid and solid forms of 
DBCP. Protective clothing should include impermeable coveralls or 
similar fullbody work clothing, gloves, headcoverings, and workshoes or 
shoe coverings. Standard rubber and neoprene gloves do not offer 
adequate protection and should not be relied upon to keep DBCP off the 
skin. DBCP should never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and 
shoes should not be allowed to become contaminated with the material, 
and if they do, they should be promptly removed and not worn again until 
completely free of the material. Any protective clothing which has 
developed leaks or is otherwise found to be defective should be repaired 
or replaced. Employees should also be required to wear splash-proof 
safety goggles where there is any possibility of DBCP contacting the 
eyes.

                 vi. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities

    1. The workplace must be kept clean, orderly and in a sanitary 
condition;
    2. Dry sweeping and the use of compressed air is unsafe for the 
cleaning of floors and other surfaces where DBCP dust or liquids are 
found. To minimize the contamination of air with dust, vacuuming with 
either portable or permanent systems must be used. If a portable unit is 
selected, the exhaust must be attached to the general workplace exhaust 
ventilation system, or collected within the vacuum unit equipped with 
high efficiency filters or other appropriate means of contamination 
removal and not used for other purposes. Units used to collect DBCP must 
be labeled.
    3. Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water must be 
provided, and maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing 
agents should also be provided to assure the effective removal of DBCP 
from the skin.
    4. Change or dressing rooms with individual clothes storage 
facilities must be provided to prevent the contamination of street 
clothes with DBCP. Because of the hazardous nature of DBCP, contaminated 
protective clothing must be stored in closed containers for cleaning or 
disposal.

                     vii. Miscellaneous Precautions

    A. Store DBCP in tightly closed containers in a cool, well 
ventilated area.
    B. Use of supplied-air suits or other impervious clothing (such as 
acid suits) may be necessary to prevent skin contact with DBCP. 
Supplied-air suits should be selected, used, and maintained under the 
supervision of persons knowlegeable in the limitations and potential 
life-endangering characteristics of supplied-air suits.
    C. The use of air-conditioned suits may be necessary in warmer 
climates.
    D. Advise employees of all areas and operations where exposure to 
DBCP could occur.

                         viii. Common Operations

    Common operations in which exposure to DBCP is likely to occur are: 
during its production; and during its formulation into pesticides and 
fumigants.

 Appendix C to Sec. 1910.1044--Medical Surveillance Guidelines For DBCP

                            i. Route of Entry

    Inhalation; skin absorption

                             ii. Toxicology

    Recent data collected on workers involved in the manufacture and 
formulation of DBCP has shown that DBCP can cause sterility at very low 
levels of exposure. This finding is supported by studies showing that 
DBCP causes sterility in animals. Chronic exposure to DBCP resulted in 
pronounced necrotic action on the parenchymatous organs (i.e., liver, 
kidney, spleen) and on the testicles of rats at concentrations as low as 
5 ppm. Rats that were chronically exposed to DBCP also showed changes in 
the composition of the blood, showing low RBC, hemoglobin, and WBC, and 
high reticulocyte levels as well as functional hepatic disturbance, 
manifesting itself in a long prothrombin time. Reznik et al. noted a 
single dose of 100 mg produced profound depression of the nervous system 
of rats. Their condition gradually improved. Acute exposure also 
resulted in the destruction of the sex gland activity of male rats as 
well as causing changes in the estrous cycle in female rats. Animal 
studies have also associated DBCP with an increased incidence of 
carcinoma. Olson, et al. orally administered DBCP to rats and mice 5 
times per week at experimentally predetermined maximally tolerated doses 
and at half those doses. As early as ten weeks after initiation of 
treatment, DBCP induced a high incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of 
the stomach with metastases in both species. DBCP also induced mammary 
adenocarcinomas in the female rats at both dose levels.

                         iii. Signs and Symptoms

    A. Inhalation: Nausea, eye irritation, conjunctivitis, respiratory 
irritation, pulmonary congestion or edema, CNS depression with apathy, 
sluggishness, and ataxia.
    B. Dermal: Erythema or inflammation and dermatitis on repeated 
exposure.

                            iv. Special Tests

    A. Semen analysis: The following information excerpted from the 
document ``Evaluation of Testicular Function'', submitted by the 
Corporate Medical Department of the Shell Oil Company (exhibit 39-3), 
may be useful to physicians conducting the medical surveillance program;

[[Page 314]]

    In performing semen analyses certain minimal but specific criteria 
should be met:
    1. It is recommended that a minimum of three valid semen analyses be 
obtained in order to make a determination of an individual's average 
sperm count.
    2. A period of sexual abstinence is necessary prior to the 
collection of each masturbatory sample. It is recommended that 
intercourse or masturbation be performed 48 hours before the actual 
specimen collection. A period of 48 hours of abstinence would follow; 
then the masturbatory sample would be collected.
    3. Each semen specimen should be collected in a clean, widemouthed, 
glass jar (not necessarily pre-sterilized) in a manner designated by the 
examining physician. Any part of the seminal fluid exam should be 
initialed only after liquifaction is complete, i.e., 30 to 45 minutes 
after collection.
    4. Semen volume should be measured to the nearest \1/10\ of a cubic 
centimeter.
    5. Sperm density should be determined using routine techniques 
involving the use of a white cell pipette and a hemocytometer chamber. 
The immobilizing fluid most effective and most easily obtained for this 
process is distilled water.
    6. Thin, dry smears of the semen should be made for a morphologic 
classification of the sperm forms and should be stained with either 
hematoxalin or the more difficult, yet more precise, Papanicolaou 
technique. Also of importance to record is obvious sperm agglutination, 
pyospermia, delayed liquifaction (greater than 30 minutes), and 
hyperviscosity. In addition, pH, using nitrazine paper, should be 
determined.
    7. A total morphology evaluation should include percentages of the 
following:
    a. Normal (oval) forms,
    b. Tapered forms,
    c. Amorphous forms (include large and small sperm shapes),
    d. Duplicated (either heads or tails) forms, and
    e. Immature forms.
    8. Each sample should be evaluated for sperm viability (percent 
viable sperm moving at the time of examination) as well as sperm 
motility (subjective characterization of ``purposeful forward sperm 
progression'' of the majority of those viable sperm analyzed) within two 
hours after collection, ideally by the same or equally qualified 
examiner.
    B. Serum determinations: The following serum determinations should 
be performed by radioimmuno-assay techniques using National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) specific antigen or antigen preparations of equivalent 
sensitivity:
    1. Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH);
    2. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH); and
    3. Serum total estrogen (females only).

                              v. Treatment

    Remove from exposure immediately, give oxygen or artificial 
resuscitation if indicated. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be 
removed immediately. Flush eyes and wash contaminated skin. If swallowed 
and the person is conscious, induce vomiting. Recovery from mild 
exposures is usually rapid and complete.

             vi. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations

    A. Other considerations. DBCP can cause both acute and chronic 
effects. It is important that the physician become familiar with the 
operating conditions in which exposure to DBCP occurs. Those with 
respiratory disorders may not tolerate the wearing of negative pressure 
respirators.
    B. Surveillance and screening. Medical histories and laboratory 
examinations are required for each employee subject to exposure to DBCP. 
The employer should screen employees for history of certain medical 
conditions (listed below) which might place the employee at increased 
risk from exposure.
    1. Liver disease. The primary site of biotransformation and 
detoxification of DBCP is the liver. Liver dysfunctions likely to 
inhibit the conjugation reactions will tend to promote the toxic actions 
of DBCP. These precautions should be considered before exposing persons 
with impaired liver function to DBCP.
    2. Renal disease. Because DBCP has been associated with injury to 
the kidney it is important that special consideration be given to those 
with possible impairment of renal function.
    3. Skin desease. DBCP can penetrate the skin and can cause erythema 
on prolonged exposure. Persons with pre-existing skin disorders may be 
more susceptible to the effects of DBCP.
    4. Blood dyscrasias. DBCP has been shown to decrease the content of 
erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and leukocytes in the blood, as well as 
increase the prothrombin time. Persons with existing blood disorders may 
be more susceptible to the effects of DBCP.
    5. Reproductive disorders. Animal studies have associated DBCP with 
various effects on the reproductive organs. Among these effects are 
atrophy of the testicles and changes in the estrous cycle. Persons with 
pre-existing reproductive disorders may be at increased risk to these 
effects of DBCP.

     Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1045--Substance Safety Data Sheet for 
                              Acrylonitrile

                       i. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: Acrylonitrile (CH<INF>2</INF> CHCN).
    B. Synonyms: Propenenitrile; vinyl cyanide; cyanoethylene; AN; VCN; 
acylon; carbacryl; fumigrian; ventox.
    C. Acrylonitrile can be found as a liquid or vapor, and can also be 
found in polymer resins, rubbers, plastics, polyols, and other polymers 
having acrylonitrile as a raw or intermediate material.
    D. AN is used in the manufacture of acrylic and modiacrylic fibers, 
acrylic plastics and resins, speciality polymers, nitrile rubbers, and 
other organic chemicals. It has also been used as a fumigant.
    E. Appearance and odor: Colorless to pale yellow liquid with a 
pungent odor which can only be detected at concentrations above the 
permissible exposure level, in a range of 13-19 parts AN per million 
parts of air (13-19 ppm).
    F. Permissible exposure: Exposure may not exceed either:
    1. Two parts AN per million parts of air (2 ppm) averaged over the 
8-hour workday; or
    2. Ten parts AN per million parts of air (10 ppm) averaged over any 
15-minute period in the workday.
    3. In addition, skin and eye contact with liquid AN is prohibited.

[[Page 323]]

                         ii. Health Hazard Data

    A. Acrylonitrile can affect your body if you inhale the vapor 
(breathing), if it comes in contact with your eyes or skin, or if you 
swallow it. It may enter your body through your skin.
    B. Effects of overexposure: 1. Short-term exposure: Acrylonitrile 
can cause eye irritation, nausea, vomiting, headache, sneezing, 
weakness, and light-headedness. At high concentrations, the effects of 
exposure may go on to loss of consciousness and death. When 
acrylonitrile is held in contact with the skin after being absorbed into 
shoe leather or clothing, it may produce blisters following several 
hours of no apparent effect. Unless the shoes or clothing are removed 
immediately and the area washed, blistering will occur. Usually there is 
no pain or inflammation associated with blister formation.
    2. Long-term exposure: Acrylonitrile has been shown to cause cancer 
in laboratory animals and has been associated with higher incidences of 
cancer in humans. Repeated or prolonged exposure of the skin to 
acrylonitrile may produce irritation and dermatitis.
    3. Reporting signs and symptoms: You should inform your employer if 
you develop any signs or symptoms and suspect they are caused by 
exposure to acrylonitrile.

                   iii. Emergency First Aid Procedures

    A. Eye exposure: If acrylonitrile gets into your eyes, wash your 
eyes immediately with large amounts of water, lifting the lower and 
upper lids occasionally. Get medical attention immediately. Contact 
lenses should not be worn when working with this chemical.
    B. Skin exposure: If acrylonitrile gets on your skin, immediately 
wash the contaminated skin with water. If acrylonitrile soaks through 
your clothing, especially your shoes, remove the clothing immediately 
and wash the skin with water. If symptoms occur after washing, get 
medical attention immediately. Thoroughly wash the clothing before 
reusing. Contaminated leather shoes or other leather articles should be 
discarded.
    C. Inhalation: If you or any other person breathes in large amounts 
of acrylonitrile, move the exposed person to fresh air at once. If 
breathing has stopped, perform artificial respiration. Keep the affected 
person warm and at rest. Get medical attention as soon as possible.
    D. Swallowing: When acrylonitrile has been swallowed, give the 
person large quantities of water immediately. After the water has been 
swallowed, try to get the person to vomit by having him touch the back 
of his throat with his finger. Do not make an unconscious person vomit. 
Get medical attention immediately.
    E. Rescue: Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure. If 
the exposed person has been overcome, notify someone else and put into 
effect the established emergency procedures. Do not become a casualty 
yourself. Understand your emergency rescue procedures and know the 
location of the emergency equipment before the need arises.
    F. Special first aid procedures: First aid kits containing an 
adequate supply (at least two dozen) of amyl nitrite pearls, each 
containing 0.3 ml, should be maintained at each site where acrylonitrile 
is used. When a person is suspected of receiving an overexposure to 
acrylonitrile, immediately remove that person from the contaminated area 
using established rescue procedures. Contaminated clothing must be 
removed and the acrylonitrile washed from the skin immediately. 
Artificial respiration should be started at once if breathing has 
stopped. If the person is unconscious, amyl nitrite may be used as an 
antidote by a properly trained individual in accordance with established 
emergency procedures. Medical aid should be obtained immediately.

                 iv. Respirators and Protective Clothing

    A. Respirators. You may be required to wear a respirator for 
nonroutine activities, in emergencies, while your employer is in the 
process of reducing acrylonitrile exposures through engineering 
controls, and in areas where engineering controls are not feasible. If 
respirators are worn, they must have a label issued by the National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health under the provisions of 42 
CFR part 84 stating that the respirators have been approved for use with 
organic vapors. For effective protection, respirators must fit your face 
and head snugly. Respirators must not be loosened or removed in work 
situations where their use is required.
    Acrylonitrile does not have a detectable odor except at levels above 
the permissible exposure limits. Do not depend on odor to warn you when 
a respirator cartridge or canister is exhausted. Cartridges or canisters 
must be changed daily or before the end-of-service-life, whichever comes 
first. Reuse of these may allow acrylonitrille to gradually filter 
through the cartridge and cause exposures which you cannot detect by 
odor. If you can smell acrylonitrile while wearing a respirator, proceed 
immediately to fresh air. If you experience difficulty breathing while 
wearing a respirator, tell your employer.
    B. Supplied-air suits: In some work situations, the wearing of 
supplied-air suits may be necessary. Your employer must instruct you in 
their proper use and operation.
    C. Protective clothing: You must wear impervious clothing, gloves, 
face shield, or other appropriate protective clothing to prevent skin 
contact with liquid acrylonitrile. Where protective clothing is 
required, your

[[Page 324]]

employer is required to provide clean garments to you as necessary to 
assume that the clothing protects you adequately.
    Replace or repair impervious clothing that has developed leaks.
    Acrylonitrile should never be allowed to remain on the skin. 
Clothing and shoes which are not impervious to acrylonitrile should not 
be allowed to become contaminated with acrylonitrile, and if they do the 
clothing and shoes should be promptly removed and decontaminated. The 
clothing should be laundered or discarded after the AN is removed. Once 
acrylonitrile penetrates shoes or other leather articles, they should 
not be worn again.
    D. Eye protection: You must wear splashproof safety goggles in areas 
where liquid acrylonitrile may contact your eyes. In addition, contact 
lenses should not be worn in areas where eye contact with acrylonitrile 
can occur.

           v. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling, and Storage

    A. Acrylonitrile is a flammable liquid, and its vapors can easily 
form explosive mixtures in air.
    B. Acrylonitrile must be stored in tightly closed containers in a 
cool, well-ventilated area, away from heat, sparks, flames, strong 
oxidizers (especially bromine), strong bases, copper, copper alloys, 
ammonia, and amines.
    C. Sources of ignition such as smoking and open flames are 
prohibited wherever acrylonitrile is handled, used, or stored in a 
manner that could create a potential fire or explosion hazard.
    D. You should use non-sparking tools when opening or closing metal 
containers of acrylonitrile, and containers must be bonded and grounded 
when pouring or transferring liquid acrylonitrile.
    E. You must immediately remove any non-impervious clothing that 
becomes wetted with acrylonitrile, and this clothing must not be reworn 
until the acrylonitrile is removed from the clothing.
    F. Impervious clothing wet with liquid acrylonitrile can be easily 
ignited. This clothing must be washed down with water before you remove 
it.
    G. If your skin becomes wet with liquid acrylonitrile, you must 
promptly and thoroughly wash or shower with soap or mild detergent to 
remove any acrylonitrile from your skin.
    H. You must not keep food, beverages, or smoking materials, nor are 
you permitted to eat or smoke in regulated areas where acrylonitrile 
concentrations are above the permissible exposure limits.
    I. If you contact liquid acrylonitrile, you must wash your hands 
thoroughly with soap or mild detergent and water before eating, smoking, 
or using toilet facilities.
    J. Fire extinguishers and quick drenching facilities must be readily 
available, and you should know where they are and how to operate them.
    K. Ask your supervisor where acrylonitrile is used in your work area 
and for any additional plant safety and health rules.

                        vi. Access to Information

    A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the 
information contained in this Substance Safety Data Sheet for 
acrylonitrile. In addition, you employer must instruct you in the proper 
work practices for using acrylonitrile, emergency procedures, and the 
correct use of protective equipment.
    B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being 
exposed to acrylonitrile. You or your representative has the right to 
observe employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your 
employer is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer 
determines that you are being overexposed, he or she is required to 
inform you of the actions which are being taken to reduce your exposure 
to within permissible exposure limits.
    C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and 
medical examinations. These records must be kept by the employer for at 
least forty (40) years or for the period of your employment plus twenty 
(20) years, whichever is longer.
    D. Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical 
records to you or your representative upon your request.

    Appendix B to Sec. 1910.1045--Substance Technical Guidelines for 
                              Acrylonitrile

                      i. Physical and Chemical Data

    A. Substance identification: 1. Synonyms: AN; VCN; vinyl cyanide; 
propenenitrile; cyanoethylene; Acrylon; Carbacryl; Fumigrain; Ventox.
    2. Formula: CH2=CHCN.
    3. Molecular weight: 53.1.
    B. Physical data: 1. Boiling point (760 mm Hg): 77.3  deg.C (171 
deg.F);
    2. Specific gravity (water=1): 0.81 (at 20  deg.C or 68  deg.F);
    3. Vapor density (air=1 at boiling point of acrylonitrile): 1.83;
    4. Melting point: -83  deg.C (-117  deg.F);
    5. Vapor pressure (@20  deg.F): 83 mm Hg;
    6. Solubility in water, percent by weight @20  deg.C (68  deg.F): 
7.35;
    7. Evaporation rate (Butyl Acetate=1): 4.54; and
    8. Appearance and odor: Colorless to pale yellow liquid with a 
pungent odor at concentrations above the permissible exposure level. Any 
detectable odor of acrylonitrile may indicate overexposure.

[[Page 325]]

             ii. Fire, Explosion, and Reactivity Hazard Data

    A. Fire: 1. Flash point: -1  deg.C (30  deg.F) (closed cup).
    2. Autoignition temperature: 481  deg.C (898  deg.F).
    3. Flammable limits air, percent by volume: Lower: 3, Upper: 17.
    4. Extinguishing media: Alcohol foam, carbon dioxide, and dry 
chemical.
    5. Special fire-fighting procedures: Do not use a solid stream of 
water, since the stream will scatter and spread the fire. Use water to 
cool containers exposed to a fire.
    6. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: Acrylonitrile is a flammable 
liquid. Its vapors can easily form explosive mixtures with air. All 
ignition sources must be controlled where acrylonitrile is handled, 
used, or stored in a manner that could create a potential fire or 
explosion hazard. Acrylonitrile vapors are heavier than air and may 
travel along the ground and be ignited by open flames or sparks at 
locations remote from the site at which acrylonitrile is being handled.
    7. For purposes of compliance with the requirements of 29 CFR 
1910.106, acrylonitrile is classified as a class IB flammable liquid. 
For example, 7,500 ppm, approximately one-fourth of the lower flammable 
limit, would be considered to pose a potential fire and explosion 
hazard.
    8. For purposes of compliance with 29 CFR 1910.157, acrylonitrile is 
classified as a Class B fire hazard.
    9. For purpose of compliance with 29 CFR 1919.309, locations 
classified as hazardous due to the presence of acrylonitrile shall be 
Class I, Group D.
    B. Reactivity:
    1. Conditions contributing to instability: Acrylonitrile will 
polymerize when hot, and the additional heat liberated by the 
polymerization may cause containers to explode. Pure AN may self-
polymerize, with a rapid build-up of pressure, resulting in an explosion 
hazard. Inhibitors are added to the commercial product to prevent self-
polymerization.
    2. Incompatibilities: Contact with strong oxidizers (especially 
bromine) and strong bases may cause fires and explosions. Contact with 
copper, copper alloys, ammonia, and amines may start serious 
decomposition.
    3. Hazardous decompostion products: Toxic gases and vapors (such as 
hydrogen cyanide, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide) may be 
released in a fire involving acrylonitrile and certain polymers made 
from acrylonitrile.
    4. Special precautions: Liquid acrylonitrile will attack some forms 
of plastics, rubbers, and coatings.

                iii. Spill, Leak, and Disposal Procedures

    A. If acrylonitrile is spilled or leaked, the following steps should 
be taken:
    1. Remove all ignition sources.
    2. The area should be evacuated at once and re-entered only after 
the area has been thoroughly ventilated and washed down with water.
    3. If liquid acrylonitrile or polymer intermediate, collect for 
reclamation or absorb in paper, vermiculite, dry sand, earth, or similar 
material, or wash down with water into process sewer system.
    B. Persons not wearing protective equipment should be restricted 
from areas of spills or leaks until clean-up has been completed.
    C. Waste disposal methods: Waste material shall be disposed of in a 
manner that is not hazardous to employees or to the general population. 
Spills of acrylonitrile and flushing of such spills shall be channeled 
for appropriate treatment or collection for disposal. They shall not be 
channeled directly into the sanitary sewer system. In selecting the 
method of waste disposal, applicable local, State, and Federal 
regulations should be consulted.

                iv. Monitoring and Measurement Procedures

    A. Exposure above the Permissible Exposure Limit:
    1. Eight-hour exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the 
purpose of determining employee exposure under this section are best 
taken so that the average 8-hour exposure may be determined from a 
single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour samples. Air samples should be 
taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly 
represent that inhaled by the employee.)
    2. Ceiling evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose of 
determining employee exposure under this section must be taken during 
periods of maximum expected airborne concentrations of acrylonitrile in 
the employee's breathing zone. A minimum of three (3) measurements 
should be taken on one work shift. The average of all measurements taken 
is an estimate of the employee's ceiling exposure.
    3. Monitoring techniques: The sampling and analysis under this 
section may be performed by collecting the acrylonitrile vapor on 
charcoal adsorption tubes or other composition adsorption tubes, with 
subsequent chemical analysis. Sampling and analysis may also be 
performed by instruments such as real-time continuous monitoring 
systems, portable direct-reading instruments, or passive dosimeters. 
Analysis of resultant samples should be by gas chromatograph.
    Appendix D lists methods of sampling and analysis which have been 
tested by NIOSH and OSHA for use with acrylonitrile. NIOSH and OSHA have 
validated modifications of

[[Page 326]]

NIOSH Method S-156 (See Appendix D) under laboratory conditions for 
concentrations below 1 ppm. The employer has the obligation of selecting 
a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements 
of the standard under his unique field conditions. The standard requires 
that methods of monitoring must be accurate, to a 95-percent confidence 
level, to <plus-minus>35-percent for concentrations of AN at or above 2 
ppm, and to <plus-minus>-50-percent for concentrations below 2 ppm. In 
addition to the methods described in Appendix D, there are numerous 
other methods available for monitoring for AN in the workplace. Details 
on these other methods have been submitted by various companies to the 
rulemaking record, and are available at the OSHA Docket Office.
    B. Since many of the duties relating to employee exposure are 
dependent on the results of monitoring and measuring procedures, 
employers shall assure that the evaluation of employee exposures is 
performed by a competent industrial hygienist or other technically 
qualified person.

                         v. Protective Clothing

    Employees shall be provided with and required to wear appropriate 
protective clothing to prevent any possibility of skin contact with 
liquid AN. Because acrylonitrile is absorbed through the skin, it is 
important to prevent skin contact with liquid AN. Protective clothing 
shall include impermeable coveralls or similar full-body work clothing, 
gloves, head-coverings, as appropriate to protect areas of the body 
which may come in contact with liquid AN.
    Employers should ascertain that the protective garmets are 
impermeable to acrylonitrile. Non-impermeable clothing and shoes should 
not be allowed to become contaminated with liquid AN. If permeable 
clothing does become contaminated, it should be promptly removed, placed 
in a regulated area for removal of the AN, and not worn again until the 
AN is removed. If leather footwear or other leather garments become wet 
from acrylonitrile, they should be replaced and not worn again, due to 
the ability of leather to absorb acrylonitrile and hold it against the 
skin. Since there is no pain associated with the blistering which may 
result from skin contact with liquid AN, it is essential that the 
employee be informed of this hazard so that he or she can be protected.
    Any protective clothing which has developed leaks or is otherwise 
found to be defective shall be repaired or replaced. Clean protective 
clothing shall be provided to the employee as necessary to assure its 
protectiveness. Whenever impervious clothing becomes wet with liquid AN, 
it shall be washed down with water before being removed by the employee. 
Employees are also required to wear splash-proof safety goggles where 
there is any possibility of acrylonitrile contacting the eyes.

                 vi. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities

    For purposes of complying with 29 CFR 1910.141, the following items 
should be emphasized:
    A. The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanitary 
condition. The employer is required to institute a leak and spill 
detection program for operations involving liquid AN in order to detect 
sources of fugitive AN emissions.
    B. Dry sweeping and the use of compressed air is unsafe for the 
cleaning of floors and other surfaces where liquid AN may be found.
    C. Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water are to be 
provided, and maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing 
agents are also to be provided to assure the effective removal of 
acrylonitrile from the skin.
    D. Change or dressing rooms with individual clothes storage 
facilities must be provided to prevent the contamination of street 
clothes with acrylonitrile. Because of the hazardous nature of 
acrylonitrile, contaminated protective clothing should be placed in a 
regulated area designated by the employer for removal of the AN before 
the clothing is laundered or disposed of.

                     vii. Miscellaneous Precautions

    A. Store acrylonitrile in tightly-closed containers in a cool, well-
ventilated area and take necessary precautions to avoid any explosion 
hazard.
    B. High exposures to acrylonitrile can occur when transferring the 
liquid from one container to another.
    C. Non-sparking tools must be used to open and close metal 
acrylonitrile containers. These containers must be effectively grounded 
and bonded prior to pouring.
    D. Never store uninhibited acrylonitrile.
    E. Acrylonitrile vapors are not inhibited. They may form polymers 
and clog vents of storage tanks.
    F. Use of supplied-air suits or other impervious coverings may be 
necessary to prevent skin contact with and provide respiratory 
protection from acrylonitrile where the concentration of acrylonitrile 
is unknown or is above the ceiling limit. Supplied-air suits should be 
selected, used, and maintained under the immediate supervision of 
persons knowledgeable in the limitations and potential life-endangering 
characteristics of supplied-air suits.
    G. Employers shall advise employees of all areas and operations 
where exposure to acrylonitrile could occur.

[[Page 327]]

                         viii. Common Operations

    Common operations in which exposure to acrylonitrile is likely to 
occur include the following: Manufacture of the acrylonitrile monomer; 
synthesis of acrylic fibers, ABS, SAN, and nitrile barrier plastics and 
resins, nitrile rubber, surface coatings, specialty chemicals, use as a 
chemical intermediate, use as a fumigant and in the cyanoethylation of 
cotton.

   Appendix C to Sec. 1910.1045--Medical Surveillance Guidelines for 
                              Acrylonitrile

                            i. route of entry

    Inhalation; skin absorption; ingestion.

                             ii. toxicology

    Acrylonitrile vapor is an asphyxiant due to inhibitory action on 
metabolic enzyme systems. Animals exposed to 75 or 100 ppm for 7 hours 
have shown signs of anoxia; in some animals which died at the higher 
level, cyanomethemoglobin was found in the blood. Two human fatalities 
from accidental poisioning have been reported; one was caused by 
inhalation of an unknown concentration of the vapor, and the other was 
thought to be caused by skin absorption or inhalation. Most cases of 
intoxication from industrial exposure have been mild, with rapid onset 
of eye irritation, headache, sneezing, and nausea. Weakness, 
lightheadedness, and vomiting may also occur. Exposure to high 
concentrations may produce profound weakness, asphyxia, and death. The 
vapor is a severe eye irritant. Prolonged skin contract with the liquid 
may result in absorption with systemic effects, and in the formation of 
large blisters after a latent period of several hours. Although there is 
usually little or no pain or inflammation, the affected skin resembles a 
second-degree thermal burn. Solutions spilled on exposed skin, or on 
areas covered only by a light layer of clothing, evaporate rapidly, 
leaving no irritation, or, at the most, mild transient redness. Repeated 
spills on exposed skin may result in dermatitis due to solvent effects.
    Results after 1 year of a planned 2-year animal study on the effects 
of exposure to acrylonitrile have indicated that rats ingesting as 
little as 35 ppm in their drinking water develop tumors of the central 
nervous system. The interim results of this study have been supported by 
a similar study being conducted by the same laboratory, involving 
exposure of rats by inhalation of acrylonitrile vapor, which has shown 
similar types of tumors in animals exposed to 80 ppm.
    In addition, the preliminary results of an epidemiological study 
being performed by duPont on a cohort of workers in their Camden, S.C. 
acrylic fiber plant indicate a statistically significant increase in the 
incidence of colon and lung cancers among employees exposed to 
acrylonitrile.

              iii. signs and symptoms of acute overexposure

    Asphyxia and death can occur from exposure to high concentrations of 
acrylonitrile. Symptoms of overexposure include eye irritation, 
headache, sneezing, nausea and vomiting, weakness, and light-headedness. 
Prolonged skin contact can cause blisters on the skin with appearance of 
a second-degree burn, but with little or no pain. Repeated skin contact 
may produce scaling dermatits.

                   iv. treatment of acute overexposure

    Remove employee from exposure. Immediately flush eyes with water and 
wash skin with soap or mild detergent and water. If AN has been 
swallowed, and person is conscious, induce vomiting. Give artificial 
resuscitation if indicated. More severe cases, such as those associated 
with loss of consciousness, may be treated by the intravenous 
administration of sodium nitrite, followed by sodium thiosulfate, 
although this is not as effective for acrylonitrile poisoning as for 
inorganic cyanide poisoning.

              v. surveillance and preventive considerations

    A. As noted above, exposure to acrylonitrile has been linked to 
increased incidence of cancers of the colon and lung in employees of the 
duPont acrylic fiber plant in Camden, S.C. In addition, the animal 
testing of acrylonitrile has resulted in the development of cancers of 
the central nervous system in rats exposed by either inhalation or 
ingestion. The physician should be aware of the findings of these 
studies in evaluating the health of employees exposed to acrylonitrile.
    Most reported acute effects of occupational exposure to 
acrylonitrile are due to its ability to cause tissue anoxia and 
asphyxia. The effects are similar to those caused by hydrogen cyanide. 
Liquid acrylonitrile can be absorbed through the skin upon prolonged 
contact. The liquid readily penetrates leather, and will produce burns 
of the feet if footwear contaminated with acrylonitrile is not removed.
    It is important for the physician to become familiar with the 
operating conditions in which exposure to acrylonitrile may occur. Those 
employees with skin diseases may not tolerate the wearing of whatever 
protective clothing may be necessary to protect them from exposure. In 
addition, those with chronic respiratory disease may not tolerate the 
wearing of negative-pressure respirators.
    B. Surveillance and screening. Medical histories and laboratory 
examinations are required for each employee subject to exposure

[[Page 328]]

to acrylonitrile above the action level. The employer must screen 
employees for history of certain medical conditions which might place 
the employee at increased risk from exposure.
    1. Central nervous system dysfunction. Acute effects of exposure to 
acrylonitrile generally involve the central nervous system. Symptoms of 
acrylonitrile exposure include headache, nausea, dizziness, and general 
weakness. The animal studies cited above suggest possible carcinogenic 
effects of acrylonitrile on the central nervous system, since rats 
exposed by either inhalation or ingestion have developed similar CNS 
tumors.
    2. Respiratory disease. The du Pont data indicate an increased risk 
of lung cancer among employees exposed to acrylonitrile.
    3. Gastrointestinal disease. The du Pont data indicate an increased 
risk of cancer of the colon among employees exposed to acrylonitrile. In 
addition, the animal studies show possible tumor production in the 
stomachs of the rats in the ingestion study.
    4. Skin disease. Acrylonitrile can cause skin burns when prolonged 
skin contact with the liquid occurs. In addition, repeated skin contact 
with the liquid can cause dermatitis.
    5. General. The purpose of the medical procedures outlined in the 
standard is to establish a baseline for future health monitoring. 
Persons unusually susceptible to the effects of anoxia or those with 
anemia would be expected to be at increased risk. In addition to 
emphasis on the CNS, respiratory and gastro-intestinal systems, the 
cardiovascular system, liver, and kidney function should also be

   Appendix D to Sec. 1910.1045--Sampling and Analytical Methods for 
                              Acrylonitrile

    There are many methods available for monitoring employee exposures 
to acrylonitrile. Most of these involve the use of charcoal tubes and 
sampling pumps, with analysis by gas chromatograph. The essential 
differences between the charcoal tube methods include, among others, the 
use of different desorbing solvents, the use of different lots of 
charcoal, and the use of different equipment for analysis of the 
samples.
    Besides charcoal, considerable work has been performed on methods 
using porous polymer sampling tubes and passive dosimeters. In addition, 
there are several portable gas analyzers and monitoring units available 
on the open market.
    This appendix contains details for the methods which have been 
tested at OSHA Analytical Laboratory in Salt Lake City, and NIOSH in 
Cincinnati. Each is a variation on NIOSH Method S-156, which is also 
included for reference. This does not indicate that these methods are 
the only ones which will be satisfactory. There also may be workplace 
situations in which these methods are not adequate, due to such factors 
as high humidity. Copies of the other methods available to OSHA are 
available in the rulemaking record, and may be obtained from the OSHA 
Docket Office. These include, the Union Carbide, Monsanto, Dow Chemical 
and Dow Badische methods, as well as NISOH Method P & CAM 127.
    Employers who note problems with sample breakthrough should try 
larger charcoal tubes. Tubes of larger capacity are available, and are 
often used for sampling vinyl chloride. In addition, lower flow rates 
and shorter sampling times should be beneficial in minimizing 
breakthrough problems.
    Whatever method the employer chooses, he must assure himself of the 
method's accuracy and precision under the unique conditions present in 
his workplace.

                     NIOSH Method S-156 (Unmodified)

Analyte: Acrylonitrile.
Matrix: Air.
Procedure: Absorption on charcoal, desorption with methanol, GC.

    1. Principle of the method (Reference 11.1).
    1.1 A known volume of air is drawn through a charcoal tube to trap 
the organic vapors present.
    1.2 The charcoal in the tube is transferred to a small, stoppered 
sample container, and the analyte is desorbed with methanol.
    1.3 An aliquot of the desorbed sample is injected into a gas 
chromatograph.
    1.4 The area of the resulting peak is determined and compared with 
areas obtained for standards.
    2. Range and sensitivity.
    2.1 This method was validated over the range of 17.5-70.0 mg/cu m at 
an atmospheric temperature and pressure of 22  deg.C and 760 MM Hg, 
using a 20-liter sample. Under the conditions of sample size (20-liters) 
the probable useful range of this method is 4.5-135 mg-cu m. The method 
is capable of measuring much smaller amounts if the desorption 
efficiency is adequate. Desorption efficiency must be determined over 
the range used.
    2.2 The upper limit of the range of the method is dependent on the 
adsorptive capacity of the charcoal tube. This capacity varies with the 
concentrations of acrylonitrile and other substances in the air. The 
first section of the charcoal tube was found to hold at least 3.97 mg of 
acrylonitrile when a test atmosphere containing 92.0 mg/cu m of 
acrylonitrile in air was sampled 0.18 liter per minute for 240 minutes; 
at that time the concentration of acrylonitrile in the effluent was less 
than 5 percent of that in the influent. (The charcoal tube consists of 
two sections of activated charcoal separated by a section of urethane 
foam. See section 6.2.) If

[[Page 329]]

a particular atmosphere is suspected of containing a large amount of 
contaminant, a smaller sampling volume should be taken.
    3. Interference.
    3.1  When the amount of water in the air is so great that 
condensation actually occurs in the tube, organic vapors will not be 
trapped efficiently. Preliminary experiments using toluene indicate that 
high humidity severely decreases the breakthrough volume.
    3.2  When interfering compounds are known or suspected to be present 
in the air, such information, including their suspected identities, 
should be transmitted with the sample.
    3.3  It must be emphasized that any compound which has the same 
retention time as the analyte at the operating conditions described in 
this method is an interference. Retention time data on a single column 
cannot be considered proof of chemical identity.
    3.4  If the possibility of interference exists, separation 
conditions (column packing, temperature, etc.) must be changed to 
circumvent the problem.
    4. Precision and accuracy.
    4.1  The Coefficient of Variation (CV<INF>T</INF>) for the total 
analytical and sampling method in the range of 17.5-70.0 mg/cu m was 
0.073. This value corresponds to a 3.3 mg/cu m standard deviation at the 
(previous) OSHA standard level (20 ppm). Statistical information and 
details of the validation and experimental test procedures can be found 
in Reference 11.2.
    4.2  On the average the concentrations obtained at the 20 ppm level 
using the overall sampling and analytical method were 6.0 percent lower 
than the ``true'' concentrations for a limited number of laboratory 
experiments. Any difference between the ``found'' and ``true'' 
concentrations may not represent a bias in the sampling and analytical 
method, but rather a random variation from the experimentally determined 
``true'' concentration. Therefore, no recovery correction should be 
applied to the final result in section 10.5.
    5. Advantages and disadvantages of the method.
    5.1  The sampling device is small, portable, and involves no 
liquids. Interferences are minimal, and most of those which do occur can 
be eliminated by altering chromatographic conditions. The tubes are 
analyzed by means of a quick, instrumental method.
    The method can also be used for the simultaneous analysis of two or 
more substances suspected to be present in the same sample by simply 
changing gas chromatographic conditions.
    5.2  One disadvantage of the method is that the amount of sample 
which can be taken is limited by the number of milligrams that the tube 
will hold before overloading. When the sample value obtained for the 
backup section of the charcoal tube exceeds 25 percent of that found on 
the front section, the possibility of sample loss exists.
    5.3  Furthermore, the precision of the method is limited by the 
reproducibility of the pressure drop across the tubes. This drop will 
affect the flow rate and cause the volume to be imprecise, because the 
pump is usually calibrated for one tube only.
    6. Apparatus.
    6.1  A calibrated personal sampling pump whose flow can be 
determined within <plus-minus>5 percent at the recommended flow rate. 
(Reference 11.3).
    6.2  Charcoal tubes: Glass tubes with both ends flame sealed, 7 cm 
long with a 6-mm O.D. and a 4-mm I.D., containing 2 sections of 20/40 
mesh activated charcoal separated by a 2-mm portion of urethane foam. 
The activated charcoals prepared from coconut shells and is fired at 600 
 deg.C prior to packing. The adsorbing section contains 100 mg of 
charcoal, the backup section 50 mg. A 3-mm portion of urethane foam is 
placed between the outlet end of the tube and the backup section. A plug 
of silicated glass wool is placed in front of the adsorbing section. The 
pressure drop across the tube must be less than 1 inch of mercury at a 
flow rate of 1 liter per minute.
    6.3  Gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector.
    6.4  Column (4-ft x \1/4\-in stainless steel) packed with 50/80 mesh 
Poropak, type Q.
    6.5  An electronic integrator or some other suitable method for 
measuring peak areas.
    6.6  Two-milliliter sample containers with glass stoppers or Teflon-
lined caps. If an automatic sample injector is used, the associated 
vials may be used.
    6.7  Microliter syringes: 10-microliter and other convenient sizes 
for making standards.
    6.8  Pipets: 1.0-ml delivery pipets.
    6.9  Volumetric flask: 10-ml or convenient sizes for making standard 
solutions.
    7. Reagents.
    7.1  Chromatographic quality methanol.
    7.2  Acrylonitrile, reagent grade.
    7.3  Hexane, reagent grade.
    7.4  Purified nitrogen.
    7.5  Prepurified hydrogen.
    7.6  Filtered compressed air.
    8. Procedure.
    8.1  Cleaning of equipment. All glassware used for the laboratory 
analysis should be detergent washed and thoroughly rinsed with tap water 
and distilled water.
    8.2  Calibration of personal pumps. Each personal pump must be 
calibrated with a representative charcoal tube in the line. This will 
minimize errors associated with uncertainties in the sample volume 
collected.
    8.3  Collection and shipping of samples.
    8.3.1  Immediately before sampling, break the ends of the tube to 
provide an opening at least one-half the internal diameter of the tube 
(2 mm).

[[Page 330]]

    8.3.2  The smaller section of charcoal is used as a backup and 
should be positioned nearest the sampling pump.
    8.3.3  The charcoal tube should be placed in a vertical direction 
during sampling to minimize channeling through the charcoal.
    8.3.4  Air being sampled should not be passed through any hose or 
tubing before entering the charcoal tube.
    8.3.5  A maximum sample size of 20 liters is recommended. Sample at 
a flow of 0.20 liter per minute or less. The flow rate should be known 
with an accuracy of at least <plus-minus>5 percent.
    8.3.6  The temperature and pressure of the atmosphere being sampled 
should be recorded. If pressure reading is not available, record the 
elevation.
    8.3.7  The charcoal tubes should be capped with the supplied plastic 
caps immediately after sampling. Under no circumstances should rubber 
caps be used.
    8.3.8  With each batch of 10 samples submit one tube from the same 
lot of tubes which was used for sample collection and which is subjected 
to exactly the same handling as the samples except that no air is drawn 
through it. Label this as a blank.
    8.3.9  Capped tubes should be packed tightly and padded before they 
are shipped to minimize tube breakage during shipping.
    8.3.10  A sample of the bulk material should be submitted to the 
laboratory in a glass container with a Teflon-lined cap. This sample 
should not be transported in the same container as the charcoal tubes.
    8.4  Analysis of samples.
    8.4.1  Preparation of samples. In preparation for analysis, each 
charcoal tube is scored with a file in front of the first section of 
charcoal and broken open. The glass wool is removed and discarded. The 
charcoal in the first (larger) section is transferred to a 2-ml 
stoppered sample container. The separating section of foam is removed 
and discarded; the second section is transferred to another stoppered 
container. These two sections are analyzed separately.
    8.4.2  Desorption of samples. Prior to analysis, 1.0 ml of methanol 
is pipetted into each sample container. Desorption should be done for 30 
minutes. Tests indicate that this is adequate if the sample is agitated 
occasionally during this period. If an automatic sample injector is 
used, the sample vials should be capped as soon as the solvent is added 
to minimize volatilization.
    8.4.3  GC conditions. The typical operating conditions for the gas 
chromatograph are:
    1. 50 ml/min (60 psig) nitrogen carrier gas flow.
    2. 65 ml/min (24 psig) hydrogen gas flow to detector.
    3. 500 ml/min (50 psig) air flow to detector.
    4. 235  deg.C injector temperature.
    5. 255  deg.C manifold temperature (detector).
    6. 155  deg.C column temperature.
    8.4.4  Injection. The first step in the analysis is the injection of 
the sample into the gas chromatograph. To eliminate difficulties arising 
from blowback or distillation within the syringe needle, one should 
employ the solvent flush injection technique. The 10-microliter syringe 
is first flushed with solvent several times to wet the barrel and 
plunger. Three microliters of solvent are drawn into the syringe to 
increase the accuracy and reproducibility of the injected sample volume. 
The needle is removed from the solvent, and the plunger is pulled back 
about 0.2 microliter to separate the solvent flush from the sample with 
a pocket of air to be used as a marker. The needle is then immersed in 
the sample, and a 5-microliter aliquot is withdrawn, taking into 
consideration the volume of the needle, since the sample in the needle 
will be completely injected. After the needle is removed from the sample 
and prior to injection, the plunger is pulled back 1.2 microliters to 
minimize evaporation of the sample from the tip of the needle. Observe 
that the sample occupies 4.9-5.0 microliters in the barrel of the 
syringe. Duplicate injections of each sample and standard should be 
made. No more than a 3 percent difference in area is to be expected. An 
automatic sample injector can be used if it is shown to give 
reproducibility at least as good as the solvent flush method.
    8.4.5  Measurement of area. The area of the sample peak is measured 
by an electronic integrator or some other suitable form of area 
measurement, and preliminary results are read from a standard curve 
prepared as discussed below.
    8.5 Determination of desorption efficiency.
    8.5.1 Importance of determination. The desorption efficiency of a 
particular compound can vary from one laboratory to another and also 
from one batch of charcoal to another. Thus, it is necessary to 
determine at least once the percentage of the specific compound that is 
removed in the desorption process, provided the same batch of charcoal 
is used.
    8.5.2 Procedure for determining desorption efficiency. Activated 
charcoal equivalent to the amount in the first section of the sampling 
tube (100 mg) is measured into a 2.5 in, 4-mm I.D. glass tube, flame 
sealed at one end. This charcoal must be from the same batch as that 
used in obtaining the samples and can be obtained from unused charcoal 
tubes. The open end is capped with Parafilm. A known amount of hexane 
solution of acrylonitrile containing 0.239 g/ml is injected directly 
into the activated charcoal with a microliter syringe, and tube is 
capped with more Parafilm. When using an automatic sample injector, the 
sample injector vials, capped with Teflon-faced septa, may be used in 
place of the glass tube.

[[Page 331]]

    The amount injected is equivalent to that present in a 20-liter air 
sample at the selected level.
    Six tubes at each of three levels (0.5X, 1X, and 2X of the standard) 
are prepared in this manner and allowed to stand for at least overnight 
to assure complete adsorption of the analyte onto the charcoal. These 
tubes are referred to as the sample. A parallel blank tube should be 
treated in the same manner except that no sample is added to it. The 
sample and blank tubes are desorbed and analyzed in exactly the same 
manner as the sampling tube described in section 8.4.
    Two or three standards are prepared by injecting the same volume of 
compound into 1.0 ml of methanol with the same syringe used in the 
preparation of the samples. These are analyzed with the samples.
    The desorption efficiency (D.E.) equals the average weight in mg 
recovered from the tube divided by the weight in mg added to the tube, 
or
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.035

    The desorption efficiency is dependent on the amount of analyte 
collected on the charcoal. Plot the desorption efficiency versus weight 
of analyte found. This curve is used in section 10.4 to correct for 
adsorption losses.
    9. Calibration and standards.
    It is convenient to express concentration of standards in terms of 
mg/1.0 ml methanol, because samples are desorbed in this amount of 
methanol. The density of the analyte is used to convert mg into 
microliters for easy measurement with a microliter syringe. A series of 
standards, varying in concentration over the range of interest, is 
prepared and analyzed under the same GC conditions and during the same 
time period as the unknown samples. Curves are established by plotting 
concentration in mg/1.0 ml versus peak area.
    Note: Since no internal standard is used in the method, standard 
solutions must be analyzed at the same time that the sample analysis is 
done. This will minimize the effect of known day-to-day variations and 
variations during the same day of the FID response.
    10. Calculations.
    10.1 Read the weight, in mg, corresponding to each peak area from 
the standard curve. No volume corrections are needed, because the 
standard curve is based on mg/1.0 ml methanol and the volume of sample 
injected is identical to the volume of the standards injected.
    10.2 Corrections for the bank must be made for each sample.

                         mg = mg sample-mg blank

Where:
mg sample = mg found in front section of sample tube.
mg sample = mg found in front section of blank tube.
    A similar procedure is followed for the backup sections.
    10.3 Add the weights found in the front and backup sections to get 
the total weight in the sample.
    10.4 Read the desorption efficiency from the curve (see sec. 8.5.2) 
for the amount found in the front section. Divide the total weight by 
this desorption efficiency to obtain the corrected mg/sample.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.036

    10.5 The concentration of the analyte in the air sampled can be 
expressed in mg/cu m.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.037

    10.6 Another method of expressing concentration is ppm.

          ppm =m mg/cu  x  24.45/M.W.  x  760/P x  T. + 273/298

Where:
P = Pressure (mm Hg) of air sampled.
T = Temperature (  deg.C) of air sampled.
24.45 = Molar volume (liter/mole) at 25  deg.C and 760 mm Hg.
M.W. = Molecular weight (g/mole) of analyte.
760 = Standard pressure (mm Hg).
298 = Standard temperature ( deg.K).

by an electronic integator or some other suitable form of area 
measurement, and preliminary results are read from a standard curve 
prepared as discussed below.
    5.5 Determination of desorption efficiency.
    5.5.1 Importance of determination. The desorption efficiency of a 
particular compound can vary from one laboratory to another and also 
from one batch of charcoal to another. Thus, it is necessary to 
determine, at least once, the percentage of the specific compound that 
is removed in the desorption process, provided the same batch of 
charcoal is used.
    5.5.2 Procedure for determining desorption efficiency. The reference 
portion of the charcoal tube is removed. To the remaining portion, 
amounts representing 0.5X, 1X, and 2X (X represents TLV) based on a 20 l 
air sample are injected onto several tubes at each level. Dilutions of 
acrylonitrile with methanol are made to allow injection of measurable 
quantities. These tubes are then allowed to equilibrate at least 
overnight. Following equilibration they are analyzed following the same 
procedure as the samples A curve of the desorption efficiency amt 
recovered/amt added is plotted versus amount of analyte found. This 
curve is used to correct for adsorption losses.

    6. Calibration and standards.
    A series of standards, varying in concentration over the range of 
interest, is prepared and analyzed under the same GC conditions and 
during the same time period as the unknown samples. Curves are prepared 
by plotting concentration versus peak area.

    Note: Since no internal standard is used in the method, standard 
solutions must be analyzed at the same time that the sample analysis is 
done. This will minimize the effect of known day-to-day variations and 
variations during the same day of the NPD response. Multiple injections 
are necessary.

    7. Calculations.
    Read the weight, corresponding to each peak area from the standard 
curve, correct for the blank, correct for the desorption efficiency, and 
make necessary air volume corrections.

Sec. 1910.1047  Ethylene oxide.

    (a) Scope and application. (1) This section applies to all 
occupational exposures to ethylene oxide (EtO), Chemical Abstracts 
Service Registry No. 75-21-8, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) This section does not apply to the processing, use, or handling 
of products containing EtO where objective data are reasonably relied 
upon that demonstrate that the product is not capable of releasing EtO 
in airborne concentrations at or above the action level, and may not 
reasonably be foreseen to release EtO in excess of the excursion limit, 
under the expected conditions of processing, use, or handling

[[Page 334]]

that will cause the greatest possible release.
    (3) Where products containing EtO are exempted under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the employer shall maintain records of the 
objective data supporting that exemption and the basis for the 
employer's reliance on the data, as provided in paragraph (k)(1) of this 
section.
    (b) Definitions: For the purpose of this section, the following 
definitions shall apply:
    Action level means a concentration of airborne EtO of 0.5 ppm 
calculated as an eight (8)-hour time-weighted average.
    Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee.
    Authorized person means any person specifically authorized by the 
employer whose duties require the person to enter a regulated area, or 
any person entering such an area as a designated representative of 
employees for the purpose of exercising the right to observe monitoring 
and measuring procedures under paragraph (l) of this section, or any 
other person authorized by the Act or regulations issued under the Act.
    Director means the Director of the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, or designee.
    Emergency means any occurrence such as, but not limited to, 
equipment failure, rupture of containers, or failure of control 
equipment that is likely to or does result in an unexpected significant 
release of EtO.
    Employee exposure means exposure to airborne EtO which would occur 
if the employee were not using respiratory protective equipment.
    Ethylene oxide or EtO means the three-membered ring organic compound 
with chemical formula C<INF>2</INF> H<INF>4</INF> O.
    (c) Permissible exposure limits--(1) 8-hour time weighted average 
(TWA). The employer shall ensure that no employee is exposed to an 
airborne concentration of EtO in excess of one (1) part EtO per million 
parts of air (1 ppm) as an 8-hour time-weighted average (8-hour TWA).
    (2) Excursion limit. The employer shall ensure that no employee is 
exposed to an airborne concentration of EtO in excess of 5 parts of EtO 
per million parts of air (5 ppm) as averaged over a sampling period of 
fifteen (15) minutes.
    (d) Exposure monitoring--(1) General. (i) Determinations of employee 
exposure shall be made from breathing zone air samples that are 
representative of the 8-hour TWA and 15-minute short-term exposures of 
each employee.
    (ii) Representative 8-hour TWA employee exposure shall be determined 
on the basis of one or more samples representing full-shift exposure for 
each shift for each job classification in each work area. Representative 
15-minute short-term employee exposures shall be determined on the basis 
of one or more samples representing 15-minute exposures associated with 
operations that are most likely to produce exposures above the excursion 
limit for each shift for each job classification in each work area.
    (iii) Where the employer can document that exposure levels are 
equivalent for similar operations in different work shifts, the employer 
need only determine representative employee exposure for that operation 
during one shift.
    (2) Initial monitoring. (i) Each employer who has a workplace or 
work operation covered by this standard, except as provided for in 
paragraph (a)(2) or (d)(2)(ii) of this section, shall perform initial 
monitoring to determine accurately the airborne concentrations of EtO to 
which employees may be exposed.
    (ii) Where the employer has monitored after June 15, 1983 and the 
monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the 
employer may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Where the employer has previously monitored for the excursion 
limit and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this 
sections, the employer may rely on such earlier monitoring results to 
satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Monitoring frequency (periodic monitoring). (i) If the 
monitoring required

[[Page 335]]

by paragraph (d)(2) of this section reveals employee exposure at or 
above the action level but at or below the 8-hour TWA, the employer 
shall repeat such monitoring for each such employee at least every 6 
months.
    (ii) If the monitoring required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section reveals employee exposure above the 8-hour TWA, the employer 
shall repeat such monitoring for each such employee at least every 3 
months.
    (iii) The employer may alter the monitoring schedule from quarterly 
to semiannually for any employee for whom two consecutive measurements 
taken at least 7 days apart indicate that the employee's exposure has 
decreased to or below the 8-hour TWA.
    (iv) If the monitoring required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section reveals employee exposure above the 15 minute excursion limit, 
the employer shall repeat such monitoring for each such employee at 
least every 3 months, and more often as necessary to evaluate exposure 
the employee's short-term exposures.
    (4) Termination of monitoring. (i) If the initial monitoring 
required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section reveals employee 
exposure to be below the action level, the employer may discontinue TWA 
monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by the 
initial monitoring.
    (ii) If the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section reveals that employee exposures, as indicated by at least two 
consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart, are below the 
action level, the employer may discontinue TWA monitoring for those 
employees whose exposures are represented by such monitoring.
    (iii) If the initial monitoring required by paragraph (d)(2)(1) of 
this section reveals employee exposure to be at or below the excursion 
limit, the employer may discontinue excursion limit monitoring for those 
employees whose exposures are represented by the initial monitoring.
    (iv) If the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section reveals that employee exposures, as indicated by at least two 
consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart, are at or below 
the excursion limit, the employer may discontinue excursion limit 
monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by such 
monitoring.
    (5) Additional monitoring. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the employer shall institute the 
exposure monitoring required under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(3) of 
this section whenever there has been a change in the production, 
process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that may result 
in new or additional exposures to EtO or when the employer has any 
reason to suspect that a change may result in new or additional 
exposures.
    (6) Accuracy of monitoring. (i) Monitoring shall be accurate, to a 
confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for 
airborne concentrations of EtO at the 1 ppm TWA and to within plus or 
minus 35 percent for airborne concentrations of EtO at the action level 
of 0.5 ppm.
    (ii) Monitoring shall be accurate, to a confidence level of 95 
percent, to within plus or minus 35 percent for airborne concentrations 
of EtO at the excursion limit.
    (7) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) The employer 
shall, within 15 working days after the receipt of the results of any 
monitoring performed under this standard, notify the affected employee 
of these results in writing either individually or by posting of results 
in an appropriate location that is accessible to affected employees.
    (ii) The written notification required by paragraph (d)(7)(i) of 
this section shall contain the corrective action being taken by the 
employer to reduce employee exposure to or below the TWA and/or 
excursion limit, wherever monitoring results indicated that the TWA and/
or excursion limit has been exceeded.
    (e) Regulated areas. (1) The employer shall establish a regulated 
area wherever occupational exposure to airborne concentrations of EtO 
may exceed the TWA or wherever the EtO concentration exceeds or can 
reasonably be expected to exceed the excursion limit.
    (2) Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons.

[[Page 336]]

    (3) Regulated areas shall be demarcated in any manner that minimizes 
the number of employees within the regulated area.
    (f) Methods of compliance. (1) Engineering controls and work 
practices. (i) The employer shall institute engineering controls and 
work practices to reduce and maintain employee exposure to or below the 
TWA and to or below the excursion limit, except to the extent that such 
controls are not feasible.
    (ii) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work practices 
that can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to 
or below the TWA and to or below the excursion limit, the employer shall 
use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest levels achievable by 
these controls and shall supplement them by the use of respiratory 
protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (iii) Engineering controls are generally infeasible for the 
following operations: collection of quality assurance sampling from 
sterilized materials removal of biological indicators from sterilized 
materials: loading and unloading of tank cars; changing of ethylene 
oxide tanks on sterilizers; and vessel cleaning. For these operations, 
engineering controls are required only where the Assistant Secretary 
demonstrates that such controls are feasible.
    (2) Compliance program. (i) Where the TWA or excursion limit is 
exceeded, the employer shall establish and implement a written program 
to reduce exposure to or below the TWA and to or below the excursion 
limit by means of engineering and work practice controls, as required by 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and by the use of respiratory 
protection where required or permitted under this section.
    (ii) The compliance program shall include a schedule for periodic 
leak detection surveys and a written plan for emergency situations, as 
specified in paragraph (h)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Written plans for a program required in paragraph (f)(2) shall 
be developed and furnished upon request for examination and copying to 
the Assistant Secretary, the Director, affected employees and designated 
employee representatives. Such plans shall be reviewed at least every 12 
months, and shall be updated as necessary to reflect significant changes 
in the status of the employer's compliance program.
    (iv) The employer shall not implement a schedule of employee 
rotation as a means of compliance with the TWA or excursion limit.
    (g) Respiratory protection and personal protective equipment--(1) 
General. For employees who use respirators required by this section, the 
employer must provide respirators that comply with the requirements of 
this paragraph. Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering 
and work-practice controls.
    (ii) Work operations, such as maintenance and repair activities and 
vessel cleaning, for which engineering and work-practice controls are 
not feasible.
    (iii) Work operations for which feasible engineering and work-
practice controls are not yet sufficient to reduce employee exposure to 
or below the TWA.
    (iv) Emergencies.
    (2) Respirator program. The employer must implement a respiratory 
protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b) through (d) 
(except (d)(1)(iii)), and (f) through (m).

 Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1047--Substance Safety Data Sheet for Ethylene 
                          Oxide (Non-Mandatory)

                       i. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: Ethylene oxide (C<INF>2</INF> H<INF>4</INF> O).
    B. Synonyms: dihydrooxirene, dimethylene oxide, EO, 1,2-epoxyethane, 
EtO, ETO, oxacyclopropane, oxane, oxidoethane, alpha/beta-oxidoethane, 
oxiran, oxirane.
    C. Ethylene oxide can be found as a liquid or vapor.
    D. EtO is used in the manufacture of ethylene glycol, surfactants, 
ethanolamines, glycol ethers, and other organic chemicals. EtO is also 
used as a sterilant and fumigant.
    E. Appearance and odor: Colorless liquid below 10.7  deg. C (51.3 
deg. F) or colorless gas with ether-like odor detected at approximately 
700 parts EtO per million parts of air (700 ppm).
    F. Permissible Exposure: Exposure may not exceed 1 part EtO per 
million parts of air averaged over the 8-hour workday.

                         ii. Health Hazard Data

    A. Ethylene oxide can cause bodily harm if you inhale the vapor, if 
it comes into contact with your eyes or skin, or if you swallow it.
    B. Effects of overexposure:
    1. Ethylene oxide in liquid form can cause eye irritation and injury 
to the cornea, frostbite, and severe irritation and blistering of the 
skin upon prolonged or confined contact. Ingestion of EtO can cause 
gastric irritation and liver injury. Acute effects from inhalation of 
EtO vapors include respiratory irritation and lung injury, headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and cyaonosis (blue or 
purple coloring of skin). Exposure has also been associated with the 
occurrence of cancer, reproductive effects, mutagenic changes, 
neurotoxicity, and sensitization.
    1. EtO has been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals and has 
been associated with higher incidences of cancer in humans. Adverse 
reproductive effects and chromosome damage may also occur from EtO 
exposure.
    a. Reporting signs and symptoms: You should inform your employer if 
you develop any signs or symptoms and suspect that they are caused by 
exposure to EtO.

                   iii. Emergency First Aid Procedures

    A. Eye exposure: If EtO gets into your eyes, wash your eyes 
immediately with large amounts of water, lifting the lower and upper 
eyelids. Get medical attention immediately. Contact lenses should not be 
worn when working with this chemical.
    B. Skin exposure: If EtO gets on your skin, immediately wash the 
contaminated skin with water. If EtO soaks through your clothing, 
especially your shoes, remove the clothing immediately and wash the skin 
with water using an emergency deluge shower. Get medical attention 
immediately. Thoroughly wash contaminated clothing before reusing. 
Contaminated leather shoes or other leather articles should not be 
reused and should be discarded.
    C. Inhalation: If large amounts of EtO are inhaled, the exposed 
person must be moved to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, 
perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Keep the affected person warm and 
at rest. Get medical attention immediately.
    D. Swallowing: When EtO has been swallowed, give the person large 
quantities of water immediately. After the water has been swallowed, try 
to get the person to vomit by having him or her touch the back of the 
throat with his or her finger. Do not make an unconscious person vomit. 
Get medical attention immediately.
    E. Rescue: Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure. If 
the exposed person has been overcome, attempt rescue only after 
notifying at least one other person of the emergency and putting into 
effect established emergency procedures. Do not become a casualty 
yourself. Understand your emergency rescue procedures and know the 
location of the emergency equipment before the need arises.

                 iv. Respirators and Protective Clothing

    A. Respirators. You may be required to wear a respirator for 
nonroutine activities, in emergencies, while your employer is in the 
process of reducing EtO exposures through engineering controls, and in 
areas where engineering controls are not feasible. As of the effective 
date of this standard, only air-supplied, positive-pressure, full-
facepiece respirators are approved for protection

[[Page 342]]

against EtO. If air-purifying respirators are worn in the future, they 
must have a label issued by the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health under the provisions of 42 CFR part 84 stating that 
the respirators have been approved for use with ethylene oxide. For 
effective protection, respirators must fit your face and head snugly. 
Respirators must not be loosened or removed in work situations where 
their use is required.
    EtO does not have a detectable odor except at levels well above the 
permissible exposure limits. If you can smell EtO while wearing a 
respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If you experience 
difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your employer.
    B. Protective clothing: You may be required to wear impermeable 
clothing, gloves, a face shield, or other appropriate protective 
clothing to prevent skin contact with liquid EtO or EtO-containing 
solutions. Where protective clothing is required, your employer must 
provide clean garments to you as necessary to assure that the clothing 
protects you adequately.
    Replace or repair protective clothing that has become torn or 
otherwise damaged.
    EtO must never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and shoes 
which are not impermeable to EtO should not be allowed to become 
contaminated with EtO, and if they do, the clothing should be promptly 
removed and decontaminated. Contaminated leather shoes should be 
discarded. Once EtO penetrates shoes or other leather articles, they 
should not be worn again.
    C. Eye protection: You must wear splashproof safety goggles in areas 
where liquid EtO or EtO-containing solutions may contact your eyes. In 
addition, contact lenses should not be worn in areas where eye contact 
with EtO can occur.

           v. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling, and Storage

    A. EtO is a flammable liquid, and its vapors can easily form 
explosive mixtures in air.
    B. EtO must be stored in tighly closed containers in a cool, well-
ventilated area, away from heat, sparks, flames, strong oxidizers, 
alkalines, and acids, strong bases, acetylide-forming metals such as 
cooper, silver, mercury and their alloys.
    C. Sources of ignition such as smoking material, open flames and 
some electrical devices are prohibited wherever EtO is handled, used, or 
stored in a manner that could create a potential fire or explosion 
hazard.
    D. You should use non-sparking tools when opening or closing metal 
containers of EtO, and containers must be bonded and grounded in the 
rare instances in which liquid EtO is poured or transferred.
    E. Impermeable clothing wet with liquid EtO or EtO-containing 
solutions may be easily ignited. If your are wearing impermeable 
clothing and are splashed with liquid EtO or EtO-containing solution, 
you should immediately remove the clothing while under an emergency 
deluge shower.
    F. If your skin comes into contact with liquid EtO or EtO-containing 
solutions, you should immediately remove the EtO using an emergency 
deluge shower.
    G. You should not keep food, beverages, or smoking materials in 
regulated areas where employee exposures are above the permissible 
exposure limits.
    H. Fire extinguishers and emergency deluge showers for quick 
drenching should be readily available, and you should know where they 
are and how to operate them.
    I. Ask your supervisor where EtO is used in your work area and for 
any additional plant safety and health rules.

                        vi. Access to Information

    A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the 
information contained in this standard and appendices for EtO. In 
addition, your employer must instruct you in the proper work practices 
for using EtO emergency procedures, and the correct use of protective 
equipment.
    B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being 
exposed to EtO. You or your representative has the right to observe 
employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer 
is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer determine 
that you are being overexposed, he or she is required to inform you of 
the actions which are being taken to reduce your exposure to within 
permissible exposure limits.
    C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and 
medical examinations. These exposure records must be kept by the 
employer for at least thirty (30) years. Medical records must be kept 
for the period of your employment plus thirty (30) years.
    D. Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical 
records to your physician or designated representative upon your written 
request.

    vii. Sterilant Use of Eto in Hospitals and Health Care Facilities

    This section of Appendix A, for informational purposes, sets forth 
EPA's recommendations for modifications in workplace design and practice 
in hospitals and health care facilities for which the Environmental 
Protection Agency has registered EtO for uses as a sterilant or fumigant 
under the Federal Insecticide, Funigicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 
136 et seq. These new recommendations, published in the Federal Register 
by EPA at 49 FR 15268, as modified in today's Register, are intended

[[Page 343]]

to help reduce the exposure of hospital and health care workers to EtO 
to 1 ppm. EPA's recommended workplace design and workplace practice are 
as follows:

                           1. Workplace Design

    a. Installation of gas line hand valves. Hand valves must be 
installed on the gas supply line at the connection to the supply 
cylinders to minimize leakage during cylinder change.
    b. Installation of capture boxes. Sterilizer operations result in a 
gas/water discharge at the completion of the process. This discharge is 
routinely piped to a floor drain which is generally located in an 
equipment or an adjacent room. When the floor drain is not in the same 
room as the sterilizer and workers are not normally present, all that is 
necessary is that the room be well ventilated.
    The installation of a ``capture box'' will be required for those 
work place layouts where the floor drain is located in the same room as 
the sterilizer or in a room where workers are normally present. A 
``capture box'' is a piece of equipment that totally encloses the floor 
drain where the discharge from the sterilizer is pumped. The ``capture 
box'' is to be vented directly to a non-recirculating or dedicated 
ventilation system. Sufficient air intake should be allowed at the 
bottom of the box to handle the volume of air that is ventilated from 
the top of the box. The ``capture box'' can be made of metal, plastic, 
wood or other equivalent material. The box is intended to reduce levels 
of EtO discharged into the work room atmosphere. The use of a ``capture 
box'' is not required if: (1) The vacuum pump discharge floor drain is 
located in a well ventilated equipment or other room where workers are 
not normally present or (2) the water sealed vacuum pump discharges 
directly to a closed sealed sewer line (check local plumbing codes).
    If it is impractical to install a vented ``capture box'' and a well 
ventilated equipment or other room is not feasible, a box that can be 
sealed over the floor drain may be used if: (1) The floor drain is 
located in a room where workers are not normally present and EtO cannot 
leak into an occupied area, and (2) the sterilizer in use is less than 
12 cubic feet in capacity (check local plumbing codes).
    c. Ventilation of aeration units i. Existing aeration units. 
Existing units must be vented to a non-recirculating or dedicated system 
or vented to an equipment or other room where workers are not normally 
present and which is well ventilated. Aerator units must be positioned 
as close as possible to the sterilizer to minimize the exposure from the 
off-gassing of sterilized items.
    ii. Installation of new aerator units (where none exist). New 
aerator units must be vented as described above for existing aerators. 
Aerators must be in place by July 1, 1986.
    d. Ventilation during cylinder change. Workers may be exposed to 
short but relatively high levels of EtO during the change of gas 
cylinders. To reduce exposure from this route, users must select one of 
three alternatives designed to draw off gas that may be released when 
the line from the sterilizer to the cylinder is disconnected:
    i. Location of cylinders in a well ventilated equipment room or 
other room where workers are not normally present.
    ii. Installation of a flexible hose (at least 4" in diameter) to a 
non-recirculating or dedicated ventilation system and located in the 
area of cylinder change in such a way that the hose can be positioned at 
the point where the sterilizer gas line is disconnected from the 
cylinder.
    iii. Installation of a hood that is part of a non-recirculating or 
dedicated system and positioned no more than one foot above the point 
where the change of cylinders takes place.
    e. Ventilation of sterilizer door area. One of the major sources of 
exposure to EtO occurs when the sterilizer door is opened following the 
completion of the sterilization process. In order to reduce this avenue 
of exposure, a hood or metal canopy closed on each end must be installed 
over the sterilizer door. The hood or metal canopy must be connected to 
a non-recirculating or dedicated ventilation system or one that exhausts 
gases to a well ventilated equipment or other room where workers are not 
normally present. A hood or canopy over the sterilizer door is required 
for use even with those sterilizers that have a purge cycle and must be 
in place by July 1, 1986.
    f. Ventilation of sterilizer relief valve. Sterilizers are typically 
equipped with a safety relief device to release gas in case of increased 
pressure in the sterilizer. Generally, such relief devices are used on 
pressure vessels. Although these pressure relief devices are rarely 
opened for hospital and health care sterilizers, it is suggested that 
they be designed to exhaust vapor from the sterilizer by one of the 
following methods:
    i. Through a pipe connected to the outlet of the relief valve 
ventilated directly outdoors at a point high enough to be away from 
passers by, and not near any windows that open, or near any air 
conditioning or ventilation air intakes.
    ii. Through a connection to an existing or new non-recirculating or 
dedicated ventilation system.
    iii. Through a connection to a well ventilated equipment or other 
room where workers are not normally present.
    g. Ventilation systems. Each hospital and health care facility 
affected by this notice that uses EtO for the sterilization of equipment 
and supplies must have a ventilation system which enables compliance 
with the requirements of section (b) through (f) in the

[[Page 344]]

manner described in these sections and within the timeframes allowed. 
Thus, each affected hospital and health care facility must have or 
install a non-recirculating or dedicated ventilation equipment or other 
room where workers are not normally present in which to vent EtO.
    h. Installation of alarm systems. An audible and visual indicator 
alarm system must be installed to alert personnel of ventilation system 
failures, i.e., when the ventilation fan motor is not working.

                         2. Workplace Practices

    All the workplace practices discussed in this unit must be 
permanently posted near the door of each sterilizer prior to use by any 
operator.
    a. Changing of supply line filters. Filters in the sterilizer liquid 
line must be changed when necessary, by the following procedure:
    i. Close the cylinder valve and the hose valve.
    ii. Disconnect the cylinder hose (piping) from the cylinder.
    iii. Open the hose valve and bleed slowly into a proper ventilating 
system at or near the in-use supply cylinders.
    iv. Vacate the area until the line is empty.
    v. Change the filter.
    vi. Reconnect the lines and reverse the value position.
    vii. Check hoses, filters, and valves for leaks with a fluorocarbon 
leak detector (for those sterilizers using the 88 percent 
chlorofluorocarbon, 12 percent ethylene oxide mixture (12/88)).
    b. Restricted access area. i. Areas involving use of EtO must be 
designated as restricted access areas. They must be identified with 
signs or floor marks near the sterilizer door, aerator, vacuum pump 
floor drain discharge, and in-use cylinder storage.
    ii. All personnel must be excluded from the restricted area when 
certain operations are in progress, such as discharging a vacuum pump, 
emptying a sterilizer liquid line, or venting a non-purge sterilizer 
with the door ajar or other operations where EtO might be released 
directly into the face of workers.
    c. Door opening procedures. i. Sterilizers with purge cycles. A load 
treated in a sterilizer equipped with a purge cycle should be removed 
immediately upon completion of the cycle (provided no time is lost 
opening the door after cycle is completed). If this is not done, the 
purge cycle should be repeated before opening door.
    ii. Sterilizers without purge cycles. For a load treated in a 
sterilizer not equipped with a purge cycle, the sterilizer door must be 
ajar 6" for 15 minutes, and then fully opened for at least another 15 
minutes before removing the treated load. The length of time of the 
second period should be established by peak monitoring for one hour 
after the two 15-minute periods suggested. If the level is above 10 ppm 
time-weighted average for 8 hours, more time should be added to the 
second waiting period (door wide open). However, in no case may the 
second period be shortened to less than 15 minutes.
    d. Chamber unloading procedures. i. Procedures for unloading the 
chamber must include the use of baskets or rolling carts, or baskets and 
rolling tables to transfer treated loads quickly, thus avoiding 
excessive contact with treated articles, and reducing the duration of 
exposures.
    ii. If rolling carts are used, they should be pulled not pushed by 
the sterilizer operators to avoid offgassing exposure.
    e. Maintenance. A written log should be instituted and maintained 
documenting the date of each leak detection and any maintenance 
procedures undertaken. This is a suggested use practice and is not 
required.
    i. Leak detection. Sterilizer door gaskets, cylinder and vacuum 
piping, hoses, filters, and valves must be checked for leaks under full 
pressure with a Fluorocarbon leak detector (for 12/88 systems only) 
every two weeks by maintenance personnel. Also, the cylinder piping 
connections must be checked after changing cylinders. Particular 
attention in leak detection should be given to the automatic solenoid 
valves that control the flow of EtO to the sterilizer. Specifically, a 
check should be made at the EtO gasline entrance port to the sterilizer, 
while the sterilizer door is open and the solenoid valves are in a 
closed position.
    ii. Maintenance procedures. Sterilizer/areator door gaskets, valves, 
and fittings must be replaced when necessary as determined by 
maintenance personnel in their bi-weekly checks; in addition, visual 
inspection of the door gaskets for cracks, debris, and other foreign 
substances should be conducted daily by the operator.

    Appendix B to Sec. 1910.1047--Substance Technical Guidelines for 
                     Ethylene Oxide (Non-Mandatory)

                      i. Physical and Chemical Data

    A. Substance identification:
    1. Synonyms: dihydrooxirene, dimethylene oxide, EO, 1,2-epoxyethane, 
EtO ETO oxacyclopropane, oxane, oxidoethane, alpha/beta-oxidoethane, 
oxiran, oxirane.
    2. Formula: (C<INF>2</INF> H<INF>4</INF> O).
    3. Molecular weight: 44.06
    B. Physical data:
    1. Boiling point (760 mm Hg): 10.70 deg. C (51.3 deg. F);
    2. Specific gravity (water = 1): 0.87 (at 20 deg. C or 68 deg. F)
    3. Vapor density (air = 1): 1.49;
    4. Vapor pressure (at 20 deg. C); 1,095 mm Hg;
    5. Solubility in water: complete;

[[Page 345]]

    6. Appearance and odor: colorless liquid; gas at temperature above 
10.7 deg. F or 51.3 deg. C with ether-like odor above 700 ppm.

             ii. Fire, Explosion, and Reactivity Hazard Data

    A. Fire:
    1. Flash point: less than O deg. F (open cup);
    2. Stability: decomposes violently at temperatures above 800 deg. F;
    3. Flammable limits in air, percent by volume: Lower: 3, Upper: 100;
    4. Extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide for small fires, polymer or 
alcohol foams for large fires;
    5. Special fire fighting procedures: Dilution of ethylene oxide with 
23 volumes of water renders it non-flammable;
    6. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: Vapors of EtO will burn 
without the presence of air or other oxidizers. EtO vapors are heavier 
than air and may travel along the ground and be ignited by open flames 
or sparks at locations remote from the site at which EtO is being used.
    7. For purposes of compliance with the requirements of 29 CFR 
1910.106, EtO is classified as a flammable gas. For example, 7,500 ppm, 
approximately one-fourth of the lower flammable limit, would be 
considered to pose a potential fire and explosion hazard.
    8. For purposes of compliance with 29 CFR 1910.155, EtO is 
classified as a Class B fire hazard.
    9. For purpose of compliance with 29 CFR 1919.307, locations 
classified as hazardous due to the presence of EtO shall be Class I.
    B. Reactivity:
    1. Conditions contributing to instability: EtO will polymerize 
violently if contaminated with aqueous alkalies, amines, mineral acids, 
metal chlorides, or metal oxides. Violent decomposition will also occur 
at temperatures above 800  deg. F;
    2. Incompatabilities: Alkalines and acids;
    3. Hazardous decomposition products: Carbon monoxide and carbon 
dioxide.

                iii. Spill, Leak, and Disposal Procedures

    A. If EtO is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken:
    1. Remove all ignition sources.
    2. The area should be evacuated at once and re-entered only after 
the area has been thoroughly ventilated and washed down with water.
    B. Persons not wearing appropriate protective equipment should be 
restricted from areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been 
completed.
    C. Waste disposal methods: Waste material should be disposed of in a 
manner that is not hazardous to employees or to the general population. 
In selecting the method of waste disposal, applicable local, State, and 
Federal regulations should be consulted.

                iv. Monitoring and Measurement Procedures

    A. Exposure above the Permissible Exposure Limit:
    1. Eight-hour exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the 
purpose of determining employee exposure under this section are best 
taken with consecutive samples covering the full shift. Air samples 
should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most 
nearly represent that inhaled by the employee.)
    2. Monitoring techniques: The sampling and analysis under this 
section may be performed by collection of the EtO vapor on charcoal 
adsorption tubes or other composition adsorption tubes, with subsequent 
chemical analysis. Sampling and analysis may also be performed by 
instruments such as real-time continuous monitoring systems, portable 
direct reading instruments, or passive dosimeters as long as 
measurements taken using these methods accurately evaluate the 
concentration of EtO in employees' breathing zones.
    Appendix D describes the validated method of sampling and analysis 
which has been tested by OSHA for use with EtO. Other available methods 
are also described in Appendix D. The employer has the obligation of 
selecting a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision 
requirements of the standard under his unique field conditions. The 
standard requires that the method of monitoring should be accurate, to a 
95 percent confidence level, to plus or minus 25 percent for 
concentrations of EtO at 1 ppm, and to plus or minus 35 percent for 
concentrations at 0.5 ppm. In addition to the method described in 
Appendix D, there are numerous other methods available for monitoring 
for EtO in the workplace. Details on these other methods have been 
submitted by various companies to the rulemaking record, and are 
available at the OSHA Docket Office.
    B. Since many of the duties relating to employee exposure are 
dependent on the results of measurement procedures, employers should 
assure that the evaluation of employee exposures is performed by a 
technically qualified person.

                  v. Protective Clothing and Equipment

    Employees should be provided with and be required to wear 
appropriate protective clothing wherever there is significant potential 
for skin contact with liquid EtO or EtO-containing solutions. Protective 
clothing shall include impermeable coveralls or similar full-body work 
clothing, gloves, and head coverings, as appropriate to protect areas of 
the body which may come in contact with liquid EtO or EtO-containing 
solutions.
    Employers should ascertain that the protective garments are 
impermeable to EtO. Permeable clothing, including items made of

[[Page 346]]

rubber, and leather shoes should not be allowed to become contaminated 
with liquid EtO. If permeable clothing does become contaminated, it 
should be immediately removed, while the employer is under an emergency 
deluge shower. If leather footwear or other leather garments become wet 
from EtO they should be discarded and not be worn again, because leather 
absorbs EtO and holds it against the skin.
    Any protective clothing that has been damaged or is otherwise found 
to be defective should be repaired or replaced. Clean protective 
clothing should be provided to the employee as necessary to assure 
employee protection. Whenever impermeable clothing becomes wet with 
liquid EtO, it should be washed down with water before being removed by 
the employee. Employees are also required to wear splash-proof safety 
goggles where there is any possibility of EtO contacting the eyes.

                      vi. Miscellaneous Precautions

    A. Store EtO in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-ventilated 
area and take all necessary precautions to avoid any explosion hazard.
    B. Non-sparking tools must be used to open and close metal 
containers. These containers must be effectively grounded and bonded.
    C. Do not incinerate EtO cartridges, tanks or other containers.
    D. Employers should advise employees of all areas and operations 
where exposure to EtO occur.

                         vii. Common Operations

    Common operations in which exposure to EtO is likely to occur 
include the following: Manufacture of EtO, surfactants, ethanolamines, 
glycol ethers, and specialty chemicals, and use as a sterilant in the 
hospital, health product and spice industries.

   Appendix C to Sec. 1910.1047--Medical Surveillance Guidelines for 
                     Ethylene Oxide (Non-Mandatory)

                            i. route of entry

    Inhalation.

                             ii. toxicology

    Clinical evidence of adverse effects associated with the exposure to 
EtO is present in the form of increased incidence of cancer in 
laboratory animals (leukemia, stomach, brain), mutation in offspring in 
animals, and resorptions and spontaneous abortions in animals and human 
populations respectively. Findings in humans and experimental animals 
exposed to airborne concentrations of EtO also indicate damage to the 
genetic material (DNA). These include hemoglobin alkylation, 
unsecheduled DNA synthesis, sister chromatid exchange chromosomal 
aberration, and functional sperm abnormalities.
    Ethylene oxide in liquid form can cause eye irritation and injury to 
the cornea, frostbite, severe irritation, and blistering of the skin 
upon prolonged or confined contact. Ingestion of EtO can cause gastric 
irritation and liver injury. Other effects from inhalation of EtO vapors 
include respiratory irritation and lung injury, headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea and cyanosis.

              iii. signs and symptoms of acute overexposure

    The early effects of acute overexposure to EtO are nausea and 
vomiting, headache, and irritation of the eyes and respiratory passages. 
The patient may notice a ``peculiar taste'' in the mouth. Delayed 
effects can include pulmonary edema, drowsiness, weakness, and 
incoordination. Studies suggest that blood cell changes, an increase in 
chromosomal aberrations, and spontaneous abortion may also be causally 
related to acute overexposure to EtO.
    Skin contact with liquid or gaseous EtO causes characteristic burns 
and possibly even an allergic-type sensitization. The edema and erythema 
occurring from skin contact with EtO progress to vesiculation with a 
tendency to coalesce into blebs with desquamation. Healing occurs within 
three weeks, but there may be a residual brown pigmentation. A 40-80% 
solution is extremely dangerous, causing extensive blistering after only 
brief contact. Pure liquid EtO causes frostbite because of rapid 
evaporation. In contrast, the eye is relatively insensitive to EtO, but 
there may be some irritation of the cornea.
    Most reported acute effects of occupational exposure to EtO are due 
to contact with EtO in liquid phase. The liquid readily penetrates 
rubber and leather, and will produce blistering if clothing or footwear 
contaminated with EtO are not removed.

             iv. surveillance and preventive considerations

    As noted above, exposure to EtO has been linked to an increased risk 
of cancer and reproductive effects including decreased male fertility, 
fetotoxicity, and spontaneous abortion. EtO workers are more likely to 
have chromosomal damage than similar groups not exposed to EtO. At the 
present, limited studies of chronic effects in humans resulting from 
exposure to EtO suggest a causal association with leukemia. Animal 
studies indicate leukemia and cancers at other sites (brain, stomach) as 
well. The physician should be aware of the findings of these studies in 
evaluating the health of employees exposed to EtO.
    Adequate screening tests to determine an employee's potential for 
developing serious

[[Page 347]]

chronic diseases, such as cancer, from exposure to EtO do not presently 
exist. Laboratory tests may, however, give evidence to suggest that an 
employee is potentially overexposed to EtO. It is important for the 
physician to become familiar with the operating conditions in which 
exposure to EtO is likely to occur. The physician also must become 
familiar with the signs and symptoms that indicate a worker is receiving 
otherwise unrecognized and unacceptable exposure to EtO. These elements 
are especially important in evaluating the medical and work histories 
and in conducting the physical exam. When an unacceptable exposure in an 
active employee is identified by the physician, measures taken by the 
employer to lower exposure should also lower the risk of serious long-
term consequences.
    The employer is required to institute a medical surveillance program 
for all employees who are or will be exposed to EtO at or above the 
action level (0.5 ppm) for at least 30 days per year, without regard to 
respirator use. All examinations and procedures must be performed by or 
under the supervision of a licensed physician at a reasonable time and 
place for the employee and at no cost to the employee.
    Although broad latitude in prescribing specific tests to be included 
in the medical surveillance program is extended to the examining 
physician, OSHA requires inclusion of the following elements in the 
routine examination:
    (i) Medical and work histories with special emphasis directed to 
symptoms related to the pulmonary, hematologic, neurologic, and 
reproductive systems and to the eyes and skin.
    (ii) Physical examination with particular emphasis given to the 
pulmonary, hematologic, neurologic, and reproductive systems and to the 
eyes and skin.
    (iii) Complete blood count to include at least a white cell count 
(including differential cell count), red cell count, hematocrit, and 
hemoglobin.
    (iv) Any laboratory or other test which the examining physician 
deems necessary by sound medical practice.
    If requested by the employee, the medical examinations shall include 
pregnancy testing or laboratory evaluation of fertility as deemed 
appropriate by the physician.
    In certain cases, to provide sound medical advice to the employer 
and the employee, the physician must evaluate situations not directly 
related to EtO. For example, employees with skin diseases may be unable 
to tolerate wearing protective clothing. In addition those with chronic 
respiratory diseases may not tolerate the wearing of negative pressure 
(air purifying) respirators. Additional tests and procedures that will 
help the physician determine which employees are medically unable to 
wear such respirators should include: An evaluation of cardiovascular 
function, a baseline chest x-ray to be repeated at five year intervals, 
and a pulmonary function test to be repeated every three years. The 
pulmonary function test should include measurement of the employee's 
forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at one second 
(FEV1), as well as calculation of the ratios of FEV1 to FVC, and 
measured FVC and measured FEV1 to expected values corrected for 
variation due to age, sex, race, and height.
    The employer is required to make the prescribed tests available at 
least annually to employees who are or will be exposed at or above the 
action level, for 30 or more days per year; more often than specified if 
recommended by the examining physician; and upon the employee's 
termination of employment or reassignment to another work area. While 
little is known about the long term consequences of high short-term 
exposures, it appears prudent to monitor such affected employees closely 
in light of existing health data. The employer shall provide physician 
recommended examinations to any employee exposed to EtO in emergency 
conditions. Likewise, the employer shall make available medical 
consultations including physician recommended exams to employees who 
believe they are suffering signs or symptoms of exposure to EtO.
    The employer is required to provide the physician with the following 
informatin: a copy of this standard and its appendices; a description of 
the affected employee's duties as they relate to the employee exposure 
level; and information from the employee's previous medical examinations 
which is not readily available to the examining physician. Making this 
information available to the physician will aid in the evaluation of the 
employee's health in relation to assigned duties and fitness to wear 
personal protective equipment, when required.
    The employer is required to obtain a written opinion from the 
examining physician containing the results of the medical examinations; 
the physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any detected 
medical conditions which would place the employee at increased risk of 
material impairment of his or her health from exposure to EtO; any 
recommended restrictions upon the employee's exposure to EtO, or upon 
the use of protective clothing or equipment such as respirators; and a 
statement that the employee has been informed by the physician of the 
results of the medical examination and of any medical conditions which 
require further explanation or treatment. This written opinion must not 
reveal specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposure 
to EtO, and a copy of the opinion must be provided to the affected 
employee.
    The purpose in requiring the examining physician to supply the 
employer with a

[[Page 348]]

written opinion is to provide the employer with a medical basis to aid 
in the determination of initial placement of employees and to assess the 
employee's ability to use protective clothing and equipment.

   Appendix D to Sec. 1910.1047--Sampling and Analytical Methods for 
                     Ethylene Oxide (Non-Mandatory)

    A number of methods are available for monitoring employee exposures 
to EtO. Most of these involve the use of charcoal tubes and sampling 
pumps, followed by analysis of the samples by gas chromatograph. The 
essential differences between the charcoal tube methods include, among 
others, the use of different desorbing solvents, the use of different 
lots of charcoal, and the use of different equipment for analysis of the 
samples.
    Besides charcoal, methods using passive dosimeters, gas sampling 
bags, impingers, and detector tubes have been utilized for determination 
of EtO exposure. In addition, there are several commercially available 
portable gas analyzers and monitoring units.
    This appendix contains details for the method which has been tested 
at the OSHA Analytical Laboratory in Salt Lake City. Inclusion of this 
method in the appendix does not mean that this method is the only one 
which will be satisfactory. Copies of descriptions of other methods 
available are available in the rulemaking record, and may be obtained 
from the OSHA Docket Office. These include the Union Carbide, Dow 
Chemical, 3M, and DuPont methods, as well as NIOSH Method S-286. These 
methods are briefly described at the end of this appendix.
    Employers who note problems with sample breakthrough using the OSHA 
or other charcoal methods should try larger charcoal tubes. Tubes of 
larger capacity are available. In addition, lower flow rates and shorter 
sampling times should be beneficial in minimizing breakthrough problems. 
Whatever method the employer chooses, he must assure himself of the 
method's accuracy and precision under the unique conditions present in 
his workplace.

    1. General Discussion.
    1.1  Background.
    1.1.1  History of Procedure.
    Ethylene oxide samples analyzed at the OSHA Laboratory have normally 
been collected on activated charcoal and desorbed with carbon disulfide. 
The analysis is performed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a FID 
(Flame ionization detector) as described in NIOSH Method S286 (Ref. 
5.1). This method is based on a PEL of 50 ppm and has a detection limit 
of about 1 ppm.
    Recent studies have prompted the need for a method to analyze and 
detect ethylene oxide at very low concentrations.
    Several attempts were made to form an ultraviolet (UV) sensitive 
derivative with ethylene oxide for analysis with HPLC. Among those 
tested that gave no detectable product were: p-anisidine, 
methylimidazole, aniline, and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid. Each was 
tested with catalysts such as triethylamine, aluminum chloride, 
methylene chloride and sulfuric acid but no detectable derivative was 
produced.
    The next derivatization attempt was to react ethylene oxide with HBr 
to form 2-bromoethanol. This reaction was successful. An ECD (electron 
capture detector) gave a very good response for 2-bromoethanol due to 
the presence of bromine. The use of carbon disulfide as the desorbing 
solvent gave too large a response and masked the 2-bromoethanol. Several 
other solvents were tested for both their response on the ECD and their 
ability to desorb ethylene oxide from the charcoal. Among those tested 
were toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene, hexane, cyclohexane and benzene. 
Benzene was the only solvent tested that gave a suitable response on the 
ECD and a high desorption. It was found that the desorption efficiency 
was improved by using 1% CS<INF>2</INF> with the benzene. The carbon 
disulfide did not significantly improve the recovery with the other 
solvents. SKC Lot 120 was used in all tests done with activated 
charcoal.
    1.1.2  Physical Properties (Ref. 5.2-5.4).

    1.2  Limit Defining Parameters.
    1.2.1  Detection Limit of the Analytical Procedure.
    The detection limit of the analytical procedure is 12.0 picograms of 
ethylene oxide per injection. This is the amount of analyte which will 
give a peak whose height is five times the height of the baseline noise. 
(See Backup Data Section 4.1).
    1.2.2  Detection Limit of the Overall Procedure.
    The detection limit of the overall procedure is 24.0 ng of ethylene 
oxide per sample.
    This is the amount of analyte spiked on the sampling device which 
allows recovery of an amount of analyte equivalent to the detection 
limit of the analytical procedure. (See Backup Data Section 4.2).
    1.2.3  Reliable Quantitation Limit.
    The reliable quantitation limit is 94.0 nanograms of ethylene oxide 
per sample. This is the smallest amount of analyte which can be 
quantitated within the requirements of 75% recovery and 95% confidence 
limits. (See Backup Data Section 4.2).
    It must be recognized that the reliable quantitation limit and 
detection limits reported in the method are based upon optimization of 
the instrument for the smallest possible amount of analyte. When the 
target concentration of an analyte is exceptionally higher than these 
limits, they may not be attainable at the routine operating parameters. 
In this case, the limits reported on analysis reports will be based on 
the operating parameters used during the analysis of the samples.
    1.2.4  Sensitivity.
    The sensitivity of the analytical procedure over a concentration 
range representing 0.5 to 2 times the target concentration based on the 
recommended air volume is 34105 area units per <greek-m>g/mL. The 
sensitivity is determined by the slope of the calibration curve (See 
Backup Data Section 4.3).
    The sensitivity will vary somewhat with the particular instrument 
used in the analysis.
    1.2.5  Recovery.
    The recovery of analyte from the collection medium must be 75% or 
greater. The average recovery from spiked samples over the range of 0.5 
to 2 times the target concentration is 88.0% (See Backup Section 4.4). 
At lower concentrations the recovery appears to be non-linear.
    1.2.6  Precision (Analytical Method Only).
    The pooled coefficient of variation obtained from replicate 
determination of analytical standards at 0.5X, 1X and 2X the target 
concentration is 0.036 (See Backup Data Section 4.5).
    1.2.7  Precision (Overall Procedure).
    The overall procedure must provide results at the target 
concentration that are 25% of better at the 95% confidence level. The 
precision at the 95% confidence level for the 15 day storage test is 
plus or minus 12.9% (See Backup Data Section 4.6).
    This includes an additional plus or minus 5% for sampling error.
    1.3  Advantages.
    1.3.1  The sampling procedure is convenient.
    1.3.2  The analytical procedure is very sensitive and reproducible.
    1.3.3  Reanalysis of samples is possible.
    1.3.4  Samples are stable for at least 15 days at room temperature.
    1.3.5  Interferences are reduced by the longer GC retention time of 
the new derivative.
    1.4  Disadvantages.
    1.4.1  Two tubes in series must be used because of possible 
breakthrough and migration.
    1.4.2  The precision of the sampling rate may be limited by the 
reproducibility of the pressure drop across the tubes. The pumps are 
usually calibrated for one tube only.
    1.4.3  The use of benzene as the desorption solvent increases the 
hazards of analysis because of the potential carcinogenic effects of 
benzene.
    1.4.4  After repeated injections there can be a buildup of residue 
formed on the electron capture detector which decreases sensitivity.
    1.4.5  Recovery from the charcoal tubes appears to be nonlinear at 
low concentrations.
    2. Sampling Procedure.
    2.1  Apparatus.
    2.1.1  A calibrated personal sampling pump whose flow can be 
determined within plus or minus 5% of the recommended flow.
    2.1.2  SKC Lot 120 Charcoal tubes: glass tube with both ends flame 
sealed, 7 cm long with a 6 mm O.D. and a 4-mm I.D., containing 2 
sections of coconut shell charcoal separated by a 2-mm portion of 
urethane foam. The adsorbing section contains 100 mg of charcoal, the 
backup section 50 mg. A 3-mm portion of urethane foam is placed between 
the outlet end of the tube and the backup section. A plug of silylated 
glass wool is placed in front of the adsorbing section.
    2.2  Reagents.
    2.2.1  None required.
    2.3  Sampling Technique.
    2.3.1  Immediately before sampling, break the ends of the charcoal 
tubes. All tubes must be from the same lot.
    2.3.2  Connect two tubes in series to the sampling pump with a short 
section of flexible tubing. A minimum amount of tubing is

[[Page 350]]

used to connect the two sampling tubes together. The tube closer to the 
pump is used as a backup. This tube should be identified as the backup 
tube.
    2.3.3  The tubes should be placed in a vertical position during 
sampling to minimize channeling.
    2.3.4  Air being sampled should not pass through any hose or tubing 
before entering the charcoal tubes.
    2.3.5  Seal the charcoal tubes with plastic caps immediately after 
sampling. Also, seal each sample with OSHA seals lengthwise.
    2.3.6  With each batch of samples, submit at least one blank tube 
from the same lot used for samples. This tube should be subjected to 
exactly the same handling as the samples (break, seal, transport) except 
that no air is drawn through it.
    2.3.7  Transport the samples (and corresponding paperwork) to the 
lab for analysis.
    2.3.8  If bulk samples are submitted for analysis, they shoud be 
transported in glass containers with Teflon-lined caps. These samples 
must be mailed separately from the container used for the charcoal 
tubes.
    2.4  Breakthrough.
    2.4.1  The breakthrough (5% breakthrough) volume for a 3.0 mg/m 
ethylene oxide sample stream at approximately 85% relative humidity, 
22 deg. C and 633 mm is 2.6 liters sampled at 0.05 liters per minute. 
This is equivalent to 7.8 <greek-m> g of ethylene oxide. Upon saturation 
of the tube it appeared that the water may be displacing ethylene oxide 
during sampling.
    2.5  Desorption Efficiency.
    2.5.1  The desorption efficiency, from liquid injection onto 
charcoal tubes, averaged 88.0% from 0.5 to 2.0 x the target 
concentration for a 1.0 liter air sample. At lower ranges it appears 
that the desorption efficiency is non-linear (See Backup Data Section 
4.2).
    2.5.2  The desorption efficiency may vary from one laboratory to 
another and also from one lot of charcoal to another. Thus, it is 
necessary to determine the desorption efficiency for a particular lot of 
charcoal.
    2.6  Recommended Air Volume and Sampling Rate.
    2.6.1  The recommended air volume is 1.0 liter.
    2.6.2  The recommended maximum sampling rate is 0.05 Lpm.
    2.7  Interferences.
    2.7.1  Ethylene glycol and Freon 12 at target concentration levels 
did not interfere with the collection of ethylene oxide.
    2.7.2  Suspected interferences should be listed on the sample data 
sheets.
    2.7.3  The relative humidity may affect the sampling procedure.
    2.8  Safety Precautions.
    2.8.1  Attach the sampling equipment to the employee so that it does 
not interfere with work performance.
    2.8.2  Wear safety glasses when breaking the ends of the sampling 
tubes.
    2.8.3  If possible, place the sampling tubes in a holder so the 
sharp end is not exposed while sampling.
    3. Analytical Method.
    3.1  Apparatus.
    3.1.1  Gas chromatograph equipped with a linearized electron capture 
detector.
    3.1.2  GC column capable of separating the derivative of ethylene 
oxide (2-bromoethanol) from any interferences and the 1% CS<INF>2</INF> 
in benzene solvent. The column used for validation studies was: 10 ft x 
\1/8\ inch stainless steel 20% SP-2100, .1% Carbowax 1500 on 100/120 
Supelcoport.
    3.1.3  An electronic integrator or some other suitable method of 
measuring peak areas.
    3.1.4  Two milliliter vials with Teflon-lined caps.
    3.1.5  Gas tight syringe--500 <greek-m> L or other convenient sizes 
for preparing standards.
    3.1.6  Microliter syringes--10 <greek-m> L or other convenient sizes 
for diluting standards and 1 <greek-m> L for sample injections.
    3.1.7  Pipets for dispensing the 1% CS<INF>2</INF> in benzene 
solvent. The Glenco 1 mL dispenser is adequate and convenient.
    3.1.8  Volumetric flasks--5 mL and other convenient sizes for 
preparing standards.
    3.1.9  Disposable Pasteur pipets.
    3.2  Reagents.
    3.2.1  Benzene, reagent grade.
    3.2.2  Carbon Disulfide, reagent grade.
    3.2.3  Ethylene oxide, 99.7% pure.
    3.2.4  Hydrobromic Acid, 48% reagent grade.
    3.2.5  Sodium Carbonate, anhydrous, reagent grade.
    3.2.6  Desorbing reagent, 99% Benzene/1% CS<INF>2</INF>.
    3.3  Sample Preparation.
    3.3.1  The front and back sections of each sample are transferred to 
separate 2-mL vials.
    3.3.2  Each sample is desorbed with 1.0 mL of desorbing reagent.
    3.3.3  The vials are sealed immediately and allowed to desorb for 
one hour with occasional shaking.
    3.3.4  Desorbing reagent is drawn off the charcoal with a disposable 
pipet and put into clean 2-mL vials.
    3.3.5  One drop of HBr is added to each vial. Vials are resealed and 
HBr is mixed well with the desorbing reagent.
    3.3.6  About 0.15 gram of sodium carbonate is carefully added to 
each vial. Vials are again resealed and mixed well.
    3.4  Standard Preparation.
    3.4.1  Standards are prepared by injecting the pure ethylene oxide 
gas into the desorbing reagent.

[[Page 351]]

    3.4.2  A range of standards are prepared to make a calibration 
curve. A concentration of 1.0 <greek-m> L of ethylene oxide gas per 1 mL 
desorbing reagent is equivalent to 1.0 ppm air concentration (all gas 
volumes at 25 deg. C and 760 mm) for the recommended 1 liter air sample. 
This amount is uncorrected for desorption efficiency (See Backup Data 
Section 4.2. for desorption efficiency corrections).
    3.4.3  One drop of HBr per mL of standard is added and mixed well.
    3.4.4  About 0.15 grams of sodium carbonate is carefully added for 
each drop of HBr (A small reaction will occur).
    3.5 Analysis.
    3.5.1  GC Conditions.
Nitrogen flow rate--10mL/min.
Injector Temperature--250 deg. C
Detector Temperature--300 deg. C
Column Temperature--100 deg. C
Injection size--0.8 <greek-m> L
Elution time--3.9 minutes
    3.5.2  Peak areas are measured by an integrator or other suitable 
means.
    3.5.3  The integrator results are in area units and a calibration 
curve is set up with concentration vs. area units.
    3.6  Interferences.
    3.6.1  Any compound having the same retention time of 2-bromoethanol 
is a potential interference. Possible interferences should be listed on 
the sample data sheets.
    3.6.2  GC parameters may be changed to circumvent interferences.
    3.6.3  There are usually trace contaminants in benzene. These 
contaminants, however, posed no problem of interference.
    3.6.4  Retention time data on a single column is not considered 
proof of chemical identity. Samples over the 1.0 ppm target level should 
be confirmed by GC/Mass Spec or other suitable means.
    3.7  Calculations
    3.7.1  The concentration in <greek-m>g/mL for a sample is determined 
by comparing the area of a particular sample to the calibration curve, 
which has been prepared from analytical standards.
    3.7.2  The amount of analyte in each sample is corrected for 
desorption efficiency by use of a desorption curve.
    3.7.3  Analytical results (A) from the two tubes that compose a 
particular air sample are added together.
    3.7.4  The concentration for a sample is calculated by the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.038

where:
A=<greek-m>g/mL
B=desorption volume in milliliters
C=air volume in liters.

    3.7.5  To convert mg/m<SUP>3</SUP> to parts per million (ppm) the 
following relationship is used:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.039

where:
mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>=results from 3.7.4
24.45=molar volume at 25  deg. C and 760mm Hg
44.05=molecular weight of ETO.

    3.8  Safety Precautions
    3.8.1  Ethylene oxide and benzene are potential carcinogens and care 
must be exercised when working with these compounds.
    3.8.2  All work done with the solvents (preparation of standards, 
desorption of samples, etc.) should be done in a hood.
    3.8.3  Avoid any skin contact with all of the solvents.
    3.8.4  Wear safety glasses at all times.
    3.8.5  Avoid skin contact with HBr because it is highly toxic and a 
strong irritant to eyes and skin.
    4. Backup Data.
    4.1  Detection Limit Data.
    The detection limit was determined by injecting 0.8 <greek-m>L of a 
0.015 <greek-m>g/mL standard of ethylene oxide into 1% CS<INF>2</INF> in 
benzene. The detection limit of the analytical procedure is taken to be 
1.20 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> <greek-m>g per injection. This is equivalent to 
8.3 ppb (0.015 mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>) for the recommended air volume.
    4.2  Desorption Efficiency.
    Ethylene oxide was spiked onto charcoal tubes and the following 
recovery data was obtained.

                  Summary of Other Sampling Procedures

    OSHA believes that served other types of monitoring equipment and 
techniques exist for monitoring time-weighted averages. Considerable 
research and method development is currently being performed, which will 
lead to improvements and a wider variety of monitoring techniques. A 
combination of monitoring procedures can be used. There probably is no 
one best method for monitoring personal exposure to ethylene oxide in 
all cases. There are advantages, disadvantages, and limitations to each 
method. The method of choice will depend on the need and requirements. 
Some commonly used methods

[[Page 353]]

include the use of charcoal tubes, passive dosimeters, Tedler gas 
sampling bags, detector tubes, photoionization detection units, infrared 
detection units and gas chromatographs. A number of these methods are 
described below.

                  A. Charcoal Tube Sampling Procedures

    Qazi-Ketcham method (Ex. 11-133)--This method consists of collecting 
EtO on Columbia JXC activated carbon, desorbing the EtO with carbon 
disulfide and analyzing by gas chromatography with flame ionization 
detection. Union Carbide has recently updated and revalidated this 
monitoring procedures. This method is capable of determining both eight-
hour time-weighted average exposures and short-term exposures. The 
method was validated to 0.5 ppm. Like other charcoal collecting 
procedures, the method requires considerable analytical expertise.
    ASTM-proposed method-- The Ethylene Oxide Industry Council (EOIC) 
has contracted with Clayton Environmental Consultants, Inc. to conduct a 
collaborative study for the proposed method. The ASTM-Proposed method is 
similar to the method published by Qazi and Ketcham is the November 1977 
American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal, and to the method of 
Pilney and Coyne, presented at the 1979 American Industrial Hygiene 
Conference. After the air to be sampled is drawn through an activated 
charcoal tube, the ethylene oxide is desorbed from the tube using carbon 
disulfide and is quantitated by gas chromatography utilizing a flame 
ionization detector. The ASTM-proposed method specifies a large two-
section charcoal tube, shipment in dry ice, storage at less
than -5 deg. C, and analysis within three weeks to prevent migration and 
sample loss. Two types of charcoal tubes are being tested--Pittsburgh 
Coconut-Based (PCB) and Columbia JXC charcoal. This collaborative study 
will give an indication of the inter- and intralaboratory precision and 
accuracy of the ASTM-proposed method. Several laboratories have 
considerable expertise using the Qazi-Ketcham and Dow methods.
    B. Passive Monitors--Ethylene oxide diffuses into the monitor and is 
collected in the sampling media. The DuPont Pro-Tek badge collects EtO 
in an absorbing solution, which is analyzed colorimetrically to 
determine the amount of EtO present. The 3M 350 badge collects the EtO 
on chemically treated charcoal. Other passive monitors are currently 
being developed and tested. Both 3M and DuPont have submitted data 
indicating their dosimeters meet the precision and accuracy requirements 
of the proposed ethylene oxide standard. Both presented laboratory 
validation data to 0.2 ppm (Exs. 11-65, 4-20, 108, 109, 130).
    C. Tedlar Gas Sampling Bags-Samples are collected by drawing a known 
volume of air into a Tedlar gas sampling bag. The ethylene oxide 
concentration is often determined on-site using a portable gas 
chromatograph or portable infrared spectometer.
    D. Detector tubes--A known volume of air is drawn through a detector 
tube using a small hand pump. The concentration of EtO is related to the 
length of stain developed in the tube. Detector tubes are economical, 
easy to use, and give an immediate readout. Unfortunately, partly 
because they are nonspecific, their accuracy is often questionable. 
Since the sample is taken over a short period of time, they may be 
useful for determining the source of leaks.
    E. Direct Reading Instruments--There are numerous types of direct 
reading instruments, each having its own strengths and weaknesses (Exs. 
135B, 135C, 107, 11-78, 11-153). Many are relatively new, offering 
greater sensitivity and specificity. Popular ethylene oxide direct 
reading instruments include infrared detection units, photoionization 
detection units, and gas chromatographs.
    Portable infrared analyzers provide an immediate, continuous 
indication of a concentration value; making them particularly useful for 
locating high concentration pockets, in leak detection and in ambient 
air monitoring. In infrared detection units, the amount of infrared 
light absorbed by the gas being analyzed at selected infrared 
wavelengths is related to the concentration of a particular component. 
Various models have either fixed or variable infrared filters, differing 
cell pathlengths, and microcomputer controls for greater sensitivity, 
automation, and interference elimination.
    A fairly recent detection system is photoionization detection. The 
molecules are ionized by high energy ultraviolet light. The resulting 
current is measured. Since different substances have different 
ionization potentials, other organic compounds may be ionized. The lower 
the lamp energy, the better the selectivity. As a continuous monitor, 
photoionization detection can be useful for locating high concentration 
pockets, in leak detection, and continuous ambient air monitoring. Both 
portable and stationary gas chromatographs are available with various 
types of detectors, including photoionization detectors. A gas 
chromatograph with a photoionization detector retains the photionization 
sensitivity, but minimizes or eliminates interferences. For several GC/
PID units, the sensitivity is in the 0.1-0.2 ppm EtO range. The GC/PID 
with microprocessors can sample up to 20 sample points sequentially, 
calculate and record data, and activate alarms or ventilation systems. 
Many are quite flexible and can be configured to meet the specific 
analysis needs for the workplace.

tube, Miran 103 IR analyzer, 3M 3550 monitor and the Du Pont C-70 
badge. Quoting Elbert V. Kring:

    We also believe that OSHA's proposed accuracy in this standard is 
appropriate. At plus or minus 25 percent at one part per million, and 
plus or minus 35 percent below that. And, our data indicates there's 
only one monitoring method, right now, that we've tested thoroughly, 
that meets that accuracy requirements. That is the Du Pont Pro-Tek 
badge* * *. We also believe that this kind of data should be confirmed 
by another independent laboratory, using the same type dynamic chamber 
testing (Tr. 1470)

Additional data by an independent laboratory following their exact 
protocol was not submitted. However, information was submitted on 
comparisons and precision and accuracy of those monitoring procedures 
which indicate far better precision and accuracy of those monitoring 
procedures than that obtained by Du Pont (Ex. 4-20, 130, 11-68, 11-133, 
130, 135A).
    The accuracy of any method depends to a large degree upon the skills 
and experience of those who not only collect the samples but also those 
who analyze the samples. Even for methods that are collaboratively 
tested, some laboratories are closer to the true values than others. 
Some laboratories may meet the precision and accuracy requirements of 
the method; others may consistently far exceed them for the same method.

Sec. 1910.1048  Formaldehyde.

    (a) Scope and application. This standard applies to all occupational 
exposures to formaldehyde, i.e. from formaldehyde gas, its solutions, 
and materials that release formaldehyde.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this standard, the following 
definitions shall apply:
    Action level means a concentration of 0.5 part formaldehyde per 
million parts of air (0.5 ppm) calculated as an eight (8)-hour time-
weighted average (TWA) concentration.
    Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 
or designee.
    Authorized person means any person required by work duties to be 
present in regulated areas, or authorized to do so by the employer, by 
this section, or by the OSH Act of 1970.
    Director means the Director of the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, or designee.
    Emergency is any occurrence, such as but not limited to equipment 
failure, rupture of containers, or failure of control equipment that 
results in an uncontrolled release of a significant amount of 
formaldehyde.
    Employee exposure means the exposure to airborne formaldehyde which 
would occur without corrections for protection provided by any 
respirator that is in use.
    Formaldehyde means the chemical substance, HCHO, Chemical Abstracts 
Service Registry No. 50-00-0.
    (c) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL)--(1) TWA: The employer shall 
assure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of 
formaldehyde which exceeds 0.75 parts formaldehyde per million parts of 
air (0.75 ppm) as an 8-hour TWA.
    (2) Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL): The employer shall assure that 
no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of formaldehyde 
which exceeds two parts formaldehyde per million parts of air (2 ppm) as 
a 15-minute STEL.
    (d) Exposure monitoring--(1) General. (i) Each employer who has a 
workplace covered by this standard shall monitor employees to determine 
their exposure to formaldehyde.
    (ii) Exception. Where the employer documents, using objective data, 
that the presence of formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasing products in 
the workplace cannot result in airborne concentrations of formaldehyde 
that would cause any employee to be exposed at or above the action level 
or the STEL under foreseeable conditions of use, the employer will not 
be required to measure employee exposure to formaldehyde.
    (iii) When an employee's exposure is determined from representative 
sampling, the measurements used shall be representative of the 
employee's full shift or short-term exposure to formaldehyde, as 
appropriate.

[[Page 355]]

    (iv) Representative samples for each job classification in each work 
area shall be taken for each shift unless the employer can document with 
objective data that exposure levels for a given job classification are 
equivalent for different work shifts.
    (2) Initial monitoring. The employer shall identify all employees 
who may be exposed at or above the action level or at or above the STEL 
and accurately determine the exposure of each employee so identified.
    (i) Unless the employer chooses to measure the exposure of each 
employee potentially exposed to formaldehyde, the employer shall develop 
a representative sampling strategy and measure sufficient exposures 
within each job classification for each workshift to correctly 
characterize and not underestimate the exposure of any employee within 
each exposure group.
    (ii) The initial monitoring process shall be repeated each time 
there is a change in production, equipment, process, personnel, or 
control measures which may result in new or additional exposure to 
formaldehyde.
    (iii) If the employer receives reports of signs or symptoms of 
respiratory or dermal conditions associated with formaldehyde exposure, 
the employer shall promptly monitor the affected employee's exposure.
    (3) Periodic monitoring. (i) The employer shall periodically measure 
and accurately determine exposure to formaldehyde for employees shown by 
the initial monitoring to be exposed at or above the action level or at 
or above the STEL.
    (ii) If the last monitoring results reveal employee exposure at or 
above the action level, the employer shall repeat monitoring of the 
employees at least every 6 months.
    (iii) If the last monitoring results reveal employee exposure at or 
above the STEL, the employer shall repeat monitoring of the employees at 
least once a year under worst conditions.
    (4) Termination of monitoring. The employer may discontinue periodic 
monitoring for employees if results from two consecutive sampling 
periods taken at least 7 days apart show that employee exposure is below 
the action level and the STEL. The results must be statistically 
representative and consistent with the employer's knowledge of the job 
and work operation.
    (5) Accuracy of monitoring. Monitoring shall be accurate, at the 95 
percent confidence level, to within plus or minus 25 percent for 
airborne concentrations of formaldehyde at the TWA and the STEL and to 
within plus or minus 35 percent for airborne concentrations of 
formaldehyde at the action level.
    (6) Employee notification of monitoring results. Within 15 days of 
receiving the results of exposure monitoring conducted under this 
standard, the employer shall notify the affected employees of these 
results. Notification shall be in writing, either by distributing copies 
of the results to the employees or by posting the results. If the 
employee exposure is over either PEL, the employer shall develop and 
implement a written plan to reduce employee exposure to or below both 
PELs, and give written notice to employees. The written notice shall 
contain a description of the corrective action being taken by the 
employer to decrease exposure.
    (7) Observation of monitoring. (i) The employer shall provide 
affected employees or their designated representatives an opportunity to 
observe any monitoring of employee exposure to formaldehyde required by 
this standard.
    (ii) When observation of the monitoring of employee exposure to 
formaldehyde requires entry into an area where the use of protective 
clothing or equipment is required, the employer shall provide the 
clothing and equipment to the observer, require the observer to use such 
clothing and equipment, and assure that the observer complies with all 
other applicable safety and health procedures.
    (e) Regulated areas. (1) The employer shall establish regulated 
areas where the concentration of airborne formaldehyde exceeds either 
the TWA or the STEL and post all entrances and accessways with signs 
bearing the following information:


[[Page 356]]



                                 DANGER

                              FORMALDEHYDE

                  IRRITANT AND POTENTIAL CANCER HAZARD

                        AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

    (2) The employer shall limit access to regulated areas to authorized 
persons who have been trained to recognize the hazards of formaldehyde.
    (3) An employer at a multiemployer worksite who establishes a 
regulated area shall communicate the access restrictions and locations 
of these areas to other employers with work operations at that worksite.
    (f) Methods of compliance--(1) Engineering controls and work 
practices. The employer shall institute engineering and work practice 
controls to reduce and maintain employee exposures to formaldehyde at or 
below the TWA and the STEL.
    (2) Exception. Whenever the employer has established that feasible 
engineering and work practice controls cannot reduce employee exposure 
to or below either of the PELs, the employer shall apply these controls 
to reduce employee exposures to the extent feasible and shall supplement 
them with respirators which satisfy this standard.
    (g) Respiratory protection--(1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering 
and work-practice controls.
    (ii) Work operations, such as maintenance and repair activities or

indicative of possible overexposure to formaldehyde.
    (i) Administration of a medical disease questionnaire, such as in 
appendix D, which is designed to elicit information on work history, 
smoking history, any evidence of eye, nose, or throat irritation; 
chronic airway problems or hyperreactive airway disease: allergic skin 
conditions or dermatitis; and upper or lower respiratory problems.
    (ii) A determination by the physician, based on evaluation of the 
medical disease questionnaire, of whether a medical examination is 
necessary for employees not required to wear respirators to reduce 
exposure to formaldehyde.
    (4) Medical examinations. Medical examinations shall be given to any 
employee who the physician feels, based on information in the medical 
disease questionnaire, may be at increased risk from exposure to 
formaldehyde and at the time of initial assignment and at least annually 
thereafter to all employees required to wear a respirator to reduce 
exposure to formaldehyde. The medical examination shall include:
    (i) A physical examination with emphasis on evidence of irritation 
or sensitization of the skin and respiratory system, shortness of 
breath, or irritation of the eyes.
    (ii) Laboratory examinations for respirator wearers consisting of 
baseline and annual pulmonary function tests. As a minimum, these tests 
shall consist of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume 
in one second (FEV<INF>1</INF>), and forced expiratory flow (FEF).

[[Page 359]]

    (iii) Any other test which the examining physician deems necessary 
to complete the written opinion.
    (iv) Counseling of employees having medical conditions that would be 
directly or indirectly aggravated by exposure to formaldehyde on the 
increased risk of impairment of their health.
    (5) Examinations for employees exposed in an emergency. The employer 
shall make medical examinations available as soon as possible to all 
employees who have been exposed to formaldehyde in an emergency.
    (i) The examination shall include a medical and work history with 
emphasis on any evidence of upper or lower respiratory problems, 
allergic conditions, skin reaction or hypersensitivity, and any evidence 
of eye, nose, or throat irritation.
    (ii) Other examinations shall consist of those elements considered 
appropriate by the examining physician.
    (6) Information provided to the physician. The employer shall 
provide the following information to the examining physician:
    (i) A copy of this standard and appendix A, C, D, and E;
    (ii) A description of the affected employee's job duties as they 
relate to the employee's exposure to formaldehyde;
    (iii) The representative exposure level for the employee's job 
assignment;
    (iv) Information concerning any personal protective equipment and 
respiratory protection used or to be used by the employee; and
    (v) Information from previous medical examinations of the affected 
employee within the control of the employer.
    (vi) In the event of a nonroutine examination because of an 
emergency, the employer shall provide to the physician as soon as 
possible: A description of how the emergency occurred and the exposure 
the victim may have received.
    (7) Physician's written opinion. (i) For each examination required 
under this standard, the employer shall obtain a written opinion from 
the examining physician. This written opinion shall contain the results 
of the medical examination except that it shall not reveal specific 
findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposure to 
formaldehyde. The written opinion shall include:
    (A) The physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any 
medical condition that would place the employee at an increased risk of 
material impairment of health from exposure to formaldehyde;
    (B) Any recommended limitations on the employee's exposure or 
changes in the use of personal protective equipment, including 
respirators;
    (C) A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician 
of any medical conditions which would be aggravated by exposure to 
formaldehyde, whether these conditions may have resulted from past 
formaldehyde exposure or from exposure in an emergency, and whether 
there is a need for further examination or treatment.
    (ii) The employer shall provide for retention of the results of the 
medical examination and tests conducted by the physician.
    (iii) The employer shall provide a copy of the physician's written 
opinion to the affected employee within 15 days of its receipt.
    (8) Medical removal. (i) The provisions of paragraph (l)(8) apply 
when an employee reports significant irritation of the mucosa of the 
eyes or the upper airways, respiratory sensitization, dermal irritation, 
or dermal sensitization attributed to workplace formaldehyde exposure. 
Medical removal provisions do not apply in the case of dermal irritation 
or dermal sensitization when the product suspected of causing the dermal 
condition contains less than 0.05% formaldehyde.
    (ii) An employee's report of signs or symptoms of possible 
overexposure to formaldehyde shall be evaluated by a physician selected 
by the employer pursuant to paragraph (l)(3). If the physician 
determines that a medical examination is not necessary under paragraph 
(l)(3)(ii), there shall be a two-week evaluation and remediation period 
to permit the employer to ascertain whether the signs or symptoms 
subside untreated or with the use of creams, gloves, first aid treatment 
or personal protective equipment. Industrial hygiene measures that limit 
the

[[Page 360]]

employee's exposure to formaldehyde may also be implemented during this 
period. The employee shall be referred immediately to a physician prior 
to expiration of the two-week period if the signs or symptoms worsen. 
Earnings, seniority and benefits may not be altered during the two-week 
period by virtue of the report.
    (iii) If the signs or symptoms have not subsided or been remedied by 
the end of the two-week period, or earlier if signs or symptoms warrant, 
the employee shall be examined by a physician selected by the employer. 
The physician shall presume, absent contrary evidence, that observed 
dermal irritation or dermal sensitization are not attributable to 
formaldehyde when products to which the affected employee is exposed 
contain less than 0.1% formaldehyde.
    (iv) Medical examinations shall be conducted in compliance with the 
requirements of paragraph (l)(5) (i) and (ii). Additional guidelines for 
conducting medical exams are contained in appendix C.
    (v) If the physician finds that significant irritation of the mucosa 
of the eyes or of the upper airways, respiratory sensitization, dermal 
irritation, or dermal sensitization result from workplace formaldehyde 
exposure and recommends restrictions or removal, the employer shall 
promptly comply with the restrictions or recommendation of removal. In 
the event of a recommendation of removal, the employer shall remove the 
effected employee from the current formaldehyde exposure and if 
possible, transfer the employee to work having no or significantly less 
exposure to formaldehyde.
    (vi) When an employee is removed pursuant to paragraph (l)(8)(v), 
the employer shall transfer the employee to comparable work for which 
the employee is qualified or can be trained in a short period (up to 6 
months), where the formaldehyde exposures are as low as possible, but 
not higher than the action level. The employeer shall maintain the 
employee's current earnings, seniority, and other benefits. If there is 
no such work available, the employer shall maintain the employee's 
current earnings, seniority and other benefits until such work becomes 
available, until the employee is determined to be unable to return to 
workplace formaldehyde exposure, until the employee is determined to be 
able to return to the original job status, or for six months, whichever 
comes first.
    (vii) The employer shall arrange for a follow-up medical examination 
to take place within six months after the employee is removed pursuant 
to this paragraph. This examination shall determine if the employee can 
return to the original job status, or if the removal is to be permanent. 
The physician shall make a decision within six months of the date the 
employee was removed as to whether the employee can be returned to the 
original job status, or if the removal is to be permanent.
    (viii) An employer's obligation to provide earnings, seniority and 
other benefits to a removed employee may be reduced to the extent that 
the employee receives compensation for earnings lost during the period 
of removal either from a publicly or employer-funded compensation 
program or from employment with another employer made possible by virtue 
of the employee's removal.
    (ix) In making determinations of the formaldehyde content of 
materials under this paragraph the employer may rely on objective data.
    (9) Multiple physician review. (i) After the employer selects the 
initial physician who conducts any medical examination or consultation 
to determine whether medical removal or restriction is appropriate, the 
employee may designate a second physician to review any findings, 
determinations or recommendations of the initial physician and to 
conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory tests as the 
second physician deems necessary and appropriate to evaluate the effects 
of formaldehyde exposure and to facilitate this review.
    (ii) The employer shall promptly notify an employee of the right to 
seek a second medical opinion after each occasion that an initial 
physician conducts a medical examination or consultation for the purpose 
of medical removal or restriction.
    (iii) The employer may condition its participation in, and payment 
for, the

[[Page 361]]

multiple physician review mechanism upon the employee doing the 
following within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the notification of 
the right to seek a second medical opinion, or receipt of the initial 
physician's written opinion, whichever is later;
    (A) The employee informs the employer of the intention to seek a 
second medical opinion, and
    (B) The employee initiates steps to make an appointment with a 
second physician.
    (iv) If the findings, determinations or recommendations of the 
second physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the 
employer and the employee shall assure that efforts are made for the two 
physicians to resolve the disagreement. If the two physicians are unable 
to quickly resolve their disagreement, then the employer and the 
employee through their respective physicians shall designate a third 
physician who shall be a specialist in the field at issue:
    (A) To review the findings, determinations or recommendations of the 
prior physicians; and
    (B) To conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests 
and discussions with the prior physicians as the third physician deems 
necessary to resolve the disagreement of the prior physicians.
    (v) In the alternative, the employer and the employee or authorized 
employee representative may jointly designate such third physician.
    (vi) The employer shall act consistent with the findings, 
determinations and recommendations of the third physician, unless the 
employer and the employee reach an agreement which is otherwise 
consistent with the recommendations of at least one of the three 
physicians.
    (m) Hazard communication--(1) General. Communication of the hazards

    Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1048--Substance Technical Guidelines for 
                                Formalin

    The following Substance Technical Guideline for Formalin provides 
information on uninhibited formalin solution (37% formaldehyde, no 
methanol stabilizer). It is designed to inform employees at the 
production level of their rights and duties under the formaldehyde 
standard whether their job title defines them as workers or supervisors. 
Much of the information provided is general; however, some information 
is specific for formalin. When employee exposure to formaldehyde is from 
resins capable of releasing formaldehyde, the resin itself and other 
impurities or decomposition products may also be toxic, and employers 
should include this information as well when informing employees of the 
hazards associated with the materials they handle. The precise hazards 
associated with exposure to formaldehyde depend both on the form (solid, 
liquid, or gas) of the material and the concentration of formaldehyde 
present. For example, 37-50 percent solutions of formaldehyde present a 
much greater hazard to the skin and eyes from spills or splashes than 
solutions containing less than 1 percent formaldehyde. Individual 
Substance Technical Guidelines used by the employer for training 
employees should be modified to properly give information on the 
material actually being used.

                        Fire and Explosion Hazard

    Moderate fire and explosion hazard when exposed to heat or flame.
    The flash point of 37% formaldehyde solutions is above normal room 
temperature, but the explosion range is very wide, from 7 to 73% by 
volume in air.

[[Page 365]]

    Reaction of formaldehyde with nitrogen dioxide, nitromethane, 
perchloric acid and aniline, or peroxyformic acid yields explosive 
compounds.

Flash Point: 185  deg.F (85  deg.C) closed cup
Lower Explosion Limit: 7%
Upper Explosion Limit: 73%
Autoignition Temperature: 806  deg.F (430  deg.C)
Flammability Class (OSHA): III A

    Extinguishing Media: Use dry chemical, ``alcohol foam'', carbon 
dioxide, or water in flooding amounts as fog. Solid streams may not be 
effective. Cool fire-exposed containers with water from side until well 
after fire is out.
    Use of water spray to flush spills can also dilute the spill to 
produce nonflammable mixtures. Water runoff, however, should be 
contained for treatment.

     National Fire Protection Association Section 325M Designation:

    Health: 2--Materials hazardous to health, but areas may be entered 
with full-faced mask self-contained breathing apparatus which provides 
eye protection.
    Flammability: 2--Materials which must be moderately heated before 
ignition will occur. Water spray may be used to extinguish the fire 
because the material can be cooled below its flash point.
    Reactivity: D--Materials which (in themselves) are normally stable 
even under fire exposure conditions and which are not reactive with 
water. Normal fire fighting procedures may be used.

                               Reactivity

    Stability: Formaldehyde solutions may self-polymerize to form 
paraformaldehyde which precipitates.
    Incompatibility (Materials to Avoid): Strong oxidizing agents, 
caustics, strong alkalies, isocyanates, anhydrides, oxides, and 
inorganic acids. Formaldehyde reacts with hydrochloric acid to form the 
potent carcinogen, bis-chloromethyl ether. Formaldehyde reacts with 
nitrogen dioxide, nitromethane, perchloric acid and aniline, or 
peroxyformic acid to yield explosive compounds. A violent reaction 
occurs when formaldehyde is mixed with strong oxidizers.
    Hazardous Combustion or Decomposition Products: Oxygen from the air 
can oxidize formaldehyde to formic acid, especially when heated. Formic 
acid is corrosive.

                           Health Hazard Data

                        Acute Effects of Exposure

    Ingestion (Swallowing): Liquids containing 10 to 40% formaldehyde 
cause severe irritation and inflammation of the mouth, throat, and 
stomach. Severe stomach pains will follow ingestion with possible loss 
of consciousness and death. Ingestion of dilute formaldehyde solutions 
(0.03-0.04%) may cause discomfort in the stomach and pharynx.
    Inhalation (Breathing): Formaldehyde is highly irritating to the 
upper respiratory tract and eyes. Concentrations of 0.5 to 2.0 ppm may 
irritate the eyes, nose, and throat of some individuals. Concentrations 
of 3 to 5 ppm also cause tearing of the eyes and are intolerable to some 
persons. Concentrations of 10 to 20 ppm cause difficulty in breathing, 
burning of the nose and throat, cough, and heavy tearing of the eyes, 
and 25 to 30 ppm causes severe respiratory tract injury leading to 
pulmonary edema and pneumonitis. A concentration of 100 ppm is 
immediately dangerous to life and health. Deaths from accidental 
exposure to high concentrations of formaldehyde have been reported.
    Skin (Dermal): Formalin is a severe skin irritant and a sensitizer. 
Contact with formalin causes white discoloration, smarting, drying, 
cracking, and scaling. Prolonged and repeated contact can cause numbness 
and a hardening or tanning of the skin. Previously exposed persons may 
react to future exposure with an allergic eczematous dermatitis or 
hives.
    Eye Contact: Formaldehyde solutions splashed in the eye can cause 
injuries ranging from transient discomfort to severe, permanent corneal 
clouding and loss of vision. The severity of the effect depends on the 
concentration of formaldehyde in the solution and whether or not the 
eyes are flushed with water immediately after the accident.
    Note.-- The perception of formaldehyde by odor and eye irritation 
becomes less sensitive with time as one adapts to formaldehyde. This can 
lead to overexposure if a worker is relying on formaldehyde's warning 
properties to alert him or her to the potential for exposure.

Acute Animal Toxicity:
Oral, rats: LD50=800 mg/kg
Oral, mouse: LD50=42 mg/kg
Inhalation, rats: LCLo=250 mg/kg
Inhalation, mouse: LCLo=900 mg/kg
Inhalation, rats: LC50=590 mg/kg

                       Chronic Effects of Exposure

    Carcinogenicity: Formaldehyde has the potential to cause cancer in 
humans. Repeated and prolonged exposure increases the risk. Various 
animal experiments have conclusively shown formaldehyde to be a 
carcinogen in rats. In humans, formaldehyde exposure has been associated 
with cancers of the lung, nasopharynx and oropharynx, and nasal 
passages.
    Mutagenicity: Formaldehyde is genotoxic in several in vitro test 
systems showing properties of both an initiator and a promoter.
    Toxicity: Prolonged or repeated exposure to formaldehyde may result 
in respiratory impairment. Rats exposed to formaldehyde at 2 ppm 
developed benign nasal tumors and

[[Page 366]]

changes of the cell structure in the nose as well as inflamed mucous 
membranes of the nose. Structural changes in the epithelial cells in the 
human nose have also been observed. Some persons have developed asthma 
or bronchitis following exposure to formaldehyde, most often as the 
result of an accidental spill involving a single exposure to a high 
concentration of formaldehyde.

                   Emergency and First Aid Procedures

    Ingestion (Swallowing): If the victim is conscious, dilute, 
inactivate, or absorb the ingested formaldehyde by giving milk, 
activated charcoal, or water. Any organic material will inactivate 
formaldehyde. Keep affected person warm and at rest. Get medical 
attention immediately. If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips.
    Inhalation (Breathing): Remove the victim from the exposure area to 
fresh air immediately. Where the formaldehyde concentration may be very 
high, each rescuer must put on a self-contained breathing apparatus 
before attempting to remove the victim, and medical personnel should be 
informed of the formaldehyde exposure immediately. If breathing has 
stopped, give artificial respiration. Keep the affected person warm and 
at rest. Qualified first-aid or medical personnel should administer 
oxygen, if available, and maintain the patient's airways and blood 
pressure until the victim can be transported to a medical facility. If 
exposure results in a highly irritated upper respiratory tract and 
coughing continues for more than 10 minutes, the worker should be 
hospitalized for observation and treatment.
    Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing (including shoes) 
immediately. Wash the affected area of your body with soap or mild 
detergent and large amounts of water until no evidence of the chemical 
remains (at least 15 to 20 minutes). If there are chemical burns, get 
first aid to cover the area with sterile, dry dressing, and bandages. 
Get medical attention if you experience appreciable eye or respiratory 
irritation.
    Eye Contact: Wash the eyes immediately with large amounts of water 
occasionally lifting lower and upper lids, until no evidence of chemical 
remains (at least 15 to 20 minutes). In case of burns, apply sterile 
bandages loosely without medication. Get medical attention immediately. 
If you have experienced appreciable eye irritation from a splash or 
excessive exposure, you should be referred promptly to an opthamologist 
for evaluation.

                          Emergency Procedures

    Emergencies: If you work in an area where a large amount of 
formaldehyde could be released in an accident or from equipment failure, 
your employer must develop procedures to be followed in event of an 
emergency. You should be trained in your specific duties in the event of 
an emergency, and it is important that you clearly understand these 
duties. Emergency equipment must be accessible and you should be trained 
to use any equipment that you might need. Formaldehyde contaminated 
equipment must be cleaned before reuse.
    If a spill of appreciable quantity occurs, leave the area quickly 
unless you have specific emergency duties. Do not touch spilled 
material. Designated persons may stop the leak and shut off ignition 
sources if these procedures can be done without risk. Designated persons 
should isolate the hazard area and deny entry except for necessary 
people protected by suitable protective clothing and respirators 
adequate for the exposure. Use water spray to reduce vapors. Do not 
smoke, and prohibit all flames or flares in the hazard area.
    Special Firefighting Procedures: Learn procedures and 
responsibilities in the event of a fire in your workplace. Become 
familiar with the appropriate equipment and supplies and their location. 
In firefighting, withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from 
venting safety device or any discoloration of storage tank due to fire.

                  Spill, Leak, and Disposal Procedures

    Occupational Spill: For small containers, place the leaking 
container in a well ventilated area. Take up small spills with absorbent 
material and place the waste into properly labeled containers for later 
disposal. For larger spills, dike the spill to minimize contamination 
and facilitate salvage or disposal. You may be able to neutralize the 
spill with sodium hydroxide or sodium sulfite. Your employer must comply 
with EPA rules regarding the clean-up of toxic waste and notify state 
and local authorities, if required. If the spill is greater than 1,000 
lb/day, it is reportable under EPA's Superfund legislation.
    Waste Disposal: Your employer must dispose of waste containing 
formaldehyde in accordance with applicable local, state, and Federal law 
and in a manner that minimizes exposure of employees at the site and of 
the clean-up crew.

                  Monitoring and Measurement Procedures

    Monitoring Requirements: If your exposure to formaldehyde exceeds 
the 0.5 ppm action level or the 2 ppm STEL, your employer must monitor 
your exposure. Your employer need not measure every exposure if a ``high 
exposure'' employee can be identified. This person usually spends the 
greatest amount of time nearest the process equipment. If you are a 
``representative employee'', you will be asked to wear a sampling device 
to collect formaldehyde. This device may be a passive badge, a sorbent 
tube attached to a pump, or

[[Page 367]]

an impinger containing liquid. You should perform your work as usual, 
but inform the person who is conducting the monitoring of any 
difficulties you are having wearing the device.
    Evaluation of 8-hour Exposure: Measurements taken for the purpose of 
determining time-weighted average (TWA) exposures are best taken with 
samples covering the full shift. Samples collected must be taken from 
the employee's breathing zone air.
    Short-term Exposure Evaluation: If there are tasks that involve 
brief but intense exposure to formaldehyde, employee exposure must be 
measured to assure compliance with the STEL. Sample collections are for 
brief periods, only 15 minutes, but several samples may be needed to 
identify the peak exposure.
    Monitoring Techniques: OSHA's only requirement for selecting a 
method for sampling and analysis is that the methods used accurately 
evaluate the concentration of formaldehyde in employees' breathing 
zones. Sampling and analysis may be performed by collection of 
formaldehyde on liquid or solid sorbents with subsequent chemical 
analysis. Sampling and analysis may also be performed by passive 
diffusion monitors and short-term exposure may be measured by 
instruments such as real-time continuous monitoring systems and portable 
direct reading instruments.
    Notification of Results: Your employer must inform you of the 
results of exposure monitoring representative of your job. You may be 
informed in writing, but posting the results where you have ready access 
to them constitutes compliance with the standard.

                    Protective Equipment and Clothing

    [Material impervious to formaldehyde is needed if the employee 
handles formaldehyde solutions of 1% or more. Other employees may also 
require protective clothing or equipment to prevent dermatitis.]
    Respiratory Protection: Use NIOSH-approved full facepiece negative 
pressure respirators equipped with approved cartridges or canisters 
within the use limitations of these devices. (Present restrictions on 
cartridges and canisters do not permit them to be used for a full 
workshift.) In all other situations, use positive pressure respirators 
such as the positive-pressure air purifying respirator or the self-
contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). If you use a negative pressure 
respirator, your employer must provide you with fit testing of the 
respirator at least once a year in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in Appendix E.
    Protective Gloves: Wear protective (impervious) gloves provided by 
your employer, at no cost, to prevent contact with formalin. Your 
employer should select these gloves based on the results of permeation 
testing and in accordance with the ACGIH Guidelines for Selection of 
Chemical Protective Clothing.
    Eye Protection: If you might be splashed in the eyes with formalin, 
it is essential that you wear goggles or some other type of complete 
protection for the eye. You may also need a face shield if your face is 
likely to be splashed with formalin, but you must not substitute face 
shields for eye protection. (This section pertains to formaldehyde 
solutions of 1% or more.)
    Other Protective Equipment: You must wear protective (impervious) 
clothing and equipment provided by your employer at no cost to prevent 
repeated or prolonged contact with formaldehyde liquids. If you are 
required to change into whole-body chemical protective clothing, your 
employer must provide a change room for your privacy and for storage of 
your normal clothing.
    If you are splashed with formaldehyde, use the emergency showers and 
eyewash fountains provided by your employer immediately to prevent 
serious injury. Report the incident to your supervisor and obtain 
necessary medical support.

                      Entry Into an IDLH Atmosphere

    Enter areas where the formaldehyde concentration might be 100 ppm or 
more only with complete body protection including a self-contained 
breathing apparatus with a full facepiece operated in a positive 
pressure mode or a supplied air respirator with full facepiece and 
operated in a positive pressure mode. This equipment is essential to 
protect your life and health under such extreme conditions.

                          Engineering Controls

    Ventilation is the most widely applied engineering control method 
for reducing the concentration of airborne substances in the breathing 
zones of workers. There are two distinct types of ventilation.
    Local Exhaust: Local exhaust ventilation is designed to capture 
airborne contaminants as near to the point of generation as possible. To 
protect you, the direction of contaminant flow must always be toward the 
local exhaust system inlet and away from you.
    General (Mechanical): General dilution ventilation involves 
continuous introduction of fresh air into the workroom to mix with the 
contaminated air and lower your breathing zone concentration of 
formaldehyde. Effectiveness depends on the number of air changes per 
hour. Where devices emitting formaldehyde are spread out over a large 
area, general dilution ventilation may be the only practical method of 
control.
    Work Practices: Work practices and administrative procedures are an 
important part of a control system. If you are asked to perform

[[Page 368]]

a task in a certain manner to limit your exposure to formaldehyde, it is 
extremely important that you follow these procedures.

                          Medical Surveillance

    Medical surveillance helps to protect employees' health. You are 
encouraged strongly to participate in the medical surveillance program.
    Your employer must make a medical surveillance program available at 
no expense to you and at a reasonable time and place if you are exposed 
to formaldehyde at concentrations above 0.5 ppm as an 8-hour average or 
2 ppm over any 15-minute period. You will be offered medical 
surveillance at the time of your initial assignment and once a year 
afterward as long as your exposure is at least 0.5 ppm (TWA) or 2 ppm 
(STEL). Even if your exposure is below these levels, you should inform 
your employer if you have signs and symptoms that you suspect, through 
your training, are related to your formaldehyde exposure because you may 
need medical surveillance to determine if your health is being impaired 
by your exposure.
    The surveillance plan includes:
    (a) A medical disease questionnaire.
    (b) A physical examination if the physician determines this is 
necessary.
    If you are required to wear a respirator, your employer must offer 
you a physical examination and a pulmonary function test every year.
    The physician must collect all information needed to determine if 
you are at increased risk from your exposure to formaldehyde. At the 
physician's discretion, the medical examination may include other tests, 
such as a chest x-ray, to make this determination.
    After a medical examination the physician will provide your employer 
with a written opinion which includes any special protective measures 
recommended and any restrictions on your exposure. The physician must 
inform you of any medical conditions you have which would be aggravated 
by exposure to formaldehyde.
    All records from your medical examinations, including disease 
surveys, must be retained at your employer's expense.

                               Emergencies

    If you are exposed to formaldehyde in an emergency and develop signs 
or symptoms associated with acute toxicity from formaldehyde exposure, 
your employer must provide you with a medical examination as soon as 
possible. This medical examination will include all steps necessary to 
stabilize your health. You may be kept in the hospital for observation 
if your symptoms are severe to ensure that any delayed effects are 
recognized and treated.

 Appendix B to Sec. 1910.1048--Sampling Strategy and Analytical Methods 
                            for Formaldehyde

    To protect the health of employees, exposure measurements must be 
unbiased and representative of employee exposure. The proper measurement 
of employee exposure requires more than a token commitment on the part 
of the employer. OSHA's mandatory requirements establish a baseline; 
under the best of circumstances all questions regarding employee 
exposure will be answered. Many employers, however, will wish to conduct 
more extensive monitoring before undertaking expensive commitments, such 
as engineering controls, to assure that the modifications are truly 
necessary. The following sampling strategy, which was developed at NIOSH 
by Nelson A. Leidel, Kenneth A. Busch, and Jeremiah R. Lynch and 
described in NIOSH publication No. 77-173 (Occupational Exposure 
Sampling Strategy Manual) will assist the employer in developing a 
strategy for determining the exposure of his or her employees.
    There is no one correct way to determine employee exposure. 
Obviously, measuring the exposure of every employee exposed to 
formaldehyde will provide the most information on any given day. Where 
few employees are exposed, this may be a practical solution. For most 
employers, however, use of the following strategy will give just as much 
information at less cost.
    Exposure data collected on a single day will not automatically 
guarantee the employer that his or her workplace is always in compliance 
with the formaldehyde standard. This does not imply, however, that it is 
impossible for an employer to be sure that his or her worksite is in 
compliance with the standard. Indeed, a properly designed sampling 
strategy showing that all employees are exposed below the PELs, at least 
with a 95 percent certainty, is compelling evidence that the exposure 
limits are being achieved provided that measurements are conducted using 
valid sampling strategy and approved analytical methods.
    There are two PELs, the TWA concentration and the STEL. Most 
employers will find that one of these two limits is more critical in the 
control of their operations, and OSHA expects that the employer will 
concentrate monitoring efforts on the critical component. If the more 
difficult exposure is controlled, this information, along with 
calculations to support the assumptions, should be adequate to show that 
the other exposure limit is also being achieved.

[[Page 369]]

                            Sampling Strategy

           Determination of the Need for Exposure Measurements

    The employer must determine whether employees may be exposed to 
concentrations in excess of the action level. This determination becomes 
the first step in an employee exposure monitoring program that minimizes 
employer sampling burdens while providing adequate employee protection. 
If employees may be exposed above the action level, the employer must 
measure exposure. Otherwise, an objective determination that employee 
exposure is low provides adequate evidence that exposure potential has 
been examined.
    The employer should examine all available relevant information, eg. 
insurance company and trade association data and information from 
suppliers or exposure data collected from similar operations. The 
employer may also use previously-conducted sampling including area 
monitoring. The employer must make a determination relevant to each 
operation although this need not be on a separate piece of paper. If the 
employer can demonstrate conclusively that no employee is exposed above 
the action level or the STEL through the use of objective data, the 
employer need proceed no further on employee exposure monitoring until 
such time that conditions have changed and the determination is no 
longer valid.
    If the employer cannot determine that employee exposure is less than 
the action level and the STEL, employee exposure monitoring will have to 
be conducted.

                        Workplace Material Survey

    The primary purpose of a survey of raw material is to determine if 
formaldehyde is being used in the work environment and if so, the 
conditions under which formaldehyde is being used.
    The first step is to tabulate all situations where formaldehyde is 
used in a manner such that it may be released into the workplace 
atmosphere or contaminate the skin. This information should be available 
through analysis of company records and information on the MSDSs 
available through provisions of this standard and the Hazard 
Communication standard.
    If there is an indication from materials handling records and 
accompanying MSDSs that formaldehyde is being used in the following 
types of processes or work operations, there may be a potential for 
releasing formaldehyde into the workplace atmosphere:
    (1) Any operation that involves grinding, sanding, sawing, cutting, 
crushing, screening, sieving, or any other manipulation of material that 
generates formaldehyde-bearing dust
    (2) Any processes where there have been employee complaints or 
symptoms indicative of exposure to formaldehyde
    (3) Any liquid or spray process involving formaldehyde
    (4) Any process that uses formaldehyde in preserved tissue
    (5) Any process that involves the heating of a formaldehyde-bearing 
resin.

Processes and work operations that use formaldehyde in these manners 
will probably require further investigation at the worksite to determine 
the extent of employee monitoring that should be conducted.

                         Workplace Observations

    To this point, the only intention has been to provide an indication 
as to the existence of potentially exposed employees. With this 
information, a visit to the workplace is needed to observe work 
operations, to identify potential health hazards, and to determine 
whether any employees may be exposed to hazardous concentrations of 
formaldehyde.
    In many circumstances, sources of formaldehyde can be identified 
through the sense of smell. However, this method of detection should be 
used with caution because of olfactory fatigue.
    Employee location in relation to source of formaldehyde is important 
in determining if an employee may be significantly exposed to 
formaldehyde. In most instances, the closer a worker is to the source, 
the higher the probability that a significant exposure will occur.
    Other characteristics should be considered. Certain high temperature 
operations give rise to higher evaporation rates. Locations of open 
doors and windows provide natural ventilation that tend to dilute 
formaldehyde emissions. General room ventilation also provides a measure 
of control.

            Calculation of Potential Exposure Concentrations

    By knowing the ventilation rate in a workplace and the quantity of 
formaldehyde generated, the employer may be able to determine by 
calculation if the PELs might be exceeded. To account for poor mixing of 
formaldehyde into the entire room, locations of fans and proximity of 
employees to the work operation, the employer must include a safety 
factor. If an employee is relatively close to a source, particularly if 
he or she is located downwind, a safety factor of 100 may be necessary. 
For other situations, a factor of 10 may be acceptable. If the employer 
can demonstrate through such calculations that employee exposure does 
not exceed the action level or the STEL, the employer may use this 
information as objective data to demonstrate compliance with the 
standard.

[[Page 370]]

                            Sampling Strategy

    Once the employer determines that there is a possibility of 
substantial employee exposure to formaldehyde, the employer is obligated 
to measure employee exposure.
    The next step is selection of a maximum risk employee. When there 
are different processes where employees may be exposed to formaldehyde, 
a maximum risk employee should be selected for each work operation.
    Selection of the maximum risk employee requires professional 
judgment. The best procedure for selecting the maximum risk employee is 
to observe employees and select the person closest to the source of 
formaldehyde. Employee mobility may affect this selection; eg. if the 
closest employee is mobile in his tasks, he may not be the maximum risk 
employee. Air movement patterns and differences in work habits will also 
affect selection of the maximum risk employee.
    When many employees perform essentially the same task, a maximum 
risk employee cannot be selected. In this circumstance, it is necessary 
to resort to random sampling of the group of workers. The objective is 
to select a subgroup of adequate size so that there is a high 
probability that the random sample will contain at least one worker with 
high exposure if one exists. The number of persons in the group 
influences the number that need to be sampled to ensure that at least 
one individual from the highest 10 percent exposure group is contained 
in the sample. For example, to have 90 percent confidence in the 
results, if the group size is 10, nine should be sampled; for 50, only 
18 need to be sampled.
    If measurement shows exposure to formaldehyde at or above the action 
level or the STEL, the employer needs to identify all other employees 
who may be exposed at or above the action level or STEL and measure or 
otherwise accurately characterize the exposure of these employees.
    Whether representative monitoring or random sampling are conducted, 
the purpose remains the same--to determine if the exposure of any 
employee is above the action level. If the exposure of the most exposed 
employee is less than the action level and the STEL, regardless of how 
the employee is identified, then it is reasonable to assume that 
measurements of exposure of the other employees in that operation would 
be below the action level and the STEL.

                          Exposure Measurements

    There is no ``best'' measurement strategy for all situations. Some 
elements to consider in developing a strategy are:
    (1) Availability and cost of sampling equipment
    (2) Availability and cost of analytic facilities
    (3) Availability and cost of personnel to take samples
    (4) Location of employees and work operations
    (5) Intraday and interday variations in the process
    (6) Precision and accuracy of sampling and analytic methods, and
    (7) Number of samples needed.
    Samples taken for determining compliance with the STEL differ from 
those that measure the TWA concentration in important ways. STEL samples 
are best taken in a nonrandom fashion using all available knowledge 
relating to the area, the individual, and the process to obtain samples 
during periods of maximum expected concentrations. At least three 
measurements on a shift are generally needed to spot gross errors or 
mistakes; however, only the highest value represents the STEL.
    If an operation remains constant throughout the workshift, a much 
greater number of samples would need to be taken over the 32 discrete 
nonoverlapping periods in an 8-hour workshift to verify compliance with 
a STEL. If employee exposure is truly uniform throughout the workshift, 
however, an employer in compliance with the l ppm TWA would be in 
compliance with the 2 ppm STEL, and this determination can probably be 
made using objective data.

                 Need to Repeat the Monitoring Strategy

    Interday and intraday fluctuations in employee exposure are mostly 
influenced by the physical processes that generate formaldehyde and the 
work habits of the employee. Hence, in-plant process variations 
influence the employer's determination of whether or not additional 
controls need to be imposed. Measurements that employee exposure is low 
on a day that is not representative of worst conditions may not provide 
sufficient information to determine whether or not additional 
engineering controls should be installed to achieve the PELs.
    The person responsible for conducting sampling must be aware of 
systematic changes which will negate the validity of the sampling 
results. Systematic changes in formaldehyde exposure concentration for 
an employee can occur due to:
    (1) The employee changing patterns of movement in the workplace
    (2) Closing of plant doors and windows
    (3) Changes in ventilation from season to season
    (4) Decreases in ventilation efficiency or abrupt failure of 
engineering control equipment
    (5) Changes in the production process or work habits of the 
employee.

Any of these changes, if they may result in additional exposure that 
reaches the next level of action (i.e. 0.5 or 1.0 ppm as an 8-hr average 
or 2 ppm over 15 minutes) require

[[Page 371]]

the employer to perform additional monitoring to reassess employee 
exposure.
    A number of methods are suitable for measuring employee exposure to 
formaldehyde or for characterizing emissions within the worksite. The 
preamble to this standard describes some methods that have been widely 
used or subjected to validation testing. A detailed analytical procedure 
derived from the OSHA Method 52 for acrolein and formaldehyde is 
presented below for informational purposes.
    Inclusion of OSHA's method in this appendix in no way implies that 
it is the only acceptable way to measure employee exposure to 
formaldehyde. Other methods that are free from significant interferences 
and that can determine formaldehyde at the permissible exposure limits 
within <plus-minus>25 percent of the ``true'' value at the 95 percent 
confidence level are also acceptable. Where applicable, the method 
shou1d a1so be capab1e of measuring formaldehyde at the action level to 
<plus-minus>35 percent of the ``true'' value with a 95 percent 
confidence level. OSHA encourages emp1oyers to choose methods that will 
be best for their individual needs. The employer must exercise caution, 
however, in choosing an appropriate method since some techniques suffer 
from interferences that are likely to be present in workplaces of 
certain industry sectors where formaldehyde is used.

                          1. General Discussion

    1.1  Background: The current OSHA method for collecting acrolein 
vapor recommends the use of activated 13X molecular sieves. The samples 
must be stored in an ice bath during and after sampling and also they 
must be analyzed within 48 hours of collection. The current OSHA method 
for collecting formaldehyde vapor recommends the use of bubblers 
containing 10% methanol in water as the trapping solution.
    This work was undertaken to resolve the sample stability problems 
associated with acrolein and also to eliminate the need to use bubb1ers 
to sample formaldehyde. A goal of this work was to develop and/or to 
evaluate a common sampling and analytical procedure for acrolein and 
formaldehyde.
    NIOSH has developed independent methodologies for acrolein and 
formaldehyde which recommend the use of reagent-coated adsorbent tubes 
to collect the aldehydes as stable derivatives. The formaldehyde 
sampling tubes contain Chromosorb 102 adsorbent coated with N-
benzylethanolamine (BEA) which reacts with formaldehyde vapor to form a 
stable oxazolidine compound. The acrolein sampling tubes contain XAD-2 
adsorbent coated with 2-(hydroxymethyl)piperidine (2-HMP) which reacts 
with acrolein vapor to form a different, stable oxazolidine derivative. 
Acrolein does not appear to react with BEA to give a suitable reaction 
product. Therefore, the formaldehyde procedure cannot provide a common 
method for both aldehydes. However, formaldehyde does react with 2-HMP 
to form a very suitable reaction product. It is the quantitative 
reaction of acrolein and formaldehyde with 2-HMP that provides the basis 
for this evaluation.
    This sampling and analytical procedure is very similar to the method 
recommended by NIOSH for acrolein. Some changes in the NIOSH methodology 
were necessary to permit the simultaneous determination of both 
aldehydes and also to accommodate OSHA laboratory equipment and 
analytical techniques.
    1.2  Limit-defining parameters: The analyte air concentrations 
reported in this method are based on the recommended air volume for each 
analyte collected separately and a desorption volume of 1 mL. The 
amounts are presented as acrolein and/or formaldehyde, even though the 
derivatives are the actual species analyzed.
    1.2.1  Detection limits of the analytical procedure: The detection 
limit of the analytical procedure was 386 pg per injection for 
formaldehyde. This was the amount of analyte which gave a peak whose 
height was about five times the height of the peak given by the residual 
formaldehyde derivative in a typical blank front section of the 
recommended sampling tube.
    1.2.2  Detection limits of the overall procedure: The detection 
limits of the overall procedure were 482 ng per sample (16 ppb or 20 
<greek-m>g/m\3\ for formaldehyde). This was the amount of analyte spiked 
on the sampling device which allowed recoveries approximately equal to 
the detection limit of the analytical procedure.

[[Page 372]]

    1.2.3  Reliable quantitation limits: The reliable quantitation limit 
was 482 ng per sample (16 ppb or 20 <greek-m>g/m\3\) for formaldehyde. 
These were the smallest amounts of analyte which could be quantitated 
within the limits of a recovery of at least 75% and a precision 
(<plus-minus>1.96 SD) of <plus-minus>25% or better.
_______________________________________________________________________
    The reliable quantitation limit and detection limits reported in the 
method are based upon optimization of the instrument for the smallest 
possible amount of analyte. When the target concentration of an analyte 
is exceptionally higher than these limits, they may not be attainable at 
the routine operating parameters.

_______________________________________________________________________
    1.2.4  Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the analytical procedure over 
concentration ranges representing 0.4 to 2 times the target 
concentration, based on the recommended air volumes, was 7,589 area 
units per <greek-m>g/mL for formaldehyde. This value was determined from 
the slope of the calibration curve. The sensitivity may vary with the 
particular instrument used in the analysis.
    1.2.5  Recovery: The recovery of formaldehyde from samples used in 
an 18-day storage test remained above 92% when the samples were stored 
at ambient temperature. These values were determined from regression 
lines which were calculated from the storage data. The recovery of the 
analyte from the collection device must be at least 75% following 
storage.
    1.2.6  Precision (analytical method only): The pooled coefficient of 
variation obtained from replicate determinations of analytical standards 
over the range of 0.4 to 2 times the target concentration was 0.0052 for 
formaldehyde (Section 4.3).
    1.2.7  Precision (overall procedure): The precision at the 95% 
confidence level for the ambient temperature storage tests was 
<plus-minus>14.3% for formaldehyde. These values each include an 
additional <plus-minus>5% for sampling error. The overall procedure must 
provide results at the target concentrations that are <plus-minus>25% at 
the 95% confidence level.
    1.2.8  Reproducibility: Samples collected from controlled test 
atmospheres and a draft copy of this procedure were given to a chemist 
unassociated with this evaluation. The formaldehyde samples were 
analyzed following 15 days storage. The average recovery was 96.3% and 
the standard deviation was 1.7%.
    1.3  Advantages:
    1.3.1  The sampling and analytical procedures permit the 
simultaneous determination of acrolein and formaldehyde.
    1.3.2  Samples are stable following storage at ambient temperature 
for at least 18 days.
    1.4  Disadvantages: None.

                          2. Sampling Procedure

    2.1  Apparatus:
    2.1.1  Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that 
can be calibrated to within <plus-minus>5% of the recommended 0.1 L/min 
sampling rate with the sampling tube in line.
    2.1.2  Samples are collected with laboratory prepared sampling 
tubes. The sampling tube is constructed of silane treated glass and is 
about 8-cm long. The ID is 4 mm and the OD is 6 mm. One end of the tube 
is tapered so that a glass wool end plug will hold the contents of the 
tube in place during sampling. The other end of the sampling tube is 
open to its full 4-mm ID to facilitate packing of the tube. Both ends of 
the tube are fire-polished for safety. The tube is packed with a 75-mg 
backup section, located nearest the tapered end and a 150-mg sampling 
section of pretreated XAD-2 adsorbent which has been coated with 2-HMP. 
The two sections of coated adsorbent are separated and retained with 
small plugs of silanized glass wool. Following packing, the sampling 
tubes are sealed with two \7/32\ inch OD plastic end caps. Instructions 
for the pretreatment and the coating of XAD-2 adsorbent are presented in 
Section 4 of this method.
    2.1.3  Sampling tubes, similar to those recommended in this method, 
are marketed by Supelco, Inc. These tubes were not available when this 
work was initiated; therefore, they were not evaluated.
    2.2  Reagents: None required.
    2.3  Technique:
    2.3.1  Properly label the sampling tube before sampling and then 
remove the plastic end caps.
    2.3.2  Attach the sampling tube to the pump using a section of 
flexible plastic tubing such that the large, front section of the 
sampling tube is exposed directly to the atmosphere. Do not place any 
tubing ahead of the sampling tube. The sampling tube should be attached 
in the worker's breathing zone in a vertical manner such that it does 
not impede work performance.
    2.3.3  After sampling for the appropriate time, remove the sampling 
tube from the pump and then seal the tube with plastic end caps.
    2.3.4  Include at least one blank for each sampling set. The blank 
should be handled in the same manner as the samples with the exception 
that air is not drawn through it.
    2.3.5  List any potential interferences on the sample data sheet.
    2.4  Breakthrough:
    2.4.1  Breakthrough was defined as the relative amount of analyte 
found on a backup sample in relation to the total amount of analyte 
collected on the sampling train.
    2.4.2  For formaldehyde collected from test atmospheres containing 6 
times the PEL, the average 5% breakthrough air volume was 41

[[Page 373]]

L. The sampling rate was 0.1 L/min and the average mass of formaldehyde 
collected was 250 <greek-m>g.
    2.5  Desorption Efficiency: No desorption efficiency corrections are 
necessary to compute air sample results because analytical standards are 
prepared using coated adsorbent. Desorption efficiencies were 
determined, however, to investigate the recoveries of the analytes from 
the sampling device. The average recovery over the range of 0.4 to 2 
times the target concentration, based on the recommended air volumes, 
was 96.2% for formaldehyde. Desorption efficiencies were essentially 
constant over the ranges studied.
    2.6   Recommended Air Volume and Sampling Rate:
    2.6.1  The recommended air volume for formaldehyde is 24 L.
    2.6.2  The recommended sampling rate is 0.1 L/min.
    2.7  Interferences:
    2.7.1  Any collected substance that is capable of reacting 2-HMP and 
thereby depleting the derivatizing agent is a potential interference. 
Chemicals which contain a carbonyl group, such as acetone, may be 
capable or reacting with 2-HMP.
    2.7.2  There are no other known interferences to the sampling 
method.
    2.8  Safety Precautions:
    2.8.1  Attach the sampling equipment to the worker in such a manner 
that it well not interfere with work performance or safety.
    2.8.2  Follow all safety practices that apply to the work area being 
sampled.

                         3. Analytical Procedure

    3.1  Apparatus:
    3.1.1  A gas chromatograph (GC), equipped with a nitrogen selective 
detector. A Hewlett-Packard Model 5840A GC fitted with a nitrogen-
phosphorus flame ionization detector (NPD) was used for this evaluation. 
Injections were performed using a Hewlett-Packard Model 7671A automatic 
sampler.
    3.1.2  A GC column capable of resolving the analytes from any 
interference. A 6 ft x \1/4\ in OD (2mm ID) glass GC column containing 
10% UCON 50-HB-5100 + 2% KOH on 80/100 mesh Chromosorb W-AW was used for 
the evaluation. Injections were performed on-column.
    3.1.3  Vials, glass 2-mL with Teflon-lined caps.
    3.1.4  Volumetric flasks, pipets, and syringes for preparing 
standards, making dilutions, and performing injections.
    3.2  Reagents:
    3.2.1  Toluene and dimethylformamide. Burdick and Jackson solvents 
were used in this evaluation.
    3.2.2  Helium, hydrogen, and air, GC grade.
    3.2.3  Formaldehyde, 37%, by weight, in water. Aldrich Chemical, ACS 
Reagent Grade formaldehyde was used in this evaluation.
    3.2.4  Amberlite XAD-2 adsorbent coated with 2-(hydroxymethyl--
piperidine (2-HMP), 10% by weight (Section 4).
    3.2.5  Desorbing solution with internal standard. This solution was 
prepared by adding 20 <greek-m>L of dimethylformamide to 100 mL of 
toluene.
    3.3  Standard preparation:
    3.3.1  Formaldehyde: Prepare stock standards by diluting known 
volumes of 37% formaldehyde solution with methanol. A procedure to 
determine the formaldehyde content of these standards is presented in 
Section 4. A standard containing 7.7 mg/mL formaldehyde was prepared by 
diluting 1 mL of the 37% reagent to 50 mL with methanol.
    3.3.2  It is recommended that analytical standards be prepared about 
16 hours before the air samples are to be analyzed in order to ensure 
the complete reaction of the analytes with 2-HMP. However, rate studies 
have shown the reaction to be greater than 95% complete after 4 hours. 
Therefore, one or two standards can be analyzed after this reduced time 
if sample results are outside the concentration range of the prepared 
standards.
    3.3.3  Place 150-mg portions of coated XAD-2 adsorbent, from the 
same lot number as used to collect the air samples, into each of several 
glass 2-mL vials. Seal each vial with a Teflon-lined cap.
    3.3.4  Prepare fresh analytical standards each day by injecting 
appropriate amounts of the diluted analyte directly onto 150-mg portions 
of coated adsorbent. It is permissible to inject both acrolein and 
formaldehyde on the same adsorbent portion. Allow the standards to stand 
at room temperature. A standard, approximately the target levels, was 
prepared by injecting 11 <greek-m>L of the acrolein and 12 <greek-m>L of 
the formaldehyde stock standards onto a single coated XAD-2 adsorbent 
portion.
    3.3.5  Prepare a sufficient number of standards to generate the 
calibration curves. Analytical standard concentrations should bracket 
sample concentrations. Thus, if samples are not in the concentration 
range of the prepared standards, additional standards must be prepared 
to determine detector response.
    3.3.7  Desorb the standards in the same manner as the samples 
following the 16-hour reaction time.
    3.4  Sample preparation:
    3.4.1  Transfer the 150-mg section of the sampling tube to a 2-mL 
vial. Place the 75-mg section in a separate vial. If the glass wool 
plugs contain a significant number of adsorbent beads, place them with 
the appropriate sampling tube section. Discard the glass wool plugs if 
they do not contain a significant number of adsorbent beads.
    3.4.2  Add 1 mL of desorbing solution to each vial.
    3.4.3  Seal the vials with Teflon-lined caps and then allow them to 
desorb for one hour.

[[Page 374]]

Shake the vials by hand with vigorous force several times during the 
desorption time.
    3.4.4  Save the used sampling tubes to be cleaned and recycled.
    3.5  Analysis:
    3.5.1  GC Conditions

Column Temperature:
Bi-level temperature program--First level: 100 to 140  deg. C at 4  deg. 
C/min following completion of the first level.
Second level: 140 to 180  deg. C at 20  deg. C/min following completion 
of the first level.
Isothermal period: Hold column at 180  deg. C until the recorder pen 
returns to baseline (usually about 25 min after injection).

Injector temperature: 180  deg. C
Helium flow rate: 30 mL/min (detector response will be reduced if 
nitrogen is substituted for helium carrier gas).
Injection volume: 0.8 <greek-m>L
GC column: Six-ft x \1/4\-in OD (2 mm ID) glass GC column containing 10% 
UCON 50-HB-5100+2% KOH on 80/100 Chromosorb W-AW.
    NPD conditions:
    Hydrogen flow rate: 3 mL/min
    Air flow rate: 50 mL/min
    Detector temperature: 275  deg. C
    3.5.2  Chromatogram: For an example of a typical chromatogram, see 
Figure 4.11 in OSHA Method 52.
    3.5.3  Use a suitable method, such as electronic integration, to 
measure detector response.
    3.5.4  Use an internal standard method to prepare the calibration 
curve with several standard solutions of different concentrations. 
Prepare the calibration curve daily. Program the integrator to report 
results in <greek-m>g/mL.
    3.5.5  Bracket sample concentrations with standards.
    3.6  Interferences (Analytical)
    3.6.1  Any compound with the same general retention time as the 
analytes and which also gives a detector response is a potential 
interference. Possible interferences should be reported to the 
laboratory with submitted samples by the industrial hygienist.
    3.6.2  GC parameters (temperature, column, etc.) may be changed to 
circumvent interferences.
    3.6.3  A useful means of structure designation is GC/MS. It is 
recommended this procedure be used to confirm samples whenever possible.
    3.6.4  The coated adsorbent usually contains a very small amount of 
residual formaldehyde derivative (Section 4.8).
    3.7  Calculations:
    3.7.1  Results are obtained by use of calibration curves. 
Calibration curves are prepared by plotting detector response against 
concentration for each standard. The best line through the data points 
is determined by curve fitting.
    3.7.2  The concentration, in <greek-m>g/mL, for a particular sample 
is determined by comparing its detector response to the calibration 
curve. If either of the analytes is found on the backup section, it is 
added to the amount found on the front section. Blank corrections should 
be performed before adding the results together.
    3.7.3  The acrolein and/or formaldehyde air concentration can be 
expressed using the following equation:

mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>=(A)(B)/C
where A=<greek-m>g/mL from 3.7.2, B=desorption volume, and C=L of air 
          sampled.

    No desorption efficiency corrections are required.
    3.7.4  The following equation can be used to convert results in mg/
m<SUP>3</SUP> to ppm.

ppm=(mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>)(24.45)/MW
where mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>=result from 3.7.3, 24.45=molar volume of an ideal 
          gas at 760 mm Hg and 25  deg. C, MW=molecular weight (30.0).

                             4. Backup Data

    4.1  Backup data on detection limits, reliable quantitation limits, 
sensitivity and precision of the analytical method, breakthrough, 
desorption efficiency, storage, reproducibility, and generation of test 
atmospheres are available in OSHA Method 52, developed by the Organics 
Methods Evaluation Branch, OSHA Analytical Laboratory, Salt Lake City, 
Utah.
    4.2  Procedure to Coat XAD-2 Adsorbent with 2-HMP:
    4.2.1  Apparatus: Soxhlet extraction apparatus, rotary evaporation 
apparatus, vacuum dessicator, 1-L vacuum flask, 1-L round-bottomed 
evaporative flask, 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, 250-mL Buchner funnel with a 
coarse fritted disc, etc.
    4.2.2  Reagents:
    4.2.2.1  Methanol, isooctane, and toluene.
    4.2.2.2  2-(Hydroxymethyl)piperidine.
    4.2.2.3  Amberlite XAD-2 non-ionic polymeric adsorbent, 20 to 60 
mesh, Aldrich Chemical XAD-2 was used in this evaluation.
    4.2.3  Procedure: Weigh 125 g of crude XAD-2 adsorbent into a 1-L 
Erlenmeyer flask. Add about 200 mL of water to the flask and then swirl 
the mixture to wash the adsorbent. Discard any adsorbent that floats to 
the top of the water and then filter the mixture using a fritted Buchner 
funnel. Air dry the adsorbent for 2 minutes. Transfer the adsorbent back 
to the Erlenmeyer flask and then add about 200 mL of methanol to the 
flask. Swirl and then filter the mixture as before. Transfer the washed 
adsorbent back to the Erlenmeyer flask and then add about 200 mL of 
methanol to the flask. Swirl and then filter the mixture as before. 
Transfer the washed adsorbent to a 1-L round-bottomed evaporative flask, 
add 13 g of 2-HMP and then 200 mL of methanol, swirl the mixture

[[Page 375]]

and then allow it to stand for one hour. Remove the methanol at about 40 
 deg. C and reduced pressure using a rotary evaporation apparatus. 
Transfer the coated adsorbent to a suitable container and store it in a 
vacuum desiccator at room temperature overnight. Transfer the coated 
adsorbent to a Soxhlet extractor and then extract the material with 
toluene for about 24 hours. Discard the contaminated toluene, add 
methanol in its place and then continue the Soxhlet extraction for an 
additional 4 hours. Transfer the adsorbent to a weighted 1-L round-
bottom evaporative flask and remove the methanol using the rotary 
evaporation apparatus. Determine the weight of the adsorbent and then 
add an amount of 2-HMP, which is 10% by weight of the adsorbent. Add 200 
mL of methanol and then swirl the mixture. Allow the mixture to stand 
for one hour. Remove the methanol by rotary evaporation. Transfer the 
coated adsorbent to a suitable container and store it in a vacuum 
desiccator until all traces of solvents are gone. Typically, this will 
take 2-3 days. The coated adsorbent should be protected from 
contamination. XAD-2 adsorbent treated in this manner will probably not 
contain residual acrolein derivative. However, this adsorbent will often 
contain residual formaldehyde derivative levels of about 0.1 <greek-m>g 
per 150 mg of adsorbent. If the blank values for a batch of coated 
adsorbent are too high, then the batch should be returned to the Soxhlet 
extractor, extracted with toluene again and then recoated. This process 
can be repeated until the desired blank levels are attained.
    The coated adsorbent is now ready to be packed into sampling tubes. 
The sampling tubes should be stored in a sealed container to prevent 
contamination. Sampling tubes should be stored in the dark at room 
temperature. The sampling tubes should be segregated by coated adsorbent 
lot number. A sufficient amount of each lot number of coated adsorbent 
should be retained to prepare analytical standards for use with air 
samples from that lot number.
    4.3  A Procedure to Determine Formaldehyde by Acid Titration: 
Standardize the 0.1 N HCl solution using sodium carbonate and methyl 
orange indicator.
    Place 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium sulfite and three drops of 
thymophthalein indicator into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask. Titrate the 
contents of the flask to a colorless endpoint with 0.1 N HCl (usually 
one or two drops is sufficient). Transfer 10 mL of the formaldehyde/
methanol solution (prepared in 3.3.1) into the same flask and titrate 
the mixture with 0.1 N HCl, again, to a colorless endpoint. The 
formaldehyde concentration of the standard may be calculated by the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.041

    This method is based on the quantitative liberation of sodium 
hydroxide when formaldehyde reacts with sodium sulfite to form the 
formaldehyde-bisulfite addition product. The volume of sample may be 
varied depending on the formaldehyde content but the solution to be 
titrated must contain excess sodium sulfite. Formaldehyde solutions 
containing substantial amounts of acid or base must be neutralized

                            I. Health Hazards

    The occupational health hazards of formaldehyde are primarily due to 
its toxic effects after inhalation, after direct contact with the skin 
or eyes by formaldehyde in liquid or vapor form, and after ingestion.

                             II. Toxicology

                      A. Acute Effects of Exposure

    1. Inhalation (breathing): Formaldehyde is highly irritating to the 
upper airways. The concentration of formaldehyde that is immediately 
dangerous to life and health is 100 ppm. Concentrations above 50 ppm can 
cause severe pulmonary reactions within minutes. These include pulmonary 
edema, pneumonia, and bronchial irritation which can result in death. 
Concentrations above 5 ppm readily cause lower airway irritation 
characterized by cough, chest tightness and wheezing. There is some 
controversy regarding whether formaldehyde gas is a pulmonary sensitizer 
which can cause occupational asthma in a previously normal individual. 
Formaldehyde can produce symptoms of bronchial asthma in humans. The 
mechanism may be either sensitization of the individual by exposure to 
formaldehyde or direct irritation by formaldehyde in persons with pre-
existing asthma. Upper airway irritation is the most common respiratory 
effect reported by workers

[[Page 376]]

and can occur over a wide range of concentrations, most frequently above 
1 ppm. However, airway irritation has occurred in some workers with 
exposures to formaldehyde as low as 0.1 ppm. Symptoms of upper airway 
irritation include dry or sore throat, itching and burning sensations of 
the nose, and nasal congestion. Tolerance to this level of exposure may 
develop within 1-2 hours. This tolerance can permit workers remaining in 
an environment of gradually increasing formaldehyde concentrations to be 
unaware of their increasingly hazardous exposure.
    2. Eye contact: Concentrations of formaldehyde between 0.05 ppm and 
0.5 ppm produce a sensation of irritation in the eyes with burning, 
itching, redness, and tearing. Increased rate of blinking and eye 
closure generally protects the eye from damage at these low levels, but 
these protective mechanisms may interfere with some workers' work 
abilities. Tolerance can occur in workers continuously exposed to 
concentrations of formaldehyde in this range. Accidental splash injuries 
of human eyes to aqueous solutions of formaldehyde (formalin) have 
resulted in a wide range of ocular injuries including corneal opacities 
and blindness. The severity of the reactions have been directly 
dependent on the concentration of formaldehyde in solution and the 
amount of time lapsed before emergency and medical intervention.
    3. Skin contact: Exposure to formaldehyde solutions can cause 
irritation of the skin and allergic contact dermatitis. These skin 
diseases and disorders can occur at levels well below those encountered 
by many formaldehyde workers. Symptoms include erythema, edema, and 
vesiculation or hives. Exposure to liquid formalin or formaldehyde vapor 
can provoke skin reactions in sensitized individuals even when airborne 
concentrations of formaldehyde are well below 1 ppm.
    4. Ingestion: Ingestion of as little as 30 ml of a 37 percent 
solution of formaldehyde (formalin) can result in death. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity after ingestion is most severe in the stomach 
and results in symptoms which can include nausea, vomiting, and servere 
abdominal pain. Diverse damage to other organ systems including the 
liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, brain, and central nervous systems can 
occur from the acute response to ingestion of formaldehyde.

                     B. Chronic Effects of Exposure

    Long term exposure to formaldehyde has been shown to be associated 
with an increased risk of cancer of the nose and accessory sinuses, 
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal cancer, and lung cancer in humans. 
Animal experiments provide conclusive evidence of a causal relationship 
between nasal cancer in rats and formaldehyde exposure. Concordant 
evidence of carcinogenicity includes DNA binding, genotoxicity in short-
term tests, and cytotoxic changes in the cells of the target organ 
suggesting both preneoplastic changes and a dose-rate effect. 
Formaldehyde is a complete carcinogen and appears to exert an effect on 
at least two stages of the carcinogenic process.

                    III. Surveillance considerations

                               A. History

    1. Medical and occupational history: Along with its acute irritative 
effects, formaldehyde can cause allergic sensitization and cancer. One 
of the goals of the work history should be to elicit information on any 
prior or additional exposure to formaldehyde in either the occupational 
or the non-occupational setting.
    2. Respiratory history: As noted above, formaldehyde has recognized 
properties as an airway irritant and has been reported by some authors 
as a cause of occupational asthma. In addition, formaldehyde has been 
associated with cancer of the entire respiratory system of humans. For 
these reasons, it is appropriate to include a comprehensive review of 
the respiratory system in the medical history. Components of this 
history might include questions regarding dyspnea on exertion, shortness 
of breath, chronic airway complaints, hyperreactive airway disease, 
rhinitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, emphysema, respiratory 
allergic reaction, or other preexisting pulmonary disease.
    In addition, generalized airway hypersensitivity can result from 
exposures to a single sensitizing agent. The examiner should, therefore, 
elicit any prior history of exposure to pulmonary irritants, and any 
short- or long-term effects of that exposure.
    Smoking is known to decrease mucociliary clearance of materials 
deposited during respiration in the nose and upper airways. This may 
increase a worker's exposure to inhaled materials such as formaldehyde 
vapor. In addition, smoking is a potential confounding factor in the 
investigation of any chronic respiratory disease, including cancer. For 
these reasons, a complete smoking history should be obtained.
    3. Skin Disorders: Because of the dermal irritant and sensitizing 
effects of formaldehyde, a history of skin disorders should be obtained. 
Such a history might include the existence of skin irritation, 
previously documented skin sensitivity, and other dermatologic 
disorders. Previous exposure to formaldehyde and other dermal 
sensitizers should be recorded.
    4. History of atopic or allergic diseases: Since formaldehyde can 
cause allergic sensitization of the skin and airways, it might be useful 
to identify individuals with prior allergen sensitization. A history of 
atopic disease and allergies to formaldehyde or any other substances 
should also be obtained. It is not definitely known at this time whether 
atopic

[[Page 377]]

diseases and allergies to formaldehyde or any other substances should 
also be obtained. Also it is not definitely known at this time whether 
atopic individuals have a greater propensity to develop formaldehyde 
sensitivity than the general population, but identification of these 
individuals may be useful for ongoing surveillance.
    5. Use of disease questionnaires: Comparison of the results from 
previous years with present results provides the best method for 
detecting a general deterioration in health when toxic signs and 
symptoms are measured subjectively. In this way recall bias does not 
affect the results of the analysis. Consequently, OSHA has determined 
that the findings of the medical and work histories should be kept in a 
standardized form for comparison of the year-to-year results.

                         B. Physical Examination

    1. Mucosa of eyes and airways: Because of the irritant effects of 
formaldehyde, the examining physician should be alert to evidence of 
this irritation. A speculum examination of the nasal mucosa may be 
helpful in assessing possible irritation and cytotoxic changes, as may 
be indirect inspection of the posterior pharynx by mirror.
    2. Pulmonary system: A conventional respiratory examination, 
including inspection of the thorax and auscultation and percussion of 
the lung fields should be performed as part of the periodic medical 
examination. Although routine pulmonary function testing is only 
required by the standard once every year for persons who are exposed 
over the TWA concentration limit, these tests have an obvious value in 
investigating possible respiratory dysfunction and should be used 
wherever deemed appropriate by the physician. In cases of alleged 
formaldehyde-induced airway disease, other possible causes of pulmonary 
disfunction (including exposures to other substances) should be ruled 
out. A chest radiograph may be useful in these circumstances. In cases 
of suspected airway hypersensitivity or allergy, it may be appropriate 
to use bronchial challenge testing with formaldehyde or methacholine to 
determine the nature of the disorder. Such testing should be performed 
by or under the supervision of a physician experienced in the procedures 
involved.
    3. Skin: The physician should be alert to evidence of dermal 
irritation of sensitization, including reddening and inflammation, 
urticaria, blistering, scaling, formation of skin fissures, or other 
symptoms. Since the integrity of the skin barrier is compromised by 
other dermal diseases, the presence of such disease should be noted. 
Skin sensitivity testing carries with it some risk of inducing 
sensitivity, and therefore, skin testing for formaldehyde sensitivity 
should not be used as a routine screening test. Sensitivity testing may 
be indicated in the investigation of a suspected existing sensitivity. 
Guidelines for such testing have been prepared by the North American 
Contact Dermatitis Group.

                   C. Additional Examinations or Tests

    The physician may deem it necessary to perform other medical 
examinations or tests as indicated. The standard provides a mechanism 
whereby these additional investigations are covered under the standard 
for occupational exposure to formaldehyde.

                             D. Emergencies

    The examination of workers exposed in an emergency should be 
directed at the organ systems most likely to be affected. Much of the 
content of the examination will be similar to the periodic examination 
unless the patient has received a severe acute exposure requiring 
immediate attention to prevent serious consequences. If a severe 
overexposure requiring medical intervention or hospitalization has 
occurred, the physician must be alert to the possibility of delayed 
symptoms. Followup nonroutine examinations may be necessary to assure 
the patient's well-being.

                         E. Employer Obligations

    The employer is required to provide the physician with the following 
information: A copy of this standard and appendices A, C, D, and E; a 
description of the affected employee's duties as they relate to his or 
her exposure concentration; an estimate of the employee's exposure 
including duration (e.g. 15 hr/wk, three 8-hour shifts, full-time); a 
description of any personal protective equipment, including respirators, 
used by the employee; and the results of any previous medical 
determinations for the affected employee related to formaldehyde 
exposure to the extent that this information is within the employer's 
control.

                       F. Physician's Obligations

    The standard requires the employer to obtain a written statement 
from the physician. This statement must contain the physician's opinion 
as to whether the employee has any medical condition which would place 
him or her at increased risk of impaired health from exposure to 
formaldehyde or use of respirators, as appropriate. The physician must 
also state his opinion regarding any restrictions that should be placed 
on the employee's exposure to formaldehyde or upon the use of protective 
clothing or equipment such as respirators. If the employee wears a 
respirator as a result of his or her exposure to formaldehyde, the 
physician's opinion must also contain a statement regarding the 
suitability of the employee to wear the type of respirator assigned. 
Finally, the physician must inform the employer that the employee

[[Page 378]]

has been told the results of the medical examination and of any medical 
conditions which require further explanation or treatment. This written 
opinion is not to contain any information on specific findings or 
diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposure to formaldehyde.
    The purpose in requiring the examining physician to supply the 
employer with a written opinion is to provide the employer with a 
medical basis to assist the employer in placing employees initially, in 
assuring that their health is not being inpaired by formaldehyde, and to 
assess the employee's ability to use any required protective equipment.

exposure to MDA due to an emergency, means shall be developed to alert 
promptly those employees who have the potential to be directly exposed. 
Affected employees not engaged in correcting emergency conditions shall 
be evacuated immediately in the event that an emergency occurs. Means 
shall also be developed and implemented for alerting other employees who 
may be exposed as a result of the emergency.
    (e) Exposure monitoring--(1) General. (i) Determinations of employee 
exposure shall be made from breathing zone air samples that are 
representative of each employee's exposure to airborne MDA over an eight 
(8) hour period. Determination of employee exposure to the STEL shall be 
made from breathing zone air samples collected over a 15 minute sampling 
period.
    (ii) Representative employee exposure shall be determined on the 
basis of one or more samples representing full shift exposure for each 
shift for each job classification in each work area where exposure to 
MDA may occur.
    (iii) Where the employer can document that exposure levels are 
equivalent for similar operations in different work shifts, the employer 
shall only be required to determine representative employee exposure for 
that operation during one shift.
    (2) Initial monitoring. Each employer who has a workplace or work 
operation covered by this standard shall perform initial monitoring to 
determine accurately the airborne concentrations of MDA to which 
employees may be exposed.
    (3) Periodic monitoring and monitoring frequency. (i) If the 
monitoring required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section reveals employee 
exposure at or above the action level, but at or below the PELs, the 
employer shall repeat such representative monitoring for each such 
employee at least every six (6) months.
    (ii) If the monitoring required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
reveals employee exposure above the PELs, the employer shall repeat such 
monitoring for each such employee at least every three (3) months.
    (iii) The employer may alter the monitoring schedule from every 
three months to every six months for any employee for whom two 
consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart indicate that the 
employee exposure has decreased to below the TWA but above the action 
level.
    (4) Termination of monitoring. (i) If the initial monitoring 
required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section reveals employee exposure 
to be below the action level, the employer may discontinue the 
monitoring for that employee, except as otherwise required by paragraph 
(e)(5) of this section.
    (ii) If the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section reveals that employee exposures, as indicated by at least two 
consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart, are below the 
action level the employer may discontinue the monitoring for that 
employee, except as otherwise required by paragraph (e)(5) of this 
section.
    (5) Additional monitoring. The employer shall institute the exposure 
monitoring required under paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section 
when there has been a change in production process, chemicals present, 
control equipment, personnel, or work practices which may result in new 
or additional exposures to MDA, or when the employer has any reason to 
suspect a change which may result in new or additional exposures.
    (6) Accuracy of monitoring. Monitoring shall be accurate, to a 
confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus

[[Page 383]]

25 percent for airborne concentrations of MDA.
    (7) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) The employer 
shall, within 15 working days after the receipt of the results of any 
monitoring performed under this standard, notify each employee of these 
results, in writing, either individually or by posting of results in an 
appropriate location that is accessible to affected employees.
    (ii) The written notification required by paragraph (e)(7)(i) of 
this section shall contain the corrective action being taken by the 
employer to reduce the employee exposure to or below the PELs, wherever 
the PELs are exceeded.
    (8) Visual monitoring. The employer shall make routine inspections 
of employee hands, face and forearms potentially exposed to MDA. Other 
potential dermal exposures reported by the employee must be referred to 
the appropriate medical personnel for observation. If the employer 
determines that the employee has been exposed to MDA the employer shall:
    (i) Determine the source of exposure;
    (ii) Implement protective measures to correct the hazard; and
    (iii) Maintain records of the corrective actions in accordance with 
paragraph (n) of this section.

these controls are not feasible or where the provisions of paragraph 
(g)(1)(ii) or (h)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section apply.
    (ii) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work practices 
which can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure 
to or below the PELs, the employer shall use them to reduce employee 
exposure to the lowest levels achievable by these controls and shall 
supplement them by the use of respiratory protective devices which 
comply with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2) Compliance program. (i) The employer shall establish and 
implement a written program to reduce employee exposure to or below the 
PELs by means of engineering and work practice controls, as required by

or above the action level or where dermal exposure to MDA may occur, 
following an initial examination (paragraph (m)(2) of this section), 
periodic examinations (paragraph (m)(3) of this section), an emergency 
situation paragraph (m)(4) of this section, or an additional examination 
(paragraph (m)(5) of this section) in the following circumstances:

[[Page 389]]

    (1) When the employee exhibits signs and/or symptoms indicative of 
acute exposure to MDA; or
    (2) When the examining physician determines that an employee's 
abnormal liver function tests are not associated with MDA exposure but 
that the abnormalities may be exacerbated as a result of occupational 
exposure to MDA.
    (B) Temporary removal due to a final medical determination. (1) The 
employer shall remove an employee from work environments in which 
exposure to MDA is at or above the action level or where dermal exposure 
to MDA may occur, on each occasion that there is a final medical 
determination or opinion that the employee has a detected medical 
condition which places the employee at increased risk of material 
impairment to health from exposure to MDA.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, the phrase ``final medical 
determination'' shall mean the outcome of the physician review mechanism 
used pursuant to the medical surveillance provisions of this section.
    (3) Where a final medical determination results in any recommended 
special protective measures for an employee, or limitations on an 
employee's exposure to MDA, the employer shall implement and act 
consistent with the recommendation.
    (ii) Return of the employee to former job status. (A) The employer 
shall return an employee to his or her former job status:
    (1) When the employee no longer shows signs or symptoms of exposure 
to MDA, or upon the advice of the physician.
    (2) When a subsequent final medical determination results in a 
medical finding, determination, or opinion that the employee no longer 
has a detected medical condition which places the employee at increased 
risk of material impairment to health from exposure to MDA.
    (B) For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an 
employer return an employee to his or her former job status is not 
intended to expand upon or restrict any rights an employee has or would 
have had, absent temporary medical removal, to a specific job 
classification or position under the terms of a collective bargaining 
agreement.
    (iii) Removal of other employee special protective measure or 
limitations. The employer shall remove any limitations placed on an 
employee, or end any special protective measures provided to an 
employee, pursuant to a final medical determination, when a subsequent 
final medical determination indicates that the limitations or special 
protective measures are no longer necessary.
    (iv) Employer options pending a final medical determination. Where 
the physician review mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance 
provisions of this section, has not yet resulted in a final medical 
determination with respect to an employee, the employer shall act as 
follows:
    (A) Removal. The employer may remove the employee from exposure to 
MDA, provide special protective measures to the employee, or place 
limitations upon the employee, consistent with the medical findings, 
determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have 
reviewed the employee's health status.
    (B) Return. The employer may return the employee to his or her 
former job status, and end any special protective measures provided to 
the employee, consistent with the medical findings, determinations, or 
recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the 
employee's health status, with two exceptions.
    (1) If the initial removal, special protection, or limitation of the 
employee resulted from a final medical determination which differed from 
the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial 
physician; or
    (2) If the employee has been on removal status for the preceding six 
months as a result of exposure to MDA, then the employer shall await a 
final medical determination.
    (v) Medical removal protection benefits--(A) Provisions of medical 
removal protection benefits. The employer shall provide to an employee 
up to six (6) months of medical removal protection benefits on each 
occasion that an employee is removed from exposure to MDA or otherwise 
limited pursuant to this section.

[[Page 390]]

    (B) Definition of medical removal protection benefits. For the 
purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer provide 
medical removal protection benefits means that the employer shall 
maintain the earnings, seniority, and other employment rights and 
benefits of an employee as though the employee had not been removed from 
normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited.
    (C) Follow-up medical surveillance during the period of employee 
removal or limitations. During the period of time that an employee is 
removed from normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited, the employer 
may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon 
the employee's participation in follow-up medical surveillance made 
available pursuant to this section.
    (D) Workers' compensation claims. If a removed employee files a 
claim for workers' compensation payments for a MDA-related disability, 
then the employer shall continue to provide medical removal protection 
benefits pending disposition of the claim. To the extent that an award 
is made to the employee for earnings lost during the period of removal, 
the employer's medical removal protection obligation shall be reduced by 
such amount. The employer shall receive no credit for workers' 
compensation payments received by the employee for treatment-related 
expenses.
    (E) Other credits. The employer's obligation to provide medical 
removal protection benefits to a removed employee shall be reduced to 
the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost 
during the period of removal either from a publicly or employer-funded 
compensation program, or receives income from non-MDA-related employment 
with any employer made possible by virtue of the employee's removal.
    (F) Employees who do not recover within the 6 months of removal. The 
employer shall take the following measures with respect to any employee 
removed from exposure to MDA:
    (1) The employer shall make available to the employee a medical 
examination pursuant to this section to obtain a final medical 
determination with respect to the employee;
    (2) The employer shall assure that the final medical determination 
obtained indicates whether or not the employee may be returned to his or 
her former job status, and, if not, what steps should be taken to 
protect the employee's health;
    (3) Where the final medical determination has not yet been obtained, 
or, once obtained indicates that the employee may not yet be returned to 
his or her former job status, the employer shall continue to provide 
medical removal protection benefits to the employee until either the 
employee is returned to former job status, or a final medical 
determination is made that the employee is incapable of ever safely 
returning to his or her former job status; and
    (4) Where the employer acts pursuant to a final medical 
determination which permits the return of the employee to his or her 
former job status, despite what would otherwise be an abnormal liver 
function test, later questions concerning removing the employee again 
shall be decided by a final medical determination. The employer need not 
automatically remove such an employee pursuant to the MDA removal 
criteria provided by this section.
    (vi) Voluntary removal or restriction of an employee. Where an 
employer, although not required by this section to do so, removes an 
employee from exposure to MDA or otherwise places limitations on an 
employee due to the effects of MDA exposure on the employee's medical 
condition, the employer shall provide medical removal protection 
benefits to the employee equal to that required by paragraph (m)(9)(v) 
of this section.
    (n) Recordkeeping--(1) Monitoring data for exempted employers. (i) 
Where as a result of the initial monitoring the processing, use, or 
handling of products made from or containing MDA are exempted from other

      Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1050--Substance Data Sheet, for 4,4'-
                           Methylenedianiline

                       I. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: Methylenedianiline (MDA)
    B. Permissible Exposure:
    1. Airborne: Ten parts per billion parts of air (10 ppb), time-
weighted average (TWA) for an 8-hour workday and an action level of five 
parts per billion parts of air (5 ppb).
    2. Dermal: Eye contact and skin contact with MDA are not permitted.
    C. Appearance and odor: White to tan solid; amine odor

                         II. Health Hazard Data

    A. Ways in which MDA affects your health. MDA can affect your health 
if you inhale it, or if it comes in contact with your skin or eyes. MDA 
is also harmful if you happen to swallow it. Do not get MDA in eyes, on 
skin, or on clothing.
    B. Effects of overexposure. 1. Short-term (acute) overexposure: 
Overexposure to MDA may produce fever, chills, loss of appetite, 
vomiting, jaundice. Contact may irritate skin, eyes and mucous 
membranes. Sensitization may occur.
    2. Long-term (chronic) exposure. Repeated or prolonged exposure to 
MDA, even at relatively low concentrations, may cause cancer. In 
addition, damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, and spleen may occur with 
long term exposure.
    3. Reporting signs and symptoms. You should inform your employer if 
you develop any signs or symptoms which you suspect are caused by 
exposure to MDA including yellow staining of the skin.

                 III. Protective Clothing and Equipment

    A. Respirators. Respirators are required for those operations in 
which engineering controls or work-practice controls are not adequate or 
feasible to reduce exposure to the permissible limit. If respirators are 
worn, they must have a label issued by the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health under the provisions of 42 CFR part 84 
stating that the respirators have been approved for this purpose, and 
cartridges and canisters must be replaced in accordance with the 
requirements of 29 CFR 1910.134. If you experience difficulty breathing 
while wearing a respirator, you can request a positive-pressure 
respirator from your employer. You must be thoroughly trained to use the 
assigned respirator, and the training must be provided by your employer.
    MDA does not have a detectable odor except at levels well above the 
permissible exposure limits. Do not depend on odor to warn you when a 
respirator canister is exhausted. If you can smell MDA while wearing a 
respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If you experience 
difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your employer.
    B. Protective Clothing. You may be required to wear coveralls, 
aprons, gloves, face shields, or other appropriate protective clothing 
to prevent skin contact with MDA. Where protective clothing is required, 
your employer is required to provide clean garments to you, as 
necessary, to assure that the clothing protects you adequately. Replace 
or repair impervious clothing that has developed leaks.
    MDA should never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and 
shoes which are not impervious to MDA should not be allowed to become 
contaminated with MDA, and if they do, the clothing and shoes should be 
promptly removed and decontaminated. The clothing should be laundered to 
remove MDA or discarded. Once MDA penetrates shoes or other leather 
articles, they should not be worn again.
    C. Eye protection. You must wear splashproof safety goggles in areas 
where liquid MDA may contact your eyes. Contact lenses should not be 
worn in areas where eye contact with MDA can occur. In addition, you 
must wear a face shield if your face could be splashed with MDA liquid.

                 IV. Emergency and First Aid Procedures

    A. Eye and face exposure. If MDA is splashed into the eyes, wash the 
eyes for at least 15 minutes. See a doctor as soon as possible.
    B. Skin exposure. If MDA is spilled on your clothing or skin, remove 
the contaminated clothing and wash the exposed skin with large amounts 
of soap and water immediately. Wash contaminated clothing before you 
wear it again.

[[Page 394]]

    C. Breathing. If you or any other person breathes in large amounts 
of MDA, get the exposed person to fresh air at once. Apply artificial 
respiration if breathing has stopped. Call for medical assistance or a 
doctor as soon as possible. Never enter any vessel or confined space 
where the MDA concentration might be high without proper safety 
equipment and at least one other person present who will stay outside. A 
life line should be used.
    D. Swallowing. If MDA has been swallowed and the patient is 
conscious, do not induce vomiting. Call for medical assistance or a 
doctor immediately.

                         V. Medical Requirements

    If you are exposed to MDA at a concentration at or above the action 
level for more than 30 days per year, or exposed to liquid mixtures more 
than 15 days per year, your employer is required to provide a medical 
examination, including a medical history and laboratory tests, within 60 
days of the effective date of this standard and annually thereafter. 
These tests shall be provided without cost to you. In addition, if you 
are accidentally exposed to MDA (either by ingestion, inhalation, or 
skin/eye contact) under conditions known or suspected to constitute 
toxic exposure to MDA, your employer is required to make special 
examinations and tests available to you.

                      VI. Observation of Monitoring

    Your employer is required to perform measurements that are 
representative of your exposure to MDA and you or your designated 
representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are 
entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure and to 
record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking 
place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and 
equipment are required to be worn, you and your representative must also 
be provided with, and must wear, the protective clothing and equipment.

                         VII. Access to Records

    You or your representative are entitled to see the records of 
measurements of your exposure to MDA upon written request to your 
employer. Your medical examination records can be furnished to your 
physician or designated representative upon request by you to your 
employer.

          VIII. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling and Storage

    A. Material is combustible. Avoid strong acids and their anhydrides. 
Avoid strong oxidants. Consult supervisor for disposal requirements.
    B. Emergency clean-up. Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and 
fully clothe the body in the appropriate personal protective clothing 
and equipment.

or local laws.
    5. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment.

              VI. Special Storage and Handling Precautions

    A. High exposure to MDA can occur when transferring the substance 
from one container to another. Such operations should be well ventilated 
and good work practices must be established to avoid spills.
    B. Pure MDA is a solid with a low vapor pressure. Grinding or 
heating operations increase the potential for exposure.
    C. Store away from oxidizing materials.
    D. Employers shall advise employees of all areas and operations 
where exposure to MDA could occur.

                VII. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities

    A. The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanitary 
condition.
    The employer should institute a leak and spill detection program for 
operations involving MDA in order to detect sources of fugitive MDA 
emissions.
    B. Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water are to be 
provided and maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing 
agents should also be provided to assure the effective removal of MDA 
from the skin.

                         VIII. Common Operations

    Common operations in which exposure to MDA is likely to occur 
include the following: Manufacture of MDA; Manufacture of Methylene 
diisocyanate; Curing agent for epoxy resin structures; Wire coating 
operations; and filament winding.

  Appendix C to Sec. 1910.1050--Medical Surveillance Guidelines for MDA

                            I. Route of Entry

    Inhalation; skin absorption; ingestion. MDA can be inhaled, absorbed 
through the skin, or ingested.

                             II. Toxicology

    MDA is a suspect carcinogen in humans. There are several reports of 
liver disease in humans and animals resulting from acute exposure to 
MDA. A well documented case of an acute cardiomyopathy secondary to 
exposure to MDA is on record. Numerous human cases of hepatitis 
secondary to MDA are known. Upon direct contact MDA may also cause 
damage to the eyes. Dermatitis and skin sensitization have been 
observed. Almost all forms of acute environmental hepatic injury in 
humans involve the hepatic parenchyma and produce hepatocellular 
jaundice. This agent produces intrahepatic cholestasis. The clinical 
picture consists of cholestatic jaundice, preceded or accompanied by 
abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Onset in about 60% of all observed 
cases is abrupt with severe abdominal pain. In about 30% of observed 
cases, the illness presented and evolved more slowly and less 
dramatically, with only slight abdominal pain. In about 10% of the cases 
only jaundice was evident. The cholestatic nature of the jaundice is 
evident in the prominence of itching, the histologic predominance of 
bile stasis, and portal inflammatory infiltration, accompanied by only 
slight parenchymal injury in most cases, and by the moderately elevated 
transaminase values. Acute, high doses, however, have been known to 
cause hepatocellular damage resulting in elevated SGPT, SGOT, alkaline 
phosphatase and bilirubin.
    Absorption through the skin is rapid. MDA is metabolized and 
excreted over a 48-hour period. Direct contact may be irritating to the 
skin, causing dermatitis. Also MDA which is deposited on the skin is not 
thoroughly removed through washing.
    MDA may cause bladder cancer in humans. Animal data supporting this 
assumption is not available nor is conclusive human data. However, human 
data collected on workers at a helicopter manufacturing facility where 
MDA is used suggests a higher incidence of bladder cancer among exposed 
workers.

                         III. Signs and Symptoms

    Skin may become yellow from contact with MDA.
    Repeated or prolonged contact with MDA may result in recurring 
dermatitis (red-itchy, cracked skin) and eye irritation. Inhalation, 
ingestion or absorption through the skin at high concentrations may 
result in hepatitis, causing symptoms such as fever and chills, nausea 
and vomiting, dark urine, anorexia, rash, right upper quadrant pain and 
jaundice. Corneal burns may occur when MDA is splashed in the eyes.

        IV. Treatment of Acute Toxic Effects/Emergency Situation

    If MDA gets into the eyes, immediately wash eyes with large amounts 
of water. If MDA is splashed on the skin, immediately wash contaminated 
skin with mild soap or detergent. Employee should be removed from 
exposure and given proper medical treatment. Medical tests required 
under the emergency section of the medical surveillance section (M)(4) 
must be conducted.

    If the chemical is swallowed do not induce vomiting but remove by 
gastric lavage.

 Appendix D to Sec. 1910.1050--Sampling and Analytical Methods for MDA 
                  Monitoring and Measurement Procedures

    Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure 
to MDA are best taken so that the representative average 8-hour exposure 
may be determined from a single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour samples. 
Short-time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used to 
determine average exposure level if a minimum of five measurements are 
taken in a random manner over the 8-hour work shift. Random sampling 
means that any portion of the work shift has the same chance of being 
sampled as any other. The arithmetic average of all such random samples 
taken on one work shift is an estimate of an employee's average level of 
exposure for that work shift. Air samples should be taken in the 
employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that 
inhaled by the employee).
    There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee 
exposures to MDA. The method OSHA currently uses is included below.
    The employer, however, has the obligation of selecting any 
monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of 
the standard under his unique field conditions. The standard requires 
that the method of monitoring must have an accuracy, to a 95 percent 
confidence level, of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for the 
select PEL.

                            OSHA Methodology

                           Sampling Procedure

                                Apparatus

    Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that can be 
calibrated within <plus-minus>5% of the recommended flow rate with the 
sampling filter in line.
    Samples are collected on 37 mm Gelman type A/E glass fiber filters 
treated with sulfuric acid. The filters are prepared by soaking each 
filter with 0.5 mL of 0.26N H<INF>2</INF> SO<INF>4</INF>. (0.26 N 
H<INF>2</INF> SO<INF>4</INF> can be prepared by diluting 1.5 mL of 36N 
H<INF>2</INF> SO<INF>4</INF> to 200 mL with deionized water.) The 
filters are dried in an oven at 100 degrees C for one hour and then 
assembled into two-piece 37 mm polystyrene cassettes with backup pads. 
The cassettes are sealed with shrink bands and the ends are plugged with 
plastic plugs.
    After sampling, the filters are carefully removed from the cassettes 
and individually transferred to small vials containing approximately 2 
mL deionized water. The vials must be tightly sealed. The water can be 
added before or after the filters are transferred. The vials must be 
sealable and capable of holding at least 7 mL of liquid. Small glass 
scintillation vials with caps containing Teflon liners are recommended.

                                Reagents

    Deionized water is needed for addition to the vials.

                           Sampling Technique

    Immediately before sampling, remove the plastic plugs from the 
filter cassettes.
    Attach the cassette to the sampling pump with flexible tubing and 
place the cassette in the employee's breathing zone.
    After sampling, seal the cassettes with plastic plugs until the 
filters are transferred to the vials containing deionized water.
    At some convenient time within 10 hours of sampling, transfer the 
sample filters to vials.
    Seal the small vials lengthwise.
    Submit at least one blank filter with each sample set. Blanks should 
be handled in the same manner as samples, but no air is drawn through 
them.
    Record sample volumes (in L of air) for each sample, along with any 
potential interferences.

                          Retention Efficiency

    A retention efficiency study was performed by drawing 100 L of air 
(80% relative humidity) at 1 L/min through sample filters that had been 
spiked with 0.814 <greek-m>g MDA. Instead of using backup pads, blank 
acid-treated filters were used as backups in each cassette. Upon 
analysis, the top filters were found to have an average of 91.8% of the 
spiked amount. There was no MDA found on the bottom filters, so the 
amount lost was probably due to the slight instability of the MDA salt.

                          Extraction Efficiency

    The average extraction efficiency for six filters spiked at the 
target concentration is 99.6%.
    The stability of extracted and derivatized samples was verified by 
reanalyzing the above six samples the next day using fresh standards. 
The average extraction efficiency for the reanalyzed samples is 98.7%.

                Recommended Air Volume and Sampling Rate

    The recommended air volume is 100 L.
    The recommended sampling rate is 1 L/min.

                        Interferences (Sampling)

    MDI appears to be a positive interference. It was found that when 
MDI was spiked onto

[[Page 397]]

an acid-treated filter, the MDI converted to MDA after air was drawn 
through it.
    Suspected interferences should be reported to the laboratory with 
submitted samples.

                      Safety Precautions (Sampling)

    Attach the sampling equipment to the employees so that it will not 
interfere with work performance or safety.
    Follow all safety procedures that apply to the work area being 
sampled.

                          Analytical Procedure

    Apparatus: The following are required for analysis.
    A GC equipped with an electron capture detector. For this evaluation 
a Tracor 222 Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Nickel 63 High 
Temperature Electron Capture Detector and a Linearizer was used.
    A GC column capable of separating the MDA derivative from the 
solvent and interferences. A 6 ft X 2 mm ID glass column packed with 3% 
OV-101 coated on 100/120 Gas Chrom Q was used in this evaluation.
    A electronic integrator or some other suitable means of measuring 
peak areas or heights.
    Small resealable vials with Teflon-lined caps capable of holding 4 
mL.
    A dispenser or pipet for toluene capable of delivering 2.0 mL.
    Pipets (or repipets with plastic or Teflon tips) capable of 
delivering 1 mL for the sodium hydroxide and buffer solutions.
    A repipet capable of delivering 25 <greek-m>L HFAA.
    Syringes for preparation of standards and injection of standards and 
samples into a GC.
    Volumetric flasks and pipets to dilute the pure MDA in preparation 
of standards.
    Disposable pipets to transfer the toluene layers after the samples 
are extracted.

                                Reagents

    0.5 NaOH prepared from reagent grade NaOH.
    Toluene, pesticide grade. Burdick and Jackson distilled in glass 
toluene was used.
    Heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride (HFAA). HFAA from Pierce Chemical 
Company was used.
    pH 7.0 phosphate buffer, prepared from 136 g potassium dihydrogen 
phosphate and 1 L deionized water. The pH is adjusted to 7.0 with 
saturated sodium hydroxide solution.
    4,4' -Methylenedianiline (MDA), reagent grade.

                          Standard Preparation

    Concentrated stock standards are prepared by diluting pure MDA with 
toluene. Analytical standards are prepared by injecting uL amounts of 
diluted stock standards into vials that contain 2.0 mL toluene.
    25 uL HFAA are added to each vial and the vials are capped and 
shaken for 10 seconds.
    After 10 min, 1 mL of buffer is added to each vial.
    The vials are recapped and shaken for 10 seconds.
    After allowing the layers to separate, aliquots of the toluene 
(upper) layers are removed with a syringe and analyzed by GC.
    Analytical standard concentrations should bracket sample 
concentrations. Thus, if samples fall out of the range of prepared 
standards, additional standards must be prepared to ascertain detector 
response.

                           Sample Preparation

    The sample filters are received in vials containing deionized water.
    1 mL of 0.5N NaOH and 2.0 mL toluene are added to each vial.
    The vials are recapped and shaken for 10 min.
    After allowing the layers to separate, approximately 1 mL aliquots 
of the toluene (upper) layers are transferred to separate vials with 
clean disposable pipets.
    The toluene layers are treated and analyzed.

                                Analysis

                              GC conditions

Zone temperatures:
    Column--220 degrees C
    Injector--235 degrees C
    Detector--335 degrees C
Gas flows, Ar/CH<INF>4</INF> Column--28 mL/min
    (95/5)        Purge--40 mL/min
Injection volume: 5.0 uL
Column: 6 ft X 1/8 in ID glass, 3% OV-101 on 100/120 Gas Chrom Q
Retention time of MDA derivative: 3.5 min

                              Chromatogram

    Peak areas or heights are measured by an integrator or other 
suitable means.
    A calibration curve is constructed by plotting response (peak areas 
or heights) of standard injections versus ug of MDA per sample. Sample 
concentrations must be bracketed by standards.

                       Interferences (Analytical)

    Any compound that gives an electron capture detector response and 
has the same general retention time as the HFAA derivative of MDA is a 
potential interference. Suspected interferences reported to the 
laboratory with submitted samples by the industrial hygienist must be 
considered before samples are derivatized.
    GC parameters may be changed to possibly circumvent interferences.
    Retention time on a single column is not considered proof of 
chemical identity.

[[Page 398]]

Analyte identity should be confirmed by GC/MS if possible.

                              Calculations

    The analyte concentration for samples is obtained from the 
calibration curve in terms of ug MDA per sample. The extraction 
efficiency is 100%. If any MDA is found on the blank, that amount is 
subtracted from the sample amounts. The air concentrations are 
calculated using the following formulae.
<greek-m>g/m\3\=(<greek-m>g MDA per sample) (1000)/(L of air sampled)
ppb=(<greek-m>g/m\3\) (24.46)/(198.3)=(<greek-m>g/m\3\) (0.1233) where 
          24.46 is the molar volume at 25 degrees C and 760 mm Hg

                     Safety Precautions (Analytical)

    Avoid skin contact and inhalation of all chemicals.
    Restrict the use of all chemicals to a fume hood if possible.
    Wear safety glasses and a lab coat at all times while in the lab 
area.

relied upon that demonstrate the work operation or the product or the 
group of products or operations to which it belongs may not reasonably 
be foreseen to release BD in airborne concentrations at or above the 
action level or in excess of the STEL under the expected conditions of 
processing, use, or handling that will cause the greatest possible 
release or in any plausible accident.
    (ii) This section also does not apply to work operations, products 
or streams where the only exposure to BD is from liquid mixtures 
containing 0.1% or less of BD by volume or the vapors released from such 
liquids, unless objective data become available that show that airborne 
concentrations generated by such mixtures can exceed the action level or 
STEL under reasonably predictable conditions of processing, use or 
handling that will cause the greatest possible release.
    (iii) Except for labeling requirements and requirements for 
emergency response, this section does not apply to the storage, 
transportation, distribution or sale of BD or liquid mixtures in intact 
containers or in transportation pipelines sealed in such a manner as to 
fully contain BD vapors or liquid.
    (3) Where products or processes containing BD are exempted under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the employer shall maintain records of 
the objective data supporting that exemption and the basis for the 
employer's reliance on the data, as provided in paragraph (m)(1) of this

registration, or certification) allows him or her to independently 
provide or be delegated the responsibility to provide one or more of the 
specific health care services required by paragraph (k) of this section.
    Regulated area means any area where airborne concentrations of BD 
exceed or can reasonably be expected to exceed the 8-hour time weighted 
average (8-hr TWA) exposure of 1 ppm or the short-term exposure limit 
(STEL) of 5 ppm for 15 minutes.
    This section means this 1,3-butadiene standard.
    (c) Permissible exposure limits (PELs)--(1) Time-weighted average 
(TWA) limit. The employer shall ensure that no employee is exposed to an 
airborne concentration of BD in excess of one (1) part BD per million 
parts of air (ppm) measured as an eight (8)-hour time-weighted average.
    (2) Short-term exposure limit (STEL). The employer shall ensure that

each shift and for each job classification in each work area.
    (iii) Representative 15-minute short-term employee exposures shall 
be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing 15-minute 
exposures associated with operations that are most likely to produce 
exposures above the STEL for each shift and for each job classification 
in each work area.
    (iv) Except for the initial monitoring required under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, where the employer can document that exposure 
levels are equivalent for similar operations on different work shifts, 
the employer need only determine representative employee exposure for 
that operation from the shift during which the highest exposure is 
expected.
    (2) Initial monitoring. (i) Each employer who has a workplace or 
work operation covered by this section, shall perform initial monitoring 
to determine accurately the airborne concentrations of BD to which 
employees may be exposed, or shall rely on objective data pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section to fulfill this requirement.
    (ii) Where the employer has monitored within two years prior to the 
effective date of this section and the monitoring satisfies all other 
requirements of this section, the employer may rely on such earlier 
monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of 
this section, provided that the conditions under which the initial 
monitoring was conducted have not changed in a manner that may result in 
new or additional exposures.

[[Page 400]]

    (3) Periodic monitoring and its frequency. (i) If the initial 
monitoring required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section reveals employee 
exposure to be at or above the action level but at or below both the 8-
hour TWA limit and the STEL, the employer shall repeat the 
representative monitoring required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
every twelve months.
    (ii) If the initial monitoring required by paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section reveals employee exposure to be above the 8-hour TWA limit, the 
employer shall repeat the representative monitoring required by 
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section at least every three months until 
the employer has collected two samples per quarter (each at least 7 days 
apart) within a two-year period, after which such monitoring must occur 
at least every six months.
    (iii) If the initial monitoring required by paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section reveals employee exposure to be above the STEL, the employer 
shall repeat the representative monitoring required by paragraph 
(d)(1)(iii) of this section at least every three months until the 
employer has collected two samples per quarter (each at least 7 days 
apart) within a two-year period, after which such monitoring must occur 
at least every six months.
    (iv) The employer may alter the monitoring schedule from every six 
months to annually for any required representative monitoring for which 
two consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart indicate that 
employee exposure has decreased to or below the 8-hour TWA, but is at or 
above the action level.
    (4) Termination of monitoring. (i) If the initial monitoring 
required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section reveals employee exposure 
to be below the action level and at or below the STEL, the employer may 
discontinue the monitoring for employees whose exposures are represented 
by the initial monitoring.
    (ii) If the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section reveals that employee exposures, as indicated by at least two 
consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart, are below the 
action level and at or below the STEL, the employer may discontinue the 
monitoring for those employees who are represented by such monitoring.
    (5) Additional monitoring. (i) The employer shall institute the 
exposure monitoring required under paragraph (d) of this section 
whenever there has been a change in the production, process, control 
equipment, personnel or work practices that may result in new or 
additional exposures to BD or when the employer has any reason to 
suspect that a change may result in new or additional exposures.
    (ii) Whenever spills, leaks, ruptures or other breakdowns occur that 
may lead to employee exposure above the 8-hr TWA limit or above the 
STEL, the employer shall monitor [using leak source, such as direct 
reading instruments, area or personal monitoring], after the cleanup of 
the spill or repair of the leak, rupture or other breakdown, to ensure 
that exposures have returned to the level that existed prior to the 
incident.
    (6) Accuracy of monitoring. Monitoring shall be accurate, at a 
confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for 
airborne concentrations of BD at or above the 1 ppm TWA limit and to 
within plus or minus 35 percent for airborne concentrations of BD at or 
above the action level of 0.5 ppm and below the 1 ppm TWA limit.
    (7) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) The employer 
shall, within 5 business days after the receipt of the results of any 
monitoring performed under this section, notify the affected employees 
of these results in writing either individually or by posting of results 
in an appropriate location that is accessible to affected employees.
    (ii) The employer shall, within 15 business days after receipt of 
any monitoring performed under this section indicating the 8-hour TWA or 
STEL has been exceeded, provide the affected employees, in writing, with 
information on the corrective action being taken by the employer to 
reduce employee exposure to or below the 8-hour TWA or STEL and the 
schedule for completion of this action.
    (8) Observation of monitoring--(i) Employee observation. The 
employer shall provide affected employees or their

[[Page 401]]

designated representatives an opportunity to observe any monitoring of 
employee exposure to BD conducted in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (ii) Observation procedures. When observation of the monitoring of 
employee exposure to BD requires entry into an area where the use of 
protective clothing or equipment is required, the employer shall provide 
the observer at no cost with protective clothing and equipment, and 
shall ensure that the observer uses this equipment and complies with all 
other applicable safety and health procedures.
    (e) Regulated areas. (1) The employer shall establish a regulated 
area wherever occupational exposures to airborne concentrations of BD 
exceed or can reasonably be expected to exceed the permissible exposure 
limits, either the 8-hr TWA or the STEL.
    (2) Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons.
    (3) Regulated areas shall be demarcated from the rest of the 
workplace in any manner that minimizes the number of employees exposed 
to BD within the regulated area.
    (4) An employer at a multi-employer worksite who establishes a 
regulated area shall communicate the access restrictions and locations 
of these areas to other employers with work operations at that worksite 
whose employees may have access to these areas.
    (f) Methods of compliance--(1) Engineering controls and work 
practices. (i) The employer shall institute engineering controls and 
work practices to reduce and maintain employee exposure to or below the 
PELs, except to the extent that the employer can establish that these 
controls are not feasible or where paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section 
applies.
    (ii) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work practices 
which can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure 
to or below the 8-hour TWA or STEL, the employer shall use them to 
reduce employee exposure to the lowest levels achievable by these 
controls and shall supplement them by the use of respiratory protection 
that complies with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2) Compliance plan. (i) Where any exposures are over the PELs, the 
employer shall establish and implement a written plan to reduce employee 
exposure to or below the PELs primarily by means of engineering and work 
practice controls, as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and 
by the use of respiratory protection where required or permitted under 
this section. No compliance plan is required if all exposures are under 
the PELs.
    (ii) The written compliance plan shall include a schedule for the 
development and implementation of the engineering controls and work 
practice controls including periodic leak detection surveys.
    (iii) Copies of the compliance plan required in paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section shall be furnished upon request for examination and copying 
to the Assistant Secretary, the Director, affected employees and 
designated employee representatives. Such plans shall be reviewed at 
least every 12 months, and shall be updated as necessary to reflect 
significant changes in the status of the employer's compliance program.
    (iv) The employer shall not implement a schedule of employee 
rotation as a means of compliance with the PELs.
    (g) Exposure Goal Program. (1) For those operations and job 
classifications where employee exposures are greater than the action 
level, in addition to compliance with the PELs, the employer shall have 
an exposure goal program that is intended to limit employee exposures to 
below the action level during normal operations.
    (2) Written plans for the exposure goal program shall be furnished 
upon request for examination and copying to the Assistant Secretary, the 
Director, affected employees and designated employee representatives.
    (3) Such plans shall be updated as necessary to reflect significant 
changes in the status of the exposure goal program.
    (4) Respirator use is not required in the exposure goal program.
    (5) The exposure goal program shall include the following items 
unless the employer can demonstrate that the item is not feasible, will 
have no significant effect in reducing employee

[[Page 402]]

exposures, or is not necessary to achieve exposures below the action 
level:
    (i) A leak prevention, detection, and repair program.
    (ii) A program for maintaining the effectiveness of local exhaust 
ventilation systems.
    (iii) The use of pump exposure control technology such as, but not 
limited to, mechanical double-sealed or seal-less pumps.
    (iv) Gauging devices designed to limit employee exposure, such as 
magnetic gauges on rail cars.
    (v) Unloading devices designed to limit employee exposure, such as a 
vapor return system.
    (vi) A program to maintain BD concentration below the action level 
in control rooms by use of engineering controls.
    (h) Respiratory protection--(1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering 
and work-practice controls.
    (ii) Non-routine work operations that are performed infrequently and 
for which employee exposures are limited in duration.
    (iii) Work operations for which feasible engineering and work-
practice controls are not yet sufficient to reduce employee exposures to 
or below the PELs.
    (iv) Emergencies.
    (2) Respirator program. (i) The employer must implement a 
respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b) 
through (d) (except (d)(1)(iii), (d)(3)(iii)(B)(1), and (2)), and (f) 
through (m).
    (ii) If air-purifying respirators are used, the employer must 
replace the air-purifying filter elements according to the replacement 
schedule set for the class of respirators listed in Table 1 of this 
section, and at the beginning of each work shift.
    (iii) Instead of using the replacement schedule listed in Table 1 of 
this section, the employer may replace cartridges or canisters at 90% of 
their expiration service life, provided the employer:
    (A) Demonstrates that employees will be adequately protected by this 
procedure.
    (B) Uses BD breakthrough data for this purpose that have been 
derived from tests conducted under worst-case conditions of humidity, 
temperature, and air-flow rate through the filter element, and the 
employer also describes the data supporting the cartridge-or canister-
change schedule, as well as the basis for using the data in the 
employer's respirator program.
    (iv) A label must be attached to each filter element to indicate the 
date and time it is first installed on the respirator.
    (v) If NIOSH approves an end-of-service-life indicator (ESLI) for an 
air-purifying filter element, the element may be used until the ESLI 
shows no further useful service life or until the element is replaced at 
the beginning of the next work shift, whichever occurs first.
    (vi) Regardless of the air-purifying element used, if an employee 
detects the odor of BD, the employer must replace the air-purifying 
element immediately.
    (3) Respirator selection. (i) The employer must select appropriate 
respirators from Table 1 of this section.

this rule, if twelve months or more have elapsed since the last physical 
examination conducted as part of a medical screening program for BD 
exposure;
    (B) Before assumption of duties by the employee in a job with BD 
exposure;
    (C) Every 3 years after the initial physical examination;
    (D) At the discretion of the physician or other licensed health care 
professional reviewing the annual health questionnaire and CBC;
    (E) At the time of employee reassignment to an area where exposure 
to BD is below the action level, if the employee's past exposure history 
does not meet the criteria of paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section for 
continued coverage in the screening and surveillance program, and if 
twelve months or more have elapsed since the last physical examination; 
and
    (F) At termination of employment if twelve months or more have 
elapsed since the last physical examination.
    (ii) Following an emergency situation, medical screening shall be 
conducted as quickly as possible, but not later than 48 hours after the

    (4) Content of medical screening. (i) Medical screening for 
employees covered by paragraphs (j)(1) (i)-(ii) of this section shall 
include:
    (A) A baseline health questionnaire that includes a comprehensive 
occupational and health history and is updated annually. Particular 
emphasis shall be placed on the hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial 
systems, including exposure to chemicals, in addition to BD, that may 
have an adverse effect on these systems, the presence of signs and 
symptoms that might be related to disorders of these systems, and any 
other information determined by the examining physician or other 
licensed health care professional to be necessary to evaluate whether 
the employee is at increased risk of material impairment of health from 
BD exposure. Health questionnaires shall consist of the sample forms in 
Appendix C to this section, or be equivalent to those samples;
    (B) A complete physical examination, with special emphasis on the 
liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and skin;
    (C) A CBC; and
    (D) Any other test which the examining physician or other licensed 
health care professional deems necessary to evaluate whether the 
employee may be at increased risk from exposure to BD.
    (ii) Medical screening for employees exposed to BD in an emergency 
situation shall focus on the acute effects of BD exposure and at a 
minimum include: A CBC within 48 hours of the exposure and then monthly 
for three months; and a physical examination if the employee reports 
irritation of the eyes, nose throat, lungs, or skin, blurred vision, 
coughing, drowsiness, nausea, or headache. Continued employee 
participation in the medical screening and surveillance program, beyond 
these minimum requirements, shall be at the discretion of the physician 
or other licensed health care professional.
    (5) Additional medical evaluations and referrals. (i) Where the 
results of medical screening indicate abnormalities of the hematopoietic 
or reticuloendothelial systems, for which a non-occupational cause is 
not readily apparent, the examining physician or other licensed health 
care professional shall refer the employee to an appropriate specialist 
for further evaluation and shall make available to the specialist the 
results of the medical screening.

and
    (D) A statement that the employee has been informed of the results 
of the medical evaluation and any medical conditions resulting from BD 
exposure that require further explanation or treatment.
    (ii) The written medical opinion provided to the employer shall not 
reveal specific records, findings, and diagnoses that have no bearing on 
the employee's ability to work with BD.
    Note: However, this provision does not negate the ethical obligation 
of the physician or other licensed health care professional to transmit 
any other adverse findings directly to the employee.
    (8) Medical surveillance. (i) The employer shall ensure that

   Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1051--Substance Safety Data Sheet For 1,3-
                        Butadiene (Non-Mandatory)

                       I. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: 1,3-Butadiene (CH<INF>2</INF>= CH-CH= CH<INF>2</INF>).
    B. Synonyms: 1,3-Butadiene (BD); butadiene; biethylene; bi-vinyl; 
divinyl; butadiene-1,3; buta-1,3-diene; erythrene; NCI-C50602; CAS-106-
99-0.
    C. BD can be found as a gas or liquid.
    D. BD is used in production of styrene-butadiene rubber and 
polybutadiene rubber for the tire industry. Other uses include copolymer 
latexes for carpet backing and paper coating, as well as resins and 
polymers for pipes and automobile and appliance parts. It is also used 
as an intermediate in the production of such chemicals as fungicides.
    E. Appearance and odor: BD is a colorless, non-corrosive, flammable 
gas with a mild aromatic odor at standard ambient temperature and 
pressure.
    F. Permissible exposure: Exposure may not exceed 1 part BD per 
million parts of air averaged over the 8-hour workday, nor may short-
term exposure exceed 5 parts of BD per million parts of air averaged 
over any 15-minute period in the 8-hour workday.

                         II. Health Hazard Data

    A. BD can affect the body if the gas is inhaled or if the liquid 
form, which is very cold (cryogenic), comes in contact with the eyes or 
skin.
    B. Effects of overexposure: Breathing very high levels of BD for a 
short time can cause

[[Page 408]]

central nervous system effects, blurred vision, nausea, fatigue, 
headache, decreased blood pressure and pulse rate, and unconsciousness. 
There are no recorded cases of accidental exposures at high levels that 
have caused death in humans, but this could occur. Breathing lower 
levels of BD may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Skin 
contact with liquefied BD can cause irritation and frostbite.
    C. Long-term (chronic) exposure: BD has been found to be a potent 
carcinogen in rodents, inducing neoplastic lesions at multiple target 
sites in mice and rats. A recent study of BD-exposed workers showed that 
exposed workers have an increased risk of developing leukemia. The risk 
of leukemia increases with increased exposure to BD. OSHA has concluded 
that there is strong evidence that workplace exposure to BD poses an 
increased risk of death from cancers of the lymphohematopoietic system.
    D. Reporting signs and symptoms: You should inform your supervisor 
if you develop any of these signs or symptoms and suspect that they are 
caused by exposure to BD.

                   III. Emergency First Aid Procedures

    In the event of an emergency, follow the emergency plan and 
procedures designated for your work area. If you have been trained in 
first aid procedures, provide the necessary first aid measures. If 
necessary, call for additional assistance from co-workers and emergency 
medical personnel.
    A. Eye and Skin Exposures: If there is a potential that liquefied BD 
can come in contact with eye or skin, face shields and skin protective 
equipment must be provided and used. If liquefied BD comes in contact 
with the eye, immediately flush the eyes with large amounts of water, 
occasionally lifting the lower and the upper lids. Flush repeatedly. Get 
medical attention immediately. Contact lenses should not be worn when 
working with this chemical. In the event of skin contact, which can 
cause frostbite, remove any contaminated clothing and flush the affected 
area repeatedly with large amounts of tepid water.
    B. Breathing: If a person breathes in large amounts of BD, move the 
exposed person to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, begin 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if you have been trained in this 
procedure. Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Get medical 
attention immediately.
    C. Rescue: Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure. If 
the exposed person has been overcome, call for help and begin emergency 
rescue procedures. Use extreme caution so that you do not become a 
casualty. Understand the plant's emergency rescue procedures and know 
the locations of rescue equipment before the need arises.

                 IV. Respirators and Protective Clothing

    A. Respirators: Good industrial hygiene practices recommend that 
engineering and work practice controls be used to reduce environmental 
concentrations to the permissible exposure level. However, there are 
some exceptions where respirators may be used to control exposure. 
Respirators may be used when engineering and work practice controls are 
not technically feasible, when such controls are in the process of being 
installed, or when these controls fail and need to be supplemented or 
during brief, non-routine, intermittent exposure. Respirators may also 
be used in situations involving non-routine work operations which are 
performed infrequently and in which exposures are limited in duration, 
and in emergency situations. In some instances cartridge respirator use 
is allowed, but only with strict time constraints. For example, at 
exposure below 5 ppm BD, a cartridge (or canister) respirator, either 
full or half face, may be used, but the cartridge must be replaced at 
least every 4 hours, and it must be replaced every 3 hours when the 
exposure is between 5 and 10 ppm. If the use of respirators is 
necessary, the only respirators permitted are those that have been 
approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH). In addition to respirator selection, a complete respiratory 
protection program must be instituted which includes regular training, 
maintenance, fit testing, inspection, cleaning, and evaluation of 
respirators. If you can smell BD while wearing a respirator, proceed 
immediately to fresh air, and change cartridge (or canister) before re-
entering an area where there is BD exposure. If you experience 
difficulty in breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your 
supervisor.
    B. Protective Clothing: Employees should be provided with and 
required to use impervious clothing, gloves, face shields (eight-inch 
minimum), and other appropriate protective clothing necessary to prevent 
the skin from becoming frozen by contact with liquefied BD (or a vessel 
containing liquid BD).
    Employees should be provided with and required to use splash-proof 
safety goggles where liquefied BD may contact the eyes.

           V. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling, and Storage

    A. Fire and Explosion Hazards: BD is a flammable gas and can easily 
form explosive mixtures in air. It has a lower explosive limit of 2%, 
and an upper explosive limit of 11.5%. It has an autoignition 
temperature of 420  deg.C (788  deg.F). Its vapor is heavier than air 
(vapor density, 1.9) and may travel a considerable distance to a source 
of ignition and flash back. Usually it contains inhibitors to prevent 
self-polymerization (which is accompanied by evolution of heat) and to 
prevent

[[Page 409]]

formation of explosive peroxides. At elevated temperatures, such as in 
fire conditions, polymerization may take place. If the polymerization 
takes place in a container, there is a possibility of violent rupture of 
the container.
    B. Hazard: Slightly toxic. Slight respiratory irritant. Direct 
contact of liquefied BD on skin may cause freeze burns and frostbite.
    C. Storage: Protect against physical damage to BD containers. 
Outside or detached storage of BD containers is preferred. Inside 
storage should be in a cool, dry, well-ventilated, noncombustible 
location, away from all possible sources of ignition. Store cylinders 
vertically and do not stack. Do not store with oxidizing material.
    D. Usual Shipping Containers: Liquefied BD is contained in steel 
pressure apparatus.
    E. Electrical Equipment: Electrical installations in Class I 
hazardous locations, as defined in Article 500 of the National 
Electrical Code, should be in accordance with Article 501 of the Code. 
If explosion-proof electrical equipment is necessary, it shall be 
suitable for use in Group B. Group D equipment may be used if such 
equipment is isolated in accordance with Section 501-5(a) by sealing all 
conduit \1/2\- inch size or larger. See Venting of Deflagrations (NFPA 
No. 68, 1994), National Electrical Code (NFPA No. 70, 1996 ), Static 
Electricity (NFPA No. 77, 1993), Lightning Protection Systems (NFPA No. 
780, 1995), and Fire Hazard Properties of Flammable Liquids, Gases and 
Volatile Solids (NFPA No. 325, 1994).
    F. Fire Fighting: Stop flow of gas. Use water to keep fire-exposed 
containers cool. Fire extinguishers and quick drenching facilities must 
be readily available, and you should know where they are and how to 
operate them.
    G. Spill and Leak: Persons not wearing protective equipment and 
clothing should be restricted from areas of spills or leaks until clean-
up has been completed. If BD is spilled or leaked, the following steps 
should be taken:
    1. Eliminate all ignition sources.
    2. Ventilate area of spill or leak.
    3. If in liquid form, for small quantities, allow to evaporate in a 
safe manner.
    4. Stop or control the leak if this can be done without risk. If 
source of leak is a cylinder and the leak cannot be stopped in place, 
remove the leaking cylinder to a safe place and repair the leak or allow 
the cylinder to empty.
    H. Disposal: This substance, when discarded or disposed of, is a 
hazardous waste according to Federal regulations (40 CFR part 261). It 
is listed as hazardous waste number D001 due to its ignitability. The 
transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of this waste material 
must be conducted in compliance with 40 CFR parts 262, 263, 264, 268 and 
270. Disposal can occur only in properly permitted facilities. Check 
state and local regulation of any additional requirements as these may 
be more restrictive than federal laws and regulation.
    I. You should not keep food, beverages, or smoking materials in 
areas where there is BD exposure, nor should you eat or drink in such 
areas.
    J. Ask your supervisor where BD is used in your work area and ask 
for any additional plant safety and health rules.

                        VI. Medical Requirements

    Your employer is required to offer you the opportunity to 
participate in a medical screening and surveillance program if you are 
exposed to BD at concentrations exceeding the action level (0.5 ppm BD 
as an 8-hour TWA) on 30 days or more a year, or at or above the 8 hr TWA 
(1 ppm) or STEL (5 ppm for 15 minutes) on 10 days or more a year. 
Exposure for any part of a day counts. If you have had exposure to BD in 
the past, but have been transferred to another job, you may still be 
eligible to participate in the medical screening and surveillance 
program. The OSHA rule specifies the past exposures that would qualify 
you for participation in the program. These past exposure are work 
histories that suggest the following: (1) That you have been exposed at 
or above the PELs on 30 days a year for 10 or more years; (2) that you 
have been exposed at or above the action level on 60 days a year for 10 
or more years; or (3) that you have been exposed above 10 ppm on 30 days 
in any past year. Additionally, if you are exposed to BD in an emergency 
situation, you are eligible for a medical examination within 48 hours. 
The basic medical screening program includes a health questionnaire, 
physical examination, and blood test. These medical evaluations must be 
offered to you at a reasonable time and place, and without cost or loss 
of pay.

                     VII. Observation of Monitoring

    Your employer is required to perform measurements that are 
representative of your exposure to BD and you or your designated 
representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are 
entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to 
record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking 
place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and 
equipment are required to be worn, you or your representative must also 
be provided with, and must wear, the protective clothing and equipment.

                       VIII. Access to Information

    A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the 
information contained in this appendix. In addition, your employer

[[Page 410]]

must instruct you in the proper work practices for using BD, emergency 
procedures, and the correct use of protective equipment.
    B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being 
exposed to BD. You or your representative has the right to observe 
employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer 
is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer determines 
that you are being overexposed, he or she is required to inform you of 
the actions which are being taken to reduce your exposure to within 
permissible exposure limits and of the schedule to implement these 
actions.
    C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and 
medical examinations. These records must be kept by the employer for at 
least thirty (30) years.
    D. Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical 
records to you or your representative upon your request.

  Appendix B to Sec. 1910.1051--Substance Technical Guidelines for 1,3-
                        Butadiene (Non-Mandatory)

                      I. Physical and Chemical Data

    A. Substance identification:
    1. Synonyms: 1,3-Butadiene (BD); butadiene; biethylene; bivinyl; 
divinyl; butadiene-1,3; buta-1,3-diene; erythrene; NCI-C50620; CAS-106-
99-0.
    2. Formula: CH<INF>2</INF>= CH-CH= CH<INF>2</INF>.
    3. Molecular weight: 54.1.
    B. Physical data:
    1. Boiling point (760 mm Hg): -4.7  deg.C (23.5  deg.F).
    2. Specific gravity (water=1): 0.62 at 20  deg.C (68  deg.F).
    3. Vapor density (air=1 at boiling point of BD): 1.87.
    4. Vapor pressure at 20  deg.C (68  deg.F): 910 mm Hg.
    5. Solubility in water, g/100 g water at 20  deg.C (68  deg.F): 
0.05.
    6. Appearance and odor: Colorless, flammable gas with a mildly 
aromatic odor. Liquefied BD is a colorless liquid with a mildly aromatic 
odor.

             II. Fire, Explosion, and Reactivity Hazard Data

    A. Fire:
    1. Flash point: -76  deg.C (-105  deg.F) for take out; liquefied BD; 
Not applicable to BD gas.
    2. Stability: A stabilizer is added to the monomer to inhibit 
formation of polymer during storage. Forms explosive peroxides in air in 
absence of inhibitor.
    3. Flammable limits in air, percent by volume: Lower: 2.0; Upper: 
11.5.
    4. Extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide for small fires, polymer or 
alcohol foams for large fires.
    5. Special fire fighting procedures: Fight fire from protected 
location or maximum possible distance. Stop flow of gas before 
extinguishing fire. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed cylinders cool.
    6. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: BD vapors are heavier than 
air and may travel to a source of ignition and flash back. Closed 
containers may rupture violently when heated.
    7. For purposes of compliance with the requirements of 29 CFR 
1910.106, BD is classified as a flammable gas. For example, 7,500 ppm, 
approximately one-fourth of the lower flammable limit, would be 
considered to pose a potential fire and explosion hazard.
    8. For purposes of compliance with 29 CFR 1910.155, BD is classified 
as a Class B fire hazard.
    9. For purposes of compliance with 29 CFR 1910.307, locations 
classified as hazardous due to the presence of BD shall be Class I.
    B. Reactivity:
    1. Conditions contributing to instability: Heat. Peroxides are 
formed when inhibitor concentration is not maintained at proper level. 
At elevated temperatures, such as in fire conditions, polymerization may 
take place.
    2. Incompatibilities: Contact with strong oxidizing agents may cause 
fires and explosions. The contacting of crude BD (not BD monomer) with 
copper and copper alloys may cause formations of explosive copper 
compounds.
    3. Hazardous decomposition products: Toxic gases (such as carbon 
monoxide) may be released in a fire involving BD.
    4. Special precautions: BD will attack some forms of plastics, 
rubber, and coatings. BD in storage should be checked for proper 
inhibitor content, for self-polymerization, and for formation of 
peroxides when in contact with air and iron. Piping carrying BD may 
become plugged by formation of rubbery polymer.
    C. Warning Properties:
    1. Odor Threshold: An odor threshold of 0.45 ppm has been reported 
in The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Report, Odor 
Thresholds for Chemicals with Established Occupational Health Standards. 
(Ex. 32-28C)
    2. Eye Irritation Level: Workers exposed to vapors of BD 
(concentration or purity unspecified) have complained of irritation of 
eyes, nasal passages, throat, and lungs. Dogs and rabbits exposed 
experimentally to as much as 6700 ppm for 7\1/2\ hours a day for 8 
months have developed no histologically demonstrable abnormality of the 
eyes.
    3. Evaluation of Warning Properties: Since the mean odor threshold 
is about half of the 1 ppm PEL, and more than 10-fold below the 5 ppm 
STEL, most wearers of air purifying respirators should still be able to 
detect breakthrough before a significant overexposure to BD occurs.

[[Page 411]]

                III. Spill, Leak, and Disposal Procedures

    A. Persons not wearing protective equipment and clothing should be 
restricted from areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been 
completed. If BD is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be 
taken:
    1. Eliminate all ignition sources.
    2. Ventilate areas of spill or leak.
    3. If in liquid form, for small quantities, allow to evaporate in a 
safe manner.
    4. Stop or control the leak if this can be done without risk. If 
source of leak is a cylinder and the leak cannot be stopped in place, 
remove the leaking cylinder to a safe place and repair the leak or allow 
the cylinder to empty.
    B. Disposal: This substance, when discarded or disposed of, is a 
hazardous waste according to Federal regulations (40 CFR part 261). It 
is listed by the EPA as hazardous waste number D001 due to its 
ignitability. The transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of 
this waste material must be conducted in compliance with 40 CFR parts 
262, 263, 264, 268 and 270. Disposal can occur only in properly 
permitted facilities. Check state and local regulations for any 
additional requirements because these may be more restrictive than 
federal laws and regulations.

                IV. Monitoring and Measurement Procedures

    A. Exposure above the Permissible Exposure Limit (8-hr TWA) or 
Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL):
    1. 8-hr TWA exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose 
of determining employee exposure under this standard are best taken with 
consecutive samples covering the full shift. Air samples must be taken 
in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent 
that inhaled by the employee).
    2. STEL exposure evaluation: Measurements must represent 15 minute 
exposures associated with operations most likely to exceed the STEL in 
each job and on each shift.
    3. Monitoring frequencies: Table 1 gives various exposure scenarios 
and their required monitoring frequencies, as required by the final 
standard for occupational exposure to butadiene.

    Table 1--Five Exposure Scenarios and Their Associated Monitoring
                               Frequencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Action    8-hr
  level     TWA    STEL            Required monitoring activity

                           (d)(3)(iii). Monitor 8-hr TWA, annually.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Exposure Scenario, Limit Exceeded: + = Yes, -= No.
** The employer may decrease the frequency of exposure monitoring to
  annually when at least 2 consecutive measurements taken at least 7
  days apart show exposures to be below the 8 hr TWA, but at or above
  the action level.

    4. Monitoring techniques: Appendix D describes the validated method 
of sampling and analysis which has been tested by OSHA for use with BD. 
The employer has the obligation of selecting a monitoring method which 
meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standard under his 
or her unique field conditions. The standard requires that the method of 
monitoring must be accurate, to a 95 percent confidence level, to plus 
or minus 25 percent for concentrations of BD at or above 1 ppm, and to 
plus or minus 35 percent for concentrations below 1 ppm.

                    V. Personal Protective Equipment

    A. Employees should be provided with and required to use impervious 
clothing, gloves, face shields (eight-inch minimum), and other 
appropriate protective clothing necessary to prevent the skin from 
becoming frozen from contact with liquid BD.
    B. Any clothing which becomes wet with liquid BD should be removed 
immediately and not re-worn until the butadiene has evaporated.
    C. Employees should be provided with and required to use splash 
proof safety goggles where liquid BD may contact the eyes.

                 VI. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities

    For purposes of complying with 29 CFR 1910.141, the following items 
should be emphasized:
    A. The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanitary 
condition.
    B. Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water are to be 
provided and maintained in a sanitary condition.

                       VII. Additional Precautions

    A. Store BD in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-ventilated 
area and take all necessary precautions to avoid any explosion hazard.
    B. Non-sparking tools must be used to open and close metal 
containers. These containers must be effectively grounded.

[[Page 412]]

    C. Do not incinerate BD cartridges, tanks or other containers.
    D. Employers must advise employees of all areas and operations where 
exposure to BD might occur.

  Appendix C to Sec. 1910.1051--Medical Screening and Surveillance for 
                      1,3-Butadiene (Non-Mandatory)

      I. Basis for Medical Screening and Surveillance Requirements

                      A. Route of Entry Inhalation

                              B. Toxicology

    Inhalation of BD has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, 
damage to the reproductive organs, and fetotoxicity. Butadiene can be 
converted via oxidation to epoxybutene and diepoxybutane, two genotoxic 
metabolites that may play a role in the expression of BD's toxic 
effects.
    BD has been tested for carcinogenicity in mice and rats. Both 
species responded to BD exposure by developing cancer at multiple 
primary organ sites. Early deaths in mice were caused by malignant 
lymphomas, primarily lymphocytic type, originating in the thymus.
    Mice exposed to BD have developed ovarian or testicular atrophy. 
Sperm head morphology tests also revealed abnormal sperm in mice exposed 
to BD; lethal mutations were found in a dominant lethal test. In light 
of these results in animals, the possibility that BD may adversely 
affect the reproductive systems of male and female workers must be 
considered.
    Additionally, anemia has been observed in animals exposed to 
butadiene. In some cases, this anemia appeared to be a primary response 
to exposure; in other cases, it may have been secondary to a neoplastic 
response.

                             C. Epidemiology

    Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates that BD exposure poses an 
increased risk of leukemia. Mild alterations of hematologic parameters 
have also been observed in synthetic rubber workers exposed to BD.

                  II. Potential Adverse Health Effects

                                A. Acute

    Skin contact with liquid BD causes characteristic burns or 
frostbite. BD is gaseous form can irritate the eyes, nasal passages, 
throat, and lungs. Blurred vision, coughing, and drowsiness may also 
occur. Effects are mild at 2,000 ppm and pronounced at 8,000 ppm for 
exposures occurring over the full workshift.
    At very high concentrations in air, BD is an anesthetic, causing 
narcosis, respiratory paralysis, unconsciousness, and death. Such 
concentrations are unlikely, however, except in an extreme emergency 
because BD poses an explosion hazard at these levels.

                               B. Chronic

    The principal adverse health effects of concern are BD-induced 
lymphoma, leukemia and potential reproductive toxicity. Anemia and other 
changes in the peripheral blood cells may be indicators of excessive 
exposure to BD.

                             C. Reproductive

    Workers may be concerned about the possibility that their BD 
exposure may be affecting their ability to procreate a healthy child. 
For workers with high exposures to BD, especially those who have 
experienced difficulties in conceiving, miscarriages, or stillbirths, 
appropriate medical and laboratory evaluation of fertility may be 
necessary to determine if BD is having any adverse effect on the 
reproductive system or on the health of the fetus.

              III. Medical Screening Components At-A-Glance

                         A. Health Questionnaire

    The most important goal of the health questionnaire is to elicit 
information from the worker regarding potential signs or symptoms 
generally related to leukemia or other blood abnormalities. Therefore, 
physicians or other licensed health care professionals should be aware 
of the presenting symptoms and signs of lymphohematopoietic disorders 
and cancers, as well as the procedures necessary to confirm or exclude 
such diagnoses. Additionally, the health questionnaire will assist with 
the identification of workers at greatest risk of developing leukemia or 
adverse reproductive effects from their exposures to BD.
    Workers with a history of reproductive difficulties or a personal or 
family history of immune deficiency syndromes, blood dyscrasias, 
lymphoma, or leukemia, and those who are or have been exposed to 
medicinal drugs or chemicals known to affect the hematopoietic or 
lymphatic systems may be at higher risk from their exposure to BD. After 
the initial administration, the health questionnaire must be updated 
annually.

                      B. Complete Blood Count (CBC)

    The medical screening and surveillance program requires an annual 
CBC, with differential and platelet count, to be provided for each 
employee with BD exposure. This test is to be performed on a blood 
sample obtained by phlebotomy of the venous system or, if technically 
feasible, from a fingerstick sample of capillary blood. The sample is to 
be analyzed by an accredited laboratory.
    Abnormalities in a CBC may be due to a number of different 
etiologies. The concern

[[Page 413]]

for workers exposed to BD includes, but is not limited to, timely 
identification of lymphohematopoietic cancers, such as leukemia and non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma. Abnormalities of portions of the CBC are identified 
by comparing an individual's results to those of an established range of 
normal values for males and females. A substantial change in any 
individual employee's CBC may also be viewed as ``abnormal'' for that 
individual even if all measurements fall within the population-based 
range of normal values. It is suggested that a flowsheet for laboratory 
values be included in each employee's medical record so that comparisons 
and trends in annual CBCs can be easily made.
    A determination of the clinical significance of an abnormal CBC 
shall be the responsibility of the examining physician, other licensed 
health care professional, or medical specialist to whom the employee is 
referred. Ideally, an abnormal CBC should be compared to previous CBC 
measurements for the same employee, when available. Clinical common 
sense may dictate that a CBC value that is very slightly outside the 
normal range does not warrant medical concern. A CBC abnormality may 
also be the result of a temporary physical stressor, such as a transient 
viral illness, blood donation, or menorrhagia, or laboratory error. In 
these cases, the CBC should be repeated in a timely fashion, i.e., 
within 6 weeks, to verify that return to the normal range has occurred. 
A clinically significant abnormal CBC should result in removal of the 
employee from further exposure to BD. Transfer of the employee to other 
work duties in a BD-free environment would be the preferred 
recommendation.

                         C. Physical Examination

    The medical screening and surveillance program requires an initial 
physical examination for workers exposed to BD; this examination is 
repeated once every three years. The initial physical examination should 
assess each worker's baseline general health and rule out clinical signs 
of medical conditions that may be caused by or aggravated by 
occupational BD exposure. The physical examination should be directed at 
identification of signs of lymphohematopoietic disorders, including 
lymph node enlargement, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly.
    Repeated physical examinations should update objective clinical 
findings that could be indicative of interim development of a 
lymphohematopoietic disorder, such as lymphoma, leukemia, or other blood 
abnormality. Physical examinations may also be provided on an as needed 
basis in order to follow up on a positive answer on the health 
questionnaire, or in response to an abnormal CBC. Physical examination 
of workers who will no longer be working in jobs with BD exposure are 
intended to rule out lymphohematopoietic disorders.
    The need for physical examinations for workers concerned about 
adverse reproductive effects from their exposure to BD should be 
identified by the physician or other licensed health care professional 
and provided accordingly. For these workers, such consultations and 
examinations may relate to developmental toxicity and reproductive 
capacity.
    Physical examination of workers acutely exposed to significant 
levels of BD should be especially directed at the respiratory system, 
eyes, sinuses, skin, nervous system, and any region associated with 
particular complaints. If the worker has received a severe acute 
exposure, hospitalization may be required to assure proper medical 
management. Since this type of exposure may place workers at greater 
risk of blood abnormalities, a CBC must be obtained within 48 hours and 
repeated at one, two, and three months.

  Appendix D to Sec. 1910.1051--Sampling and Analytical Method for 1,3-
                        Butadiene (Non-Mandatory)

    OSHA Method No.: 56.
    Matrix: Air.
    Target concentration: 1 ppm (2.21 mg/m\3\)
    Procedure: Air samples are collected by drawing known volumes of air 
through sampling tubes containing charcoal adsorbent which has been 
coated with 4-tert-butylcatechol. The samples are desorbed with carbon 
disulfide and then analyzed by gas chromatography using a flame 
ionization detector.
    Recommended sampling rate and air volume: 0.05 L/min and 3 L.
    Detection limit of the overall procedure: 90 ppb (200 ug/m \3\) 
(based on 3 L air volume).
    Reliable quantitation limit: 155 ppb (343 ug/m \3\) (based on 3 L 
air volume).
    Standard error of estimate at the target concentration: 6.5%.
    Special requirements: The sampling tubes must be coated with 4-tert-
butylcatechol. Collected samples should be stored in a freezer.
    Status of method: A sampling and analytical method has been 
subjected to the established evaluation procedures of the Organic 
Methods Evaluation Branch, OSHA Analytical Laboratory, Salt Lake City, 
Utah 84165.

                             1.  Background

    This work was undertaken to develop a sampling and analytical 
procedure for BD at 1 ppm. The current method recommended by OSHA for 
collecting BD uses activated coconut shell charcoal as the sampling 
medium (Ref. 5.2). This method was found to be inadequate for use at low 
BD levels because of sample instability.

[[Page 414]]

    The stability of samples has been significantly improved through the 
use of a specially cleaned charcoal which is coated with 4-tert-
butylcatechol (TBC). TBC is a polymerization inhibitor for BD (Ref. 
5.3).

                          1.1.1  Toxic effects

    Symptoms of human exposure to BD include irritation of the eyes, 
nose and throat. It can also cause coughing, drowsiness and fatigue. 
Dermatitis and frostbite can result from skin exposure to liquid BD. 
(Ref. 5.1)
    NIOSH recommends that BD be handled in the workplace as a potential 
occupational carcinogen. This recommendation is based on two inhalation 
studies that resulted in cancers at multiple sites in rats and in mice. 
BD has also demonstrated mutagenic activity in the presence of a liver 
microsomal activating system. It has also been reported to have adverse 
reproductive effects. (Ref. 5.1)

                  1.1.2.  Potential workplace exposure

    About 90% of the annual production of BD is used to manufacture 
styrene-butadiene rubber and Polybutadiene rubber. Other uses include: 
Polychloroprene rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene-stryene resins, nylon 
intermediates, styrene-butadiene latexes, butadiene polymers, 
thermoplastic elastomers, nitrile resins, methyl methacrylate-butadiene 
styrene resins and chemical intermediates. (Ref. 5.1)

vinylethylene.

                     1.2.  Limit defining parameters

    The analyte air concentrations listed throughout this method are 
based on an air volume of 3 L and a desorption volume of 1 mL. Air 
concentrations listed in ppm are referenced to 25  deg.C and 760 mm Hg.

           1.2.1.  Detection limit of the analytical procedure

    The detection limit of the analytical procedure was 304 pg per 
injection. This was the amount of BD which gave a response relative to 
the interferences present in a standard.

            1.2.2.  Detection limit of the overall procedure

    The detection limit of the overall procedure was 0.60 <greek-m>g per 
sample (90 ppb or 200 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>). This amount was 
determined graphically. It was the amount of analyte which, when spiked 
on the sampling device, would allow recovery approximately equal to the 
detection limit of the analytical procedure.

                   1.2.3.  Reliable quantitation limit

    The reliable quantitation limit was 1.03 <greek-m>g per sample (155 
ppb or 343 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>). This was the smallest amount of 
analyte which could be quantitated within the limits of a recovery of at 
least 75% and a precision (<plus-minus>1.96 SD) of <plus-minus>25% or 
better.

                    1.2.4.  Sensitivity <SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The reliable quantitation limit and detection limits reported in 
the method are based upon optimization of the instrument for the 
smallest possible amount of analyte. When the target concentration of an 
analyte is exceptionally higher than these limits, they may not be 
attainable at the routine operation parameters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The sensitivity of the analytical procedure over a concentration 
range representing 0.6 to 2 times the target concentration, based on the 
recommended air volume, was 387 area units per <greek-m>g/mL. This value 
was determined from the slope of the calibration curve. The sensitivity 
may vary with the particular instrument used in the analysis.

                            1.2.5.  Recovery

    The recovery of BD from samples used in storage tests remained above 
77% when the samples were stored at ambient temperature and above 94% 
when the samples were stored at refrigerated temperature. These values 
were determined from regression lines which were calculated from the 
storage data. The recovery of the analyte from the collection device 
must be at least 75% following storage.

               1.2.6.  Precision (analytical method only)

    The pooled coefficient of variation obtained from replicate 
determinations of analytical standards over the range of 0.6 to 2 times 
the target concentration was 0.011.

                  1.2.7.  Precision (overall procedure)

    The precision at the 95% confidence level for the refrigerated 
temperature storage test was <plus-minus>12.7%. This value includes an 
additional <plus-minus>5% for sampling error. The overall procedure must 
provide results at the target concentrations that are <plus-minus>25% at 
the 95% confidence level.

[[Page 415]]

                         1.2.8.  Reproducibility

    Samples collected from a controlled test atmosphere and a draft copy 
of this procedure were given to a chemist unassociated with this 
evaluation. The average recovery was 97.2% and the standard deviation 
was 6.2%.

                          2. Sampling procedure

                             2.1.  Apparatus

    2.1.1.  Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump 
that can be calibrated to within <plus-minus>5% of the recommended 0.05 
L/min sampling rate with the sampling tube in line.
    2.1.2.  Samples are collected with laboratory prepared sampling 
tubes. The sampling tube is constructed of silane-treated glass and is 
about 5-cm long. The ID is 4 mm and the OD is 6 mm. One end of the tube 
is tapered so that a glass wool end plug will hold the contents of the 
tube in place during sampling. The opening in the tapered end of the 
sampling tube is at least one-half the ID of the tube (2 mm). The other 
end of the sampling tube is open to its full 4-mm ID to facilitate 
packing of the tube. Both ends of the tube are fire-polished for safety. 
The tube is packed with 2 sections of pretreated charcoal which has been 
coated with TBC. The tube is packed with a 50-mg backup section, located 
nearest the tapered end, and with a 100-mg sampling section of charcoal. 
The two sections of coated adsorbent are separated and retained with 
small plugs of silanized glass wool. Following packing, the sampling 
tubes are sealed with two \7/32\ inch OD plastic end caps. Instructions 
for the pretreatment and coating of the charcoal are presented in 
Section 4.1 of this method.

                             2.2.  Reagents

    None required.

                             2.3.  Technique

    2.3.1.  Properly label the sampling tube before sampling and then 
remove the plastic end caps.
    2.3.2.  Attach the sampling tube to the pump using a section of 
flexible plastic tubing such that the larger front section of the 
sampling tube is exposed directly to the atmosphere. Do not place any 
tubing ahead of the sampling tube. The sampling tube should be attached 
in the worker's breathing zone in a vertical manner such that it does 
not impede work performance.
    2.3.3.  After sampling for the appropriate time, remove the sampling 
tube from the pump and then seal the tube with plastic end caps. Wrap 
the tube lengthwise.
    2.3.4.  Include at least one blank for each sampling set. The blank 
should be handled in the same manner as the samples with the exception 
that air is not drawn through it.
    2.3.5.  List any potential interferences on the sample data sheet.
    2.3.6.   The samples require no special shipping precautions under 
normal conditions. The samples should be refrigerated if they are to be 
exposed to higher than normal ambient temperatures. If the samples are 
to be stored before they are shipped to the laboratory, they should be 
kept in a freezer. The samples should be placed in a freezer upon 
receipt at the laboratory.

                           2.4.  Breakthrough

    (Breakthrough was defined as the relative amount of analyte found on 
the backup section of the tube in relation to the total amount of 
analyte collected on the sampling tube. Five-percent breakthrough 
occurred after sampling a test atmosphere containing 2.0 ppm BD for 90 
min at 0.05 L/min. At the end of this time 4.5 L of air had been sampled 
and 20.1 <greek-m>g of the analyte was collected. The relative humidity 
of the sampled air was 80% at 23  deg.C.)
    Breakthrough studies have shown that the recommended sampling 
procedure can be used at air concentrations higher than the target 
concentration. The sampling time, however, should be reduced to 45 min 
if both the expected BD level and the relative humidity of the sampled 
air are high.

                       2.5.  Desorption efficiency

    The average desorption efficiency for BD from TBC coated charcoal 
over the range from 0.6 to 2 times the target concentration was 96.4%. 
The efficiency was essentially constant over the range studied.

             2.6.  Recommended air volume and sampling rate

    2.6.1.   The recommended air volume is 3L.
    2.6.2.   The recommended sampling rate is 0.05 L/min for 1 hour.

                           2.7.  Interferences

    There are no known interferences to the sampling method.

                        2.8.  Safety precautions

    2.8.1.   Attach the sampling equipment to the worker in such a 
manner that it will not interfere with work performance or safety.
    2.8.2.   Follow all safety practices that apply to the work area 
being sampled.

    \2\ A Hewlett-Packard Model 5840A GC was used for this evaluation. 
Injections were performed using a Hewlett-Packard Model 7671A automatic 
sampler.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3.1.2.   A GC column capable of resolving the analytes from any 
interference.<SUP>3</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ A 20-ft x \1/8\-inch OD stainless steel GC column containing 20% 
FFAP on 80/100 mesh Chromabsorb W-AW-DMCS was used for this evaluation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3.2.1.   Carbon disulfide.<SUP>4</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Fisher Scientific Company A.C.S. Reagent Grade solvent was used 
in this evaluation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The benzene contaminant that was present in the carbon disulfide was 
used as an internal standard (ISTD) in this evaluation.
    3.2.2.   Nitrogen, hydrogen and air, GC grade.
    3.2.3.   BD of known high purity.<SUP>5</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Matheson Gas Products, CP Grade 1,3-butadiene was used in this 
study.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       3.3.  Standard preparation

    3.3.1.   Prepare standards by diluting known volumes of BD gas with 
carbon disulfide. This can be accomplished by injecting the appropriate 
volume of BD into the headspace above the 1-mL of carbon disulfide 
contained in sealed 2-mL vial. Shake the vial after the needle is 
removed from the septum.<SUP>6</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ A standard containing 7.71 <greek-m>g/mL (at ambient temperature 
and pressure) was prepared by diluting 4 <greek-m>L of the gas with 1-mL 
of carbon disulfide.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3.3.2.   The mass of BD gas used to prepare standards can be 
determined by use of the following equations:

MV = (760/BP)(273+t)/(273)(22.41)

Where:

MV = ambient molar volume
BP = ambient barometric pressure
T = ambient temperature
<greek-m>g/<greek-m>L = 54.09/MV
<greek-m>g/standard = (<greek-m>g/<greek-m>L)(<greek-m>L) BD used to 
prepare the standard

                        3.4.  Sample preparation

    3.4.1.   Transfer the 100-mg section of the sampling tube to a 2-mL 
vial. Place the 50-mg section in a separate vial. If the glass wool 
plugs contain a significant amount of charcoal, place them with the 
appropriate sampling tube section.
    3.4.2.   Add 1-mL of carbon disulfide to each vial.
    3.4.3.   Seal the vials with Teflon-lined caps and then allow them 
to desorb for one hour. Shake the vials by hand vigorously several times 
during the desorption period.
    3.4.4.   If it is not possible to analyze the samples within 4 
hours, separate the carbon disulfide from the charcoal, using a 
disposable Pasteur-type pipet, following the one hour. This separation 
will improve the stability of desorbed samples.
    3.4.5.   Save the used sampling tubes to be cleaned and repacked 
with fresh adsorbent.

    3.5.4.   Prepare a calibration curve using several standard 
solutions of different concentrations. Prepare the calibration curve 
daily. Program the integrator to report the results in <greek-m>g/mL.
    3.5.5.   Bracket sample concentrations with standards.

                    3.6.  Interferences (analytical)

    3.6.1.   Any compound with the same general retention time as the 
analyte and which also gives a detector response is a potential 
interference. Possible interferences should be reported by the 
industrial hygienist to the laboratory with submitted samples.
    3.6.2.   GC parameters (temperature, column, etc.) may be changed to 
circumvent interferences.
    3.6.3.   A useful means of structure designation is GC/MS. It is 
recommended that this procedure be used to confirm samples whenever 
possible.

                           3.7.  Calculations

    3.7.1.   Results are obtained by use of calibration curves. 
Calibration curves are prepared by plotting detector response against 
concentration for each standard. The best

[[Page 417]]

line through the data points is determined by curve fitting.
    3.7.2.   The concentration, in ug/mL, for a particular sample is 
determined by comparing its detector response to the calibration curve. 
If any analyte is found on the backup section, this amount is added to 
the amount found on the front section. Blank corrections should be 
performed before adding the results together.
    3.7.3.   The BD air concentration can be expressed using the 
following equation:

mg/m \3\ = (A)(B)/(C)(D)

Where:

A = <greek-m>g/mL from Section 3.7.2
B = volume
C = L of air sampled
D = efficiency

    3.7.4.   The following equation can be used to convert results in 
mg/m \3\ to ppm:
ppm = (mg/m \3\)(24.46)/54.09

Where:

mg/m \3\ = result from Section 3.7.3.
24.46 = molar volume of an ideal gas at 760 mm Hg and 25  deg.C.

                  3.8.  Safety precautions (analytical)

    3.8.1.   Avoid skin contact and inhalation of all chemicals.
    3.8.2.   Restrict the use of all chemicals to a fume hood whenever 
possible.
    3.8.3.   Wear safety glasses and a lab coat in all laboratory areas.

    4.1.2.3.   Specially cleaned coconut shell charcoal, 20/40 
mesh.<SUP>11</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\  Specially cleaned charcoal was obtained from Supelco, Inc. for 
use in this evaluation. The cleaning process used by Supelco is 
proprietary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4.1.2.4.   Nitrogen gas, GC grade.
    4.1.3.   Procedure.
    Weigh 30g of charcoal into a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add about 250 
mL of 10% phosphoric acid to the flask and then swirl the mixture. Stir 
the mixture for 1 hour using a magnetic stirrer. Filter the mixture 
using a fitted Buchner funnel. Wash the charcoal several times with 250-
mL portions of deionized water to remove all traces of the acid. 
Transfer the washed charcoal to the tube furnace quartz tube. Place the 
quartz tube in the furnace and then connect the nitrogen gas purge to 
the tube. Fire the charcoal to 700   deg.C. Maintain that temperature 
for at least 1 hour. After the charcoal has cooled to room temperature, 
transfer it to a tared beaker. Determine the weight of the charcoal and 
then add an amount of TBC which is 10% of the charcoal, by weight.
    CAUTION-TBC is toxic and should only be handled in a fume hood while 
wearing gloves.
    Carefully mix the contents of the beaker and then transfer the 
mixture to a 4-oz bottle. Stopper the bottle with a clean rubber stopper 
which has been wrapped with Teflon tape. Clamp the bottle in a water 
bath so that the water level is above the charcoal level. Gently heat 
the bath to 60   deg.C and then maintain that temperature for 1 hour. 
Cool the charcoal to room temperature and then transfer the coated 
charcoal to a suitable container.
    The coated charcoal is now ready to be packed into sampling tubes. 
The sampling tubes should be stored in a sealed container to prevent 
contamination. Sampling tubes should be stored in the dark at room 
temperature. The sampling tubes should be segregated by coated adsorbent 
lot number.

                            4.2 Chromatograms

    The chromatograms were obtained using the recommended analytical 
method. The chart speed was set at 1 cm/min for the first three min and 
then at 0.2 cm/min for the time remaining in the analysis.
    The peak which elutes just before BD is a reaction product between 
an impurity on the charcoal and TBC. This peak is always present, but it 
is easily resolved from the analyte. The peak which elutes immediately 
before benzene is an oxidation product of TBC.

Sec. 1910.1052  Methylene Chloride.

    This occupational health standard establishes requirements for 
employers to control occupational exposure to methylene chloride (MC). 
Employees exposed to MC are at increased risk of developing cancer, 
adverse effects on the heart, central nervous system and liver, and skin 
or eye irritation. Exposure may occur through inhalation, by absorption 
through the skin, or through contact with the skin. MC is a solvent 
which is used in many different types of work activities, such as paint 
stripping, polyurethane foam manufacturing, and cleaning and degreasing. 
Under the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, each covered 
employer must make an initial determination of each employee's exposure 
to MC. If the employer determines that employees are exposed below the 
action level, the only other provisions of this section that apply are 
that a record must be made of the determination, the employees must 
receive information and training under paragraph (l) of this section 
and, where appropriate, employees must be protected from contact with 
liquid MC under paragraph (h) of this section. The provisions of the MC 
standard are as follows:
    (a) Scope and application. This section applies to all occupational 
exposures to methylene chloride (MC), Chemical Abstracts Service 
Registry Number 75-09-2, in general industry, construction and shipyard 
employment.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following 
definitions shall apply:
    Action level means a concentration of airborne MC of 12.5 parts per 
million (ppm) calculated as an eight (8)-hour time-weighted average 
(TWA).
    Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee.
    Authorized person means any person specifically authorized by the 
employer and required by work duties to be present in regulated areas, 
or any person entering such an area as a designated representative of 
employees for the purpose of exercising the right to observe monitoring 
and measuring procedures under paragraph (d) of this section, or any 
other person authorized by the OSH Act or regulations issued under the 
Act.
    Director means the Director of the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, or designee.
    Emergency means any occurrence, such as, but not limited to, 
equipment failure, rupture of containers, or failure of control 
equipment, which results, or is likely to result in an uncontrolled 
release of MC. If an incidental release of MC can be controlled by 
employees such as maintenance personnel at the time of release and in 
accordance with the leak/spill provisions required by paragraph (f) of 
this section, it is not considered an emergency as defined by this 
standard.
    Employee exposure means exposure to airborne MC which occurs or 
would occur if the employee were not using respiratory protection.
    Methylene chloride (MC) means an organic compound with chemical 
formula, CH<INF>2</INF> Cl<INF>2</INF>. Its Chemical Abstracts Service 
Registry Number is 75-09-2. Its molecular weight is 84.9 g/mole.
    Physician or other licensed health care professional is an 
individual whose legally permitted scope of practice (i.e., license, 
registration, or certification) allows him or her to independently 
provide or be delegated the responsibility to provide some or all of the 
health care services required by paragraph (j) of this section.
    Regulated area means an area, demarcated by the employer, where an 
employee's exposure to airborne concentrations of MC exceeds or can 
reasonably be expected to exceed either the 8-hour TWA PEL or the STEL.
    Symptom means central nervous system effects such as headaches, 
disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, and decreased attention span; skin 
effects such as chapping, erythema, cracked skin, or skin burns; and 
cardiac effects such as chest pain or shortness of breath.
    This section means this methylene chloride standard.
    (c) Permissible exposure limits (PELs)--(1) Eight-hour time-weighted 
average (TWA) PEL. The employer shall ensure

[[Page 427]]

that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of MC in excess 
of twenty-five parts of MC per million parts of air (25 ppm) as an 8-
hour TWA.
    (2) Short-term exposure limit (STEL). The employer shall ensure that 
no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of MC in excess of 
one hundred and twenty-five parts of MC per million parts of air (125 
ppm) as determined over a sampling period of fifteen minutes.
    (d) Exposure monitoring--(1) Characterization of employee exposure. 
(i) Where MC is present in the workplace, the employer shall determine 
each employee's exposure by either:
    (A) Taking a personal breathing zone air sample of each employee's 
exposure; or
    (B) Taking personal breathing zone air samples that are 
representative of each employee's exposure.
    (ii) Representative samples. The employer may consider personal 
breathing zone air samples to be representative of employee exposures 
when they are taken as follows:
    (A) 8-hour TWA PEL. The employer has taken one or more personal 
breathing zone air samples for at least one employee in each job 
classification in a work area during every work shift, and the employee 
sampled is expected to have the highest MC exposure.
    (B) Short-term exposure limits. The employer has taken one or more 
personal breathing zone air samples which indicate the highest likely 
15-minute exposures during such operations for at least one employee in 
each job classification in the work area during every work shift, and 
the employee sampled is expected to have the highest MC exposure.
    (C) Exception. Personal breathing zone air samples taken during one 
work shift may be used to represent employee exposures on other work 
shifts where the employer can document that the tasks performed and 
conditions in the workplace are similar across shifts.
    (iii) Accuracy of monitoring. The employer shall ensure that the 
methods used to perform exposure monitoring produce results that are 
accurate to a confidence level of 95 percent, and are:
    (A) Within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of 
MC above the 8-hour TWA PEL or the STEL; or
    (B) Within plus or minus 35 percent for airborne concentrations of 
MC at or above the action level but at or below the 8-hour TWA PEL.
    (2) Initial determination. Each employer whose employees are exposed 
to MC shall perform initial exposure monitoring to determine each 
affected employee's exposure, except under the following conditions:
    (i) Where objective data demonstrate that MC cannot be released in 
the workplace in airborne concentrations at or above the action level or 
above the STEL. The objective data shall represent the highest MC 
exposures likely to occur under reasonably foreseeable conditions of 
processing, use, or handling. The employer shall document the objective 
data exemption as specified in paragraph (m) of this section;
    (ii) Where the employer has performed exposure monitoring within 12 
months prior to April 10, 1997 and that exposure monitoring meets all 
other requirements of this section, and was conducted under conditions 
substantially equivalent to existing conditions; or
    (iii) Where employees are exposed to MC on fewer than 30 days per 
year (e.g., on a construction site), and the employer has measurements 
by direct-reading instruments which give immediate results (such as a 
detector tube) and which provide sufficient information regarding 
employee exposures to determine what control measures are necessary to 
reduce exposures to acceptable levels.
    (3) Periodic monitoring. Where the initial determination shows 
employee exposures at or above the action level or above the STEL, the 
employer shall establish an exposure monitoring program for periodic 
monitoring of employee exposure to MC in accordance with Table 1:

[[Page 428]]

                                paragraph (d)(3), the following
                                employers must monitor STEL exposures
                                every three months until either the date
                                by which they must achieve the 8-hour
                                TWA PEL under paragraph (n) of this
                                section or the date by which they in
                                fact achieve the 8-hour TWA PEL,
                                whichever comes first: employers engaged
                                in polyurethane foam manufacturing; foam
                                fabrication; furniture refinishing;

                                conversion, or upholstery; and use of MC
                                in construction work for restoration and
                                preservation of buildings, painting and
                                paint removal, cabinet making, or floor
                                refinishing and resurfacing.
Above the TWA and above the    Monitor 8-hour TWA exposures and STEL
 STEL.                          exposures every three months.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [Note to paragraph (d)(3):
    The employer may decrease the frequency of 8-hour TWA exposure 
monitoring to every six months when at least two consecutive 
measurements taken at least seven days apart show exposures to be at or 
below the 8-hour TWA PEL. The employer may discontinue the periodic 8-
hour TWA monitoring for employees where at least two consecutive 
measurements taken at least seven days apart are below the action level. 
The employer may discontinue the periodic STEL monitoring for employees 
where at least two consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart 
are at or below the STEL.]
    (4) Additional monitoring. (i) The employer shall perform exposure 
monitoring when a change in workplace conditions indicates that employee 
exposure may have increased. Examples of situations that may require 
additional monitoring include changes in production, process, control 
equipment, or work practices, or a leak, rupture, or other breakdown.
    (ii) Where exposure monitoring is performed due to a spill, leak, 
rupture or equipment breakdown, the employer shall clean-up the MC and 
perform the appropriate repairs before monitoring.
    (5) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) The employer 
shall, within 15 working days after the receipt of the results of any 
monitoring performed under this section, notify each affected employee 
of these results in writing, either individually or by posting of 
results in an appropriate location that is accessible to affected 
employees.
    (ii) Whenever monitoring results indicate that employee exposure is 
above the 8-hour TWA PEL or the STEL, the employer shall describe in the 
written notification the corrective action being taken to reduce 
employee exposure to or below the 8-hour TWA PEL or STEL and the 
schedule for completion of this action.
    (6) Observation of monitoring--(i) Employee observation. The 
employer shall provide affected employees or their designated 
representatives an opportunity to observe any monitoring of employee 
exposure to MC conducted in accordance with this section.
    (ii) Observation procedures. When observation of the monitoring of 
employee exposure to MC requires entry into an area where the use of 
protective clothing or equipment is required, the employer shall 
provide, at no cost to the observer(s), and the observer(s) shall be 
required to use such clothing and equipment and shall comply with all 
other applicable safety and health procedures.
    (e) Regulated areas. (1) The employer shall establish a regulated 
area wherever an employee's exposure to airborne concentrations of MC 
exceeds or can reasonably be expected to exceed either the 8-hour TWA 
PEL or the STEL.
    (2) The employer shall limit access to regulated areas to authorized 
persons.
    (3) The employer shall supply a respirator, selected in accordance 
with

[[Page 429]]

paragraph (h)(3) of this section, to each person who enters a regulated 
area and shall require each affected employee to use that respirator 
whenever MC exposures are likely to exceed the 8-hour TWA PEL or STEL.
    [Note to paragraph (e)(3):
    An employer who has implemented all feasible engineering, work 
practice and administrative controls (as required in paragraph (f) of 
this section), and who has established a regulated area (as required by 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section) where MC exposure can be reliably 
predicted to exceed the 8-hour TWA PEL or the STEL only on certain days 
(for example,because of work or process schedule) would need to have 
affected employees use respirators in that regulated area only on those 
days.]
    (4) The employer shall ensure that, within a regulated area, 
employees do not engage in non-work activities which may increase dermal 
or oral MC exposure.
    (5) The employer shall ensure that while employees are wearing 
respirators, they do not engage in activities (such as taking medication 
or chewing gum or tobacco) which interfere with respirator seal or 
performance.
    (6) The employer shall demarcate regulated areas from the rest of 
the workplace in any manner that adequately establishes and alerts 
employees to the boundaries of the area and minimizes the number of 
authorized employees exposed to MC within the regulated area.
    (7) An employer at a multi-employer worksite who establishes a 
regulated area shall communicate the access restrictions and locations 
of these areas to all other employers with work operations at that 
worksite.
    (f) Methods of compliance--(1) Engineering and work practice 
controls. The employer shall institute and maintain the effectiveness of 
engineering controls and work practices to reduce employee exposure to 
or below the PELs except to the extent that the employer can demonstrate 
that such controls are not feasible. Wherever the feasible engineering 
controls and work practices which can be instituted are not sufficient 
to reduce employee exposure to or below the 8-TWA PEL or STEL, the 
employer shall use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest levels 
achievable by these controls and shall supplement them by the use of 
respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph 
(g) of this section.
    (2) Prohibition of rotation. The employer shall not implement a 
schedule of employee rotation as a means of compliance with the PELs.
    (3) Leak and spill detection. (i) The employer shall implement 
procedures to detect leaks of MC in the workplace. In work areas where 
spills may occur, the employer shall make provisions to contain any 
spills and to safely dispose of any MC-contaminated waste materials.
    (ii) The employer shall ensure that all incidental leaks are 
repaired and that incidental spills are cleaned promptly by employees 
who use the appropriate personal protective equipment and are trained in 
proper methods of cleanup.
    [Note to paragraph (f)(3)(ii):
    See Appendix A of this section for examples of procedures that 
satisfy this requirement. Employers covered by this standard may also be 
subject to the hazardous waste and emergency response provisions 
contained in 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).]
    (g) Respiratory protection--(1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods when an employee's exposure to MC exceeds the 8-hour TWA 
PEL, or STEL (for example, when an employee is using MC in a regulated 
area).
    (ii) Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering 
and work-practice controls.
    (iii) A few work operations, such as some maintenance operations and 
repair activities, for which the employer demonstrates that engineering 
and work-practice controls are infeasible.
    (iv) Work operations for which feasible engineering and work-
practice controls are not sufficient to reduce employee exposures to or 
below the PELs.
    (v) Emergencies.
    (2) Respirator program. (i) The employer must implement a 
respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b) 
through (m) (except (d)(1)(iii) and (d)(3)(iii)(B) (1) and (2)).

[[Page 430]]

    (ii) Employers who provide employees with gas masks with organic-
vapor canisters for the purpose of emergency escape must replace the 
canisters after any emergency use and before the gas masks are returned 
to service.
    (3) Respirator selection. The employer must select appropriate 
atmosphere-supplying respirators from Table 2 of this section.

respirator in the negative-pressure mode, or a gas mask with an organic-
vapor canister for emergency escape, the employer must:
    (i) Have a physician or other licensed health-care professional 
(PLHCP) evaluate the employee's ability to use such respiratory 
protection.
    (ii) Ensure that the PLHCP provides their findings in a written 
opinion to the employee and the employer.
    (h) Protective Work Clothing and Equipment. (1) Where needed to 
prevent MC-induced skin or eye irritation, the employer shall provide 
clean protective clothing and equipment which is resistant to MC, at no 
cost to the employee, and shall ensure that each affected employee uses 
it. Eye and face protection shall meet the requirements of 29 CFR 
1910.133 or 29 CFR 1915.153, as applicable.
    (2) The employer shall clean, launder, repair and replace all 
protective clothing and equipment required by this paragraph as needed 
to maintain their effectiveness.
    (3) The employer shall be responsible for the safe disposal of such 
clothing and equipment.
    [Note to paragraph (h)(4):
    See Appendix A for examples of disposal procedures that will satisfy 
this requirement.]
    (i) Hygiene facilities. (1) If it is reasonably foreseeable that 
employees' skin may contact solutions containing 0.1 percent or greater 
MC (for example, through splashes, spills or improper work practices), 
the employer shall provide conveniently located washing facilities 
capable of removing the MC, and shall ensure that affected employees use 
these facilities as needed.
    (2) If it is reasonably foreseeable that an employee's eyes may 
contact solutions containing 0.1 percent or greater MC (for example 
through splashes, spills or improper work practices), the employer shall 
provide appropriate eyewash facilities within the immediate work area 
for emergency use, and shall ensure that affected employees use those 
facilities when necessary.
    (j) Medical surveillance--(1) Affected employees. The employer shall 
make medical surveillance available for employees who are or may be 
exposed to MC as follows:
    (i) At or above the action level on 30 or more days per year, or 
above the 8- hour TWA PEL or the STEL on 10 or more days per year;

[[Page 431]]

    (ii) Above the 8-TWA PEL or STEL for any time period where an 
employee has been identified by a physician or other licensed health 
care professional as being at risk from cardiac disease or from some 
other serious MC-related health condition and such employee requests 
inclusion in the medical surveillance program;
    (iii) During an emergency.
    (2) Costs. The employer shall provide all required medical 
surveillance at no cost to affected employees, without loss of pay and 
at a reasonable time and place.
    (3) Medical personnel. The employer shall ensure that all medical 
surveillance procedures are performed by a physician or other licensed 
health care professional, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) Frequency of medical surveillance. The employer shall make 
medical surveillance available to each affected employee as follows:
    (i) Initial surveillance. The employer shall provide initial medical 
surveillance under the schedule provided by paragraph (n)(2)(iii) of 
this section, or before the time of initial assignment of the employee, 
whichever is later. The employer need not provide the initial 
surveillance if medical records show that an affected employee has been 
provided with medical surveillance that complies with this section 
within 12 months before April 10, 1997.
    (ii) Periodic medical surveillance. The employer shall update the 
medical and work history for each affected employee annually. The 
employer shall provide periodic physical examinations, including 
appropriate laboratory surveillance, as follows:
    (A) For employees 45 years of age or older, within 12 months of the 
initial surveillance or any subsequent medical surveillance; and
    (B) For employees younger than 45 years of age, within 36 months of 
the initial surveillance or any subsequent medical surveillance.
    (iii) Termination of employment or reassignment. When an employee 
leaves the employer's workplace, or is reassigned to an area where 
exposure to MC is consistently at or below the action level and STEL, 
medical surveillance shall be made available if six months or more have 
elapsed since the last medical surveillance.
    (iv) Additional surveillance. The employer shall provide additional 
medical surveillance at frequencies other than those listed above when 
recommended in the written medical opinion. (For example, the physician 
or other licensed health care professional may determine an examination 
is warranted in less than 36 months for employees younger than 45 years 
of age based upon evaluation of the results of the annual medical and 
work history.)
    (5) Content of medical surveillance--(i) Medical and work history. 
The comprehensive medical and work history shall emphasize neurological 
symptoms, skin conditions, history of hematologic or liver disease, 
signs or symptoms suggestive of heart disease (angina, coronary artery 
disease), risk factors for cardiac disease, MC exposures, and work 
practices and personal protective equipment used during such exposures.
    [Note to paragraph (j)(5)(i):
    See Appendix B of this section for an example of a medical and work 
history format that would satisfy this requirement.]
    (ii) Physical examination. Where physical examinations are provided 
as required above, the physician or other licensed health care 
professional shall accord particular attention to the lungs, 
cardiovascular system (including blood pressure and pulse), liver, 
nervous system, and skin. The physician or other licensed health care 
professional shall determine the extent and nature of the physical 
examination based on the health status of the employee and analysis of 
the medical and work history.
    (iii) Laboratory surveillance. The physician or other licensed 
health care professional shall determine the extent of any required 
laboratory surveillance based on the employee's observed health status 
and the medical and work history.
    [Note to paragraph (j)(5)(iii):
    See Appendix B of this section for information regarding medical 
tests. Laboratory surveillance may include before- and after-shift 
carboxyhemoglobin determinations, resting ECG, hematocrit, liver 
function tests and cholesterol levels.]
    (iv) Other information or reports. The medical surveillance shall 
also include

[[Page 432]]

any other information or reports the physician or other licensed health 
care professional determines are necessary to assess the employee's 
health in relation to MC exposure.
    (6) Content of emergency medical surveillance. The employer shall 
ensure that medical surveillance made available when an employee has 
been exposed to MC in emergency situations includes, at a minimum:
    (i) Appropriate emergency treatment and decontamination of the 
exposed employee;
    (ii) Comprehensive physical examination with special emphasis on the 
nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs, liver and skin, including 
blood pressure and pulse;
    (iii) Updated medical and work history, as appropriate for the 
medical condition of the employee; and
    (iv) Laboratory surveillance, as indicated by the employee's health 
status.
    [Note to paragraph (j)(6)(iv):
    See Appendix B for examples of tests which may be appropriate.]
    (7) Additional examinations and referrals. Where the physician or 
other licensed health care professional determines it is necessary, the 
scope of the medical examination shall be expanded and the appropriate 
additional medical surveillance, such as referrals for consultation or 
examination, shall be provided.
    (8) Information provided to the physician or other licensed health 
care professional. The employer shall provide the following information 
to a physician or other licensed health care professional who is 
involved in the diagnosis of MC-induced health effects:
    (i) A copy of this section including its applicable appendices;
    (ii) A description of the affected employee's past, current and 
anticipated future duties as they relate to the employee's MC exposure;
    (iii) The employee's former or current exposure levels or, for 
employees not yet occupationally exposed to MC, the employee's 
anticipated exposure levels and the frequency and exposure levels 
anticipated to be associated with emergencies;
    (iv) A description of any personal protective equipment, such as 
respirators, used or to be used; and
    (v) Information from previous employment-related medical 
surveillance of the affected employee which is not otherwise available 
to the physician or other licensed health care professional.
    (9) Written medical opinions. (i) For each physical examination 
required by this section, the employer shall ensure that the physician 
or other licensed health care professional provides to the employer and 
to the affected employee a written opinion regarding the results of that 
examination within 15 days of completion of the evaluation of medical 
and laboratory findings, but not more than 30 days after the 
examination. The written medical opinion shall be limited to the 
following information:
    (A) The physician or other licensed health care professional's 
opinion concerning whether exposure to MC may contribute to or aggravate 
the employee's existing cardiac, hepatic, neurological (including 
stroke) or dermal disease or whether the employee has any other medical 
condition(s) that would place the employee's health at increased risk of 
material impairment from exposure to MC.
    (B) Any recommended limitations upon the employee's exposure to MC, 
including removal from MC exposure, or upon the employee's use of 
respirators, protective clothing, or other protective equipment.
    (C) A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician 
or other licensed health care professional that MC is a potential 
occupational carcinogen, of risk factors for heart disease, and the 
potential for exacerbation of underlying heart disease by exposure to MC 
through its metabolism to carbon monoxide; and
    (D) A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician 
or other licensed health care professional of the results of the medical 
examination and any medical conditions resulting from MC exposure which 
require further explanation or treatment.
    (ii) The employer shall instruct the physician or other licensed 
health care professional not to reveal to the employer, orally or in the 
written opinion, any specific records, findings, and diagnoses that have 
no bearing on occupational exposure to MC.

[[Page 433]]

    [Note to paragraph (j)(9)(ii):
    The written medical opinion may also include information and 
opinions generated to comply with other OSHA health standards.]
    (10) Medical presumption. For purposes of this paragraph (j) of this 
section, the physician or other licensed health care professional shall 
presume, unless medical evidence indicates to the contrary, that a 
medical condition is unlikely to require medical removal from MC 
exposure if the employee is not exposed to MC above the 8-hour TWA PEL. 
If the physician or other licensed health care professional recommends 
removal for an employee exposed below the 8-hour TWA PEL, the physician 
or other licensed health care professional shall cite specific medical 
evidence, sufficient to rebut the presumption that exposure below the 8-
hour TWA PEL is unlikely to require removal, to support the 
recommendation. If such evidence is cited by the physician or other 
licensed health care professional, the employer must remove the 
employee. If such evidence is not cited by the physician or other 
licensed health care professional, the employer is not required to 
remove the employee.
    (11) Medical Removal Protection (MRP). (i) Temporary medical removal 
and return of an employee.
    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(10) of this section, when a 
medical determination recommends removal because the employee's exposure 
to MC may contribute to or aggravate the employee's existing cardiac, 
hepatic, neurological (including stroke), or skin disease, the employer 
must provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee and 
either:
    (1) Transfer the employee to comparable work where methylene 
chloride exposure is below the action level; or
    (2) Remove the employee from MC exposure.
    (B) If comparable work is not available and the employer is able to 
demonstrate that removal and the costs of extending MRP benefits to an 
additional employee, considering feasibility in relation to the size of 
the employer's business and the other requirements of this standard, 
make further reliance on MRP an inappropriate remedy, the employer may 
retain the additional employee in the existing job until transfer or 
removal becomes appropriate, provided:
    (1) The employer ensures that the employee receives additional 
medical surveillance, including a physical examination at least every 60 
days until transfer or removal occurs; and
    (2) The employer or PLHCP informs the employee of the risk to the 
employee's health from continued MC exposure.
    (C) The employer shall maintain in effect any job-related protective 
measures or limitations, other than removal, for as long as a medical 
determination recommends them to be necessary.
    (ii) End of MRP benefits and return of the employee to former job 
status.
    (A) The employer may cease providing MRP benefits at the earliest of 
the following:
    (1) Six months;
    (2) Return of the employee to the employee's former job status 
following receipt of a medical determination concluding that the 
employee's exposure to MC no longer will aggravate any cardiac, hepatic, 
neurological (including stroke), or dermal disease;
    (3) Receipt of a medical determination concluding that the employee 
can never return to MC exposure.
    (B) For the purposes of this paragraph (j), the requirement that an 
employer return an employee to the employee's former job status is not 
intended to expand upon or restrict any rights an employee has or would 
have had, absent temporary medical removal, to a specific job 
classification or position under the terms of a collective bargaining 
agreement.
    (12) Medical removal protection benefits. (i) For purposes of this 
paragraph (j), the term medical removal protection benefits means that, 
for each removal, an employer must maintain for up to six months the 
earnings, seniority, and other employment rights and benefits of the 
employee as though the employee had not been removed from MC exposure or 
transferred to a comparable job.
    (ii) During the period of time that an employee is removed from 
exposure to MC, the employer may condition the

[[Page 434]]

provision of medical removal protection benefits upon the employee's 
participation in follow-up medical surveillance made available pursuant 
to this section.
    (iii) If a removed employee files a workers' compensation claim for 
a MC-related disability, the employer shall continue the MRP benefits 
required by this paragraph until either the claim is resolved or the 6-
month period for payment f MRP benefits has passed, whichever occurs 
first. To the extent the employee is entitled to indemnity payments for 
earnings lost during the period of removal, the employer's obligation to 
provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee shall be 
reduced by the amount of such indemnity payments.
    (iv) The employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection 
benefits to a removed employee shall be reduced to the extent that the 
employee receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of 
removal from either a publicly or an employer-funded compensation 
program, or receives income from employment with another employer made 
possible by virtue of the employee's removal.
    (13) Voluntary removal or restriction of an employee. Where an 
employer, although not required by this section to do so, removes an 
employee from exposure to MC or otherwise places any limitation on an 
employee due to the effects of MC exposure on the employee's medical 
condition, the employer shall provide medical removal protection 
benefits to the employee equal to those required by paragraph (j)(12) of 
this section.
    (14) Multiple health care professional review mechanism. (i) If the 
employer selects the initial physician or licensed health care 
professional (PLHCP) to conduct any medical examination or consultation 
provided to an employee under this paragraph (j)(11), the employer shall 
notify the employee of the right to seek a second medical opinion each 
time the employer provides the employee with a copy of the written 
opinion of that PLHCP.
    (ii) If the employee does not agree with the opinion of the 
employer-selected PLHCP, notifies the employer of that fact, and takes 
steps to make an appointment with a second PLHCP within 15 days of 
receiving a copy of the written opinion of the initial PLHCP, the 
employer shall pay for the PLHCP chosen by the employee to perform at 
least the following:
    (A) Review any findings, determinations or recommendations of the 
initial PLHCP; and
    (B) Conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory tests 
as the PLHCP deems necessary to facilitate this review.
    (iii) If the findings, determinations or recommendations of the 
second PLHCP differ from those of the initial PLHCP, then the employer 
and the employee shall instruct the two health care professionals to 
resolve the disagreement.
    (iv) If the two health care professionals are unable to resolve 
their disagreement within 15 days, then those two health care 
professionals shall jointly designate a PLHCP who is a specialist in the 
field at issue. The employer shall pay for the specialist to perform at 
least the following:
    (A) Review the findings, determinations, and recommendations of the 
first two PLHCPs; and
    (B) Conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests and 
discussions with the prior PLHCPs as the specialist deems necessary to 
resolve the disagreements of the prior health care professionals.
    (v) The written opinion of the specialist shall be the definitive 
medical determination. The employer shall act consistent with the 
definitive medical determination, unless the employer and employee agree 
that the written opinion of one of the other two PLHCPs shall be the 
definitive medical determination.
    (vi) The employer and the employee or authorized employee 
representative may agree upon the use of any expeditious alternate 
health care professional determination mechanism in lieu of the multiple 
health care professional review mechanism provided by this paragraph so 
long as the alternate mechanism otherwise satisfies the requirements 
contained in this paragraph.

    Appendix A to Section 1910.1052--Substance Safety Data Sheet and 
               Technical Guidelines for Methylene Chloride

                       I. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: Methylene chloride (CH<INF>2</INF> Cl<INF>2</INF>).
    B. Synonyms: MC, Dichloromethane (DCM); Methylene dichloride; 
Methylene bichloride; Methane dichloride; CAS: 75-09-2; NCI-C50102.
    C. Physical data:
    1. Molecular weight: 84.9.
    2. Boiling point (760 mm Hg): 39.8  deg.C (104  deg.F).
    3. Specific gravity (water=1): 1.3.
    4. Vapor density (air=1 at boiling point): 2.9.
    5. Vapor pressure at 20  deg.C (68  deg.F): 350 mm Hg.
    6. Solubility in water, g/100 g water at 20  deg.C (68  deg.F)=1.32.
    7. Appearance and odor: colorless liquid with a chloroform-like 
odor.
    D. Uses:
    MC is used as a solvent, especially where high volatility is 
required. It is a good solvent for oils, fats, waxes, resins, bitumen, 
rubber and cellulose acetate and is a useful paint stripper and 
degreaser. It is used in paint removers, in propellant mixtures for 
aerosol containers, as a solvent for plastics, as a degreasing agent, as 
an extracting agent in the pharmaceutical industry and as a blowing 
agent in polyurethane foams. Its solvent property is sometimes increased 
by mixing with methanol, petroleum naphtha or tetrachloroethylene.
    E. Appearance and odor:
    MC is a clear colorless liquid with a chloroform-like odor. It is 
slightly soluble in water and completely miscible with most organic 
solvents.
    F. Permissible exposure:
    Exposure may not exceed 25 parts MC per million parts of air (25 
ppm) as an eight-hour time-weighted average (8-hour TWA PEL) or 125 
parts of MC per million parts of air (125 ppm) averaged over a 15-minute 
period (STEL).

                         II. Health Hazard Data

    A. MC can affect the body if it is inhaled or if the liquid comes in 
contact with the eyes or skin. It can also affect the body if it is 
swallowed.
    B. Effects of overexposure:
    1. Short-term Exposure:
    MC is an anesthetic. Inhaling the vapor may cause mental confusion, 
light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Continued exposure may 
cause increased light-headedness, staggering, unconsciousness, and even 
death. High vapor concentrations may also cause irritation of the eyes 
and respiratory tract. Exposure to MC may make the symptoms of angina 
(chest pains) worse. Skin exposure to liquid MC may cause irritation. If 
liquid MC remains on the skin, it may cause skin burns. Splashes of the 
liquid into the eyes may cause irritation.
    2. Long-term (chronic) exposure:
    The best evidence that MC causes cancer is from laboratory studies 
in which rats, mice and hamsters inhaled MC 6 hours per day, 5 days per 
week for 2 years. MC exposure produced lung and liver tumors in mice and 
mammary tumors in rats. No carcinogenic effects of MC were found in 
hamsters.
    There are also some human epidemiological studies which show an 
association between occupational exposure to MC and increases in biliary 
(bile duct) cancer and a type of brain cancer. Other epidemiological 
studies have not observed a relationship between MC exposure and cancer. 
OSHA interprets these results to mean that there is suggestive (but not 
absolute) evidence that MC is a human carcinogen.
    C. Reporting signs and symptoms:
    You should inform your employer if you develop any signs or symptoms 
and suspect that they are caused by exposure to MC.
    D. Warning Properties:
    1. Odor Threshold:
    Different authors have reported varying odor thresholds for MC. 
Kirk-Othmer and Sax both reported 25 to 50 ppm; Summer and May both 
reported 150 ppm; Spector reports 320 ppm. Patty, however, states that 
since one can become adapted to the odor, MC should not be considered to 
have adequate warning properties.
    2. Eye Irritation Level:
    Kirk-Othmer reports that ``MC vapor is seriously damaging to the 
eyes.'' Sax agrees with Kirk-Othmer's statement. The ACGIH Documentation 
of TLVs states that irritation of the eyes has been observed in workers 
exposed to concentrations up to 5000 ppm.
    3. Evaluation of Warning Properties:
    Since a wide range of MC odor thresholds are reported (25-320 ppm), 
and human adaptation to the odor occurs, MC is considered to be a 
material with poor warning properties.

[[Page 439]]

                   III. Emergency First Aid Procedures

    In the event of emergency, institute first aid procedures and send 
for first aid or medical assistance.
    A. Eye and Skin Exposures:
    If there is a potential for liquid MC to come in contact with eye or 
skin, face shields and skin protective equipment must be provided and 
used. If liquid MC comes in contact with the eye, get medical attention. 
Contact lenses should not be worn when working with this chemical.
    B. Breathing:
    If a person breathes in large amounts of MC, move the exposed person 
to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, perform cardiopulmorary 
resuscitation. Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Get medical 
attention as soon as possible.
    C. Rescue:
    Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure immediately. If 
the exposed person has been overcome, notify someone else and put into 
effect the established emergency rescue procedures. Understand the 
facility's emergency rescue procedures and know the locations of rescue 
equipment before the need arises. Do not become a casualty yourself.

        IV. Respirators, Protective Clothing, and Eye Protection

    A. Respirators:
    Good industrial hygiene practices recommend that engineering 
controls be used to reduce environmental concentrations to the 
permissible exposure level. However, there are some exceptions where 
respirators may be used to control exposure. Respirators may be used 
when engineering and work practice controls are not feasible, when such 
controls are in the process of being installed, or when these controls 
fail and need to be supplemented. Respirators may also be used for 
operations which require entry into tanks or closed vessels, and in 
emergency situations.
    If the use of respirators is necessary, the only respirators 
permitted are those that have been approved by the Mine Safety and 
Health Administration (MSHA) or the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH). Supplied-air respirators are required because 
air-purifying respirators do not provide adequate respiratory protection 
against MC.
    In addition to respirator selection, a complete written respiratory 
protection program should be instituted which includes regular training, 
maintenance, inspection, cleaning, and evaluation. If you can smell MC 
while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If you 
experience difficulty in breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your 
employer.
    B. Protective Clothing:
    Employees must be provided with and required to use impervious 
clothing, gloves, face shields (eight-inch minimum), and other 
appropriate protective clothing necessary to prevent repeated or 
prolonged skin contact with liquid MC or contact with vessels containing 
liquid MC. Any clothing which becomes wet with liquid MC should be 
removed immediately and not reworn until the employer has ensured that 
the protective clothing is fit for reuse. Contaminated protective 
clothing should be placed in a regulated area designated by the employer 
for removal of MC before the clothing is laundered or disposed of. 
Clothing and equipment should remain in the regulated area until all of 
the MC contamination has evaporated; clothing and equipment should then 
be laundered or disposed of as appropriate.
    C. Eye Protection:
    Employees should be provided with and required to use splash-proof 
safety goggles where liquid MC may contact the eyes.

                 V. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities

    For purposes of complying with 29 CFR 1910.141, the following items 
should be emphasized:
    A. The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanitary 
condition. The employer should institute a leak and spill detection 
program for operations involving liquid MC in order to detect sources of 
fugitive MC emissions.
    B. Emergency drench showers and eyewash facilities are recommended. 
These should be maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing 
agents should also be provided to assure the effective removal of MC 
from the skin.
    C. Because of the hazardous nature of MC, contaminated protective 
clothing should be placed in a regulated area designated by the employer 
for removal of MC before the clothing is laundered or disposed of.

           VI. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling, and Storage

    A. Fire and Explosion Hazards:
    MC has no flash point in a conventional closed tester, but it forms 
flammable vapor-air mixtures at approximately 100  deg.C (212  deg.F), 
or higher. It has a lower explosion limit of 12%, and an upper explosion 
limit of 19% in air. It has an autoignition temperature of 556.1  deg.C 
(1033  deg.F), and a boiling point of 39.8  deg.C (104  deg.F). It is 
heavier than water with a specific gravity of 1.3. It is slightly 
soluble in water.
    B. Reactivity Hazards:
    Conditions contributing to the instability of MC are heat and 
moisture. Contact with strong oxidizers, caustics, and chemically active 
metals such as aluminum or magnesium powder, sodium and potassium may 
cause fires and explosions.

[[Page 440]]

    Special precautions: Liquid MC will attack some forms of plastics, 
rubber, and coatings.
    C. Toxicity:
    Liquid MC is painful and irritating if splashed in the eyes or if 
confined on the skin by gloves, clothing, or shoes. Vapors in high 
concentrations may cause narcosis and death. Prolonged exposure to 
vapors may cause cancer or exacerbate cardiac disease.
    D. Storage:
    Protect against physical damage. Because of its corrosive 
properties, and its high vapor pressure, MC should be stored in plain, 
galvanized or lead lined, mild steel containers in a cool, dry, well 
ventilated area away from direct sunlight, heat source and acute fire 
hazards.
    E. Piping Material:
    All piping and valves at the loading or unloading station should be 
of material that is resistant to MC and should be carefully inspected 
prior to connection to the transport vehicle and periodically during the 
operation.
    F. Usual Shipping Containers:
    Glass bottles, 5- and 55-gallon steel drums, tank cars, and tank 
trucks.
    Note: This section addresses MC exposure in marine terminal and 
longshore employment only where leaking or broken packages allow MC 
exposure that is not addressed through compliance with 29 CFR parts 1917 
and 1918, respectively.
    G. Electrical Equipment:
    Electrical installations in Class I hazardous locations as defined 
in Article 500 of the National Electrical Code, should be installed 
according to Article 501 of the code; and electrical equipment should be 
suitable for use in atmospheres containing MC vapors. See Flammable and 
Combustible Liquids Code (NFPA No. 325M), Chemical Safety Data Sheet SD-
86 (Manufacturing Chemists' Association, Inc.).
    H. Fire Fighting:
    When involved in fire, MC emits highly toxic and irritating fumes 
such as phosgene, hydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide. Wear breathing 
apparatus and use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool. 
Water spray may be used to flush spills away from exposures. 
Extinguishing media are dry chemical, carbon dioxide, foam. For purposes 
of compliance with 29 CFR 1910.307, locations classified as hazardous 
due to the presence of MC shall be Class I.
    I. Spills and Leaks:
    Persons not wearing protective equipment and clothing should be 
restricted from areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been 
completed. If MC has spilled or leaked, the following steps should be 
taken:
    1. Remove all ignition sources.
    2. Ventilate area of spill or leak.
    3. Collect for reclamation or absorb in vermiculite, dry sand, 
earth, or a similar material.
    J. Methods of Waste Disposal:
    Small spills should be absorbed onto sand and taken to a safe area 
for atmospheric evaporation. Incineration is the preferred method for 
disposal of large quantities by mixing with a combustible solvent and 
spraying into an incinerator equipped with acid scrubbers to remove 
hydrogen chloride gases formed. Complete combustion will convert carbon 
monoxide to carbon dioxide. Care should be taken for the presence of 
phosgene.
    K. You should not keep food, beverage, or smoking materials, or eat 
or smoke in regulated areas where MC concentrations are above the 
permissible exposure limits.
    L. Portable heating units should not be used in confined areas where 
MC is used.
    M. Ask your supervisor where MC is used in your work area and for 
any additional plant safety and health rules.

                        VII. Medical Requirements

    Your employer is required to offer you the opportunity to 
participate in a medical surveillance program if you are exposed to MC 
at concentrations at or above the action level (12.5 ppm 8-hour TWA) for 
more than 30 days a year or at concentrations exceeding the PELs (25 ppm 
8-hour TWA or 125 ppm 15-minute STEL) for more than 10 days a year. If 
you are exposed to MC at concentrations over either of the PELs, your 
employer will also be required to have a physician or other licensed 
health care professional ensure that you are able to wear the respirator 
that you are assigned. Your employer must provide all medical 
examinations relating to your MC exposure at a reasonable time and place 
and at no cost to you.

               VIII. Monitoring and Measurement Procedures

    A. Exposure above the Permissible Exposure Limit:
    1. Eight-hour exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the 
purpose of determining employee exposure under this section are best 
taken with consecutive samples covering the full shift. Air samples must 
be taken in the employee's breathing zone.
    2. Monitoring techniques: The sampling and analysis under this 
section may be performed by collection of the MC vapor on two charcoal 
adsorption tubes in series or other composition adsorption tubes, with 
subsequent chemical analysis. Sampling and analysis may also be 
performed by instruments such as real-time continuous monitoring 
systems, portable direct reading instruments, or passive dosimeters as 
long as measurements taken using these methods accurately evaluate the 
concentration of MC in employees'' breathing zones.
    OSHA method 80 is an example of a validated method of sampling and 
analysis of

[[Page 441]]

MC. Copies of this method are available from OSHA or can be downloaded 
from the Internet at http://www.osha.gov. The employer has the 
obligation of selecting a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and 
precision requirements of the standard under his or her unique field 
conditions. The standard requires that the method of monitoring must be 
accurate, to a 95 percent confidence level, to plus or minus 25 percent 
for concentrations of MC at or above 25 ppm, and to plus or minus 35 
percent for concentrations at or below 25 ppm. In addition to OSHA 
method 80, there are numerous other methods available for monitoring for 
MC in the workplace.
    B. Since many of the duties relating to employee exposure are 
dependent on the results of measurement procedures, employers must 
assure that the evaluation of employee exposure is performed by a 
technically qualified person.

                      IX. Observation of Monitoring

    Your employer is required to perform measurements that are 
representative of your exposure to MC and you or your designated 
representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are 
entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to 
record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking 
place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and 
equipment are required to be worn, you or your representative must also 
be provided with, and must wear, protective clothing and equipment.

                        X. Access To Information

    A. Your employer is required to inform you of the information 
contained in this Appendix. In addition, your employer must instruct you 
in the proper work practices for using MC, emergency procedures, and the 
correct use of protective equipment.
    B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being 
exposed to MC. You or your representative has the right to observe 
employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer 
is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer determines 
that you are being over exposed, he or she is required to inform you of 
the actions which are being taken to reduce your exposure to within 
permissible exposure limits.
    C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and 
medical examinations. These records must be kept by the employer for at 
least thirty (30) years.
    D. Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical 
records to you or your representative upon your request.
    E. Your employee is required to provide labels and material safety 
data sheets (MSDS) for all materials, mixtures or solutions composed of 
greater than 0.1 percent MC. An example of a label that would satisfy 
these requirements would be:

       Danger Contains Methylene Chloride Potential Cancer Hazard

    May worsen heart disease because methylene chloride is converted to 
carbon monoxide in the body.
    May cause dizziness, headache, irritation of the throat and lungs, 
loss of consciousness and death at high concentrations (for example, if 
used in a poorly ventilated room).
    Avoid Skin Contact. Contact with liquid causes skin and eye 
irritation.

                   XI. Common Operations and Controls

   Appendix B to Section 1910.105--Medical Surveillance for Methylene 
                                Chloride

                        I. Primary Route of Entry

    Inhalation.

                             II. Toxicology

    Methylene Chloride (MC) is primarily an inhalation hazard. The 
principal acute hazardous effects are the depressant action on the 
central nervous system, possible cardiac toxicity and possible liver 
toxicity. The range of CNS effects are from decreased eye/hand 
coordination and decreased performance in vigilance tasks to narcosis 
and even death of individuals exposed at very high doses. Cardiac 
toxicity is due to the metabolism of MC to carbon monoxide, and the 
effects of carbon monoxide on heart tissue. Carbon monoxide displaces 
oxygen in the blood, decreases the oxygen available to heart tissue, 
increasing the risk of damage to the heart, which may result in heart 
attacks in susceptible individuals. Susceptible individuals include 
persons with heart disease and those with risk factors for heart 
disease.

[[Page 442]]

    Elevated liver enzymes and irritation to the respiratory passages 
and eyes have also been reported for both humans and experimental 
animals exposed to MC vapors.
    MC is metabolized to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide via two 
separate pathways. Through the first pathway, MC is metabolized to 
carbon monoxide as an end-product via the P-450 mixed function oxidase 
pathway located in the microsomal fraction of the cell. This 
biotransformation of MC to carbon monoxide occurs through the process of 
microsomal oxidative dechlorination which takes place primarily in the 
liver. The amount of conversion to carbon monoxide is significant as 
measured by the concentration of carboxyhemoglobin, up to 12% measured 
in the blood following occupational exposure of up to 610 ppm. Through 
the second pathway, MC is metabolized to carbon dioxide as an end 
product (with formaldehyde and formic acid as metabolic intermediates) 
via the glutathione dependent enzyme found in the cytosolic fraction of 
the liver cell. Metabolites along this pathway are believed to be 
associated with the carcinogenic activity of MC.
    MC has been tested for carcinogenicity in several laboratory 
rodents. These rodent studies indicate that there is clear evidence that 
MC is carcinogenic to male and female mice and female rats. Based on 
epidemiologic studies, OSHA has concluded that there is suggestive 
evidence of increased cancer risk in MC-related worker populations. The 
epidemiological evidence is consistent with the finding of excess cancer 
in the experimental animal studies. NIOSH regards MC as a potential 
occupational carcinogen and the International Agency for Research Cancer 
(IARC) classifies MC as an animal carcinogen. OSHA considers MC as a 
suspected human carcinogen.

            III. Medical Signs and Symptoms of Acute Exposure

    Skin exposure to liquid MC may cause irritation or skin burns. 
Liquid MC can also be irritating to the eyes. MC is also absorbed 
through the skin and may contribute to the MC exposure by inhalation.
    At high concentrations in air, MC may cause nausea, vomiting, light-
headedness, numbness of the extremities, changes in blood enzyme levels, 
and breathing problems, leading to bronchitis and pulmonary edema, 
unconsciousness and even death.
    At lower concentrations in air, MC may cause irritation to the skin, 
eye, and respiratory tract and occasionally headache and nausea. Perhaps 
the greatest problem from exposure to low concentrations of MC is the 
CNS effects on coordination and alertness that may cause unsafe 
operations of machinery and equipment, leading to self-injury or 
accidents.
    Low levels and short duration exposures do not seem to produce 
permanent disability, but chronic exposures to MC have been demonstrated 
to produce liver toxicity in animals, and therefore, the evidence is 
suggestive for liver toxicity in humans after chronic exposure.
    Chronic exposure to MC may also cause cancer.

             IV. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations

    As discussed above, MC is classified as a suspect or potential human 
carcinogen. It is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and a skin, 
eye and respiratory tract irritant. At extremely high concentrations, MC 
has caused liver damage in animals.
    MC principally affects the CNS, where it acts as a narcotic. The 
observation of the symptoms characteristic of CNS depression, along with 
a physical examination, provides the best detection of early 
neurological disorders. Since exposure to MC also increases the 
carboxyhemoglobin level in the blood, ambient carbon monoxide levels 
would have an additive effect on that carboxyhemoglobin level. Based on 
such information, a periodic post-shift carboxyhemoglobin test as an 
index of the presence of carbon monoxide in the blood is recommended, 
but not required, for medical surveillance.
    Based on the animal evidence and three epidemiologic studies 
previously mentioned, OSHA concludes that MC is a suspect human 
carcinogen. The medical surveillance program is designed to observe 
exposed workers on a regular basis. While the medical surveillance 
program cannot detect MC-induced cancer at a preneoplastic stage, OSHA 
anticipates that, as in the past, early detection and treatments of 
cancers leading to enhanced survival rates will continue to evolve.
    A. Medical and Occupational History:
    The medical and occupational work history plays an important role in 
the initial evaluation of workers exposed to MC. It is therefore 
extremely important for the examining physician or other licensed health 
care professional to evaluate the MC-exposed worker carefully and 
completely and to focus the examination on MC's potentially associated 
health hazards. The medical evaluation must include an annual detailed 
work and medical history with special emphasis on cardiac history and 
neurological symptoms.
    An important goal of the medical history is to elicit information 
from the worker regarding potential signs or symptoms associated with 
increased levels of carboxyhemoglobin due to the presence of carbon 
monoxide in the blood. Physicians or other licensed health care 
professionals should ensure that the smoking history of

[[Page 443]]

all MC exposed employees is known. Exposure to MC may cause a 
significant increase in carboxyhemoglobin level in all exposed persons. 
However, smokers as well as workers with anemia or heart disease and 
those concurrently exposed to carbon monoxide are at especially high 
risk of toxic effects because of an already reduced oxygen carrying 
capacity of the blood.
    A comprehensive or interim medical and work history should also 
include occurrence of headache, dizziness, fatigue, chest pain, 
shortness of breath, pain in the limbs, and irritation of the skin and 
eyes.
    In addition, it is important for the physician or other licensed 
health care professional to become familiar with the operating 
conditions in which exposure to MC is likely to occur. The physician or 
other licensed health care professional also must become familiar with 
the signs and symptoms that may indicate that a worker is receiving 
otherwise unrecognized and exceptionally high exposure levels of MC.
    An example of a medical and work history that would satisfy the 
requirement for a comprehensive or interim work history is represented 
by the following:
    The following is a list of recommended questions and issues for the 
self-administered questionnaire for methylene chloride exposure.

                         B. Physical Examination

    The complete physical examination, when coupled with the medical and 
occupational history, assists the physician or other licensed health 
care professional in detecting pre-existing conditions that might place 
the employee at increased risk, and establishes a baseline for future 
health monitoring. These examinations should include:
    1. Clinical impressions of the nervous system, cardiovascular 
function and pulmonary function, with additional tests conducted where 
indicated or determined by the examining physician or other licensed 
health care professional to be necessary.
    2. An evaluation of the advisability of the worker using a 
respirator, because the use of certain respirators places an additional 
burden on the cardiopulmonary system. It is necessary for the attending 
physician or other licensed health care professional to evaluate the 
cardiopulmonary function of these workers, in order to inform the 
employer in a written medical opinion of the worker's ability or fitness 
to work in an area requiring the use of certain types of respiratory 
protective equipment. The presence of facial hair or scars that might 
interfere with the worker's ability to wear certain types of respirators 
should also be noted during the examination and in the written medical 
opinion.
    Because of the importance of lung function to workers required to 
wear certain types of respirators to protect themselves from MC 
exposure, these workers must receive an assessment of pulmonary function 
before they begin to wear a negative pressure respirator and at least 
annually thereafter. The recommended pulmonary function tests include 
measurement of the employee's forced vital capacity (FVC), forced 
expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), as well as calculation of the 
ratios of FEV1 to FVC, and the ratios of measured FVC and measured FEV1 
to expected respective values corrected for variation due to age, sex, 
race, and height. Pulmonary function evaluation must be conducted by a 
physician or other licensed health care professional experienced in 
pulmonary function tests.
    The following is a summary of the elements of a physical exam which 
would fulfill the requirements under the MC standard:

3. Post-shift carboxyhemoglobin

                               IX. Studies

1. Pulmonary function testing
2. Electrocardiogram

    An evaluation of the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood of 
employees (for example by measured red blood cell volume) is considered 
useful, especially for workers acutely exposed to MC.
    It is also recommended, but not required, that end of shift 
carboxyhemoglobin levels be determined periodically, and any level above 
3% for non-smokers and above 10% for smokers should prompt an 
investigation of the worker and his workplace. This test is recommended 
because MC is metabolized to CO, which combines strongly with 
hemoglobin, resulting in a reduced capacity of the blood to transport 
oxygen in the body. This is of particular concern for cigarette smokers 
because they already have a diminished hemoglobin capacity due to the 
presence of CO in cigarette smoke.

                C. Additional Examinations and Referrals

1. Examination by a Specialist

    When a worker examination reveals unexplained symptoms or signs 
(i.e. in the physical examination or in the laboratory tests), follow-up 
medical examinations are necessary to assure that MC exposure is not 
adversely affecting the worker's health. When the examining physician or 
other licensed health care professional finds it necessary, additional 
tests should be included to determine the nature of the medical problem 
and the underlying cause. Where relevant, the worker should be sent to a 
specialist for further testing and treatment as deemed necessary.
    The final rule requires additional investigations to be covered and 
it also permits physicians or other licensed health care professionals 
to add appropriate or necessary tests to improve the diagnosis of 
disease should such tests become available in the future.

2. Emergencies

    The examination of workers exposed to MC in an emergency should be 
directed at the organ systems most likely to be affected. If the worker 
has received a severe acute exposure, hospitalization may be required to 
assure proper medical intervention. It is not possible to precisely 
define ``severe,'' but the physician or other licensed health care 
professional's judgement should not merely rest on hospitalization. If 
the worker has suffered significant conjunctival, oral, or nasal 
irritation, respiratory distress, or discomfort, the physician or other 
licensed health care professional should instigate appropriate follow-up 
procedures. These include attention to the eyes, lungs and the 
neurological system. The frequency of follow-up examinations should be 
determined by the attending physician or other licensed health care 
professional. This testing permits the early identification essential to 
proper medical management of such workers.

                         D. Employer Obligations

    The employer is required to provide the responsible physician or 
other licensed health care professional and any specialists involved in 
a diagnosis with the following information: a copy of the MC standard 
including relevant appendices, a description of the affected employee's 
duties as they relate to his or her exposure to MC; an estimate of the 
employee's exposure including duration (e.g., 15hr/wk, three 8-hour 
shifts/wk, full time); a description of any personal protective 
equipment used by the employee, including respirators; and the results 
of any previous medical determinations for the affected employee related 
to MC exposure to the extent that this information is within the 
employer's control.

[[Page 446]]

 E. Physicians' or Other Licensed Health Care Professionals' Obligations

    The standard requires the employer to ensure that the physician or 
other licensed health care professional provides a written statement to 
the employee and the employer. This statement should contain the 
physician's or licensed health care professional's opinion as to whether 
the employee has any medical condition placing him or her at increased 
risk of impaired health from exposure to MC or use of respirators, as 
appropriate. The physician or other licensed health care professional 
should also state his or her opinion regarding any restrictions that 
should be placed on the employee's exposure to MC or upon the use of 
protective clothing or equipment such as respirators. If the employee 
wears a respirator as a result of his or her exposure to MC, the 
physician or other licensed health care professional's opinion should 
also contain a statement regarding the suitability of the employee to 
wear the type of respirator assigned. Furthermore, the employee should 
be informed by the physician or other licensed health care professional 
about the cancer risk of MC and about risk factors for heart disease, 
and the potential for exacerbation of underlying heart disease by 
exposure to MC through its metabolism to carbon monoxide. Finally, the 
physician or other licensed health care professional should inform the 
employer that the employee has been told the results of the medical 
examination and of any medical conditions which require further 
explanation or treatment. This written opinion must not contain any 
information on specific findings or diagnosis unrelated to employee's 
occupational exposures.
    The purpose in requiring the examining physician or other licensed 
health care professional to supply the employer with a written opinion 
is to provide the employer with a medical basis to assist the employer 
in placing employees initially, in assuring that their health is not 
being impaired by exposure to MC, and to assess the employee's ability 
to use any required protective equipment.

Sec. 1910.1096  Ionizing radiation.

    (a) Definitions applicable to this section. (1) Radiation includes 
alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, X-rays, neutrons, high-speed 
electrons, high-speed protons, and other atomic particles; but such term 
does not include sound or radio waves, or visible light, or infrared or 
ultraviolet light.
    (2) Radioactive material means any material which emits, by 
spontaneous nuclear disintegration, corpuscular or electromagnetic 
emanations.
    (3) Restricted area means any area access to which is controlled by 
the employer for purposes of protection of individuals from exposure to 
radiation or radioactive materials.
    (4) Unrestricted area means any area access to which is not 
controlled by the employer for purposes of protection of individuals 
from exposure to radiation or radioactive materials.
    (5) Dose means the quantity of ionizing radiation absorbed, per unit 
of mass, by the body or by any portion of the body. When the provisions 
in this section specify a dose during a period of time, the dose is the 
total quantity of radiation absorbed, per unit of mass, by the body or 
by any portion of the body during such period of time. Several different 
units of dose are in current use. Definitions of units used in this 
section are set forth in paragraphs (a) (6) and (7) of this section.
    (6) Rad means a measure of the dose of any ionizing radiation to 
body tissues in terms of the energy absorbed per unit of mass of the 
tissue. One rad is the dose corresponding to the absorption of 100 ergs 
per gram of tissue (1 millirad (mrad)=0.001 rad).
    (7) Rem means a measure of the dose of any ionizing radiation to 
body tissue in terms of its estimated biological effect relative to a 
dose of 1 roentgen (r) of X-rays (1 millirem (mrem)=0.001 rem). The 
relation of the rem to other dose units depends upon the biological 
effect under consideration and upon the conditions for irradiation. Each 
of the following is considered to be equivalent to a dose of 1 rem:
    (i) A dose of 1 roentgen due to X- or gamma radiation;
    (ii) A dose of 1 rad due to X-, gamma, or beta radiation;
    (iii) A dose of 0.1 rad due to neutrons or high energy protons;
    (iv) A dose of 0.05 rad due to particles heavier than protons and 
with sufficient energy to reach the lens of the eye;
    (v) If it is more convenient to measure the neutron flux, or 
equivalent, than to determine the neutron dose in rads, as provided in 
paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, 1 rem of neutron radiation may, 
for purposes of the provisions in this section be assumed to be 
equivalent to 14 million neutrons per square centimeter incident upon 
the body; or, if there is sufficient information to estimate with 
reasonable accuracy the approximate distribution in energy of the 
neutrons, the incident number of neutrons per square centimeter 
equivalent to 1 rem may be estimated from Table G-17:

    (8) For determining exposures to X- or gamma rays up to 3 Mev., the 
dose limits specified in this section may be assumed to be equivalent to 
the ``air dose''. For the purpose of this section air dose means that 
the dose is measured by a properly calibrated appropriate instrument in 
air at or near the body surface in the region of the highest dosage 
rate.
    (b) Exposure of individuals to radiation in restricted areas. (1) 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no employer 
shall possess, use, or transfer sources of ionizing radiation in such a 
manner as to cause any individual in a restricted area to receive in

[[Page 454]]

any period of one calendar quarter from sources in the employer's 
possession or control a dose in excess of the limits specified in Table 
G-18:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) An employer may permit an individual in a restricted area to 
receive doses to the whole body greater than those permitted under 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, so long as:
    (i) During any calendar quarter the dose to the whole body shall not 
exceed 3 rems; and
    (ii) The dose to the whole body, when added to the accumulated 
occupational dose to the whole body, shall not exceed 5 (N-18) rems, 
where ``N'' equals the individual's age in years at his last birthday; 
and
    (iii) The employer maintains adequate past and current exposure 
records which show that the addition of such a dose will not cause the 
individual to exceed the amount authorized in this subparagraph. As used 
in this subparagraph Dose to the whole body shall be deemed to include 
any dose to the whole body, gonad, active bloodforming organs, head and 
trunk, or lens of the eye.
    (3) No employer shall permit any employee who is under 18 years of 
age to receive in any period of one calendar quarter a dose in excess of 
10 percent of the limits specified in Table G-18.
    (4) Calendar quarter means any 3-month period determined as follows:
    (i) The first period of any year may begin on any date in January: 
Provided, That the second, third, and fourth periods accordingly begin 
on the same date in April, July, and October, respectively, and that the 
fourth period extends into January of the succeeding year, if necessary 
to complete a 3-month quarter. During the first year of use of this 
method of determination, the first period for that year shall also 
include any additional days in January preceding the starting date for 
the first period; or
    (ii) The first period in a calendar year of 13 complete, consecutive 
calendar weeks; the second period in a calendar year of 13 complete, 
consecutive weeks; the third period in a calendar year of 13 complete, 
consecutive calendar weeks; the fourth period in a calendar year of 13 
complete, consecutive calendar weeks. If at the end of a calendar year 
there are any days not falling within a complete calendar week of that 
year, such days shall be included within the last complete calendar week 
of that year. If at the beginning of any calendar year there are days 
not falling within a complete calendar week of that year, such days 
shall be included within the last complete calendar week of the previous 
year; or
    (iii) The four periods in a calendar year may consist of the first 
14 complete, consecutive calendar weeks; the next 12 complete, 
consecutive calendar weeks, the next 14 complete, consecutive calendar 
weeks, and the last 12 complete, consecutive calendar weeks. If at the 
end of a calendar year there are any days not falling within a complete 
calendar week of that year, such days shall be included (for purposes of 
this section) within the last complete calendar week of the year. If at 
the beginning of any calendar year there are days not falling within a 
complete calendar week of that year, such days shall be included (for 
purposes of this section) within the last complete week of the previous 
year.
    (c) Exposure to airborne radioactive material. (1) No employer shall 
possess, use or transport radioactive material in such a manner as to 
cause any employee, within a restricted area, to be exposed to airborne 
radioactive material in an average concentration in excess of the limits 
specified in Table 1 of appendix B to 10 CFR part 20. The limits given 
in Table 1 are for exposure to the concentrations specified for 40 hours 
in any workweek of 7 consecutive days. In any such period where the 
number of hours of exposure is less than 40, the limits specified in the 
table may be increased proportionately. In any such period where the 
number of hours of exposure is greater than 40, the limits specified in 
the table shall be decreased proportionately.

[[Page 455]]

    (2) No employer shall possess, use, or transfer radioactive material 
in such a manner as to cause any individual within a restricted area, 
who is under 18 years of age, to be exposed to airborne radioactive 
material in an average concentration in excess of the limits specified 
in Table II of appendix B to 10 CFR part 20. For purposes of this 
paragraph, concentrations may be averaged over periods not greater than 
1 week.
    (3) Exposed as used in this paragraph means that the individual is 
present in an airborne concentration. No allowance shall be made for the 
use of protective clothing or equipment, or particle size.
    (d) Precautionary procedures and personal monitoring. (1) Every 
employer shall make such surveys as may be necessary for him to comply 
with the provisions in this section. Survey means an evaluation of the 
radiation hazards incident to the production, use, release, disposal, or 
presence of radioactive materials or other sources of radiation under a 
specific set of conditions. When appropriate, such evaluation includes a 
physical survey of the location of materials and equipment, and 
measurements of levels of radiation or concentrations of radioactive 
material present.
    (2) Every employer shall supply appropriate personnel monitoring 
equipment, such as film badges, pocket chambers, pocket dosimeters, or 
film rings, and shall require the use of such equipment by:
    (i) Each employee who enters a restricted area under such 
circumstances that he receives, or is likely to receive, a dose in any 
calendar quarter in excess of 25 percent of the applicable value 
specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (ii) Each employee under 18 years of age who enters a restricted 
area under such circumstances that he receives, or is likely to receive, 
a dose in any calendar quarter in excess of 5 percent of the applicable 
value specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (iii) Each employee who enters a high radiation area.
    (3) As used in this section:
    (i) Personnel monitoring equipment means devices designed to be worn 
or carried by an individual for the purpose of measuring the dose 
received (e.g., film badges, pocket chambers, pocket dosimeters, film 
rings, etc.);
    (ii) Radiation area means any area, accessible to personnel, in 
which there exists radiation at such levels that a major portion of the 
body could receive in any 1 hour a dose in excess of 5 millirem, or in 
any 5 consecutive days a dose in excess of 100 millirem; and
    (iii) High radiation area means any area, accessible to personnel, 
in which there exists radiation at such levels that a major portion of 
the body could receive in any one hour a dose in excess of 100 millirem.
    (e) Caution signs, labels, and signals--(1) General. (i) Symbols 
prescribed by this paragraph shall use the conventional radiation 
caution colors (magenta or purple on yellow background). The symbol 
prescribed by this paragraph is the conventional three-bladed design:

    (ii) Each high radiation area shall be equipped with a control 
device which shall either cause the level of radiation to be reduced 
below that at which an individual might receive a dose of 100 millirems 
in 1 hour upon entry into the area or shall energize a conspicuous 
visible or audible alarm signal in such a manner that the individual 
entering and the employer or a supervisor of the activity are made aware 
of the entry. In the case of a high radiation area established for a 
period of 30 days or less, such control device is not required.
    (4) Airborne radioactivity area. (i) As used in the provisions of 
this section, airborne radioactivity area means:

modulated at a subsonic frequency. The complex sound wave in free space 
shall have a fundamental frequency (f<INF>1</INF>) between 450 and 500 
hertz (Hz) modulated at a subsonic rate between 4 and 5 hertz.
    (ii) The signal generator shall not be less than 75 decibels at 
every location where an individual may be present whose immediate, 
rapid, and complete evacuation is essential.
    (iii) A sufficient number of signal units shall be installed such 
that the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section are met at 
every location where an individual may be present whose immediate, 
rapid, and complete evacuation is essential.
    (iv) The signal shall be unique in the plant or facility in which it 
is installed.
    (v) The minimum duration of the signal shall be sufficient to insure 
that all affected persons hear the signal.
    (vi) The signal-generating system shall respond automatically to an 
initiating event without requiring any human action to sound the signal.
    (2) Design objectives. (i) The signal-generating system shall be 
designed to incorporate components which enable the system to produce 
the desired signal each time it is activated within one-half second of 
activation.
    (ii) The signal-generating system shall be provided with an 
automatically activated secondary power supply which is adequate to 
simultaneously power all emergency equipment to which it is connected, 
if operation during power failure is necessary, except in those systems 
using batteries as the primary source of power.
    (iii) All components of the signal-generating system shall be 
located to provide maximum practicable protection against damage in case 
of fire, explosion, corrosive atmosphere, or other environmental 
extremes consistent with adequate system performance.
    (iv) The signal-generating system shall be designed with the minimum 
number of components necessary to make it function as intended, and 
should utilize components which do not require frequent servicing such 
as lubrication or cleaning.
    (v) Where several activating devices feed activating information to 
a central signal generator, failure of any activating device shall not 
render the signal-generator system inoperable to activating information 
from the remaining devices.
    (vi) The signal-generating system shall be designed to enhance the 
probability that alarm occurs only when immediate evacuation is 
warranted. The number of false alarms shall not be so great that the 
signal will come to be disregarded and shall be low enough to minimize 
personal injuries or excessive property damage that might result from 
such evacuation.
    (3) Testing. (i) Initial tests, inspections, and checks of the 
signal-generating system shall be made to verify that the fabrication 
and installation were made in accordance with design plans and 
specifications and to develop a thorough knowledge of the performance of 
the system and all components under normal and hostile conditions.
    (ii) Once the system has been placed in service, periodic tests, 
inspections, and checks shall be made to minimize the possibility of 
malfunction.
    (iii) Following significant alterations or revisions to the system, 
tests and checks similar to the initial installation tests shall be 
made.
    (iv) Tests shall be designed to minimize hazards while conducting 
the tests.
    (v) Prior to normal operation the signal-generating system shall be 
checked physically and functionally to assure reliability and to 
demonstrate accuracy and performance. Specific tests shall include:
    (a) All power sources.
    (b) Calibration and calibration stability.
    (c) Trip levels and stability.

such as AC or DC power, air pressure, etc.
    (e) All indicators.
    (f) Trouble indicator circuits and signals, where used.
    (g) Air pressure (if used)
    (h) Determine that sound level of the signal is within the limit of 
paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section at all points that require 
immediate evacuation.
    (vi) In addition to the initial startup and operating tests, 
periodic scheduled performance tests and status checks must be made to 
insure that the system is at all times operating within design limits 
and capable of the required response. Specific periodic tests or checks 
or both shall include:
    (a) Adequacy of signal activation device.
    (b) All power sources.
    (c) Function of all alarm circuits and trouble indicator circuits 
including trip levels.

Sec. 1910.1200  Hazard communication.

    (a) Purpose. (1) The purpose of this section is to ensure that the 
hazards of all chemicals produced or imported are evaluated, and that 
information concerning their hazards is transmitted to employers and 
employees. This transmittal of information is to be accomplished by 
means of comprehensive hazard communication programs, which are to 
include container labeling and other forms of warning, material safety 
data sheets and employee training.
    (2) This occupational safety and health standard is intended to 
address comprehensively the issue of evaluating the potential hazards of 
chemicals, and communicating information concerning hazards and 
appropriate protective measures to employees, and to preempt any legal 
requirements of a state, or political subdivision of a state, pertaining 
to this subject. Evaluating the potential hazards of chemicals, and 
communicating information concerning hazards and appropriate protective 
measures to employees, may include, for example, but is not limited to, 
provisions for: developing and maintaining a written hazard 
communication program for the workplace, including lists of hazardous 
chemicals present; labeling of containers of chemicals in the workplace, 
as well as of containers of chemicals being shipped to other workplaces; 
preparation and distribution of material safety data sheets to employees 
and downstream employers; and development and implementation of employee 
training programs regarding hazards of chemicals and protective 
measures. Under section 18 of the Act, no state or political subdivision 
of a state may adopt or enforce, through any court or agency, any 
requirement relating to the issue addressed by this Federal standard, 
except pursuant to a Federally-approved state plan.
    (b) Scope and application. (1) This section requires chemical 
manufacturers or importers to assess the hazards of chemicals which they 
produce or import, and all employers to provide information to their 
employees about the hazardous chemicals to which they are exposed, by 
means of a hazard communication program, labels and other forms of 
warning, material safety data sheets, and information and training. In 
addition, this section requires distributors to transmit the required 
information to employers. (Employers who do not produce or import 
chemicals need only focus on those parts of this rule that deal with 
establishing a workplace program and communicating information to their 
workers. Appendix E of this section is a general guide for such 
employers to help them determine their compliance obligations under the 
rule.)
    (2) This section applies to any chemical which is known to be 
present in the workplace in such a manner that employees may be exposed 
under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.
    (3) This section applies to laboratories only as follows:
    (i) Employers shall ensure that labels on incoming containers of 
hazardous chemicals are not removed or defaced;
    (ii) Employers shall maintain any material safety data sheets that 
are received with incoming shipments of hazardous chemicals, and ensure 
that they are readily accessible during each workshift to laboratory 
employees when they are in their work areas;

[[Page 462]]

    (iii) Employers shall ensure that laboratory employees are provided 
information and training in accordance with paragraph (h) of this 
section, except for the location and availability of the written hazard 
communication program under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section; and,
    (iv) Laboratory employers that ship hazardous chemicals are 
considered to be either a chemical manufacturer or a distributor under 
this rule, and thus must ensure that any containers of hazardous 
chemicals leaving the laboratory are labeled in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and that a material safety data sheet 
is provided to distributors and other employers in accordance with 
paragraphs (g)(6) and (g)(7) of this section.
    (4) In work operations where employees only handle chemicals in 
sealed containers which are not opened under normal conditions of use 
(such as are found in marine cargo handling, warehousing, or retail 
sales), this section applies to these operations only as follows:
    (i) Employers shall ensure that labels on incoming containers of 
hazardous chemicals are not removed or defaced;
    (ii) Employers shall maintain copies of any material safety data 
sheets that are received with incoming shipments of the sealed 
containers of hazardous chemicals, shall obtain a material safety data 
sheet as soon as possible for sealed containers of hazardous chemicals 
received without a material safety data sheet if an employee requests 
the material safety data sheet, and shall ensure that the material 
safety data sheets are readily accessible during each work shift to 
employees when they are in their work area(s); and,
    (iii) Employers shall ensure that employees are provided with 
information and training in accordance with paragraph (h) of this 
section (except for the location and availability of the written hazard 
communication program under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section), to 
the extent necessary to protect them in the event of a spill or leak of 
a hazardous chemical from a sealed container.
    (5) This section does not require labeling of the following 
chemicals:
    (i) Any pesticide as such term is defined in the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.), when

(21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act of 1913 (21 U.S.C. 
151 et seq.), and regulations issued under those Acts, when they are 
subject to the labeling requirements under those Acts by either the Food 
and Drug Administration or the Department of Agriculture;
    (iv) Any distilled spirits (beverage alcohols), wine, or malt 
beverage intended for nonindustrial use, as such terms are defined in 
the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and 
regulations issued under that Act, when subject to the labeling 
requirements of that Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act 
by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms;
    (v) Any consumer product or hazardous substance as those terms are 
defined in the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.) and

Appendix A provides further definitions and explanations of the scope of 
health hazards covered by this section, and Appendix B describes the 
criteria to be used to determine whether or not a chemical is to be 
considered hazardous for purposes of this standard.
    Identity means any chemical or common name which is indicated on the 
material safety data sheet (MSDS) for the chemical. The identity used 
shall permit cross-references to be made among the required list of 
hazardous chemicals, the label and the MSDS.
    Immediate use means that the hazardous chemical will be under the 
control of and used only by the person who transfers it from a labeled 
container and only within the work shift in which it is transferred.
    Importer means the first business with employees within the Customs 
Territory of the United States which receives hazardous chemicals 
produced in other countries for the purpose of supplying them to 
distributors or employers within the United States.
    Label means any written, printed, or graphic material displayed on 
or affixed to containers of hazardous chemicals.
    Material safety data sheet (MSDS) means written or printed material 
concerning a hazardous chemical which is prepared in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    Mixture means any combination of two or more chemicals if the 
combination is not, in whole or in part, the result of a chemical 
reaction.

[[Page 466]]

    Organic peroxide means an organic compound that contains the 
bivalent -O-O-structure and which may be considered to be a structural 
derivative of hydrogen peroxide where one or both of the hydrogen atoms 
has been replaced by an organic radical.
    Oxidizer means a chemical other than a blasting agent or explosive 
as defined in Sec. 1910.109(a), that initiates or promotes combustion in 
other materials, thereby causing fire either of itself or through the 
release of oxygen or other gases.
    Physical hazard means a chemical for which there is scientifically 
valid evidence that it is a combustible liquid, a compressed gas, 
explosive, flammable, an organic peroxide, an oxidizer, pyrophoric, 
unstable (reactive) or water-reactive.
    Produce means to manufacture, process, formulate, blend, extract, 
generate, emit, or repackage.
    Pyrophoric means a chemical that will ignite spontaneously in air at 
a temperature of 130  deg.F (54.4  deg.C) or below.
    Responsible party means someone who can provide additional 
information on the hazardous chemical and appropriate emergency 
procedures, if necessary.
    Specific chemical identity means the chemical name, Chemical 
Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number, or any other information that 
reveals the precise chemical designation of the substance.
    Trade secret means any confidential formula, pattern, process, 
device, information or compilation of information that is used in an 
employer's business, and that gives the employer an opportunity to 
obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Appendix 
D sets out the criteria to be used in evaluating trade secrets.
    Unstable (reactive) means a chemical which in the pure state, or as 
produced or transported, will vigorously polymerize, decompose, 
condense, or will become self-reactive under conditions of shocks, 
pressure or temperature.
    Use means to package, handle, react, emit, extract, generate as a 
byproduct, or transfer.
    Water-reactive means a chemical that reacts with water to release a 
gas that is either flammable or presents a health hazard.
    Work area means a room or defined space in a workplace where 
hazardous chemicals are produced or used, and where employees are 
present.
    Workplace means an establishment, job site, or project, at one 
geographical location containing one or more work areas.
    (d) Hazard determination. (1) Chemical manufacturers and importers 
shall evaluate chemicals produced in their workplaces or imported by 
them to determine if they are hazardous. Employers are not required to 
evaluate chemicals unless they choose not to rely on the evaluation 
performed by the chemical manufacturer or importer for the chemical to 
satisfy this requirement.
    (2) Chemical manufacturers, importers or employers evaluating 
chemicals shall identify and consider the available scientific evidence 
concerning such hazards. For health hazards, evidence which is 
statistically significant and which is based on at least one positive 
study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles is 
considered to be sufficient to establish a hazardous effect if the 
results of the study meet the definitions of health hazards in this 
section. Appendix A shall be consulted for the scope of health hazards 
covered, and Appendix B shall be consulted for the criteria to be 
followed with respect to the completeness of the evaluation, and the 
data to be reported.
    (3) The chemical manufacturer, importer or employer evaluating 
chemicals shall treat the following sources as establishing that the 
chemicals listed in them are hazardous:
    (i) 29 CFR part 1910, subpart Z, Toxic and Hazardous Substances, 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); or,
    (ii) Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical 
Agents in the Work Environment, American Conference of Governmental 
Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) (latest edition). The chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or employer is still responsible for evaluating 
the hazards associated with the chemicals in these source lists in 
accordance with the requirements of this standard.

[[Page 467]]

    (4) Chemical manufacturers, importers and employers evaluating 
chemicals shall treat the following sources as establishing that a 
chemical is a carcinogen or potential carcinogen for hazard 
communication purposes:
    (i) National Toxicology Program (NTP), Annual Report on Carcinogens 
(latest edition);
    (ii) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs 
(latest editions); or
    (iii) 29 CFR part 1910, subpart Z, Toxic and Hazardous Substances, 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
    Note: The Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances published 
by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health indicates 
whether a chemical has been found by NTP or IARC to be a potential 
carcinogen.
    (5) The chemical manufacturer, importer or employer shall determine 
the hazards of mixtures of chemicals as follows:
    (i) If a mixture has been tested as a whole to determine its 
hazards, the results of such testing shall be used to determine whether 
the mixture is hazardous;
    (ii) If a mixture has not been tested as a whole to determine 
whether the mixture is a health hazard, the mixture shall be assumed to 
present the same health hazards as do the components which comprise one 
percent (by weight or volume) or greater of the mixture, except that the 
mixture shall be assumed to present a carcinogenic hazard if it contains 
a component in concentrations of 0.1 percent or greater which is 
considered to be a carcinogen under paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
    (iii) If a mixture has not been tested as a whole to determine 
whether the mixture is a physical hazard, the chemical manufacturer, 
importer, or employer may use whatever scientifically valid data is 
available to evaluate the physical hazard potential of the mixture; and,
    (iv) If the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer has 
evidence to indicate that a component present in the mixture in 
concentrations of less than one percent (or in the case of carcinogens, 
less than 0.1 percent) could be released in concentrations which would 
exceed an established OSHA permissible exposure limit or ACGIH Threshold 
Limit Value, or could present a health risk to employees in those 
concentrations, the mixture shall be assumed to present the same hazard.
    (6) Chemical manufacturers, importers, or employers evaluating 
chemicals shall describe in writing the procedures they use to determine 
the hazards of the chemical they evaluate. The written procedures are to 
be made available, upon request, to employees, their designated 
representatives, the Assistant Secretary and the Director. The written 
description may be incorporated into the written hazard communication 
program required under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Written hazard communication program. (1) Employers shall 
develop, implement, and maintain at each workplace, a written hazard 
communication program which at least describes how the criteria 
specified in paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section for labels and 
other forms of warning, material safety data sheets, and employee 
information and training will be met, and which also includes the 
following:
    (i) A list of the hazardous chemicals known to be present using an 
identity that is referenced on the appropriate material safety data 
sheet (the list may be compiled for the workplace as a whole or for 
individual work areas); and,
    (ii) The methods the employer will use to inform employees of the 
hazards of non-routine tasks (for example, the cleaning of reactor 
vessels), and the hazards associated with chemicals contained in 
unlabeled pipes in their work areas.
    (2) Multi-employer workplaces. Employers who produce, use, or store 
hazardous chemicals at a workplace in such a way that the employees of 
other employer(s) may be exposed (for example, employees of a 
construction contractor working on-site) shall additionally ensure that 
the hazard communication programs developed and implemented under this 
paragraph (e) include the following:
    (i) The methods the employer will use to provide the other 
employer(s) on-site access to material safety data sheets for each 
hazardous chemical the

[[Page 468]]

other employer(s)' employees may be exposed to while working;
    (ii) The methods the employer will use to inform the other 
employer(s) of any precautionary measures that need to be taken to 
protect employees during the workplace's normal operating conditions and 
in foreseeable emergencies; and,
    (iii) The methods the employer will use to inform the other 
employer(s) of the labeling system used in the workplace.
    (3) The employer may rely on an existing hazard communication 
program to comply with these requirements, provided that it meets the 
criteria established in this paragraph (e).
    (4) The employer shall make the written hazard communication program 
available, upon request, to employees, their designated representatives, 
the Assistant Secretary and the Director, in accordance with the 
requirements of 29 CFR 1910.20 (e).
    (5) Where employees must travel between workplaces during a 
workshift, i.e., their work is carried out at more than one geographical 
location, the written hazard communication program may be kept at the 
primary workplace facility.
    (f) Labels and other forms of warning. (1) The chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or distributor shall ensure that each container 
of hazardous chemicals leaving the workplace is labeled, tagged or 
marked with the following information:
    (i) Identity of the hazardous chemical(s);
    (ii) Appropriate hazard warnings; and
    (iii) Name and address of the chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
other responsible party.
    (2)(i) For solid metal (such as a steel beam or a metal casting), 
solid wood, or plastic items that are not exempted as articles due to 
their downstream use, or shipments of whole grain, the required label 
may be transmitted to the customer at the time of the initial shipment, 
and need not be included with subsequent shipments to the same employer 
unless the information on the label changes;
    (ii) The label may be transmitted with the initial shipment itself, 
or with the material safety data sheet that is to be provided prior to 
or at the time of the first shipment; and,
    (iii) This exception to requiring labels on every container of 
hazardous chemicals is only for the solid material itself, and does not 
apply to hazardous chemicals used in conjunction with, or known to be 
present with, the material and to which employees handling the items in 
transit may be exposed (for example, cutting fluids or pesticides in 
grains).
    (3) Chemical manufacturers, importers, or distributors shall ensure 
that each container of hazardous chemicals leaving the workplace is 
labeled, tagged, or marked in accordance with this section in a manner 
which does not conflict with the requirements of the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) and regulations issued under 
that Act by the Department of Transportation.
    (4) If the hazardous chemical is regulated by OSHA in a substance-
specific health standard, the chemical manufacturer, importer, 
distributor or employer shall ensure that the labels or other forms of 
warning used are in accordance with the requirements of that standard.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(6) and (f)(7) of this 
section, the employer shall ensure that each container of hazardous 
chemicals in the workplace is labeled, tagged or marked with the 
following information:
    (i) Identity of the hazardous chemical(s) contained therein; and,
    (ii) Appropriate hazard warnings, or alternatively, words, pictures, 
symbols, or combination thereof, which provide at least general 
information regarding the hazards of the chemicals, and which, in 
conjunction with the other information immediately available to 
employees under the hazard communication program, will provide employees 
with the specific information regarding the physical and health hazards 
of the hazardous chemical.
    (6) The employer may use signs, placards, process sheets, batch 
tickets, operating procedures, or other such written materials in lieu 
of affixing labels to individual stationary process containers, as long 
as the alternative method identifies the containers to which it is 
applicable and conveys the

[[Page 469]]

information required by paragraph (f)(5) of this section to be on a 
label. The written materials shall be readily accessible to the 
employees in their work area throughout each work shift.
    (7) The employer is not required to label portable containers into 
which hazardous chemicals are transferred from labeled containers, and 
which are intended only for the immediate use of the employee who 
performs the transfer. For purposes of this section, drugs which are 
dispensed by a pharmacy to a health care provider for direct 
administration to a patient are exempted from labeling.
    (8) The employer shall not remove or deface existing labels on 
incoming containers of hazardous chemicals, unless the container is 
immediately marked with the required information.
    (9) The employer shall ensure that labels or other forms of warning 
are legible, in English, and prominently displayed on the container, or 
readily available in the work area throughout each work shift. Employers 
having employees who speak other languages may add the information in 
their language to the material presented, as long as the information is 
presented in English as well.
    (10) The chemical manufacturer, importer, distributor or employer 
need not affix new labels to comply with this section if existing labels 
already convey the required information.
    (11) Chemical manufacturers, importers, distributors, or employers 
who become newly aware of any significant information regarding the 
hazards of a chemical shall revise the labels for the chemical within 
three months of becoming aware of the new information. Labels on 
containers of hazardous chemicals shipped after that time shall contain 
the new information. If the chemical is not currently produced or 
imported, the chemical manufacturer, importers, distributor, or employer 
shall add the information to the label before the chemical is shipped or 
introduced into the workplace again.
    (g) Material safety data sheets. (1) Chemical manufacturers and 
importers shall obtain or develop a material safety data sheet for each 
hazardous chemical they produce or import. Employers shall have a 
material safety data sheet in the workplace for each hazardous chemical 
which they use.
    (2) Each material safety data sheet shall be in English (although 
the employer may maintain copies in other languages as well), and shall 
contain at least the following information:
    (i) The identity used on the label, and, except as provided for in 
paragraph (i) of this section on trade secrets:
    (A) If the hazardous chemical is a single substance, its chemical 
and common name(s);
    (B) If the hazardous chemical is a mixture which has been tested as 
a whole to determine its hazards, the chemical and common name(s) of the 
ingredients which contribute to these known hazards, and the common 
name(s) of the mixture itself; or,
    (C) If the hazardous chemical is a mixture which has not been tested 
as a whole:
    (1) The chemical and common name(s) of all ingredients which have 
been determined to be health hazards, and which comprise 1% or greater 
of the composition, except that chemicals identified as carcinogens 
under paragraph (d) of this section shall be listed if the 
concentrations are 0.1% or greater; and,
    (2) The chemical and common name(s) of all ingredients which have 
been determined to be health hazards, and which comprise less than 1% 
(0.1% for carcinogens) of the mixture, if there is evidence that the 
ingredient(s) could be released from the mixture in concentrations which 
would exceed an established OSHA permissible exposure limit or ACGIH 
Threshold Limit Value, or could present a health risk to employees; and,
    (3) The chemical and common name(s) of all ingredients which have 
been determined to present a physical hazard when present in the 
mixture;
    (ii) Physical and chemical characteristics of the hazardous chemical 
(such as vapor pressure, flash point);
    (iii) The physical hazards of the hazardous chemical, including the 
potential for fire, explosion, and reactivity;
    (iv) The health hazards of the hazardous chemical, including signs 
and

[[Page 470]]

symptoms of exposure, and any medical conditions which are generally 
recognized as being aggravated by exposure to the chemical;
    (v) The primary route(s) of entry;
    (vi) The OSHA permissible exposure limit, ACGIH Threshold Limit 
Value, and any other exposure limit used or recommended by the chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or employer preparing the material safety data 
sheet, where available;
    (vii) Whether the hazardous chemical is listed in the National 
Toxicology Program (NTP) Annual Report on Carcinogens (latest edition) 
or has been found to be a potential carcinogen in the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs (latest editions), or by 
OSHA;
    (viii) Any generally applicable precautions for safe handling and 
use which are known to the chemical manufacturer, importer or employer 
preparing the material safety data sheet, including appropriate hygienic 
practices, protective measures during repair and maintenance of 
contaminated equipment, and procedures for clean-up of spills and leaks;
    (ix) Any generally applicable control measures which are known to 
the chemical manufacturer, importer or employer preparing the material 
safety data sheet, such as appropriate engineering controls, work 
practices, or personal protective equipment;
    (x) Emergency and first aid procedures;
    (xi) The date of preparation of the material safety data sheet or 
the last change to it; and,
    (xii) The name, address and telephone number of the chemical 
manufacturer, importer, employer or other responsible party preparing or 
distributing the material safety data sheet, who can provide additional 
information on the hazardous chemical and appropriate emergency 
procedures, if necessary.
    (3) If no relevant information is found for any given category on 
the material safety data sheet, the chemical manufacturer, importer or 
employer preparing the material safety data sheet shall mark it to 
indicate that no applicable information was found.
    (4) Where complex mixtures have similar hazards and contents (i.e. 
the chemical ingredients are essentially the same, but the specific 
composition varies from mixture to mixture), the chemical manufacturer, 
importer or employer may prepare one material safety data sheet to apply 
to all of these similar mixtures.
    (5) The chemical manufacturer, importer or employer preparing the 
material safety data sheet shall ensure that the information recorded 
accurately reflects the scientific evidence used in making the hazard 
determination. If the chemical manufacturer, importer or employer 
preparing the material safety data sheet becomes newly aware of any 
significant information regarding the hazards of a chemical, or ways to 
protect against the hazards, this new information shall be added to the 
material safety data sheet within three months. If the chemical is not 
currently being produced or imported the chemical manufacturer or 
importer shall add the information to the material safety data sheet 
before the chemical is introduced into the workplace again.
    (6)(i) Chemical manufacturers or importers shall ensure that 
distributors and employers are provided an appropriate material safety 
data sheet with their initial shipment, and with the first shipment 
after a material safety data sheet is updated;
    (ii) The chemical manufacturer or importer shall either provide 
material safety data sheets with the shipped containers or send them to 
the distributor or employer prior to or at the time of the shipment;
    (iii) If the material safety data sheet is not provided with a 
shipment that has been labeled as a hazardous chemical, the distributor 
or employer shall obtain one from the chemical manufacturer or importer 
as soon as possible; and,
    (iv) The chemical manufacturer or importer shall also provide 
distributors or employers with a material safety data sheet upon 
request.
    (7)(i) Distributors shall ensure that material safety data sheets, 
and updated information, are provided to other distributors and 
employers with their initial shipment and with the

[[Page 471]]

first shipment after a material safety data sheet is updated;
    (ii) The distributor shall either provide material safety data 
sheets with the shipped containers, or send them to the other 
distributor or employer prior to or at the time of the shipment;
    (iii) Retail distributors selling hazardous chemicals to employers 
having a commercial account shall provide a material safety data sheet 
to such employers upon request, and shall post a sign or otherwise 
inform them that a material safety data sheet is available;
    (iv) Wholesale distributors selling hazardous chemicals to employers 
over-the-counter may also provide material safety data sheets upon the 
request of the employer at the time of the over-the-counter purchase, 
and shall post a sign or otherwise inform such employers that a material 
safety data sheet is available;
    (v) If an employer without a commercial account purchases a 
hazardous chemical from a retail distributor not required to have 
material safety data sheets on file (i.e., the retail distributor does 
not have commercial accounts and does not use the materials), the retail 
distributor shall provide the employer, upon request, with the name, 
address, and telephone number of the chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
distributor from which a material safety data sheet can be obtained;
    (vi) Wholesale distributors shall also provide material safety data 
sheets to employers or other distributors upon request; and,
    (vii) Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors need not 
provide material safety data sheets to retail distributors that have 
informed them that the retail distributor does not sell the product to 
commercial accounts or open the sealed container to use it in their own 
workplaces.
    (8) The employer shall maintain in the workplace copies of the 
required material safety data sheets for each hazardous chemical, and 
shall ensure that they are readily accessible during each work shift to 
employees when they are in their work area(s). (Electronic access, 
microfiche, and other alternatives to maintaining paper copies of the 
material safety data sheets are permitted as long as no barriers to 
immediate employee access in each workplace are created by such 
options.)
    (9) Where employees must travel between workplaces during a 
workshift, i.e., their work is carried out at more than one geographical 
location, the material safety data sheets may be kept at the primary 
workplace facility. In this situation, the employer shall ensure that 
employees can immediately obtain the required information in an 
emergency.
    (10) Material safety data sheets may be kept in any form, including 
operating procedures, and may be designed to cover groups of hazardous 
chemicals in a work area where it may be more appropriate to address the 
hazards of a process rather than individual hazardous chemicals. 
However, the employer shall ensure that in all cases the required 
information is provided for each hazardous chemical, and is readily 
accessible during each work shift to employees when they are in in their 
work area(s).
    (11) Material safety data sheets shall also be made readily 
available, upon request, to designated representatives and to the 
Assistant Secretary, in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 
1910.20(e). The Director shall also be given access to material safety 
data sheets in the same manner.
    (h) Employee information and training. (1) Employers shall provide 
employees with effective information and training on hazardous chemicals 
in their work area at the time of their initial assignment, and whenever 
a new physical or health hazard the employees have not previously been 
trained about is introduced into their work area. Information and 
training may be designed to cover categories of hazards (e.g., 
flammability, carcinogenicity) or specific chemicals. Chemical-specific 
information must always be available through labels and material safety 
data sheets.
    (2) Information. Employees shall be informed of:
    (i) The requirements of this section;
    (ii) Any operations in their work area where hazardous chemicals are 
present; and,
    (iii) The location and availability of the written hazard 
communication program, including the required list(s) of

[[Page 472]]

hazardous chemicals, and material safety data sheets required by this 
section.
    (3) Training. Employee training shall include at least:
    (i) Methods and observations that may be used to detect the presence 
or release of a hazardous chemical in the work area (such as monitoring 
conducted by the employer, continuous monitoring devices, visual 
appearance or odor of hazardous chemicals when being released, etc.);
    (ii) The physical and health hazards of the chemicals in the work 
area;
    (iii) The measures employees can take to protect themselves from 
these hazards, including specific procedures the employer has 
implemented to protect employees from exposure to hazardous chemicals, 
such as appropriate work practices, emergency procedures, and personal 
protective equipment to be used; and,
    (iv) The details of the hazard communication program developed by 
the employer, including an explanation of the labeling system and the 
material safety data sheet, and how employees can obtain and use the 
appropriate hazard information.
    (i) Trade secrets. (1) The chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
employer may withhold the specific chemical identity, including the 
chemical name and other specific identification of a hazardous chemical, 
from the material safety data sheet, provided that:
    (i) The claim that the information withheld is a trade secret can be 
supported;
    (ii) Information contained in the material safety data sheet 
concerning the properties and effects of the hazardous chemical is 
disclosed;
    (iii) The material safety data sheet indicates that the specific 
chemical identity is being withheld as a trade secret; and,
    (iv) The specific chemical identity is made available to health 
professionals, employees, and designated representatives in accordance 
with the applicable provisions of this paragraph.
    (2) Where a treating physician or nurse determines that a medical 
emergency exists and the specific chemical identity of a hazardous 
chemical is necessary for emergency or first-aid treatment, the chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or employer shall immediately disclose the 
specific chemical identity of a trade secret chemical to that treating 
physician or nurse, regardless of the existence of a written statement 
of need or a confidentiality agreement. The chemical manufacturer, 
importer, or employer may require a written statement of need and 
confidentiality agreement, in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraphs (i) (3) and (4) of this section, as soon as circumstances 
permit.
    (3) In non-emergency situations, a chemical manufacturer, importer, 
or employer shall, upon request, disclose a specific chemical identity, 
otherwise permitted to be withheld under paragraph (i)(1) of this 
section, to a health professional (i.e. physician, industrial hygienist, 
toxicologist, epidemiologist, or occupational health nurse) providing 
medical or other occupational health services to exposed employee(s), 
and to employees or designated representatives, if:
    (i) The request is in writing;
    (ii) The request describes with reasonable detail one or more of the 
following occupational health needs for the information:
    (A) To assess the hazards of the chemicals to which employees will 
be exposed;
    (B) To conduct or assess sampling of the workplace atmosphere to 
determine employee exposure levels;
    (C) To conduct pre-assignment or periodic medical surveillance of 
exposed employees;
    (D) To provide medical treatment to exposed employees;
    (E) To select or assess appropriate personal protective equipment 
for exposed employees;
    (F) To design or assess engineering controls or other protective 
measures for exposed employees; and,
    (G) To conduct studies to determine the health effects of exposure.
    (iii) The request explains in detail why the disclosure of the 
specific chemical identity is essential and that, in lieu thereof, the 
disclosure of the following information to the health professional, 
employee, or designated representative, would not satisfy the

[[Page 473]]

purposes described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section:
    (A) The properties and effects of the chemical;
    (B) Measures for controlling workers' exposure to the chemical;
    (C) Methods of monitoring and analyzing worker exposure to the 
chemical; and,
    (D) Methods of diagnosing and treating harmful exposures to the 
chemical;
    (iv) The request includes a description of the procedures to be used 
to maintain the confidentiality of the disclosed information; and,
    (v) The health professional, and the employer or contractor of the 
services of the health professional (i.e. downstream employer, labor 
organization, or individual employee), employee, or designated 
representative, agree in a written confidentiality agreement that the 
health professional, employee, or designated representative, will not 
use the trade secret information for any purpose other than the health 
need(s) asserted and agree not to release the information under any 
circumstances other than to OSHA, as provided in paragraph (i)(6) of 
this section, except as authorized by the terms of the agreement or by 
the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer.
    (4) The confidentiality agreement authorized by paragraph (i)(3)(iv) 
of this section:
    (i) May restrict the use of the information to the health purposes 
indicated in the written statement of need;
    (ii) May provide for appropriate legal remedies in the event of a 
breach of the agreement, including stipulation of a reasonable pre-
estimate of likely damages; and,
    (iii) May not include requirements for the posting of a penalty 
bond.
    (5) Nothing in this standard is meant to preclude the parties from 
pursuing non-contractual remedies to the extent permitted by law.
    (6) If the health professional, employee, or designated 
representative receiving the trade secret information decides that there 
is a need to disclose it to OSHA, the chemical manufacturer, importer, 
or employer who provided the information shall be informed by the health 
professional, employee, or designated representative prior to, or at the 
same time as, such disclosure.
    (7) If the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer denies a 
written request for disclosure of a specific chemical identity, the 
denial must:
    (i) Be provided to the health professional, employee, or designated 
representative, within thirty days of the request;
    (ii) Be in writing;
    (iii) Include evidence to support the claim that the specific 
chemical identity is a trade secret;
    (iv) State the specific reasons why the request is being denied; 
and,
    (v) Explain in detail how alternative information may satisfy the 
specific medical or occupational health need without revealing the 
specific chemical identity.
    (8) The health professional, employee, or designated representative 
whose request for information is denied under paragraph (i)(3) of this 
section may refer the request and the written denial of the request to 
OSHA for consideration.
    (9) When a health professional, employee, or designated 
representative refers the denial to OSHA under paragraph (i)(8) of this 
section, OSHA shall consider the evidence to determine if:
    (i) The chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer has supported 
the claim that the specific chemical identity is a trade secret;
    (ii) The health professional, employee, or designated representative 
has supported the claim that there is a medical or occupational health 
need for the information; and,
    (iii) The health professional, employee or designated representative 
has demonstrated adequate means to protect the confidentiality.
    (10)(i) If OSHA determines that the specific chemical identity 
requested under paragraph (i)(3) of this section is not a bona fide 
trade secret, or that it is a trade secret, but the requesting health 
professional, employee, or designated representative has a legitimate 
medical or occupational health need for the information, has executed a 
written confidentiality agreement, and has shown adequate means to 
protect the confidentiality of the information, the chemical 
manufacturer, importer,

[[Page 474]]

or employer will be subject to citation by OSHA.
    (ii) If a chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer demonstrates 
to OSHA that the execution of a confidentiality agreement would not 
provide sufficient protection against the potential harm from the 
unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret specific chemical identity, 
the Assistant Secretary may issue such orders or impose such additional 
limitations or conditions upon the disclosure of the requested chemical 
information as may be appropriate to assure that the occupational health 
services are provided without an undue risk of harm to the chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or employer.
    (11) If a citation for a failure to release specific chemical 
identity information is contested by the chemical manufacturer, 
importer, or employer, the matter will be adjudicated before the 
Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission in accordance with the 
Act's enforcement scheme and the applicable Commission rules of 
procedure. In accordance with the Commission rules, when a chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or employer continues to withhold the 
information during the contest, the Administrative Law Judge may review 
the citation and supporting documentation in camera or issue appropriate 
orders to protect the confidentiality of such matters.
    (12) Notwithstanding the existence of a trade secret claim, a 
chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer shall, upon request, 
disclose to the Assistant Secretary any information which this section 
requires the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer to make 
available. Where there is a trade secret claim, such claim shall be made 
no later than at the time the information is provided to the Assistant 
Secretary so that suitable determinations of trade secret status can be 
made and the necessary protections can be implemented.
    (13) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the 
disclosure under any circumstances of process or percentage of mixture 
information which is a trade secret.
    (j) Effective dates. Chemical manufacturers, importers, 
distributors, and employers shall be in compliance with all provisions 
of this section by March 11, 1994.
    Note: The effective date of the clarification that the exemption of 
wood and wood products from the Hazard Communication standard in 
paragraph (b)(6)(iv) only applies to wood and wood products including 
lumber which will not be processed, where the manufacturer or importer 
can establish that the only hazard they pose to employees is the 
potential for flammability or combustibility, and that the exemption 
does not apply to wood or wood products which have been treated with a 
hazardous chemical covered by this standard, and wood which may be 
subsequently sawed or cut generating dust has been stayed from March 11, 
1994 to August 11, 1994.

   Appendix A to Sec. 1910.1200--Health Hazard Definitions (Mandatory)

    Although safety hazards related to the physical characteristics of a 
chemical can be objectively defined in terms of testing requirements 
(e.g. flammability), health hazard definitions are less precise and more 
subjective. Health hazards may cause measurable changes in the body--
such as decreased pulmonary function. These changes are generally 
indicated by the occurrence of signs and symptoms in the exposed 
employees--such as shortness of breath, a non-measurable, subjective 
feeling. Employees exposed to such hazards must be apprised of both the 
change in body function and the signs and symptoms that may occur to 
signal that change.
    The determination of occupational health hazards is complicated by 
the fact that many of the effects or signs and symptoms occur commonly 
in non-occupationally exposed populations, so that effects of exposure 
are difficult to separate from normally occurring illnesses. 
Occasionally, a substance causes an effect that is rarely seen in the 
population at large, such as angiosarcomas caused by vinyl chloride 
exposure, thus making it easier to ascertain that the occupational 
exposure was the primary causative factor. More often, however, the 
effects are common, such as lung cancer. The situation is further 
complicated by the fact that most chemicals have not been adequately 
tested to determine their health hazard potential, and data do not exist 
to substantiate these effects.
    There have been many attempts to categorize effects and to define 
them in various ways. Generally, the terms ``acute'' and ``chronic'' are 
used to delineate between effects on the basis of severity or duration. 
``Acute'' effects usually occur rapidly as a result of short-term 
exposures, and are of short duration. ``Chronic'' effects generally

[[Page 475]]

occur as a result of long-term exposure, and are of long duration.
    The acute effects referred to most frequently are those defined by 
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for 
Precautionary Labeling of Hazardous Industrial Chemicals (Z129.1-1988)--
irritation, corrosivity, sensitization and lethal dose. Although these 
are important health effects, they do not adequately cover the 
considerable range of acute effects which may occur as a result of 
occupational exposure, such as, for example, narcosis.
    Similarly, the term chronic effect is often used to cover only 
carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and mutagenicity. These effects are 
obviously a concern in the workplace, but again, do not adequately cover 
the area of chronic effects, excluding, for example, blood dyscrasias 
(such as anemia), chronic bronchitis and liver atrophy.
    The goal of defining precisely, in measurable terms, every possible 
health effect that may occur in the workplace as a result of chemical 
exposures cannot realistically be accomplished. This does not negate the 
need for employees to be informed of such effects and protected from 
them. Appendix B, which is also mandatory, outlines the principles and 
procedures of hazard assessment.
    For purposes of this section, any chemicals which meet any of the 
following definitions, as determined by the criteria set forth in 
Appendix B are health hazards. However, this is not intended to be an 
exclusive categorization scheme. If there are available scientific data 
that involve other animal species or test methods, they must also be 
evaluated to determine the applicability of the HCS.7
    1. Carcinogen: A chemical is considered to be a carcinogen if:
    (a) It has been evaluated by the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer (IARC), and found to be a carcinogen or potential carcinogen; 
or
    (b) It is listed as a carcinogen or potential carcinogen in the 
Annual Report on Carcinogens published by the National Toxicology 
Program (NTP) (latest edition); or,
    (c) It is regulated by OSHA as a carcinogen.
    2. Corrosive: A chemical that causes visible destruction of, or 
irreversible alterations in, living tissue by chemical action at the 
site of contact. For example, a chemical is considered to be corrosive 
if, when tested on the intact skin of albino rabbits by the method 
described by the U.S. Department of Transportation in appendix A to 49 
CFR part 173, it destroys or changes irreversibly the structure of the 
tissue at the site of contact following an exposure period of four 
hours. This term shall not refer to action on inanimate surfaces.
    3. Highly toxic: A chemical falling within any of the following 
categories:
    (a) A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD<INF>50</INF>) of 50 
milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight when administered orally 
to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 grams each.
    (b) A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD<INF>50</INF>) of 
200 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight when administered by 
continuous contact for 24 hours (or less if death occurs within 24 
hours) with the bare skin of albino rabbits weighing between two and 
three kilograms each.
    (c) A chemical that has a median lethal concentration 
(LC<INF>50</INF>) in air of 200 parts per million by volume or less of 
gas or vapor, or 2 milligrams per liter or less of mist, fume, or dust, 
when administered by continuous inhalation for one hour (or less if 
death occurs within one hour) to albino rats weighing between 200 and 
300 grams each.
    4. Irritant: A chemical, which is not corrosive, but which causes a 
reversible inflammatory effect on living tissue by chemical action at 
the site of contact. A chemical is a skin irritant if, when tested on 
the intact skin of albino rabbits by the methods of 16 CFR 1500.41 for 
four hours exposure or by other appropriate techniques, it results in an 
empirical score of five or more. A chemical is an eye irritant if so 
determined under the procedure listed in 16 CFR 1500.42 or other 
appropriate techniques.
    5. Sensitizer: A chemical that causes a substantial proportion of 
exposed people or animals to develop an allergic reaction in normal 
tissue after repeated exposure to the chemical.
    6. Toxic. A chemical falling within any of the following categories:
    (a) A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD<INF>50</INF>) of 
more than 50 milligrams per kilogram but not more than 500 milligrams 
per kilogram of body weight when administered orally to albino rats 
weighing between 200 and 300 grams each.
    (b) A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD<INF>50</INF>) of 
more than 200 milligrams per kilogram but not more than 1,000 milligrams 
per kilogram of body weight when administered by continuous contact for 
24 hours (or less if death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of 
albino rabbits weighing between two and three kilograms each.
    (c) A chemical that has a median lethal concentration 
(LC<INF>50</INF>) in air of more than 200 parts per million but not more 
than 2,000 parts per million by volume of gas or vapor, or more than two 
milligrams per liter but not more than 20 milligrams per liter of mist, 
fume, or dust, when administered by continuous inhalation for one hour 
(or less if death occurs within one hour) to albino rats weighing 
between 200 and 300 grams each.
    7. Target organ effects.
    The following is a target organ categorization of effects which may 
occur, including

[[Page 476]]

examples of signs and symptoms and chemicals which have been found to 
cause such effects. These examples are presented to illustrate the range 
and diversity of effects and hazards found in the workplace, and the 
broad scope employers must consider in this area, but are not intended 
to be all-inclusive.

a. Hepatotoxins: Chemicals which produce liver damage3
    Signs & Symptoms: Jaundice; liver enlargement
    Chemicals: Carbon tetrachloride; nitrosamines
b. Nephrotoxins: Chemicals which produce kidney damage
    Signs & Symptoms: Edema; proteinuria
    Chemicals: Halogenated hydrocarbons; uranium
c. Neurotoxins: Chemicals which produce their primary toxic effects on 
          the nervous system
    Signs & Symptoms: Narcosis; behavioral changes; decrease in motor 
functions
    Chemicals: Mercury; carbon disulfide
d. Agents which act on the blood or hemato-poietic system: Decrease 
          hemoglobin function; deprive the body tissues of oxygen
    Signs & Symptoms: Cyanosis; loss of consciousness
    Chemicals: Carbon monoxide; cyanides
e. Agents which damage the lung: Chemicals which irritate or damage 
          pulmonary tissue
    Signs & Symptoms: Cough; tightness in chest; shortness of breath
    Chemicals: Silica; asbestos
f. Reproductive toxins: Chemicals which affect the reproductive 
          capabilities including chromosomal damage (mutations) and 
          effects on fetuses (teratogenesis)
    Signs & Symptoms: Birth defects; sterility
    Chemicals: Lead; DBCP
g. Cutaneous hazards: Chemicals which affect the dermal layer of the 
          body
    Signs & Symptoms: Defatting of the skin; rashes; irritation
    Chemicals: Ketones; chlorinated compounds
h. Eye hazards: Chemicals which affect the eye or visual capacity
    Signs & Symptoms: Conjunctivitis; corneal damage
    Chemicals: Organic solvents; acids

     Appendix B to Sec. 1910.1200--Hazard Determination (Mandatory)

    The quality of a hazard communication program is largely dependent 
upon the adequacy and accuracy of the hazard determination. The hazard 
determination requirement of this standard is performance-oriented. 
Chemical manufacturers, importers, and employers evaluating chemicals 
are not required to follow any specific methods for determining hazards, 
but they must be able to demonstrate that they have adequately 
ascertained the hazards of the chemicals produced or imported in 
accordance with the criteria set forth in this Appendix.
    Hazard evaluation is a process which relies heavily on the 
professional judgment of the evaluator, particularly in the area of 
chronic hazards. The performance-orientation of the hazard determination 
does not diminish the duty of the chemical manufacturer, importer or 
employer to conduct a thorough evaluation, examining all relevant data 
and producing a scientifically defensible evaluation. For purposes of 
this standard, the following criteria shall be used in making hazard 
determinations that meet the requirements of this standard.
    1. Carcinogenicity: As described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section 
and Appendix A of this section, a determination by the National 
Toxicology Program, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, or 
OSHA that a chemical is a carcinogen or potential carcinogen will be 
considered conclusive evidence for purposes of this section. In 
addition, however, all available scientific data on carcinogenicity must 
be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of this Appendix and the 
requirements of the rule.
    2. Human data: Where available, epidemiological studies and case 
reports of adverse health effects shall be considered in the evaluation.
    3. Animal data: Human evidence of health effects in exposed 
populations is generally not available for the majority of chemicals 
produced or used in the workplace. Therefore, the available results of 
toxicological testing in animal populations shall be used to predict the 
health effects that may be experienced by exposed workers. In 
particular, the definitions of certain acute hazards refer to specific 
animal testing results (see Appendix A).
    4. Adequacy and reporting of data. The results of any studies which 
are designed and conducted according to established scientific 
principles, and which report statistically significant conclusions 
regarding the health effects of a chemical, shall be a sufficient basis 
for a hazard determination and reported on any material safety data 
sheet. In vitro studies alone generally do not form the basis for a 
definitive finding of hazard under the HCS since they have a positive or 
negative result rather than a statistically significant finding.
    The chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer may also report the 
results of other scientifically valid studies which tend to refute the 
findings of hazard.

                 Appendix C to Sec. 1910.1200 [Reserved]

Appendix D to Sec. 1910.1200--Definition of ``Trade Secret'' (Mandatory)

    The following is a reprint of the Restatement of Torts section 757, 
comment b (1939):
    b. Definition of trade secret. A trade secret may consist of any 
formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in 
one's business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an 
advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. It may be a 
formula for a chemical compound, a process of manufacturing, treating or 
preserving materials, a pattern for a machine or other device, or a list 
of customers. It differs from other secret information in a business 
(see s759 of the Restatement of Torts which is not included in this 
Appendix) in that it is not simply information as to single or ephemeral 
events in the conduct of the business, as, for example, the amount or 
other terms of a secret bid for a contract or the salary of certain 
employees, or the security investments made or contemplated, or the date 
fixed for the announcement of a new policy or for bringing out a new 
model or the like. A trade secret is a process or device for continuous 
use in the operations of the business. Generally it relates to the 
production of goods, as, for example, a machine or formula for the 
production of an article. It may, however, relate to the sale of goods 
or to other operations in the business, such as a code for determining 
discounts, rebates or other concessions in a price list or catalogue, or 
a list of specialized customers, or a method of bookkeeping or other 
office management.
    Secrecy. The subject matter of a trade secret must be secret. 
Matters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry 
cannot be appropriated by one as his secret. Matters which are 
completely disclosed by the goods which one markets cannot be his 
secret. Substantially, a trade secret is known only in the particular 
business in which it is used. It is not requisite that only the 
proprietor of the business know it. He may, without losing his 
protection, communicate it to employees involved in its use. He may 
likewise communicate it to others pledged to secrecy. Others may also 
know of it independently, as, for example, when they have discovered the 
process or formula by independent invention and are keeping it secret. 
Nevertheless, a substantial element of secrecy must exist, so that, 
except by the use of improper means, there would be difficulty in 
acquiring the information. An exact definition of a trade secret is not 
possible. Some factors to be considered in determining whether given 
information is one's trade secret are: (1) The extent to which the 
information is known outside of his business; (2) the extent to which it 
is known by employees and others involved in his business; (3) the 
extent of measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information; 
(4) the value of the information to him and his competitors; (5) the 
amount of effort or money expended by him in developing the information; 
(6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly 
acquired or duplicated by others.
    Novelty and prior art. A trade secret may be a device or process 
which is patentable; but it need not be that. It may be a device or 
process which is clearly anticipated in the prior art or one which is 
merely a mechanical improvement that a good mechanic can make. Novelty 
and invention are not requisite for a trade secret as they are for 
patentability. These requirements are essential to patentability because 
a patent protects against unlicensed use of the patented device or 
process even by one who discovers it properly through independent 
research. The patent monopoly is a reward to the inventor. But such is 
not the case with a trade secret. Its protection is not based on a 
policy of rewarding or otherwise encouraging the development of secret 
processes or devices. The protection is merely against breach of faith 
and reprehensible means of learning another's secret. For this limited 
protection it is not appropriate to require also the kind of novelty and 
invention which is a requisite of patentability. The nature of the 
secret is, however, an important factor in determining the kind of 
relief that is appropriate against one who is subject to liability under 
the rule stated in this Section. Thus, if the secret consists of a 
device or process which is a novel invention, one who acquires the 
secret wrongfully is ordinarily enjoined from further use of it and is 
required to account for the profits derived from his past use. If, on 
the other hand, the secret consists of mechanical improvements that a 
good mechanic can make without resort to the secret, the wrongdoer's 
liability may be limited to damages, and an injunction against future 
use of the improvements made with the aid of the secret may be 
inappropriate.

   Appendix E to Sec. 1910.1200--(Advisory)--Guidelines for Employer 
                               Compliance

    The Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) is based on a simple 
concept--that employees have both a need and a right to know the hazards 
and identities of the chemicals they are exposed to when working. They 
also need to know what protective measures are available to prevent 
adverse effects from occurring. The HCS is designed to provide employees 
with the information they need.
    Knowledge acquired under the HCS will help employers provide safer 
workplaces for their employees. When employers have information about 
the chemicals being used, they

[[Page 478]]

can take steps to reduce exposures, substitute less hazardous materials, 
and establish proper work practices. These efforts will help prevent the 
occurrence of work-related illnesses and injuries caused by chemicals.
    The HCS addresses the issues of evaluating and communicating hazards 
to workers. Evaluation of chemical hazards involves a number of 
technical concepts, and is a process that requires the professional 
judgment of experienced experts. That's why the HCS is designed so that 
employers who simply use chemicals, rather than produce or import them, 
are not required to evaluate the hazards of those chemicals. Hazard 
determination is the responsibility of the producers and importers of 
the materials. Producers and importers of chemicals are then required to 
provide the hazard information to employers that purchase their 
products.
    Employers that don't produce or import chemicals need only focus on 
those parts of the rule that deal with establishing a workplace program 
and communicating information to their workers. This appendix is a 
general guide for such employers to help them determine what's required 
under the rule. It does not supplant or substitute for the regulatory 
provisions, but rather provides a simplified outline of the steps an 
average employer would follow to meet those requirements.

                   1. Becoming Familiar With The Rule.

    OSHA has provided a simple summary of the HCS in a pamphlet entitled 
``Chemical Hazard Communication,'' OSHA Publication Number 3084. Some 
employers prefer to begin to become familiar with the rule's 
requirements by reading this pamphlet. A copy may be obtained from your 
local OSHA Area Office, or by contacting the OSHA Publications Office at 
(202) 523-9667.
    The standard is long, and some parts of it are technical, but the 
basic concepts are simple. In fact, the requirements reflect what many 
employers have been doing for years. You may find that you are already 
largely in compliance with many of the provisions, and will simply have 
to modify your existing programs somewhat. If you are operating in an 
OSHA-approved State Plan State, you must comply with the State's 
requirements, which may be different than those of the Federal rule. 
Many of the State Plan States had hazard communication or ``right-to-
know'' laws prior to promulgation of the Federal rule. Employers in 
State Plan States should contact their State OSHA offices for more 
information regarding applicable requirements.
    The HCS requires information to be prepared and transmitted 
regarding all hazardous chemicals. The HCS covers both physical hazards 
(such as flammability), and health hazards (such as irritation, lung 
damage, and cancer). Most chemicals used in the workplace have some 
hazard potential, and thus will be covered by the rule.
    One difference between this rule and many others adopted by OSHA is 
that this one is performance-oriented. That means that you have the 
flexibility to adapt the rule to the needs of your workplace, rather 
than having to follow specific, rigid requirements. It also means that 
you have to exercise more judgment to implement an appropriate and 
effective program.
    The standard's design is simple. Chemical manufacturers and 
importers must evaluate the hazards of the chemicals they produce or 
import. Using that information, they must then prepare labels for 
containers, and more detailed technical bulletins called material safety 
data sheets (MSDS).
    Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors of hazardous 
chemicals are all required to provide the appropriate labels and 
material safety data sheets to the employers to which they ship the 
chemicals. The information is to be provided automatically. Every 
container of hazardous chemicals you receive must be labeled, tagged, or 
marked with the required information. Your suppliers must also send you 
a properly completed material safety data sheet (MSDS) at the time of 
the first shipment of the chemical, and with the next shipment after the 
MSDS is updated with new and significant information about the hazards.
    You can rely on the information received from your suppliers. You 
have no independent duty to analyze the chemical or evaluate the hazards 
of it.
    Employers that ``use'' hazardous chemicals must have a program to 
ensure the information is provided to exposed employees. ``Use'' means 
to package, handle, react, or transfer. This is an intentionally broad 
scope, and includes any situation where a chemical is present in such a 
way that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a 
foreseeable emergency.
    The requirements of the rule that deal specifically with the hazard 
communication program are found in this section in paragraphs (e), 
written hazard communication program; (f), labels and other forms of 
warning; (g), material safety data sheets; and (h), employee information 
and training. The requirements of these paragraphs should be the focus 
of your attention. Concentrate on becoming familiar with them, using 
paragraphs (b), scope and application, and (c), definitions, as 
references when needed to help explain the provisions.
    There are two types of work operations where the coverage of the 
rule is limited. These are laboratories and operations where chemicals 
are only handled in sealed containers (e.g., a warehouse). The limited 
provisions for these workplaces can be found in paragraph (b) of this 
section, scope and application. Basically, employers having these

[[Page 479]]

types of work operations need only keep labels on containers as they are 
received; maintain material safety data sheets that are received, and 
give employees access to them; and provide information and training for 
employees. Employers do not have to have written hazard communication 
programs and lists of chemicals for these types of operations.
    The limited coverage of laboratories and sealed container operations 
addresses the obligation of an employer to the workers in the operations 
involved, and does not affect the employer's duties as a distributor of 
chemicals. For example, a distributor may have warehouse operations 
where employees would be protected under the limited sealed container 
provisions. In this situation, requirements for obtaining and 
maintaining MSDSs are limited to providing access to those received with 
containers while the substance is in the workplace, and requesting MSDSs 
when employees request access for those not received with the 
containers. However, as a distributor of hazardous chemicals, that 
employer will still have responsibilities for providing MSDSs to 
downstream customers at the time of the first shipment and when the MSDS 
is updated. Therefore, although they may not be required for the 
employees in the work operation, the distributor may, nevertheless, have 
to have MSDSs to satisfy other requirements of the rule.

                      2. Identify Responsible Staff

    Hazard communication is going to be a continuing program in your 
facility. Compliance with the HCS is not a ``one shot deal.'' In order 
to have a successful program, it will be necessary to assign 
responsibility for both the initial and ongoing activities that have to 
be undertaken to comply with the rule. In some cases, these activities 
may already be part of current job assignments. For example, site 
supervisors are frequently responsible for on-the-job training sessions. 
Early identification of the responsible employees, and involvement of 
them in the development of your plan of action, will result in a more 
effective program design. Evaluation of the effectiveness of your 
program will also be enhanced by involvement of affected employees.
    For any safety and health program, success depends on commitment at 
every level of the organization. This is particularly true for hazard 
communication, where success requires a change in behavior. This will 
only occur if employers understand the program, and are committed to its 
success, and if employees are motivated by the people presenting the 
information to them.

            3. Identify Hazardous Chemicals in the Workplace.

    The standard requires a list of hazardous chemicals in the workplace 
as part of the written hazard communication program. The list will 
eventually serve as an inventory of everything for which an MSDS must be 
maintained. At this point, however, preparing the list will help you 
complete the rest of the program since it will give you some idea of the 
scope of the program required for compliance in your facility.
    The best way to prepare a comprehensive list is to survey the 
workplace. Purchasing records may also help, and certainly employers 
should establish procedures to ensure that in the future purchasing 
procedures result in MSDSs being received before a material is used in 
the workplace.
    The broadest possible perspective should be taken when doing the 
survey. Sometimes people think of ``chemicals'' as being only liquids in 
containers. The HCS covers chemicals in all physical forms--liquids, 
solids, gases, vapors, fumes, and mists--whether they are ``contained'' 
or not. The hazardous nature of the chemical and the potential for 
exposure are the factors which determine whether a chemical is covered. 
If it's not hazardous, it's not covered. If there is no potential for 
exposure (e.g., the chemical is inextricably bound and cannot be 
released), the rule does not cover the chemical.
    Look around. Identify chemicals in containers, including pipes, but 
also think about chemicals generated in the work operations. For 
example, welding fumes, dusts, and exhaust fumes are all sources of 
chemical exposures. Read labels provided by suppliers for hazard 
information. Make a list of all chemicals in the workplace that are 
potentially hazardous. For your own information and planning, you may 
also want to note on the list the location(s) of the products within the 
workplace, and an indication of the hazards as found on the label. This 
will help you as you prepare the rest of your program.
    Paragraph (b) of this section, scope and application, includes 
exemptions for various chemicals or workplace situations. After 
compiling the complete list of chemicals, you should review paragraph 
(b) of this section to determine if any of the items can be eliminated 
from the list because they are exempted materials. For example, food, 
drugs, and cosmetics brought into the workplace for employee consumption 
are exempt. So rubbing alcohol in the first aid kit would not be 
covered.
    Once you have compiled as complete a list as possible of the 
potentially hazardous chemicals in the workplace, the next step is to 
determine if you have received material safety data sheets for all of 
them. Check your files against the inventory you have just compiled. If 
any are missing, contact

[[Page 480]]

your supplier and request one. It is a good idea to document these 
requests, either by copy of a letter or a note regarding telephone 
conversations. If you have MSDSs for chemicals that are not on your 
list, figure out why. Maybe you don't use the chemical anymore. Or maybe 
you missed it in your survey. Some suppliers do provide MSDSs for 
products that are not hazardous. These do not have to be maintained by 
you.
    You should not allow employees to use any chemicals for which you 
have not received an MSDS. The MSDS provides information you need to 
ensure proper protective measures are implemented prior to exposure.

      4. Preparing and Implementing a Hazard Communication Program

    All workplaces where employees are exposed to hazardous chemicals 
must have a written plan which describes how the standard will be 
implemented in that facility. Preparation of a plan is not just a paper 
exercise--all of the elements must be implemented in the workplace in 
order to be in compliance with the rule. See paragraph (e) of this 
section for the specific requirements regarding written hazard 
communication programs. The only work operations which do not have to 
comply with the written plan requirements are laboratories and work 
operations where employees only handle chemicals in sealed containers. 
See paragraph (b) of this section, scope and application, for the 
specific requirements for these two types of workplaces.
    The plan does not have to be lengthy or complicated. It is intended 
to be a blueprint for implementation of your program--an assurance that 
all aspects of the requirements have been addressed.
    Many trade associations and other professional groups have provided 
sample programs and other assistance materials to affected employers. 
These have been very helpful to many employers since they tend to be 
tailored to the particular industry involved. You may wish to 
investigate whether your industry trade groups have developed such 
materials.
    Although such general guidance may be helpful, you must remember 
that the written program has to reflect what you are doing in your 
workplace. Therefore, if you use a generic program it must be adapted to 
address the facility it covers. For example, the written plan must list 
the chemicals present at the site, indicate who is to be responsible for 
the various aspects of the program in your facility, and indicate where 
written materials will be made available to employees.
    If OSHA inspects your workplace for compliance with the HCS, the 
OSHA compliance officer will ask to see your written plan at the outset 
of the inspection. In general, the following items will be considered in 
evaluating your program.
    The written program must describe how the requirements for labels 
and other forms of warning, material safety data sheets, and employee 
information and training, are going to be met in your facility. The 
following discussion provides the type of information compliance 
officers will be looking for to decide whether these elements of the 
hazard communication program have been properly addressed:

                  A. Labels and Other Forms of Warning

    In-plant containers of hazardous chemicals must be labeled, tagged, 
or marked with the identity of the material and appropriate hazard 
warnings. Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors are 
required to ensure that every container of hazardous chemicals they ship 
is appropriately labeled with such information and with the name and 
address of the producer or other responsible party. Employers purchasing 
chemicals can rely on the labels provided by their suppliers. If the 
material is subsequently transferred by the employer from a labeled 
container to another container, the employer will have to label that 
container unless it is subject to the portable container exemption. See 
paragraph (f) of this section for specific labeling requirements.
    The primary information to be obtained from an OSHA-required label 
is an identity for the material, and appropriate hazard warnings. The 
identity is any term which appears on the label, the MSDS, and the list 
of chemicals, and thus links these three sources of information. The 
identity used by the supplier may be a common or trade name (``Black 
Magic Formula''), or a chemical name (1,1,1,-trichloroethane). The 
hazard warning is a brief statement of the hazardous effects of the 
chemical (``flammable,'' ``causes lung damage''). Labels frequently 
contain other information, such as precautionary measures (``do not use 
near open flame''), but this information is provided voluntarily and is 
not required by the rule. Labels must be legible, and prominently 
displayed. There are no specific requirements for size or color, or any 
specified text.
    With these requirements in mind, the compliance officer will be 
looking for the following types of information to ensure that labeling 
will be properly implemented in your facility:
    1. Designation of person(s) responsible for ensuring labeling of in-
plant containers;
    2. Designation of person(s) responsible for ensuring labeling of any 
shipped containers;
    3. Description of labeling system(s) used;
    4. Description of written alternatives to labeling of in-plant 
containers (if used); and,
    5. Procedures to review and update label information when necessary.
    Employers that are purchasing and using hazardous chemicals--rather 
than producing

[[Page 481]]

or distributing them--will primarily be concerned with ensuring that 
every purchased container is labeled. If materials are transferred into 
other containers, the employer must ensure that these are labeled as 
well, unless they fall under the portable container exemption (paragraph 
(f)(7) of this section). In terms of labeling systems, you can simply 
choose to use the labels provided by your suppliers on the containers. 
These will generally be verbal text labels, and do not usually include 
numerical rating systems or symbols that require special training. The 
most important thing to remember is that this is a continuing duty--all 
in-plant containers of hazardous chemicals must always be labeled. 
Therefore, it is important to designate someone to be responsible for 
ensuring that the labels are maintained as required on the containers in 
your facility, and that newly purchased materials are checked for labels 
prior to use.

                     B. Material Safety Data Sheets

    Chemical manufacturers and importers are required to obtain or 
develop a material safety data sheet for each hazardous chemical they 
produce or import. Distributors are responsible for ensuring that their 
customers are provided a copy of these MSDSs. Employers must have an 
MSDS for each hazardous chemical which they use. Employers may rely on 
the information received from their suppliers. The specific requirements 
for material safety data sheets are in paragraph (g) of this section.
    There is no specified format for the MSDS under the rule, although 
there are specific information requirements. OSHA has developed a non-
mandatory format, OSHA Form 174, which may be used by chemical 
manufacturers and importers to comply with the rule. The MSDS must be in 
English. You are entitled to receive from your supplier a data sheet 
which includes all of the information required under the rule. If you do 
not receive one automatically, you should request one. If you receive 
one that is obviously inadequate, with, for example, blank spaces that 
are not completed, you should request an appropriately completed one. If 
your request for a data sheet or for a corrected data sheet does not 
produce the information needed, you should contact your local OSHA Area 
Office for assistance in obtaining the MSDS.
    The role of MSDSs under the rule is to provide detailed information 
on each hazardous chemical, including its potential hazardous effects, 
its physical and chemical characteristics, and recommendations for 
appropriate protective measures. This information should be useful to 
you as the employer responsible for designing protective programs, as 
well as to the workers. If you are not familiar with material safety 
data sheets and with chemical terminology, you may need to learn to use 
them yourself. A glossary of MSDS terms may be helpful in this regard. 
Generally speaking, most employers using hazardous chemicals will 
primarily be concerned with MSDS information regarding hazardous effects 
and recommended protective measures. Focus on the sections of the MSDS 
that are applicable to your situation.
    MSDSs must be readily accessible to employees when they are in their 
work areas during their workshifts. This may be accomplished in many 
different ways. You must decide what is appropriate for your particular 
workplace. Some employers keep the MSDSs in a binder in a central 
location (e.g., in the pick-up truck on a construction site). Others, 
particularly in workplaces with large numbers of chemicals, computerize 
the information and provide access through terminals. As long as 
employees can get the information when they need it, any approach may be 
used. The employees must have access to the MSDSs themselves--simply 
having a system where the information can be read to them over the phone 
is only permitted under the mobile worksite provision, paragraph (g)(9) 
of this section, when employees must travel between workplaces during 
the shift. In this situation, they have access to the MSDSs prior to 
leaving the primary worksite, and when they return, so the telephone 
system is simply an emergency arrangement.
    In order to ensure that you have a current MSDS for each chemical in 
the plant as required, and that employee access is provided, the 
compliance officers will be looking for the following types of 
information in your written program:
    1. Designation of person(s) responsible for obtaining and 
maintaining the MSDSs;
    2. How such sheets are to be maintained in the workplace (e.g., in 
notebooks in the work area(s) or in a computer with terminal access), 
and how employees can obtain access to them when they are in their work 
area during the work shift;
    3. Procedures to follow when the MSDS is not received at the time of 
the first shipment;
    4. For producers, procedures to update the MSDS when new and 
significant health information is found; and,
    5. Description of alternatives to actual data sheets in the 
workplace, if used.
    For employers using hazardous chemicals, the most important aspect 
of the written program in terms of MSDSs is to ensure that someone is 
responsible for obtaining and maintaining the MSDSs for every hazardous 
chemical in the workplace. The list of hazardous chemicals required to 
be maintained as part of the written program will serve as an inventory. 
As new chemicals are purchased, the list should be updated. Many 
companies have found it convenient to include on their purchase orders 
the name and

[[Page 482]]

address of the person designated in their company to receive MSDSs.

                  C. Employee Information and Training

    Each employee who may be ``exposed'' to hazardous chemicals when 
working must be provided information and trained prior to initial 
assignment to work with a hazardous chemical, and whenever the hazard 
changes. ``Exposure'' or ``exposed'' under the rule means that ``an 
employee is subjected to a hazardous chemical in the course of 
employment through any route of entry (inhalation, ingestion, skin 
contact or absorption, etc.) and includes potential (e.g., accidental or 
possible) exposure.'' See paragraph (h) of this section for specific 
requirements. Information and training may be done either by individual 
chemical, or by categories of hazards (such as flammability or 
carcinogenicity). If there are only a few chemicals in the workplace, 
then you may want to discuss each one individually. Where there are 
large numbers of chemicals, or the chemicals change frequently, you will 
probably want to train generally based on the hazard categories (e.g., 
flammable liquids, corrosive materials, carcinogens). Employees will 
have access to the substance-specific information on the labels and 
MSDSs.
    Information and training is a critical part of the hazard 
communication program. Information regarding hazards and protective 
measures are provided to workers through written labels and material 
safety data sheets. However, through effective information and training, 
workers will learn to read and understand such information, determine 
how it can be obtained and used in their own workplaces, and understand 
the risks of exposure to the chemicals in their workplaces as well as 
the ways to protect themselves. A properly conducted training program 
will ensure comprehension and understanding. It is not sufficient to 
either just read material to the workers, or simply hand them material 
to read. You want to create a climate where workers feel free to ask 
questions. This will help you to ensure that the information is 
understood. You must always remember that the underlying purpose of the 
HCS is to reduce the incidence of chemical source illnesses and 
injuries. This will be accomplished by modifying behavior through the 
provision of hazard information and information about protective 
measures. If your program works, you and your workers will better 
understand the chemical hazards within the workplace. The procedures you 
establish regarding, for example, purchasing, storage, and handling of 
these chemicals will improve, and thereby reduce the risks posed to 
employees exposed to the chemical hazards involved. Furthermore, your 
workers' comprehension will also be increased, and proper work practices 
will be followed in your workplace.
    If you are going to do the training yourself, you will have to 
understand the material and be prepared to motivate the workers to 
learn. This is not always an easy task, but the benefits are worth the 
effort. More information regarding appropriate training can be found in 
OSHA Publication No. 2254 which contains voluntary training guidelines 
prepared by OSHA's Training Institute. A copy of this document is 
available from OSHA's Publications Office at (202) 219-4667.
    In reviewing your written program with regard to information and 
training, the following items need to be considered:
    1. Designation of person(s) responsible for conducting training;
    2. Format of the program to be used (audiovisuals, classroom 
instruction, etc.);
    3. Elements of the training program (should be consistent with the 
elements in paragraph (h) of this section); and,
    4. Procedure to train new employees at the time of their initial 
assignment to work with a hazardous chemical, and to train employees 
when a new hazard is introduced into the workplace.
    The written program should provide enough details about the 
employer's plans in this area to assess whether or not a good faith 
effort is being made to train employees. OSHA does not expect that every 
worker will be able to recite all of the information about each chemical 
in the workplace. In general, the most important aspects of training 
under the HCS are to ensure that employees are aware that they are 
exposed to hazardous chemicals, that they know how to read and use 
labels and material safety data sheets, and that, as a consequence of 
learning this information, they are following the appropriate protective 
measures established by the employer. OSHA compliance officers will be 
talking to employees to determine if they have received training, if 
they know they are exposed to hazardous chemicals, and if they know 
where to obtain substance-specific information on labels and MSDSs.
    The rule does not require employers to maintain records of employee 
training, but many employers choose to do so. This may help you monitor 
your own program to ensure that all employees are appropriately trained. 
If you already have a training program, you may simply have to 
supplement it with whatever additional information is required under the 
HCS. For example, construction employers that are already in compliance 
with the construction training standard (29 CFR 1926.21) will have 
little extra training to do.
    An employer can provide employees information and training through 
whatever means are found appropriate and protective. Although there 
would always have to be

[[Page 483]]

some training on-site (such as informing employees of the location and 
availability of the written program and MSDSs), employee training may be 
satisfied in part by general training about the requirements of the HCS 
and about chemical hazards on the job which is provided by, for example, 
trade associations, unions, colleges, and professional schools. In 
addition, previous training, education and experience of a worker may 
relieve the employer of some of the burdens of informing and training 
that worker. Regardless of the method relied upon, however, the employer 
is always ultimately responsible for ensuring that employees are 
adequately trained. If the compliance officer finds that the training is 
deficient, the employer will be cited for the deficiency regardless of 
who actually provided the training on behalf of the employer.

                          D. Other Requirements

    In addition to these specific items, compliance officers will also 
be asking the following questions in assessing the adequacy of the 
program:
    Does a list of the hazardous chemicals exist in each work area or at 
a central location?
    Are methods the employer will use to inform employees of the hazards 
of non-routine tasks outlined?
    Are employees informed of the hazards associated with chemicals 
contained in unlabeled pipes in their work areas?
    On multi-employer worksites, has the employer provided other 
employers with information about labeling systems and precautionary 
measures where the other employers have employees exposed to the initial 
employer's chemicals?
    Is the written program made available to employees and their 
designated representatives?
    If your program adequately addresses the means of communicating 
information to employees in your workplace, and provides answers to the 
basic questions outlined above, it will be found to be in compliance 
with the rule.

                       5. Checklist for Compliance

    The following checklist will help to ensure you are in compliance 
with the rule:

                          6. Further Assistance

    If you have a question regarding compliance with the HCS, you should 
contact your local OSHA Area Office for assistance. In addition, each 
OSHA Regional Office has a Hazard Communication Coordinator who can 
answer your questions. Free consultation services are also available to 
assist employers, and information regarding these services can be 
obtained through the Area and Regional offices as well.
    The telephone number for the OSHA office closest to you should be 
listed in your local telephone directory. If you are not able to obtain 
this information, you may contact OSHA's Office of Information and 
Consumer Affairs at (202) 219-8151 for further assistance in identifying 
the appropriate contacts.

that the designated indvidual shall hold within the employer's 
organizational structure.
    Chemical Hygiene Plan means a written program developed and 
implemented by the employer which sets forth procedures, equipment, 
personal protective equipment and work practices that (i) are capable of

may be exposed to hazardous chemicals in the course of his or her 
assignments.
    Explosive means a chemical that causes a sudden, almost 
instantaneous release of pressure, gas, and heat when subjected to 
sudden shock, pressure, or high temperature.
    Flammable means a chemical that falls into one of the following 
categories:
    (i) Aerosol, flammable means an aerosol that, when tested by the 
method described in 16 CFR 1500.45, yields a flame protection exceeding 
18 inches at full valve opening, or a flashback (a flame extending back 
to the valve) at any degree of valve opening;

make up 99 percent or more of the total volume of the mixture.
    (iv) Solid, flammable means a solid, other than a blasting agent or 
explosive as defined in Sec. 1910.109(a), that is liable to cause fire 
through friction, absorption of moisture, spontaneous chemical change, 
or retained heat from manufacturing or processing, or which can be 
ignited readily and when ignited burns so vigorously and persistently as 
to create a serious hazard. A chemical shall be considered to be a 
flammable solid if, when tested by the method described in 16 CFR 
1500.44, it ignites and burns with a self-sustained flame at a rate 
greater than one-tenth of an inch per second along its major axis.
    Flashpoint means the minimum temperature at which a liquid gives off 
a vapor in sufficient concentration to ignite when tested as follows:

of Test for Flash Point by Setaflash Closed Tester (ASTM D 3278-78)).
    Organic peroxides, which undergo autoaccelerating thermal 
decomposition, are excluded from any of the flashpoint determination 
methods specified above.
    Hazardous chemical means a chemical for which there is statistically 
significant evidence based on at least one study conducted in accordance 
with established scientific principles that acute or chronic health 
effects may occur in exposed employees. The term health hazard includes 
chemicals which are carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents, 
reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, hepatotoxins, 
nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, agents which act on the hematopoietic 
systems, and agents which damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or mucous 
membranes.

[[Page 486]]

    Appendices A and B of the Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 
1910.1200) provide further guidance in defining the scope of health 
hazards and determining whether or not a chemical is to be considered 
hazardous for purposes of this standard.
    Laboratory means a facility where the ``laboratory use of hazardous 
chemicals'' occurs. It is a workplace where relatively small quantities 
of hazardous chemicals are used on a non-production basis.
    Laboratory scale means work with substances in which the containers 
used for reactions, transfers, and other handling of substances are 
designed to be easily and safely manipulated by one person. ``Laboratory 
scale'' excludes those workplaces whose function is to produce 
commercial quantities of materials.
    Laboratory-type hood means a device located in a laboratory, 
enclosure on five sides with a moveable sash or fixed partial enclosed 
on the remaining side; constructed and maintained to draw air from the 
laboratory and to prevent or minimize the escape of air contaminants 
into the laboratory; and allows chemical manipulations to be conducted 
in the enclosure without insertion of any portion of the employee's body 
other than hands and arms.
    Walk-in hoods with adjustable sashes meet the above definition 
provided that the sashes are adjusted during use so that the airflow and 
the exhaust of air contaminants are not compromised and employees do not 
work inside the enclosure during the release of airborne hazardous 
chemicals.
    Laboratory use of hazardous chemicals means handling or use of such 
chemicals in which all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) Chemical manipulations are carried out on a ``laboratory 
scale;''
    (ii) Multiple chemical procedures or chemicals are used;
    (iii) The procedures involved are not part of a production process, 
nor in any way simulate a production process; and
    (iv) ``Protective laboratory practices and equipment'' are available 
and in common use to minimize the potential for employee exposure to 
hazardous chemicals.
    Medical consultation means a consultation which takes place between 
an employee and a licensed physician for the purpose of determining what 
medical examinations or procedures, if any, are appropriate in cases 
where a significant exposure to a hazardous chemical may have taken 
place.
    Organic peroxide means an organic compound that contains the 
bivalent -O-O-structure and which may be considered to be a structural 
derivative of hydrogen peroxide where one or both of the hydrogen atoms 
has been replaced by an organic radical.
    Oxidizer means a chemical other than a blasting agent or explosive 
as defined in Sec. 1910.109(a), that initiates or promotes combustion in 
other materials, thereby causing fire either of itself or through the 
release of oxygen or other gases.
    Physical hazard means a chemical for which there is scientifically

exposure limits specified in 29 CFR part 1910, subpart Z.
    (d) Employee exposure determination--(1) Initial monitoring. The 
employer shall measure the employee's exposure to any substance 
regulated by a standard which requires monitoring if there is reason to 
believe that exposure levels for that substance routinely exceed the 
action level (or in the absence of an action level, the PEL).
    (2) Periodic monitoring. If the initial monitoring prescribed by 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section discloses employee exposure over the 
action level (or in the absence of an action level, the PEL), the 
employer shall immediately comply with the exposure monitoring 
provisions of the relevant standard.
    (3) Termination of monitoring. Monitoring may be terminated in 
accordance with the relevant standard.
    (4) Employee notification of monitoring results. The employer shall, 
within 15 working days after the receipt of any monitoring results, 
notify the employee of these results in writing either individually or 
by posting results in an appropriate location that is accessible to 
employees.

    (D) A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician 
of the results of the consultation or medical examination and any 
medical condition that may require further examination or treatment.
    (ii) The written opinion shall not reveal specific findings of 
diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposure.
    (h) Hazard identification. (1) With respect to labels and material 
safety data sheets:
    (i) Employers shall ensure that labels on incoming containers of 
hazardous chemicals are not removed or defaced.
    (ii) Employers shall maintain any material safety data sheets that 
are received with incoming shipments of hazardous chemicals, and ensure 
that they are readily accessible to laboratory employees.
    (2) The following provisions shall apply to chemical substances 
developed in the laboratory:
    (i) If the composition of the chemical substance which is produced 
exclusively for the laboratory's use is known, the employer shall 
determine if it is a hazardous chemical as defined in paragraph (b) of 
this section. If the chemical is determined to be hazardous, the 
employer shall provide appropriate training as required under paragraph 
(f) of this section.
    (ii) If the chemical produced is a byproduct whose composition is

                                Foreword

    As guidance for each employer's development of an appropriate 
laboratory Chemical Hygiene Plan, the following non-mandatory 
recommendations are provided. They were extracted from ``Prudent 
Practices for Handling Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories'' (referred 
to below as ``Prudent Practices''), which was published in 1981 by the 
National Research Council and is available from the National Academy 
Press, 2101 Constitution Ave., NW., Washington DC 20418.
    ``Prudent Practices'' is cited because of its wide distribution and 
acceptance and because of its preparation by members of the laboratory 
community through the sponsorship of the National Research Council. 
However, none of the recommendations given here will modify any 
requirements of the laboratory standard. This Appendix merely presents 
pertinent recommendations from ``Prudent Practices'', organized into a 
form convenient for quick reference during operation of a laboratory 
facility and during development and application of a Chemical Hygiene 
Plan. Users of this appendix should consult ``Prudent Practices'' for a 
more extended presentation and justification for each recommendation.
    ``Prudent Practices'' deals with both safety and chemical hazards 
while the laboratory standard is concerned primarily with chemical 
hazards. Therefore, only those recommendations directed primarily toward 
control of toxic exposures are cited in this appendix, with the term 
``chemical hygiene'' being substituted for the word ``safety''. However, 
since conditions producing or threatening physical injury often pose 
toxic risks as well, page references concerning major categories of 
safety hazards in the laboratory are given in section F.
    The recommendations from ``Prudent Practices'' have been 
paraphrased, combined, or otherwise reorganized, and headings have been 
added. However, their sense has not been changed.

        Corresponding Sections of the Standard and this Appendix

    The following table is given for the convenience of those who are 
developing a Chemical Hygiene Plan which will satisfy the requirements 
of paragraph (e) of the standard. It indicates those sections of this

    In this appendix, those recommendations directed primarily at 
administrators and supervisors are given in sections A-D. Those 
recommendations of primary concern to employees who are actually 
handling laboratory chemicals are given in section E. (Reference to page 
numbers in ``Prudent Practices'' are given in parentheses.)

        A. General Principles for Work with Laboratory Chemicals

    In addition to the more detailed recommendations listed below in 
sections B-E, ``Prudent Practices'' expresses certain general 
principles, including the following:
    1. It is prudent to minimize all chemical exposures. Because few 
laboratory chemicals are without hazards, general precautions for 
handling all laboratory chemicals should be adopted, rather than 
specific guidelines for particular chemicals (2, 10). Skin contact with 
chemicals should be avoided as a cardinal rule (198).
    2. Avoid underestimation of risk. Even for substances of no known 
significant hazard, exposure should be minimized; for work with 
substances which present special hazards, special precautions should be 
taken (10, 37, 38). One should assume that any mixture will be more 
toxic than its most toxic component (30, 103) and that all substances of 
unknown toxicity are toxic (3, 34).
    3. Provide adequate ventilation. The best way to prevent exposure to 
airborne substances is to prevent their escape into the working 
atmosphere by use of hoods and other ventilation devices (32, 198).
    4. Institute a chemical hygiene program. A mandatory chemical 
hygiene program designed to minimize exposures is needed; it should be a 
regular, continuing effort, not merely a standby or short-term activity 
(6, 11). Its recommendations should be followed in academic teaching 
laboratories as well as by full-time laboratory workers (13).
    5. Observe the PELs, TLVs. The Permissible Exposure Limits of OSHA 
and the Threshold Limit Values of the American Conference of 
Governmental Industrial Hygienists should not be exceeded (13).

                  B. Chemical Hygiene Responsibilities

    Responsibility for chemical hygiene rests at all levels (6, 11, 21) 
including the:
    1. Chief executive officer, who has ultimate responsibility for 
chemical hygiene within the institution and must, with other 
administrators, provide continuing support for institutional chemical 
hygiene (7, 11).
    2. Supervisor of the department or other administrative unit, who is 
responsible for chemical hygiene in that unit (7).
    3. Chemical hygiene officer(s), whose appointment is essential (7) 
and who must:
    (a) Work with administrators and other employees to develop and 
implement appropriate chemical hygiene policies and practices (7);
    (b) Monitor procurement, use, and disposal of chemicals used in the 
lab (8);
    (c) See that appropriate audits are maintained (8);
    (d) Help project directors develop precautions and adequate 
facilities (10);
    (e) Know the current legal requirements concerning regulated 
substances (50); and
    (f) Seek ways to improve the chemical hygiene program (8, 11).
    4. Laboratory supervisor, who has overall responsibility for 
chemical hygiene in the laboratory (21) including responsibility to:
    (a) Ensure that workers know and follow the chemical hygiene rules, 
that protective equipment is available and in working order, and that 
appropriate training has been provided (21, 22);
    (b) Provide regular, formal chemical hygiene and housekeeping 
inspections including routine inspections of emergency equipment (21, 
171);
    (c) Know the current legal requirements concerning regulated 
substances (50, 231);
    (d) Determine the required levels of protective apparel and 
equipment (156, 160, 162); and
    (e) Ensure that facilities and training for use of any material 
being ordered are adequate (215).
    5. Project director or director of other specific operation, who has 
primary responsibility for chemical hygiene procedures for that 
operation (7).
    6. Laboratory worker, who is responsible for:
    (a) Planning and conducting each operation in accordance with the 
institutional chemical hygiene procedures (7, 21, 22, 230); and

[[Page 492]]

    (b) Developing good personal chemical hygiene habits (22).

                       C. The Laboratory Facility

    1. Design. The laboratory facility should have:
    (a) An appropriate general ventilation system (see C4 below) with 
air intakes and exhausts located so as to avoid intake of contaminated 
air (194);
    (b) Adequate, well-ventilated stockrooms/storerooms (218, 219);
    (c) Laboratory hoods and sinks (12, 162);
    (d) Other safety equipment including eyewash fountains and drench 
showers (162, 169); and
    (e) Arrangements for waste disposal (12, 240).
    2. Maintenance. Chemical-hygiene-related equipment (hoods, 
incinerator, etc.) should undergo continuing appraisal and be modified 
if inadequate (11, 12).
    3. Usage. The work conducted (10) and its scale (12) must be 
appropriate to the physicial facilities available and, especially, to 
the quality of ventilation (13).
    4. Ventilation--(a) General laboratory ventilation. This system 
should: Provide a source of air for breathing and for input to local 
ventilation devices (199); it should not be relied on for protection 
from toxic substances released into the laboratory (198); ensure that 
laboratory air is continually replaced, preventing increase of air 
concentrations of toxic substances during the working day (194); direct 
air flow into the laboratory from non-laboratory areas and out to the 
exterior of the building (194).
    (b) Hoods. A laboratory hood with 2.5 linear feet of hood space per 
person should be provided for every 2 workers if they spend most of 
their time working with chemicals (199); each hood should have a 
continuous monitoring device to allow convenient confirmation of 
adequate hood performance before use (200, 209). If this is not 
possible, work with substances of unknown toxicity should be avoided 
(13) or other types of local ventilation devices should be provided 
(199). See pp. 201-206 for a discussion of hood design, construction, 
and evaluation.
    (c) Other local ventilation devices. Ventilated storage cabinets, 
canopy hoods, snorkels, etc. should be provided as needed (199). Each 
canopy hood and snorkel should have a separate exhaust duct (207).
    (d) Special ventilation areas. Exhaust air from glove boxes and 
isolation rooms should be passed through scrubbers or other treatment 
before release into the regular exhaust system (208). Cold rooms and 
warm rooms should have provisions for rapid escape and for escape in the 
event of electrical failure (209).
    (e) Modifications. Any alteration of the ventilation system should 
be made only if thorough testing indicates that worker protection from 
airborne toxic substances will continue to be adequate (12, 193, 204).
    (f) Performance. Rate: 4-12 room air changes/hour is normally 
adequate general ventilation if local exhaust systems such as hoods are 
used as the primary method of control (194).
    (g) Quality. General air flow should not be turbulent and should be 
relatively uniform throughout the laboratory, with no high velocity or 
static areas (194, 195); airflow into and within the hood should not be 
excessively turbulent (200); hood face velocity should be adequate 
(typically 60-100 lfm) (200, 204).
    (h) Evaluation. Quality and quantity of ventilation should be 
evaluated on installation (202), regularly monitored (at least every 3 
months) (6, 12, 14, 195), and reevaluated whenever a change in local 
ventilation devices is made (12, 195, 207). See pp. 195-198 for methods 
of evaluation and for calculation of estimated airborne contaminant 
concentrations.

               D. Components of the Chemical Hygiene Plan

 1. Basic Rules and Procedures (Recommendations for these are given in 
                            section E, below)

           2. Chemical Procurement, Distribution, and Storage

    (a) Procurement. Before a substance is received, information on 
proper handling, storage, and disposal should be known to those who will 
be involved (215, 216). No container should be accepted without an 
adequate identifying label (216). Preferably, all substances should be 
received in a central location (216).
    (b) Stockrooms/storerooms. Toxic substances should be segregated in 
a well-identified area with local exhaust ventilation (221). Chemicals 
which are highly toxic (227) or other chemicals whose containers have 
been opened should be in unbreakable secondary containers (219). Stored 
chemicals should be examined periodically (at least annually) for 
replacement, deterioration, and container integrity (218-19).
    Stockrooms/storerooms should not be used as preparation or 
repackaging areas, should be open during normal working hours, and 
should be controlled by one person (219).
    (c) Distribution. When chemicals are hand carried, the container 
should be placed in an outside container or bucket. Freight-only 
elevators should be used if possible (223).
    (d) Laboratory storage. Amounts permitted should be as small as 
practical. Storage on bench tops and in hoods is inadvisable. Exposure 
to heat or direct sunlight should be avoided. Periodic inventories 
should be conducted, with unneeded items being discarded or returned to 
the storeroom/stockroom (225-6, 229).

[[Page 493]]

                       3. Environmental Monitoring

    Regular instrumental monitoring of airborne concentrations is not 
usually justified or practical in laboratories but may be appropriate 
when testing or redesigning hoods or other ventilation devices (12) or 
when a highly toxic substance is stored or used regularly (e.g., 3 
times/week) (13).

              4. Housekeeping, Maintenance, and Inspections

    (a) Cleaning. Floors should be cleaned regularly (24).
    (b) Inspections. Formal housekeeping and chemical hygiene 
inspections should be held at least quarterly (6, 21) for units which 
have frequent pesonnel changes and semiannually for others; informal 
inspections should be continual (21).
    (c) Maintenance. Eye wash fountains should be inspected at intervals 
of not less than 3 months (6). Respirators for routine use should be 
inspected periodically by the laboratory supervisor (169). Safety 
showers should be tested routinely (169). Other safety equipment should 
be inspected regularly. (e.g., every 3-6 months) (6, 24, 171). 
Procedures to prevent restarting of out-of-service equipment should be 
established (25).
    (d) Passageways. Stairways and hallways should not be used as 
storage areas (24). Access to exits, emergency equipment, and utility 
controls should never be blocked (24).

                           5. Medical Program

    (a) Compliance with regulations. Regular medical surveillance should 
be established to the extent required by regulations (12).
    (b) Routine surveillance. Anyone whose work involves regular and 
frequent handling of toxicologically significant quantities of a 
chemical should consult a qualified physician to determine on an 
individual basis whether a regular schedule of medical surveillance is 
desirable (11, 50).
    (c) First aid. Personnel trained in first aid should be available 
during working hours and an emergency room with medical personnel should 
be nearby (173). See pp. 176-178 for description of some emergency first 
aid procedures.

                   6. Protective Apparel and Equipment

    These should include for each laboratory:
    (a) Protective apparel compatible with the required degree of 
protection for substances being handled (158-161);
    (b) An easily accessible drench-type safety shower (162, 169);
    (c) An eyewash fountain (162);
    (d) A fire extinguisher (162-164);
    (e) Respiratory protection (164-9), fire alarm and telephone for 
emergency use (162) should be available nearby; and
    (f) Other items designated by the laboratory supervisor (156, 160).

                               7. Records

    (a) Accident records should be written and retained (174).
    (b) Chemical Hygiene Plan records should document that the 
facilities and precautions were compatible with current knowledge and 
regulations (7).
    (c) Inventory and usage records for high-risk substances should be 
kept as specified in sections E3e below.
    (d) Medical records should be retained by the institution in 
accordance with the requirements of state and federal regulations (12).

                           8. Signs and Labels

    Prominent signs and labels of the following types should be posted:
    (a) Emergency telephone numbers of emergency personnel/facilities, 
supervisors, and laboratory workers (28);
    (b) Identity labels, showing contents of containers (including waste 
receptacles) and associated hazards (27, 48);
    (c) Location signs for safety showers, eyewash stations, other 
safety and first aid equipment, exits (27) and areas where food and 
beverage consumption and storage are permitted (24); and
    (d) Warnings at areas or equipment where special or unusual hazards 
exist (27).

                         9. Spills and Accidents

    (a) A written emergency plan should be established and communicated 
to all personnel; it should include procedures for ventilation failure 
(200), evacuation, medical care, reporting, and drills (172).
    (b) There should be an alarm system to alert people in all parts of 
the facility including isolation areas such as cold rooms (172).
    (c) A spill control policy should be developed and should include 
consideration of prevention, containment, cleanup, and reporting (175).
    (d) All accidents or near accidents should be carefully analyzed 
with the results distributed to all who might benefit (8, 28).

                  10. Information and Training Program

    (a) Aim: To assure that all individuals at risk are adequately 
informed about the work in the laboratory, its risks, and what to do if 
an accident occurs (5, 15).
    (b) Emergency and Personal Protection Training: Every laboratory 
worker should know the location and proper use of available protective 
apparel and equipment (154, 169).
    Some of the full-time personnel of the laboratory should be trained 
in the proper use of emergency equipment and procedures (6).
    Such training as well as first aid instruction should be available 
to (154) and encouraged for (176) everyone who might need it.

[[Page 494]]

    (c) Receiving and stockroom/storeroom personnel should know about 
hazards, handling equipment, protective apparel, and relevant 
regulations (217).
    (d) Frequency of Training: The training and education program should 
be a regular, continuing activity--not simply an annual presentation 
(15).
    (e) Literature/Consultation: Literature and consulting advice 
concerning chemical hygiene should be readily available to laboratory 
personnel, who should be encouraged to use these information resources 
(14).

                       11. Waste Disposal Program.

    (a) Aim: To assure that minimal harm to people, other organisms, and 
the environment will result from the disposal of waste laboratory 
chemicals (5).
    (b) Content (14, 232, 233, 240): The waste disposal program should 
specify how waste is to be collected, segregated, stored, and 
transported and include consideration of what materials can be 
incinerated. Transport from the institution must be in accordance with 
DOT regulations (244).
    (c) Discarding Chemical Stocks: Unlabeled containers of chemicals 
and solutions should undergo prompt disposal; if partially used, they 
should not be opened (24, 27).
    Before a worker's employment in the laboratory ends, chemicals for 
which that person was responsible should be discarded or returned to 
storage (226).
    (d) Frequency of Disposal: Waste should be removed from laboratories 
to a central waste storage area at least once per week and from the 
central waste storage area at regular intervals (14).
    (e) Method of Disposal: Incineration in an environmentally 
acceptable manner is the most practical disposal method for combustible 
laboratory waste (14, 238, 241).
    Indiscriminate disposal by pouring waste chemicals down the drain 
(14, 231, 242) or adding them to mixed refuse for landfill burial is 
unacceptable (14).
    Hoods should not be used as a means of disposal for volatile 
chemicals (40, 200).
    Disposal by recycling (233, 243) or chemical decontamination (40, 
230) should be used when possible.

        E. Basic Rules and Procedures for Working with Chemicals

    The Chemical Hygiene Plan should require that laboratory workers 
know and follow its rules and procedures. In addition to the procedures 
of the sub programs mentioned above, these should include the rules 
listed below.

                            1. General Rules

    The following should be used for essentially all laboratory work 
with chemicals:
    (a) Accidents and spills--Eye Contact: Promptly flush eyes with 
water for a prolonged period (15 minutes) and seek medical attention 
(33, 172).
    Ingestion: Encourage the victim to drink large amounts of water 
(178).
    Skin Contact: Promptly flush the affected area with water (33, 172, 
178) and remove any contaminated clothing (172, 178). If symptoms 
persist after washing, seek medical attention (33).
    Clean-up. Promptly clean up spills, using appropriate protective 
apparel and equipment and proper disposal (24 33). See pp. 233-237 for 
specific clean-up recommendations.
    (b) Avoidance of ``routine'' exposure: Develop and encourage safe 
habits (23); avoid unnecessary exposure to chemicals by any route (23);
    Do not smell or taste chemicals (32). Vent apparatus which may 
discharge toxic chemicals (vacuum pumps, distillation columns, etc.) 
into local exhaust devices (199).
    Inspect gloves (157) and test glove boxes (208) before use.
    Do not allow release of toxic substances in cold rooms and warm 
rooms, since these have contained recirculated atmospheres (209).
    (c) Choice of chemicals: Use only those chemicals for which the 
quality of the available ventilation system is appropriate (13).
    (d) Eating, smoking, etc.: Avoid eating, drinking, smoking, gum 
chewing, or application of cosmetics in areas where laboratory chemicals 
are present (22, 24, 32, 40); wash hands before conducting these 
activities (23, 24).
    Avoid storage, handling or consumption of food or beverages in 
storage areas, refrigerators, glassware or utensils which are also used 
for laboratory operations (23, 24, 226).
    (e) Equipment and glassware: Handle and store laboratory glassware 
with care to avoid damage; do not use damaged glassware (25). Use extra 
care with Dewar flasks and other evacuated glass apparatus; shield or 
wrap them to contain chemicals and fragments should implosion occur 
(25). Use equipment only for its designed purpose (23, 26).
    (f) Exiting: Wash areas of exposed skin well before leaving the 
laboratory (23).
    (g) Horseplay: Avoid practical jokes or other behavior which might 
confuse, startle or distract another worker (23).
    (h) Mouth suction: Do not use mouth suction for pipeting or starting 
a siphon (23, 32).
    (i) Personal apparel: Confine long hair and loose clothing (23, 
158). Wear shoes at all times in the laboratory but do not wear sandals, 
perforated shoes, or sneakers (158).
    (j) Personal housekeeping: Keep the work area clean and uncluttered, 
with chemicals and equipment being properly labeled and stored; clean up 
the work area on completion of an operation or at the end of each day 
(24).

[[Page 495]]

    (k) Personal protection: Assure that appropriate eye protection 
(154-156) is worn by all persons, including visitors, where chemicals 
are stored or handled (22, 23, 33, 154).
    Wear appropriate gloves when the potential for contact with toxic 
materials exists (157); inspect the gloves before each use, wash them 
before removal, and replace them periodically (157). (A table of 
resistance to chemicals of common glove materials is given p. 159).
    Use appropriate (164-168) respiratory equipment when air contaminant 
concentrations are not sufficiently restricted by engineering controls 
(164-5), inspecting the respirator before use (169).
    Use any other protective and emergency apparel and equipment as 
appropriate (22, 157-162).
    Avoid use of contact lenses in the laboratory unless necessary; if 
they are used, inform supervisor so special precautions can be taken 
(155).
    Remove laboratory coats immediately on significant contamination 
(161).
    (l) Planning: Seek information and advice about hazards (7), plan 
appropriate protective procedures, and plan positioning of equipment 
before beginning any new operation (22, 23).
    (m) Unattended operations: Leave lights on, place an appropriate 
sign on the door, and provide for containment of toxic substances in the 
event of failure of a utility service (such as cooling water) to an 
unattended operation (27, 128).
    (n) Use of hood: Use the hood for operations which might result in 
release of toxic chemical vapors or dust (198-9).
    As a rule of thumb, use a hood or other local ventilation device 
when working with any appreciably volatile substance with a TLV of less 
than 50 ppm (13).
    Confirm adequate hood performance before use; keep hood closed at 
all times except when adjustments within the hood are being made (200); 
keep materials stored in hoods to a minimum and do not allow them to 
block vents or air flow (200).
    Leave the hood ``on'' when it is not in active use if toxic 
substances are stored in it or if it is uncertain whether adequate 
general laboratory ventilation will be maintained when it is ``off'' 
(200).
    (o) Vigilance: Be alert to unsafe conditions and see that they are 
corrected when detected (22).
    (p) Waste disposal: Assure that the plan for each laboratory 
operation includes plans and training for waste disposal (230).
    Deposit chemical waste in appropriately labeled receptacles and 
follow all other waste disposal procedures of the Chemical Hygiene Plan 
(22, 24).
    Do not discharge to the sewer concentrated acids or bases (231); 
highly toxic, malodorous, or lachrymatory substances (231); or any 
substances which might interfere with the biological activity of waste 
water treatment plants, create fire or explosion hazards, cause 
structural damage or obstruct flow (242).
    (q) Working alone: Avoid working alone in a building; do not work 
alone in a laboratory if the procedures being conducted are hazardous 
(28).

               2. Working with Allergens and Embryotoxins

    (a) Allergens (examples: diazomethane, isocyanates, bichromates): 
Wear suitable gloves to prevent hand contact with allergens or 
substances of unknown allergenic activity (35).
    (b) Embryotoxins (34-5) (examples: organomercurials, lead compounds, 
formamide): If you are a woman of childbearing age, handle these 
substances only in a hood whose satisfactory performance has been 
confirmed, using appropriate protective apparel (especially gloves) to 
prevent skin contact.
    Review each use of these materials with the research supervisor and 
review continuing uses annually or whenever a procedural change is made.
    Store these substances, properly labeled, in an adequately 
ventilated area in an unbreakable secondary container.
    Notify supervisors of all incidents of exposure or spills; consult a 
qualified physician when appropriate.

    3. Work with Chemicals of Moderate Chronic or High Acute Toxicity

    Examples: diisopropylflurophosphate (41), hydrofluoric acid (43), 
hydrogen cyanide (45).
    Supplemental rules to be followed in addition to those mentioned 
above (Procedure B of ``Prudent Practices'', pp. 39-41):
    (a) Aim: To minimize exposure to these toxic substances by any route 
using all reasonable precautions (39).
    (b) Applicability: These precautions are appropriate for substances 
with moderate chronic or high acute toxicity used in significant 
quantities (39).
    (c) Location: Use and store these substances only in areas of 
restricted access with special warning signs (40, 229).
    Always use a hood (previously evaluated to confirm adequate 
performance with a face velocity of at least 60 linear feet per minute) 
(40) or other containment device for procedures which may result in the 
generation of aerosols or vapors containing the substance (39); trap 
released vapors to prevent their discharge with the hood exhaust (40).
    (d) Personal protection: Always avoid skin contact by use of gloves 
and long sleeves (and other protective apparel as appropriate) (39). 
Always wash hands and arms immediately after working with these 
materials (40).

[[Page 496]]

    (e) Records: Maintain records of the amounts of these materials on 
hand, amounts used, and the names of the workers involved (40, 229).
    (f) Prevention of spills and accidents: Be prepared for accidents 
and spills (41).
    Assure that at least 2 people are present at all times if a compound 
in use is highly toxic or of unknown toxicity (39).
    Store breakable containers of these substances in chemically 
resistant trays; also work and mount apparatus above such trays or cover 
work and storage surfaces with removable, absorbent, plastic backed 
paper (40).
    If a major spill occurs outside the hood, evacuate the area; assure 
that cleanup personnel wear suitable protective apparel and equipment 
(41).
    (g) Waste: Thoroughly decontaminate or incinerate contaminated 
clothing or shoes (41). If possible, chemically decontaminate by 
chemical conversion (40).
    Store contaminated waste in closed, suitably labeled, impervious 
containers (for liquids, in glass or plastic bottles half-filled with 
vermiculite) (40).

             4. Work with Chemicals of High Chronic Toxicity

    (Examples: dimethylmercury and nickel carbonyl (48), benzo-a-pyrene 
(51), N-nitrosodiethylamine (54), other human carcinogens or substances 
with high carcinogenic potency in animals (38).)
    Further supplemental rules to be followed, in addition to all these 
mentioned above, for work with substances of known high chronic toxicity 
(in quantities above a few milligrams to a few grams, depending on the 
substance) (47). (Procedure A of ``Prudent Practices'' pp. 47-50).
    (a) Access: Conduct all transfers and work with these substances in 
a ``controlled area'': a restricted access hood, glove box, or portion 
of a lab, designated for use of highly toxic substances, for which all 
people with access are aware of the substances being used and necessary 
precautions (48).
    (b) Approvals: Prepare a plan for use and disposal of these 
materials and obtain the approval of the laboratory supervisor (48).
    (c) Non-contamination/Decontamination: Protect vacuum pumps against 
contamination by scrubbers or HEPA filters and vent them into the hood 
(49). Decontaminate vacuum pumps or other contaminated equipment, 
including glassware, in the hood before removing them from the 
controlled area (49, 50).
    Decontaminate the controlled area before normal work is resumed 
there (50).
    (d) Exiting: On leaving a controlled area, remove any protective 
apparel (placing it in an appropriate, labeled container) and thoroughly 
wash hands, forearms, face, and neck (49).
    (e) Housekeeping: Use a wet mop or a vacuum cleaner equipped with a 
HEPA filter instead of dry sweeping if the toxic substance was a dry 
powder (50).
    (f) Medical surveillance: If using toxicologically significant 
quantities of such a substance on a regular basis (e.g., 3 times per 
week), consult a qualified physician concerning desirability of regular 
medical surveillance (50).
    (g) Records: Keep accurate records of the amounts of these 
substances stored (229) and used, the dates of use, and names of users 
(48).
    (h) Signs and labels: Assure that the controlled area is 
conspicuously marked with warning and restricted access signs (49) and 
that all containers of these substances are appropriately labeled with 
identity and warning labels (48).
    (i) Spills: Assure that contingency plans, equipment, and materials 
to minimize exposures of people and property in case of accident are 
available (233-4).
    (j) Storage: Store containers of these chemicals only in a 
ventilated, limited access (48, 227, 229) area in appropriately labeled, 
unbreakable, chemically resistant, secondary containers (48, 229).
    (k) Glove boxes: For a negative pressure glove box, ventilation rate 
must be at least 2 volume changes/hour and pressure at least 0.5 inches 
of water (48). For a positive pressure glove box, thoroughly check for 
leaks before each use (49). In either case, trap the exit gases or 
filter them through a HEPA filter and then release them into the hood 
(49).
    (l) Waste: Use chemical decontamination whenever possible; ensure 
that containers of contaminated waste (including washings from 
contaminated flasks) are transferred from the controlled area in a 
secondary container under the supervision of authorized personnel (49, 
50, 233).

         5. Animal Work with Chemicals of High Chronic Toxicity

    (a) Access: For large scale studies, special facilities with 
restricted access are preferable (56).
    (b) Administration of the toxic substance: When possible, administer 
the substance by injection or gavage instead of in the diet. If 
administration is in the diet, use a caging system under negative 
pressure or under laminar air flow directed toward HEPA filters (56).
    (c) Aerosol suppression: Devise procedures which minimize formation 
and dispersal of contaminated aerosols, including those from food, 
urine, and feces (e.g., use HEPA filtered vacuum equipment for cleaning, 
moisten contaminated bedding before removal from the cage, mix diets in 
closed containers in a hood) (55, 56).
    (d) Personal protection: When working in the animal room, wear 
plastic or rubber

[[Page 497]]

gloves, fully buttoned laboratory coat or jumpsuit and, if needed 
because of incomplete suppression of aerosols, other apparel and 
equipment (shoe and head coverings, respirator) (56).
    (e) Waste disposal: Dispose of contaminated animal tissues and 
excreta by incineration if the available incinerator can convert the 
contaminant to non-toxic products (238); otherwise, package the waste 
appropriately for burial in an EPA-approved site (239).

                        F. Safety Recommendations

    The above recommendations from ``Prudent Practices'' do not include 
those which are directed primarily toward prevention of physical injury 
rather than toxic exposure. However, failure of precautions against 
injury will often have the secondary effect of causing toxic exposures. 
Therefore, we list below page references for recommendations concerning 
some of the major categories of safety hazards which also have 
implications for chemical hygiene:

1. Corrosive agents: (35-6)
2. Electrically powered laboratory apparatus: (179-92)
3. Fires, explosions: (26, 57-74, 162-4, 174-5, 219-20, 226-7)
4. Low temperature procedures: (26, 88)
5. Pressurized and vacuum operations (including use of compressed gas 
cylinders): (27, 75-101)
