              U.S.C. 1507, the contents of the CFR, a special edition of the

              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2008), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

               The United States Flag for Burial Purposes


<R05>
Sec. 1.10  Eligibility for and disposition of the United States flag for burial purposes.

    (a) Eligibility for burial flags--(1) Persons eligible. (i) A 
veteran of any war, of Mexican border service, or of service after 
January 31, 1955, discharged or released from active duty under 
conditions other than dishonorable. (For the purpose of this section, 
the term Mexican border service means active military, naval, or air 
service during the period beginning on January 1, 1911, and ending on 
April 5, 1917, in Mexico, on the borders thereof, or in the waters 
adjacent thereto.)
    (ii) A peacetime veteran discharged or released, before June 27, 
1950, from the active military, naval, or air service, under conditions 
other than dishonorable, after serving at least one enlistment, or for a 
disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty.
    (iii) Any person who has died while in military or naval service of 
the United

[[Page 12]]

States after May 27, 1941. This subdivision authorizes and requires the 
furnishing of a flag only where the military or naval service does not 
furnish a flag immediately. The only cases wherein a flag is not 
supplied immediately are those of persons whose remains are interred 
outside the continental limits of the United States, or whose remains 
are not recovered or are recovered and not identified.
    (iv) Any person who served in the organized military forces of the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines while such forces were in the service of 
the Armed Forces of the United States pursuant to the military order of 
the President of the United States, dated July 26, 1941, including among 
such military forces organized guerrilla forces under commanders 
appointed, designated, or subsequently recognized by the Commander in 
Chief, Southwest Pacific Area, or other competent authority in the Army 
of the United States, and who dies after separation from such service 
under conditions other than dishonorable, on or after April 25, 1951.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 107(a))

    (v) Any deceased member or former member of the Selected Reserve (as 
described in section 10143 of title 10) who is not otherwise eligible 
for a flag under this section or section 1482(a) of title 10 and who:
    (A) Completed at least one enlistment as a member of the Selected 
Reserve or, in the case of an officer, completed the period of initial 
obligated service as a member of the Selected Reserve;
    (B) Was discharged before completion of the person's initial 
enlistment as a member of the Selected Reserve or, in the case of an 
officer, period of initial obligated service as a member of the Selected 
Reserve, for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; or
    (C) Died while a member of the Selected Reserve.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2301(f)(1))

    (b) Disposition of burial flags. (1) When a flag is actually used to 
drape the casket of a deceased veteran, it must be delivered to the next 
of kin following interment. Where the flag is not claimed by the next of 
kin it may be given upon request to a close friend or associate of the 
deceased veteran. Such action will constitute final and conclusive 
determination of rights under this section. (38 U.S.C. 2301)
    (2) The phrase next of kin for the purpose of disposing of the flag 
used for burial purposes is defined as follows, with preference to 
entitlement in the order listed:
    (i) Widow or widower.
    (ii) Children, according to age (minor child may be issued a flag on 
application signed by guardian).
    (iii) Parents, including adoptive, stepparents, and foster parents.
    (iv) Brothers or sisters, including brothers or sisters of the 
halfblood.
    (v) Uncles or aunts.
    (vi) Nephews or nieces.
    (vii) Others--cousins, grandparents, etc. (but not in-laws).
    (3) The phrase close friend or associate for the purpose of 
disposing of the burial flag means any person who because of his or her 
relationship with the deceased veteran arranged for the burial or 
assisted in the burial arrangements. In the absence of a person falling 
in either of these categories, any person who establishes by evidence 
that he or she was a close friend or associate of the veteran may be 
furnished the burial flag. Where more than one request for the burial 
flag is received and each is accompanied by satisfactory evidence of 
relationship or association, the head of the field facility having 
jurisdiction of the burial flag quota will determine which applicant is 
the one most equitably entitled to the burial flag.

sufficient frequency to allow for an assessment of the continued 
effectiveness of the programs.
    (b) The program evaluation will be designed to determine if the 
existing program supports the intent of the law. A program evaluation 
must identify goals and objectives that support this intent, contain a 
method to measure fulfillment of the objectives, ascertain the degree to 
which goals and objectives are met, and report the findings and 
conclusions to Congress, as well as make them available to the public.
    (c) The goals must be clear, specific, and measurable. To be clear 
they must be readily understood, free from doubt or confusion, and 
specific goals must be explicitly set forth. They must be measurable by 
objective means. These means can include use of existing record systems, 
observations, and information from other sources.
    (d) All program evaluations require a detailed evaluation plan. The 
evaluation plan must clearly state the objectives of the program 
evaluation, the methodology to be used, resources to be committed, and a 
timetable of major phases.
    (e) Each program evaluation must be objective. It must report the 
accomplishments as well as the shortcomings of the program in an 
unbiased way. The program evaluation must have findings that give 
decision-makers information which is of a level of detail and importance 
to enable decisions to be made affecting either direction or operation. 
The information in the program evaluation must be timely, and must 
contain information of sufficient currency that decisions based on the 
data in the evaluation can be made with a high degree of confidence in 
the data.
    (f) Each program evaluation requires a systematic research design to 
collect the data necessary to measure the objectives. This research 
design should conform to the following:
    (1) Rationale. The research design for each evaluation should 
contain a specific rationale and should be structured to determine 
possible cause and effect relationships.
    (2) Relevancy. It must deal with issues currently existing within 
the program, within the Department, and within the environment in which 
the program operates.
    (3) Validity. The degree of statistical validity should be assessed 
within the research design. Alternatives include an assessment of cost 
of data collection

[[Page 14]]

vs. results necessary to support decisions.
    (4) Reliability. Use of the same research design by others should 
yield the same findings.
    (g) The final program evaluation report will be reviewed for 
comments and concurrence by relevant organizations within the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, but in no case should this review unreasonably 
delay the results of the evaluation. Where disagreement exists, the 
dissenting organization's position should be summarized for a decision 
by the Secretary.
    (h) The final program evaluation report will be forwarded, with 
approved recommendations, to the concerned organization. An action plan 
to accomplish the approved recommendations will be forwarded for 
evaluation by the evaluating entity.
    (i) Program evaluation results should be integrated to the maximum 
extent possible into Department of Veterans Affairs plans and budget 
submissions to ensure continuity with other Department of Veterans 
Affairs management processes.

Sec. 1.17  Evaluation of studies relating to health effects of dioxin and radiation exposure.

    (a) From time to time, the Secretary shall publish evaluations of 
scientific or medical studies relating to the adverse health effects of 
exposure to an herbicide containing 2, 3, 7, 8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin (dioxin) and/or exposure to ionizing radiation in the ``Notices'' 
section of the Federal Register.
    (b) Factors to be considered in evaluating scientific studies 
include:
    (1) Whether the study's findings are statistically significant and 
replicable.
    (2) Whether the study and its findings have withstood peer review.
    (3) Whether the study methodology has been sufficiently described to 
permit replication of the study.
    (4) Whether the study's findings are applicable to the veteran 
population of interest.
    (5) The views of the appropriate panel of the Scientific Council of 
the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards.
    (c) When the Secretary determines, based on the evaluation of 
scientific or medical studies and after receiving the advice of the 
Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards and applying the 
reasonable doubt doctrine as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, that a significant statistical association exists between any 
disease and exposure to an herbicide containing dioxin or exposure to 
ionizing radiation, Sec. 3.311a or Sec. 3.311b of this title, as 
appropriate, shall be amended to provide guidelines for the 
establishment of service connection.
    (d)(1) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section a significant 
statistical association shall be deemed to exist when the relative 
weights of valid positive and negative studies permit the conclusion 
that it is at least as likely as not that the purported relationship 
between a particular type of exposure and a specific adverse health 
effect exists.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph a valid study is one which:
    (i) Has adequately described the study design and methods of data 
collection, verification and analysis;
    (ii) Is reasonably free of biases, such as selection, observation 
and participation biases; however, if biases exist, the investigator has 
acknowledged them and so stated the study's conclusions that the biases 
do not intrude upon those conclusions; and
    (iii) Has satisfactorily accounted for known confounding factors.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph a valid positive study is one 
which satisfies the criteria in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and 
whose findings are statistically significant at a probability level of 
.05 or less with proper accounting for multiple comparisons and subgroup 
analyses.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph a valid negative study is one 
which satisfies the criteria in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and has 
sufficient statistical power to detect an association between a 
particular type of exposure and a specific adverse health effect if such 
an association were to exist.
    (e) For purposes of assessing the relative weights of valid positive 
and negative studies, other studies affecting

[[Page 15]]

epidemiological assessments including case series, correlational studies 
and studies with insufficient statistical power as well as key 
mechanistic and animal studies which are found to have particular 
relevance to an effect on human organ systems may also be considered.
    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, 
a significant statistical association may be deemed to exist between a 
particular exposure and a specific disease if, in the Secretary's 
judgment, scientific and medical evidence on the whole supports such a 
decision.

<R05>
Sec. 1.18  Guidelines for establishing presumptions of service connection for former prisoners of war.

    (a) Purpose. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish 
presumptions of service connection for former prisoners of war when 
necessary to prevent denials of benefits in significant numbers of 
meritorious claims.
    (b) Standard. The Secretary may establish a presumption of service 
connection for a disease when the Secretary finds that there is at least 
limited/suggestive evidence that an increased risk of such disease is 
associated with service involving detention or internment as a prisoner 
of war and an association between such detention or internment and the 
disease is biologically plausible.
    (1) Definition. The phrase ``limited/suggestive evidence'' refers to 
evidence of a sound scientific or medical nature that is reasonably 
suggestive of an association between prisoner-of-war experience and the 
disease, even though the evidence may be limited because matters such as 
chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence or 
because the relatively small size of the affected population restricts 
the data available for study.
    (2) Examples. ``Limited/suggestive evidence'' may be found where one 
high-quality study detects a statistically significant association 
between the prisoner-of-war experience and disease, even though other 
studies may be inconclusive. It also may be satisfied where several 
smaller studies detect an association that is consistent in magnitude 
and direction. These examples are not exhaustive.
    (c) Duration of detention or internment. In establishing a 
presumption of service connection under paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Secretary may, based on sound scientific or medical evidence, 
specify a minimum duration of detention or internment necessary for 
application of the presumption.
    (d) Association. The requirement in paragraph (b) of this section 
that an increased risk of disease be ``associated'' with prisoner-of-war 
service may be satisfied by evidence that demonstrates either a 
statistical association or a causal association.
    (e) Evidence. In making determinations under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the Secretary will consider, to the extent feasible:
    (1) Evidence regarding the increased incidence of disease in former 
prisoners of war;
    (2) Evidence regarding the health effects of circumstances or 
hardships similar to those experienced by prisoners of war (such as 
malnutrition, torture, physical abuse, or psychological stress);
    (3) Evidence regarding the duration of exposure to circumstances or 
hardships experienced by prisoners of war that is associated with 
particular health effects; and
    (4) Any other sound scientific or medical evidence the Secretary 
considers relevant.
    (f) Evaluation of studies. In evaluating any study for the purposes 
of this section, the Secretary will consider:
    (1) The degree to which the study's findings are statistically 
significant;
    (2) The degree to which any conclusions drawn from the study data 
have withstood peer review;
    (3) Whether the methodology used to obtain the data can be 
replicated;
    (4) The degree to which the data may be affected by chance, bias, or 
confounding factors; and
    (5) The degree to which the data may be relevant to the experience 
of prisoners of war in view of similarities or differences in the 
circumstances of the study population.

[[Page 16]]

    (g) Contracts for Scientific Review and Analysis. To assist in 
making determinations under this section, the Secretary may contract 
with an appropriate expert body to review and summarize the scientific 
evidence, and assess the strength thereof, concerning the association 
between detention or internment as a prisoner of war and the occurrence 
of any disease, or for any other purpose relevant to the Secretary's 
determinations.

or designee. The head of the facility or designee shall have authority 
to designate areas within a facility as closed to the public.
    (2) Recording presence. Admission to property during periods when 
such property is closed to the public will be limited to persons 
authorized by the head of the facility or designee. Such persons may be 
required to sign a register and/or display identification documents when 
requested to do so by VA police, or other authorized individual. No 
person, without authorization, shall enter upon or remain on such 
property while the property is closed. Failure to leave such premises by 
unauthorized persons shall constitute an offense under this paragraph.
    (3) Preservation of property. The improper disposal of rubbish on 
property; the spitting on the property; the creation of any hazard on 
property to persons or things; the throwing of articles of any kind from

exercise of the law enforcement and arrest authority vested in them and 
to assure their abilities in the safe handling of situations involving 
patients and the public in general. VA police officers will successfully 
complete prescribed training in law enforcement procedures and the safe 
handling of patients as a condition of their retention of statutory law 
enforcement and arrest authority.
    (3) Nothing contained in the rules and regulations set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to abrogate any other 
Federal laws or regulations, including assimilated offenses under 18 
U.S.C. 13, or any State or local laws and regulations applicable to the

Sec. 1.303  Policy.

    (a) General. Parking spaces at VA medical facilities shall only be 
provided under the following conditions:
    (1) VA and its employees shall not be liable for any damages to 
vehicles (or their contents) parked in VA parking facilities, unless 
such damages are directly caused by such employees acting in the course 
of their VA employment.
    (2) Parking facilities at VA medical facilities shall only be made 
available at each medical facility for such periods and under such terms 
as prescribed by the facility director, consistent with Sec. Sec. 1.300 
through 1.303.
    (3) VA will limit parking facilities at VA medical facilities to the 
minimum necessary, and administer those parking facilities in full 
compliance with ridesharing regulations and Federal laws.
    (b) Fees. (1) As provided in Sec. 1.302, VA will assess VA 
employees, contractor employees, tenant employees, visitors, and other 
individuals having business at a VA medical facility where VA parking 
facilities are available, a parking fee for the use of that parking 
facility. All parking fees shall be set at a rate which shall be

shall include an allowance for the costs of management of the parking 
facilities. The Secretary will determine the fair market rental value 
through use of generally accepted appraisal techniques. If the

[[Page 22]]

appraisal establishes that there is no comparable commercial rate 
because of the absence of commercial parking facilities within a two-
mile radius of the medical facility, then the rate established shall be 
not less than the lowest rate charged for parking at the VA medical 
facility with the lowest established parking fees. Rates established 
shall be reviewed biannually by the Secretary to reflect any increase or 
decrease in value as determined by appraisal updating.
    (2) No parking fees shall be established or collected for parking 
facilities used by or for vehicles of the following:
    (i) Volunteer workers in connection with such workers performing 
services for the benefit of veterans receiving care at the medical 
facility;

or eligible person receiving examination or treatment;
    (iii) An individual transporting a veteran or eligible person 
seeking examination or treatment; and

    Organ Procurement Organization. The term ``Organ Procurement 
Organization'' (OPO) means an organization that performs or coordinates 
the procurement, preservation, and transportation of organs and 
maintains a system of locating prospective recipients for available 
organs.
    Patient. The term ``patient'' means any individual or subject who

alcoholism or alcohol abuse, infection with the human immunodeficiency 
virus, or sickle cell anemia and includes any individual who, after 
arrest on a criminal charge, is interviewed and/or tested in connection 
with drug abuse, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus, or sickle cell anemia in order to determine that 
individual's eligibility to participate in a treatment or rehabilitation 
program. The term patient includes an individual who has been diagnosed 
or treated for alcoholism, drug abuse, HIV infection, or sickle cell 
anemia for purposes of participation in a VA program or activity 
relating to those four conditions, including a program or activity 
consisting of treatment, rehabilitation, education, training, 
evaluation, or research. The term ``patient'' for the purpose of 
infection with the human immunodeficiency virus or sickle cell anemia, 
includes one tested for the disease.
    Patient identifying information. The term ``patient identifying 
information'' means the name, address, social

[[Page 24]]

security number, fingerprints, photograph, or similar information by

contractor of VA, for the purpose of seeking or performing VA program or 
activity functions relating to drug abuse, alcoholism, tests for or 
infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, or sickle cell anemia 
regarding an identifiable patient. A program or activity function 
relating to drug abuse, alcoholism, infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus, or sickle cell anemia includes evaluation, 
treatment, education, training, rehabilitation, research, or referral 
for one of these conditions. Sections 1.460 through 1.499 of this part 
apply to a primary or other diagnosis, or other information which 
identifies, or could reasonably be expected to identify, a patient as 
having a drug or alcohol abuse condition, infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus, or sickle cell anemia (e.g., alcoholic 
psychosis, drug dependence), but only if such diagnosis or information 
is received, obtained or maintained for the purpose of seeking or 
performing one of the above program or activity functions. Sections 
1.460 through 1.499 of this part do not apply if such diagnosis or other 
information is not received, obtained or maintained for the purpose of 
seeking or performing a function or activity relating to drug abuse, 
alcoholism, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, or sickle 
cell anemia for the patient in question. Whenever such diagnosis or 
other information, not originally received or obtained for the purpose 
of obtaining or providing one of the above program or activity 
functions, is subsequently used in connection with such program or 
activity functions, those original entries become a ``record'' and 
Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part thereafter apply to those 
entries. Segregability: these regulations do not apply to records or 
information contained therein, the disclosure of which (the 
circumstances surrounding the disclosure having been considered) could 
not reasonably be expected to disclose the fact that a patient has been 
connected with a VA program or activity function relating to drug abuse, 
alcoholism, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, or sickle 
cell anemia.
    (1) The following are examples of instances whereby records or 
information related to alcoholism or drug abuse are covered by the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part:
    (i) A patient with alcoholic delirium tremens is admitted for 
detoxification. The patient is offered treatment in a VA alcohol 
rehabilitation program which he declines.
    (ii) A patient who is diagnosed as a drug abuser applies for and is 
provided VA drug rehabilitation treatment.
    (iii) While undergoing treatment for an unrelated medical condition, 
a patient discusses with the physician his use and abuse of alcohol. The

    (2) The following are examples of instances whereby records or 
information related to alcoholism or drug abuse are not covered by the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part:
    (i) A patient with alcoholic delirium tremens is admitted for 
detoxification, treated and released with no counseling or treatment for 
the underlying condition of alcoholism.
    (ii) While undergoing treatment for an unrelated medical condition, 
a patient informs the physician of a history of drug abuse fifteen years 
earlier with

[[Page 25]]

no ingestion of drugs since. The history and diagnosis of drug abuse is 
documented in the hospital summary and no treatment is sought by the 
patient or offered or provided by VA during the current period of 
treatment.
    (iii) While undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in an 
accident, a patient's medical record is documented to support the 
judgment of the physician to prescribe certain alternate medications in 
order to avoid possible drug interactions in view of the patient's 
enrollment and treatment in a non-VA methadone maintenance program. The 
patient states that continued treatment and follow-up will be obtained 
from private physicians and VA treatment for the drug abuse is not 
sought by the patient nor provided or offered by the staff.
    (iv) A patient is admitted to the emergency room suffering from a 
possible drug overdose. The patient is treated and released; a history 
and diagnosis of drug abuse may be documented in the hospital summary. 
The patient is not offered treatment for the underlying conditions of 
drug abuse, nor is treatment sought by the patient for that condition.
    Third party payer. The term ``third party payer'' means a person who 
pays, or agrees to pay, for diagnosis or treatment furnished to a 
patient on the basis of a contractual relationship with the patient or a 
member of his or her family or on the basis of the patient's eligibility 
for Federal, State, or local governmental benefits.
    Treatment. The term ``treatment'' means the management and care of a 
patient for drug abuse, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, infection with the 
human immunodeficiency virus, or sickle cell anemia, or a condition 
which is identified as having been caused by one or more of these 
conditions, in order to reduce or eliminate the adverse effects upon the 
patient. The term includes testing for the human immunodeficiency virus 
or sickle cell anemia.
    Undercover agent. The term ``undercover agent'' means an officer of 
any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency who becomes a 
patient or employee for the purpose of investigating a suspected 
violation of law or who pursues that purpose after becoming a patient or 
becoming employed for other purposes.
    VHA health care facilty. The term ``VHA health care facility'' means 
a VA medical center, VA emergency room, VA nursing home or other 
facility as defined in 38 U.S.C. 1701(3).

treatment program pursuant to an authorizing court order, may be used to 
criminally investigate or prosecute any patient unless authorized 
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.494 of this part.
    (iii) The enrollment of an undercover agent or informant in a 
treatment unit shall not be deemed a violation of this section if the 
enrollment is solely for the purpose of enabling the individual to 
obtain treatment for drug or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, or sickle 
cell anemia.
    (d) Applicability to recipients of information--(1) Restriction on 
use of information. In the absence of a proper Sec. 1.494 court order,

[[Page 27]]

crime. Information obtained by undercover agents or informants (see 
paragraph (c) of this section) or through patient access (see Sec.

<R05>
Sec. 1.462  Confidentiality restrictions.

    (a) General. The patient records to which Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 
1.499 of this part apply may be disclosed or used only as permitted by 
these regulations and may not otherwise be disclosed or used in any 
civil, criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings conducted by 
any Federal, State, or local authority. Any disclosure made under these 
regulations must be limited to that information which is necessary to 
carry out the purpose of the disclosure.
    (b) Unconditional compliance required. The restrictions on 
disclosure and use in Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part apply 
whether the person seeking the information already has it, has other 
means of obtaining it, is a law enforcement or other official, has 
obtained a subpoena, or asserts any other justification for a disclosure 
or use which is not permitted by Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this 
part. These provisions do not prohibit VA from acting accordingly when 
there is no disclosure of information.
    (c) Acknowledging the presence of patients: responding to requests. 
(1) The presence of an identified patient in a VA facility for the 
treatment or other VA program activity relating to drug abuse, 
alcoholism or alcohol abuse, infection with the HIV, or sickle cell 
anemia may be acknowledged only if the patient's written consent is 
obtained in accordance with Sec. 1.475 of this part or if an 
authorizing court order is entered in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.490 
through 1.499 of this part. Acknowledgment of the presence of an 
identified patient in a facility is permitted if the acknowledgment does 
not reveal that the patient is being treated for or is otherwise 
involved in a VA program or activity concerning drug abuse, alcoholism 
or alcohol abuse, infection with the HIV, or sickle cell anemia.
    (2) Any answer to a request for a disclosure of patient records 
which is not permissible under Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this 
part must be made in a way that will not affirmatively reveal that an 
identified individual has been, or is being diagnosed or treated for 
drug abuse, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, infection with the HIV, or 
sickle cell anemia. These regulations do not restrict a disclosure that 
an identified individual is not and never has been a patient.

Sec. 1.464  Minor patients.

    (a) Definition of minor. As used in Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 
of this part the term ``minor'' means a person who has not attained the 
age of majority specified in the applicable State law, or if no age of 
majority is specified in the applicable State law, the age of eighteen 
years.
    (b) State law not requiring parental consent to treatment. If a 
minor patient acting alone has the legal capacity under the applicable 
State law to apply for and obtain treatment for drug abuse, alcoholism 
or alcohol abuse, infection with the HIV, or sickle cell anemia, any 
written consent for disclosure authorized under Sec. 1.475 of this part 
may be given only by the minor patient. This restriction includes, but 
is not limited to, any disclosure of patient identifying information to 
the parent or guardian of a minor patient for the purpose of obtaining 
financial reimbursement. Sections 1.460 through 1.499 of this part do 
not prohibit a VA facility from refusing to provide nonemergent 
treatment to an otherwise

[[Page 28]]

ineligible minor patient until the minor patient consents to the 
disclosure necessary to obtain reimbursement for services from a third 
party payer.
    (c) State law requiring parental consent to treatment. (1) Where 
State law requires consent of a parent, guardian, or other person for a 
minor to obtain treatment for drug abuse, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, 
infection with the HIV, or sickle cell anemia, any written consent for 
disclosure authorized under Sec. 1.475 of this part must be given by 
both the minor and his or her parent, guardian, or other person 
authorized under State law to act in the minor's behalf.
    (2) Where State law requires parental consent to treatment, the fact 
of a minor's application for treatment may be communicated to the 
minor's parent, guardian, or other person authorized under State law to 
act in the minor's behalf only if:
    (i) The minor has given written consent to the disclosure in 
accordance with Sec. 1.475 of this part; or
    (ii) The minor lacks the capacity to make a rational choice 
regarding such consent as judged by the appropriate VA facility director 
under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Minor applicant for service lacks capacity for rational choice. 
Facts relevant to reducing a threat to the life or physical well being 
of the applicant or any other individual may be disclosed to the parent, 
guardian, or other person authorized under State law to act in the 
minor's behalf if the appropriate VA facility director judges that:
    (1) A minor applicant for services lacks capacity because of extreme 
youth or mental or physical condition to make a rational decision on 
whether to consent to a disclosure under Sec. 1.475 of this part to his 
or her parent, guardian, or other person authorized under State law to 
act in the minor's behalf, and
    (2) The applicant's situation poses a substantial threat to the life 
or physical well-being of the applicant or any other individual which 
may be reduced by communicating relevant facts to the minor's parent, 
guardian, or other person authorized under State law to act in the 
minor's behalf.

Sec. 1.465  Incompetent and deceased patients.

    (a) Incompetent patients other than minors. In the case of a patient 
who has been adjudicated as lacking the capacity, for any reason other 
than insufficient age, to manage his or her own affairs, any consent 
which is required under Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part may 
be given by a court appointed legal guardian.
    (b) Deceased patients--(1) Vital statistics. Sec. 1.460 through 
1.499 of this part do not restrict the disclosure of patient identifying 
information relating to the cause of death of a patient under laws 
requiring the collection of death or other vital statistics or 
permitting inquiry into the cause of death.
    (2) Consent by personal representative. Any other disclosure of 
information identifying a deceased patient as being treated for drug 
abuse, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, infection with the HIV, or sickle 
cell anemia is subject to Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part. 
If a written consent to the disclosure is required, the Under Secretary 
for Health or designee may, upon the prior written request of the next 
of kin, executor/executrix, administrator/administratrix, or other 
personal representative of such deceased patient, disclose the contents 
of such records, only if the Under Secretary for Health or designee 
determines such disclosure is necessary to obtain survivorship benefits 
for the deceased patient's survivor. This would include not only VA 
benefits, but also payments by the Social Security Administration, 
Worker's Compensation Boards or Commissions, or other Federal, State, or 
local government agencies, or nongovernment entities, such as life 
insurance companies.
    (3) Information related to sickle cell anemia. Information related 
to sickle cell anemia may be released to a blood relative of a deceased 
veteran for medical follow-up or family planning purposes.

Sec. 1.466  Security for records.

    (a) Written records which are subject to Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 
1.499 of this part must be maintained in a secure room, locked file 
cabinet, safe or other similar container when not in use. Access to 
information stored in computers will be limited to authorized VA 
employees who have a need for the information in performing their 
duties. These security precautions shall be consistent with the Privacy 
Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).
    (b) Each VA facility shall adopt in writing procedures related to 
the access to and use of records which are subject to Sec. Sec. 1.460 
through 1.499 of this part.

Sec. 1.467  Restrictions on the use of identification cards and public signs.

    (a) No facility may require any patient to carry on their person 
while away from the facility premises any card or other object which 
would identify the patient as a participant in any VA drug abuse, 
alcoholism or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, or sickle cell anemia 
treatment program. A facility may require patients to use or carry cards 
or other identification objects on the premises of a facility. Patients 
may not be required to wear clothing or colored identification bracelets 
or display objects openly to all facility staff or others which would 
identify them as being treated for drug or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, 
or sickle cell anemia.
    (b) Treatment locations should not be identified by signs that would 
identify individuals entering or exiting these locations as patients 
enrolled in a drug or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, or sickle cell 
anemia program or activity.

<R05>
Sec. 1.468  Relationship to Federal statutes protecting research subjects against compulsory disclosure of their identity.

    (a) Research privilege description. There may be concurrent coverage 
of patient identifying information by the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.460 
through 1.499 of this part and by administrative action taken under Sec. 
303(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241(d) and the 
implementing regulations at 42 CFR Part 2a); or Sec. 502(c) of the 
Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 872(c) and the implementing 
regulations at 21 CFR 1316.21). These ``research privilege'' statutes 
confer on the Secretary of Health and Human Services and on the Attorney 
General, respectively, the power to authorize researchers conducting 
certain types of research to withhold from all persons not connected 
with the research the names and other identifying information concerning 
individuals who are the subjects of the research.
    (b) Effect of concurrent coverage. Sections 1.460 through 1.499 of 
this part restrict the disclosure and use of information about patients, 
while administrative action taken under the research privilege statutes 
and implementing regulations protects a person engaged in applicable 
research from being compelled to disclose any identifying 
characteristics of the individuals who are the subjects of that 
research. The issuance under Sec. Sec. 1.490 through 1.499 of this part 
of a court order authorizing a disclosure of information about a patient 
does not affect an exercise of authority under these research privilege 
statutes. However, the research privilege granted under 21 CFR 
291.505(g) to treatment programs using methadone for maintenance 
treatment does not protect from compulsory disclosure any information 
which is permitted to be disclosed under those regulations. Thus, if a 
court order entered in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.490 through 1.499 of 
this part authorizes a VA facility to disclose certain information about 
its patients, the facility may not invoke the research privilege under 
21 CFR 291.505(g) as a defense to a subpoena for that information.

Sec. 1.469  Patient access and restrictions on use.

    (a) Patient access not prohibited. Sections 1.460 through 1.499 of 
this part do not prohibit a facility from giving a patient access to his 
or her own records, including the opportunity to inspect and copy any 
records that VA maintains about the patient, subject to the provisions 
of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C.

[[Page 30]]

552a(d)(1)) and 38 CFR 1.577. If the patient is accompanied, giving 
access to the patient and the accompanying person will require a written 
consent by the patient which is provided in accordance with Sec. 1.475 
of this part.
    (b) Restrictions on use of information. Information obtained by 
patient access to patient record is subject to the restriction on use of 
this information to initiate or substantiate any criminal charges 
against the patient or to conduct any criminal investigation of the 
patient as provided for under Sec. 1.461(d)(1) of this part.

                   Disclosures With Patient's Consent


<R05>
Sec. 1.475  Form of written consent.

    (a) Required elements. A written consent to a disclosure under 
Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part must include:
    (1) The name of the facility permitted to make the disclosure (such 
a designation does not preclude the release of records from other VA 
health care facilities unless a restriction is stated on the consent).
    (2) The name or title of the individual or the name of the 
organization to which disclosure is to be made.
    (3) The name of the patient.
    (4) The purpose of the disclosure.
    (5) How much and what kind of information is to be disclosed.
    (6) The signature of the patient and, when required for a patient 
who is a minor, the signature of a person authorized to give consent 
under Sec. 1.464 of this part; or, when required for a patient who is 
incompetent or deceased, the signature of a person authorized to sign 
under Sec. 1.465 of this part in lieu of the patient.
    (7) The date on which the consent is signed.
    (8) A statement that the consent is subject to revocation at any 
time except to the extent that the facility which is to make the 
disclosure has already acted in reliance on it. Acting in reliance 
includes the provision of treatment services in reliance on a valid 
consent to disclose information to a third party payer.
    (9) The date, event, or condition upon which the consent will expire 
if not revoked before. This date, event, or condition must ensure that 
the consent will last no longer than reasonably necessary to serve the 
purpose for which it is given.
    (b) Expired, deficient, or false consent. A disclosure may not be 
made on the basis of a consent which:
    (1) Has expired;
    (2) On its face substantially fails to conform to any of the 
requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section;
    (3) Is known to have been revoked; or
    (4) Is known, or through a reasonable effort could be known, by 
responsible personnel of VA to be materially false.
    (c) Notification of deficient consent. Other than the patient, no 
person or entity may be advised that a special consent is required in 
order to disclose information relating to an individual participating in 
a drug abuse, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, HIV, or sickle cell anemia 
program or activity. Where a person or entity presents VA with an 
insufficient written consent for information protected by 38 U.S.C. 
7332, VA must, in the process of obtaining a legally sufficient consent, 
correspond only with the patient whose records are involved, or the 
legal guardian of an incompetent patient or next of kin of a deceased 
patient, and not with any other person.
    (d) It is not necessary to use any particular form to establish a 
consent referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, however, VA Form 
10-5345, titled Request for and Consent to Release of Medical Records 
Protected by 38 U.S.C. 7332, may be used for such purpose.

<R05>
Sec. 1.476  Prohibition on redisclosure.

    Each disclosure under Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part 
made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by a written 
statement similar to the following:

    This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by 
Federal confidentiality rules (38 CFR Part 1). The Federal rules 
prohibit you from making any further disclosure of this information 
unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent 
of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by 38 CFR

[[Page 31]]

Part 1. A general authorization for the release of medical or other 
information is NOT sufficient for this purpose. The Federal rules 
restrict any use of the information to criminally investigate or 
prosecute any alcohol or drug abuse patient or patient with sickle cell 
anemia or HIV infection.

    If a patient consents to a disclosure of his or her records under 
Sec. 1.475 of this part, a facility may disclose those records in 
accordance with that consent to any individual or organization named in 
the consent, except that disclosures to central registries and in 
connection with criminal justice referrals must meet the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 1.478 and 1.479 of this part, respectively.

Sec. 1.478  Disclosures to prevent multiple enrollments in detoxification and 

maintenance treatment programs; not applicable to records relating to sickle cell anemia or infection with the human immunodeficiency virus.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Central registry means an organization which obtains from two or 
more member programs patient identifying information about individuals 
applying for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment for the 
purpose of avoiding an individual's concurrent enrollment in more than 
one program.
    (2) Detoxification treatment means the dispensing of a narcotic drug 
in decreasing doses to an individual in order to reduce or eliminate 
adverse physiological or psychological effects incident to withdrawal 
from the sustained use of a narcotic drug.
    (3) Maintenance treatment means the dispensing of a narcotic drug in 
the treatment of an individual for dependence upon heroin or other 
morphine-like drugs.
    (4) Member program means a non-VA detoxification treatment or 
maintenance treatment program which reports patient identifying 
information to a central registry and which is in the same State as that 
central registry or is not more than 125 miles from any border of the 
State in which the central registry is located.
    (b) Restrictions on disclosure. VA may disclose patient records to a 
central registry which is located in the same State or is not more than 
125 miles from any border of the State or to any non-VA detoxification 
or maintenance treatment program not more than 200 miles away for the 
purpose of preventing the multiple enrollment of a patient only if:
    (1) The disclosure is made when:
    (i) The patient is accepted for treatment;
    (ii) The type or dosage of the drug is changed; or
    (iii) The treatment is interrupted, resumed or terminated.
    (2) The disclosure is limited to:
    (i) Patient identifying information;
    (ii) Type and dosage of the drug; and
    (iii) Relevant dates.
    (3) The disclosure is made with the patient's written consent 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 1.475 of this part, except that:
    (i) The consent must list the name and address of each central 
registry and each known non-VA detoxification or maintenance treatment 
program to which a disclosure will be made; and
    (ii) The consent may authorize a disclosure to any non-VA 
detoxification or maintenance treatment program established within 200 
miles after the consent is given without naming any such program.
    (c) Use of information limited to prevention of multiple 
enrollments. A central registry and any non-VA detoxification or 
maintenance treatment program to which information is disclosed to 
prevent multiple enrollments may not redisclose or use patient 
identifying information for any purpose other than the prevention of 
multiple enrollments unless authorized by a court order under Sec. Sec. 
1.490 through 1.499 of this part.

Sec. 1.479  Disclosures to elements of the criminal justice system which have referred patients.

    (a) VA may disclose information about a patient from records covered 
by Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part to

[[Page 32]]

those persons within the criminal justice system which have made 
participation in a VA treatment program a condition of the disposition 
of any criminal proceedings against the patient or of the patient's 
parole or other release from custody if:
    (1) The disclosure is made only to those individuals within the 
criminal justice system who have a need for the information in 
connection with their duty to monitor the patient's progress (e.g., a 
prosecuting attorney who is withholding charges against the patient, a 
court granting pretrial or posttrial release, probation or parole 
officers responsible for supervision of the patient); and
    (2) The patient has signed a written consent as a condition of 
admission to the treatment program meeting the requirements of Sec. 
1.475 of this part (except paragraph (a)(8) which is inconsistent with 
the revocation provisions of paragraph (c) of this section) and the 
requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Duration of consent. The written consent must state the period 
during which it remains in effect. This period must be reasonable, 
taking into account:
    (1) The anticipated length of the treatment recognizing that 
revocation of consent may not generally be effected while treatment is 
ongoing;
    (2) The type of criminal proceeding involved, the need for the 
information in connection with the final disposition of that proceeding, 
and when the final disposition will occur; and
    (3) Such other factors as the facility, the patient, and the 
person(s) who will receive the disclosure consider pertinent.
    (c) Revocation of consent. The written consent must state that it is 
revocable upon the passage of a specified amount of time or the 
occurrence of a specified, ascertainable event. The time or occurrence 
upon which consent becomes revocable may be no earlier than the 
individual's completion of the treatment program and no later than the 
final disposition of the conditional release or other action in 
connection with which consent was given.
    (d) Restrictions on redisclosure and use. A person who receives 
patient information under this section may redisclose and use it only to 
carry out that person's official duties with regard to the patient's 
conditional release or other action in connection with which the consent 
was given, including parole.

    (2) The VA medical facility director determines to be qualified to 
conduct the audit or evaluation activities.
    (c) Congressional oversight. Records subject to Sec. Sec. 1.460 
through 1.499 of this part upon written request may be released to 
congressional committees or subcommittees for program oversight and 
evaluation if such records pertain to any matter within the jurisdiction 
of such committee or subcommittee.
    (d) Limitation on disclosure and use. Records containing patient 
identifying information disclosed under this section may be disclosed

              Court Orders Authorizing Disclosures and Use


<R05>
Sec. 1.490  Legal effect of order.

    The records to which Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part 
apply may be disclosed if authorized by an appropriate order of a court 
of competent jurisdiction granted after application showing good cause 
therefore. In assessing good cause the court is statutorily required to 
weigh the public interest and the need for disclosure against the injury 
to the patient or subject, to the physician-patient relationship, and to 
the treatment services. Upon the granting of such order, the court, in 
determining the extent to which any disclosure of all or any part of any 
record is necessary, is required by statute to impose appropriate 
safeguards against unauthorized disclosure. An order of a court of 
competent jurisdiction to produce records subject to Sec. Sec. 1.460 
through 1.499 of this part will not be sufficient unless the order 
reflects that the court has complied with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 
7332(b)(2)(D). Such an order from a Federal court compels disclosure. 
However, such an order from a State court only acts to authorize the 
Secretary to exercise discretion pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 5701(b)(5) and 38 
CFR 1.511 to disclose such records. It does not compel disclosure.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7332(b)(2)(D))


<R05>
Sec. 1.491  Confidential communications.

    (a) A court order under Sec. Sec. 1.490 through 1.499 of this part 
may authorize disclosure of confidential communications made by a 
patient to a treatment program in the course of diagnosis, treatment, or 
referral for treatment only if:
    (1) The disclosure is necessary to protect against an existing 
threat to life or of serious bodily injury, including circumstances 
which constitute suspected child abuse and neglect and verbal threats 
against third parties;
    (2) The disclosure is necessary in connection with investigation or 
prosecution of an extremely serious crime, such as one which directly 
threatens loss of life or serious bodily injury, including homicide, 
rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, or child 
abuse and neglect; or
    (3) The disclosure is in connection with litigation or an 
administrative proceeding in which the patient offers testimony or other 
evidence pertaining to the content of the confidential communications.
    (b) [Reserved]

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7334)


<R05>
Sec. 1.492  Order not applicable to records disclosed without consent to researchers, auditors and evaluators.

    A court order under Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part may 
not authorize qualified personnel, who have received patient identifying 
information from VA without consent for the purpose of conducting 
research, audit or evaluation, to disclose that information or use it to 
conduct any criminal investigation or prosecution of a patient. However, 
a court order under Sec. 1.495 of this part may authorize disclosure 
and use of records to investigate or prosecute VA personnel.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7334)


<R05>
Sec. 1.493  Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing disclosures for noncriminal purposes.

    (a) Application. An order authorizing the disclosure of patient 
records covered by Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part for 
purposes other than criminal investigation or prosecution may be applied 
for by any person having a legally recognized interest in the disclosure 
which is sought. The application may be filed separately or as part of a 
pending civil action in which it appears that the patient records are 
needed to provide evidence. An application must use a fictitious name, 
such as John Doe, to refer to any patient and may not contain or 
otherwise disclose any patient identifying information unless the 
patient is the applicant or has given a written consent (meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 1.475 of this part) to disclosure or the court has 
ordered the record of the proceeding sealed from public scrutiny.
    (b) Notice. The patient and VA facility from whom disclosure is 
sought must be given:
    (1) Adequate notice in a manner which will not disclose patient 
identifying information to other persons; and

[[Page 36]]

    (2) An opportunity to file a written response to the application, or 
to appear in person, for the limited purpose of providing evidence on 
whether the statutory and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the 
court order are met.
    (c) Review of evidence: Conduct of hearing. Any oral argument, 
review of evidence, or hearing on the application must be held in the 
judge's chambers or in some manner which ensures that patient 
identifying information is not disclosed to anyone other than a party to 
the proceeding, the patient, or VA, unless the patient requests an open 
hearing in a manner which meets the written consent requirements of 
Sec. 1.475 of this part. The proceeding may include an examination by 
the judge of the patient records referred to in the application.
    (d) Criteria for entry of order. An order under this section may be 
entered only if the court determines that good cause exists. To make 
this determination the court must find that:
    (1) Other ways of obtaining the information are not available or 
would not be effective; and
    (2) The public interest and need for the disclosure outweigh the 
potential injury to the patient, the physician-patient relationship and 
the treatment services.
    (e) Content of order. An order authorizing a disclosure must:
    (1) Limit disclosure to those parts of the patient's record which 
are essential to fulfill the objective of the order;
    (2) Limit disclosure to those persons whose need for information is 
the basis for the order; and
    (3) Include such other measures as are necessary to limit disclosure 
for the protection of the patient, the physician-patient relationship 
and the treatment services; for example, sealing from public scrutiny 
the record of any proceeding for which disclosure of a patient's record 
has been ordered.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7334)


<R05>
Sec. 1.494  Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing disclosure and use of records to criminally investigate or prosecute patients.

    (a) Application. An order authorizing the disclosure or use of 
patient records covered by Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part 
to criminally investigate or prosecute a patient may be applied for by 
VA or by any person conducting investigative or prosecutorial activities 
with respect to the enforcement of criminal laws. The application may be 
filed separately, as part of an application for a subpoena or other 
compulsory process, or in a pending criminal action. An application must 
use a fictitious name such as John Doe, to refer to any patient and may 
not contain or otherwise disclose patient identifying information unless 
the court has ordered the record of the proceeding sealed from public 
scrutiny.
    (b) Notice and hearing. Unless an order under Sec. 1.495 of this 
part is sought with an order under this section, VA must be given:
    (1) Adequate notice (in a manner which will not disclose patient 
identifying information to third parties) of an application by a person 
performing a law enforcement function;
    (2) An opportunity to appear and be heard for the limited purpose of 
providing evidence on the statutory and regulatory criteria for the 
issuance of the court order; and
    (3) An opportunity to be represented by counsel.
    (c) Review of evidence: Conduct of hearings. Any oral argument, 
review of evidence, or hearing on the application shall be held in the 
judge's chambers or in some other manner which ensures that patient 
identifying information is not disclosed to anyone other than a party to 
the proceedings, the patient, or VA. The proceeding may include an 
examination by the judge of the patient records referred to in the 
application.
    (d) Criteria. A court may authorize the disclosure and use of 
patient records for the purpose of conducting a criminal investigation 
or prosecution of a patient only if the court finds that all of the 
following criteria are met:
    (1) The crime involved is extremely serious, such as one which 
causes or directly threatens loss of life or serious bodily injury 
including, but not limited to, homicide, rape, kidnapping, armed 
robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and child abuse and neglect.

[[Page 37]]

    (2) There is a reasonable likelihood that the records will disclose 
information of substantial value in the investigation or prosecution.
    (3) Other ways of obtaining the information are not available or 
would not be effective.
    (4) The potential injury to the patient, to the physician-patient 
relationship and to the ability of VA to provide services to other 
patients is outweighed by the public interest and the need for the 
disclosure.
    (5) If the applicant is a person performing a law enforcement 
function, VA has been represented by counsel independent of the 
applicant.
    (e) Content of order. Any order authorizing a disclosure or use of 
patient records under this section must:
    (1) Limit disclosure and use to those parts of the patient's record 
which are essential to fulfill the objective of the order;
    (2) Limit disclosure to those law enforcement and prosecutorial 
officials who are responsible for, or are conducting, the investigation 
or prosecution, and limit their use of the records to investigation and 
prosecution of extremely serious crime or suspected crime specified in 
the applications; and
    (3) Include such other measures as are necessary to limit disclosure 
and use to the fulfillment on only that public interest and need found 
by the court.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7332(c))


<R05>
Sec. 1.495  Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing disclosure and use of records to investigate or prosecute VA or employees of VA.

    (a) Application. (1) An order authorizing the disclosure or use of 
patient records covered by Sec. Sec. 1.460 through 1.499 of this part 
to criminally or administratively investigate or prosecute VA (or 
employees or agents of VA) may be applied for by an administrative, 
regulatory, supervisory, investigative, law enforcement, or 
prosecutorial agency having jurisdiction over VA activities.
    (2) The application may be filed separately or as part of a pending 
civil or criminal action against VA (or agents or employees of VA) in 
which it appears that the patient records are needed to provide material 
evidence. The application must use a fictitious name, such as John Doe, 
to refer to any patient and may not contain or otherwise disclose any 
patient identifying information unless the court has ordered the record 
of the proceeding sealed from public scrutiny or the patient has given a 
written consent (meeting the requirements of Sec. 1.475 of this part) 
to that disclosure.
    (b) Notice not required. An application under this section may, in 
the discretion of the court, be granted without notice. Although no 
express notice is required to VA or to any patient whose records are to 
be disclosed, upon implementation of an order so granted VA or the 
patient must be afforded an opportunity to seek revocation or amendment 
of that order, limited to the presentation of evidence on the statutory 
and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court order.
    (c) Requirements for order. An order under this section must be 
entered in accordance with, and comply with the requirements of, Sec. 
1.493(d) and (e) of this part.
    (d) Limitations on disclosure and use of patient identifying 
information. (1) An order entered under this section must require the 
deletion of patient identifying information from any documents made 
available to the public.
    (2) No information obtained under this section may be used to 
conduct any investigation or prosecution of a patient, or be used as the 
basis for an application for an order under Sec. 1.494 of this part.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7334)


<R05>
Sec. 1.496  Orders authorizing the use of undercover agents and informants to criminally investigate employees or agents of VA.

    (a) Application. A court order authorizing the placement of an 
undercover agent or informant in a VA drug or alcohol abuse, HIV 
infection, or sickle cell anemia treatment program as an employee or 
patient may be applied for by any law enforcement or prosecutorial 
agency which has reason to believe that employees or agents of the VA 
treatment program are engaged in criminal misconduct.
    (b) Notice. The VA facility director must be given adequate notice 
of the

[[Page 38]]

application and an opportunity to appear and be heard (for the limited 
purpose of providing evidence on the statutory and regulatory criteria 
for the issuance of the court order), unless the application asserts a 
belief that:
    (1) The VA facility director is involved in the criminal activities 
to be investigated by the undercover agent or informant; or
    (2) The VA facility director will intentionally or unintentionally 
disclose the proposed placement of an undercover agent or informant to 
the employees or agents who are suspected of criminal activities.
    (c) Criteria. An order under this section may be entered only if the 
court determines that good cause exists. To make this determination the 
court must find:
    (1) There is reason to believe that an employee or agent of a VA 
treatment program is engaged in criminal activity;
    (2) Other ways of obtaining evidence of this criminal activity are 
not available or would not be effective; and
    (3) The public interest and need for the placement of an undercover 
agent or informant in the VA treatment program outweigh the potential 
injury to patients of the program, physician-patient relationships and 
the treatment services.
    (d) Content of order. An order authorizing the placement of an 
undercover agent or informant in a VA treatment program must:
    (1) Specifically authorize the placement of an undercover agent or 
an informant;
    (2) Limit the total period of the placement to six months;
    (3) Prohibit the undercover agent or informant from disclosing any 
patient identifying information obtained from the placement except as 
necessary to criminally investigate or prosecute employees or agents of 
the VA treatment program; and
    (4) Include any other measures which are appropriate to limit any 
potential disruption of the program by the placement and any potential 
for a real or apparent breach of patient confidentiality; for example, 
sealing from public scrutiny the record of any proceeding for which 
disclosure of a patient's record has been ordered.
    (e) Limitation on use of information. No information obtained by an 
undercover agent or informant placed under this section may be used to 
criminally investigate or prosecute any patient or as the basis for an 
application for an order under Sec. 1.494 of this part.

                                 Records

    Note: Sections 1.500 through 1.527 concern the availability and 
release of information from files, records, reports, and other papers

Affairs. As to the release of information from Department of Veterans 
Affairs records other than claimant records, see Sec. Sec. 1.550 
through 1.558. Sections 1.500 through 1.526 implement the provisions of 
38 U.S.C. 5701, 5702.

Sec. 1.500  General.

    (a) Files, records, reports, and other papers and documents 
pertaining to any claim filed with the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
whether pending or adjudicated, and the names and addresses of present 
or former personnel of the armed services, and their dependents, in the 
possession of the Department of Veterans Affairs, will be deemed 
confidential and privileged, and no disclosure therefrom will be made 
except in the circumstances and under the conditions set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 1.501 through 1.526.
    (b) A claimant may not have access to or custody of official 
Department of Veterans Affairs records concerning himself or herself nor

of information from Department of Veterans Affairs records to a claimant 
or his or her duly authorized agent or representative may be made, 
however, under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.501 through 1.526.

[[Page 39]]

    (c) Each administration, staff office, and field facility head will 
designate an employee(s) who will be responsible for initial action on 
(granting or denying) requests to inspect or obtain information from or 
copies of records under their jurisdiction and within the purview of 
Sec. Sec. 1.501 through 1.526 unless the regulations in this part 
currently contain such designations. The request should be made to the 
office concerned (having jurisdiction of the record desired) or, if not 
known, to the Director or Veterans Assistance Officer in the nearest VA 
regional office, or to the VA Central Office, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., 
Washington, DC 20420. Personal contacts should normally be made during 
the regular duty hours of the office concerned, which are 8 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m., Monday through Friday, for VA Central Office and most field 
facilities. Any legal question arising in a field facility concerning 
the release of information will be referred to the appropriate Regional 
Counsel for disposition as contemplated by Sec. 13.401 of this chapter. 
In central office such legal questions will be referred to the General 
Counsel. Any administrative question will be referred through 
administrative channels to the appropriate administration or staff 
office head.
    (d) Upon denial of a request under paragraph (c) of this section, 
the responsible Department of Veterans Affairs official or designated 
employee will inform the requester in writing of the denial and advise 
him or her that he or she may appeal the denial. The requester will also 
be furnished the title and address of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
official to whom the appeal should be addressed. (See Sec. 1.527.) In 
each instance of denial of a request, the denial will be made a matter 
of record and the record will contain a citation to the specific 
provision of Department of Veterans Affairs regulations upon which the 
denial is based.

    Information may be disclosed to a veteran or his or her duly 
authorized representative as to matters concerning himself or herself 
alone when such disclosure would not be injurious to the physical or 
mental health of the veteran. If the veteran be deceased, matters 
concerning him or her may be disclosed to his widow, children, or next 
of kin if such disclosure will not be injurious to the physical or 
mental health of the person in whose behalf information is sought or 
cause repugnance or resentment toward the decedent.

    Information may be disclosed to a widow, widower, child, or other 
dependent parent or other claimant, or the duly authorized 
representative of any of these persons as to matters concerning such 
person alone when such disclosure will not be injurious to the physical 
or mental health of the person to whom the inquiry relates. If the 
person concerning whom the information is sought is deceased, matters 
concerning such person may be disclosed to the next of kin if the 
disclosures will not be injurious to the physical or mental health of 
the person in whose behalf the information is sought or

<R05>
Sec. 1.505  Genealogy.

    Information of a genealogical nature when its disclosure will not be 
detrimental to the memory of the veteran and not prejudicial, so far as 
may be apparent, to the interests of any living person or to the 
interests of the Government may be released by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs or in the case of inactive records may be released by 
the Archivist of the United States if in the Archivist's custody.

department or other agency of the U.S. Government or any state 
unemployment compensation agency acting in an official capacity for the 
Department of Veterans Affairs shall be furnished in response to an 
official request, written, or oral, from such department or agency. If 
the requesting department or agency does not indicate the purpose for 
which the records or documents are requested and there is doubt as to 
whether they are to be used for official purposes, the requesting 
department or agency will be asked to specify the purpose for which they 
are to be used.
    (b) The Under Secretary for Benefits, Director of Insurance Service,

Sec. 1.507  Disclosures to members of Congress.

    Members of Congress shall be furnished in their official capacity in 
any case such information contained in the Department of Veterans 
Affairs files as may be requested for official use. However, in any 
unusual case, the request will be presented to the Secretary, Deputy 
Secretary, or staff or administration head for personal action. When the 
requested information is of a type which may not be furnished a 
claimant, the member of Congress shall be advised that the information 
is furnished to him or her confidentially in his official capacity and 
should be so treated by him or her. (See 38 U.S.C. 5701.) Information 
concerning the beneficiary designation of a United States Government 
Life Insurance or National Service Life Insurance policy is deemed 
confidential and privileged and during the insured's lifetime shall not 
be disclosed to anyone other than the insured or his or her duly 
appointed fiduciary unless the insured or the fiduciary authorizes the 
release of such information.

[32 FR 10848, July 25, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 1.508  Disclosure in cases where claimants are charged with or convicted of criminal offenses.

    (a) Where incompetent claimants are charged with, or convicted of, 
offenses other than those growing out of their relationship with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs and in which it is desired to disclose 
information from the files and records of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, the Regional Counsel, Under Secretary for Benefits, Veterans 
Benefits Administration, or the General Counsel if the General Counsel 
deems it necessary and proper, may disclose to the court having 
jurisdiction so much of the information from the files and records of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs relating to the mental condition of 
such beneficiaries, the same to be available as evidence, as may be 
necessary to show the mental condition of the accused and the time of 
its onset. This provision, however, does not alter the general procedure 
for handling offenses growing out of relations with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs.
    (b) When desired by a U.S. district court, the Regional Counsel or 
the General Counsel may supply information as to whether any person 
charged with crime served in the military or naval service of the United 
States and

[[Page 41]]

whether the Department of Veterans Affairs has a file on such person. If 
the file is desired either by the court or by the prosecution or 
defense, it may be produced only in accord with Sec. Sec. 1.501 through 
1.526.

Sec. 1.509  Disclosure to courts in proceedings in the nature of an inquest.

    The Under Secretary for Benefits, Veterans Benefits Administration, 
Regional Counsels, and facility heads are authorized to make disclosures 
to courts of competent jurisdiction of such files, records, reports, and 
other documents as are necessary and proper evidence in proceedings in 
the nature of an inquest into the mental competency of claimants and 
other proceedings incident to the appointment and discharge of 
guardians, curators, or conservators to any court having jurisdiction of 
such fiduciaries in all matters of appointment, discharge, or accounting 
in such courts.

Sec. 1.510  Disclosure to insurance companies cooperating with the Department 

of Justice in the defense of insurance suits against the United States.

    Copies of records from the files of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs will, in the event of litigation involving commercial insurance 
policies issued by an insurance company cooperating with the Department 
of Justice in defense of insurance suits against the United States, be 
furnished to such companies without charge, provided the claimant or his 
or her duly authorized representative has authorized the release of the 
information contained in such records. If the release of information is 
not authorized in writing by the claimant or his or her duly authorized 
representative, information contained in the files may be furnished to 
such company if to withhold same would tend to permit the accomplishment 
of a fraud or miscarriage of justice. However, before such information 
may be released without the consent of the claimant, the request 
therefor must be accompanied by an affidavit of the representative of 
the insurance company, setting forth that litigation is pending, the 
character of the suit, and the purpose for which the information desired 
is to be used. If such information is to be used adversely to the 
claimant, the affidavit must set forth facts from which it may be 
determined by the General Counsel or Regional Counsel whether the 
furnishing of the information is necessary to prevent the perpetration 
of a fraud or other injustice. The averments contained in such affidavit 
should be considered in connection with the facts shown by the 
claimant's file, and, if such consideration shows the disclosure of the 
record is necessary and proper to prevent a fraud or other injustice, 
information as to the contents thereof may be furnished to the insurance 
company or copies of the records may be furnished to the court, 
workmen's compensation, or similar board in which the litigation is 
pending upon receipt of a subpoena duces tecum addressed to the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or the head of the office in which the 
records desired are located. In the event the subpoena requires the 
production of the file, as distinguished from the copies of the records, 
no expense to the Department of Veterans Affairs may be involved in 
complying therewith, and arrangements must be made with the 
representative of the insurance company causing the issuance of the 
subpoena to insure submission of the file to the court without expense 
to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Sec. 1.511  Disclosure of claimant records in connection with judicial proceedings generally.

    (a)(1) Where a suit (or legal proceeding) has been threatened or 
instituted against the Government, or a prosecution against a claimant 
has been instituted or is being contemplated, the request of the 
claimant or his or her duly authorized representative for information, 
documents, reports, etc., shall be acted upon by the General Counsel in 
Central Office, or the Regional Counsel for the field facility, who 
shall determine the action to be taken with respect thereto. Where

[[Page 42]]

the records have been sent to the Department of Justice in connection 
with any such suit (or legal proceeding), the request will be referred 
to the Department of Justice, Washington, DC, through the office of the 
General Counsel, for attention. Where the records have been sent to an 
Assistant U.S. Attorney, the request will be referred by the appropriate 
Regional Counsel to the Assistant U.S. Attorney. In all other cases 
where copies of documents or records are desired by or on behalf of 
parties to a suit (or legal proceeding), whether in a Federal court or 
any other, such copies shall be disclosed as provided in paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section where the request is accompanied by court 
process, or paragraph (e) of this section where the request is not 
accompanied by court process. A court process, such as a court order or 
subpoena duces tecum should be addressed to either the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs or to the head of the field facility at which the 
records desired are located. The determination as to the action to be 
taken upon any request for the disclosure of claimant records received 
in this class of cases shall be made by the component having 
jurisdiction over the subject matter in Central Office, or the division 
having jurisdiction over the subject matter in the field facility, 
except in those cases in which representatives of the component or 
division have determined that the records desired are to be used 
adversely to the claimant, in which event the process will be referred 
to the General Counsel in Central Office or to the Regional Counsel for 
the field facility for disposition.
    (2) Where a claim under the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims 
Act has been filed, or where such a claim can reasonably be anticipated, 
no information, documents, reports, etc., will be disclosed except 
through the Regional Counsel having jurisdiction, who will limit the 
disclosure of information to that which would be available under 
discovery proceedings, if the matter were in litigation. Any other 
information may be disclosed only after concurrence in such disclosure 
is provided by the General Counsel.
    (b) Disclosures in response to Federal court process--(1) Court 
order. Except for drug and alcohol abuse, human immunodeficiency virus 
and sickle cell anemia treatment records, which are protected under 38 
U.S.C. 7332, where the records sought are maintained in a VA Privacy Act 
system of records, and are retrieved by the name or other personal 
identifier of a living claimant who is a citizen of the United States or 
an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, a Federal court 
order is the process necessary for the disclosure of such records. Upon 
receipt of a Federal court order directing disclosure of claimant 
records, such records will be disclosed. Disclosure of records protected 
under 38 U.S.C. 7332 will be made in accordance with provisions of 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (2) Subpoena. Except for drug and alcohol abuse, human 
immunodeficiency virus and sickle cell anemia treatment records, which 
are protected under 38 U.S.C. 7332, where the records sought are 
maintained in a VA Privacy Act system of records, and are retrieved by 
the name or other personal identifier of a claimant, a subpoena is not 
sufficient authority for the disclosure of such records and such records 
will not be disclosed, unless the claimant is deceased, or either is not 
a citizen of the United States, or is an alien not lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence. Where one of these exceptions applies, upon receipt 
of a Federal court subpoena, such records will be disclosed. 
Additionally, where the subpoena is accompanied by authorization from 
the claimant, disclosure will be made. Regarding the disclosure of 
medical records pertaining to drug and alcohol abuse, human 
immunodeficiency virus and sickle cell anemia treatment, a subpoena is 
insufficient for such disclosure. Specific provisions for the disclosure 
of these records are set forth in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) A disclosure of records in response to the receipt of a Federal 
court process will be made to those individuals designated in the 
process to receive such records, or to the court from which the process 
issued. Where original records are produced, they must remain at all 
times in the custody of a representative of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and, if offered and received in evidence, permission should

[[Page 43]]

be obtained to substitute a copy so that the original may remain intact 
in the record. Where a court process is issued by or on behalf of a 
party litigant other than the United States, such party litigant must 
prepay the costs of copies in accordance with fees prescribed by Sec. 
1.526(i) and any other costs incident to producing the records.
    (c) Disclosures in response to state or local court processs--(1) 
State or local court order. Except for drug and alcohol abuse, human 
immunodeficiency virus and sickle cell anemia treatment records, which 
are protected under 38 U.S.C. 7332, where the records sought are 
maintained in a VA Privacy Act system of records, and are retrieved by 
the name or other personal identifier of a living claimant who is a 
citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent 
residence, a State or local court order is the process necessary for 
disclosure of such records. Upon receipt of a State or local court order 
directing disclosure of claimant records, disclosure of such records 
will be made in accordance with the provisions set forth in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section. Disclosure of records protected under 38 U.S.C. 
7332 will be made in accordance with provisions of paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (2) State or local court subpoena. Except for drug and alcohol 
abuse, human immunodeficiency virus and sickle cell anemia treatment 
records, which are protected under 38 U.S.C. 7332, where the records 
sought are maintained in a VA Privacy Act system of records, and are 
retrieved by the name or other personal identifier of a claimant, a 
subpoena is not sufficient authority for disclosure of such records and 
such records will not be disclosed unless the claimant is deceased, or, 
either is not a citizen of the United States, or is an alien not 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Where one of these exceptions 
applies, upon receipt of a State or local court subpoena directing 
disclosure of claimant records, disclosure of such records will be made 
in accordance with the provisions set forth in paragraph (c)(3), of this 
section. Regarding the disclosure of 7332 records, a subpoena is 
insufficient for such disclosure. Specific provisions for the disclosure 
of these records are set forth in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) Where the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of 
this section apply, disclosure will be made as follows:
    (i) When the process presented is accompanied by authority from the 
claimant; or,
    (ii) In the absence of claimant disclosure authority, the Regional 
Counsel having jurisdiction must determine whether the disclosure of the 
records is necessary to prevent the perpetration of fraud or other 
injustice in the matter in question. To make such a determination, the 
Regional Counsel may require such additional documentation, e.g., 
affidavit, letter of explanation, or such other documentation which 
would detail the need for such disclosure, set forth the character of 
the pending suit, and the purpose for which the documents or records 
sought are to be used as evidence. The claimant's record may also be 
considered in the making of such determination. Where a court process is 
received, and the Regional Counsel finds that additional documentation 
will be needed to make the foregoing determination, the Regional 
Counsel, or other employee having reasonable knowledge of the 
requirements of this regulation, shall contact the person causing the 
issuance of such court process, and advise that person of the need for 
additional documentation. Where a court appearance is appropriate, and 
the Regional Counsel has found that there is an insufficient basis upon 
which to warrant a disclosure of the requested information, the Regional 
Counsel, or other employee having reasonable knowledge of the 
requirement of this regulation and having consulted with the Regional 
Counsel, shall appear in court and advise the court that VA records are 
confidential and privileged and may be disclosed only in accordance with 
applicable Federal regulations, and to further advise the court of such 
regulatory requirements and how they have not been satisified. Where 
indicated, the Regional Counsel will take appropriate action to have the 
matter of disclosure of the affected records removed to Federal court.

[[Page 44]]

    (4) Any disclosure of records in response to the receipt of State or 
local court process will be made to those individuals designated in the 
process to receive such records, or to the court from which such process 
issued. Payment of the fees as prescribed by Sec. 1.526(i), as well as 
any other cost incident to producing the records, must first be 
deposited with the Department of Veterans Affairs by the party who 
caused the process to be issued. The original records must remain at all 
times in the custody of a representative of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and, if there is an offer and admission of any record or 
document contained therein, permission should be obtained to substitute 
a copy so that the original may remain intact in the record.
    (d) Notice requirements where disclosures are made pursuant to court 
process. Whenever a disclosure of Privacy Act protected records is made 
in response to the process of a Federal, State, or local court, the 
custodian of the records disclosed will make reasonable efforts to 
notify the subject of such records that such subject's records were 
disclosed to another person under compulsory legal process. Such notice 
should be accomplished when the process compelling disclosure becomes a 
matter of public record. Generally, a notice sent to the last known 
address of the subject would be sufficient to comply with this 
requirement.
    (e) Disclosures in response to requests when not accompanied by 
court process. Requests received from attorneys or others for copies of 
records for use in suits in which the Government is not involved, not 
accompanied by a court process, will be handled by the component or 
division having jurisdiction over the subject matter. If the request can 
be complied with under Sec. 1.503 or Sec. 1.504, and under the Privacy 
Act (to the extent that such records are protected by the Privacy Act), 
the records requested will be disclosed upon receipt of the required 
fee. If, however, the records cannot be furnished under such authority, 
the applicant will be advised of the procedure to obtain copies of 
records as set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (f) Suits by or against the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. 3720. Records 
pertaining to the loan guaranteed, insured, or made by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs may be made available by the General Counsel or the 
Regional Counsel subject to the usual rules of evidence, and where 
authorized under the Privacy Act, after clearance with the Department of 
Justice or U.S. Attorney if appropriate.
    (g) Disclosure of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, human immunodeficiency 
virus and sickle cell anemia treatment or related records under court 
process. Disclosure of these types of records, which are protected from 
unauthorized disclosure under 38 U.S.C. 7332, may be made only in 
response to an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction 
granted after application showing good cause therefore. In assessing 
good cause the court is required to weigh the public interest and the 
need for disclosure against the injury to the patient or subject, to the 
physician-patient relationship, and to the treatment services. The 
court, in determining the extent to which any disclosure of all or any 
part of any record is necessary, shall impose appropriate safeguards 
against unauthorized disclosure. As to a Federal court order satisfying 
the requirements of this paragraph, the records will be disclosed as 
provided in such order. As to a State or local court order satisfying 
the requirements of this subsection, the disclosure of the records 
involved is conditioned upon satisfying the provisions set forth in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If the aforementioned section is 
satisfied, and a disclosure of records is to be forthcoming, the records 
will be disclosed as provided in the court order.

Sec. 1.514  Disclosure to private physicians and hospitals other than Department of Veterans Affairs.

    (a) When a beneficiary elects to obtain medical attention as a 
private patient from a private practitioner or in a medical center other 
than a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, there may be disclosed 
to such private practitioner or head of such medical center (Federal,

    (a) It is the general policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
to refuse to furnish addresses from its records to persons who desire 
such information for debt collection, canvassing, harassing or for 
propaganda purposes.
    (b) The address of a Department of Veterans Affairs claimant as 
shown by Department of Veterans Affairs files may be furnished to:
    (1) Duly constituted police or court officials upon official request 
and the submission of a certified copy either of the indictment returned 
against the claimant or of the warrant issued for his or her arrest.
    (2) Police, other law enforcement agencies, or Federal, State, 
county, or city welfare agencies upon official written request showing 
that the purpose of the request is to locate a parent who has deserted 
his or her child or children and that other reasonable efforts to obtain 
an address have failed. The address will not be released when such 
disclosure would be prejudicial to the mental or physical health of the 
claimant. When an address is furnished it will be accompanied by the 
stipulation that it is furnished on a confidential basis and may not be 
disclosed to any other individual or agency.
    (c) When an address is requested that may not be furnished under 
Sec. Sec. 1.500 through 1.526, the person making the request will be 
informed that a letter,

[[Page 49]]

or in those cases involving judicial actions, the process or notice in 
judicial proceedings, enclosed in an unsealed envelope showing no return 
address, with the name of the addressee thereon, and bearing sufficient 
postage to cover mailing costs will be forwarded by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. If a request indicates that judicial action is 
involved in which a process or notice in judicial proceedings is 
required to be forwarded, the Department of Veterans Affairs will inform 
the person who requests the forwarding of such a document that the 
envelope must bear sufficient postage to cover costs of mailing and 
certified or registered mailing fees, including cost of obtaining 
receipt for the certified or registered mail when transmission by this 
type special mail is desired. At the time the letter, process, or notice 
in judicial proceedings is forwarded, the facility's return address will 
be placed on the envelope. When the receipt for certified or registered 
mail or the undelivered envelope is returned to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, the original sender will be notified thereof: However, 
the receipt or the envelope will be retained by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. This provision will be applicable only when it does 
not interfere unduly with the functions of the Service or division 
concerned. In no event will letters be forwarded to aid in the 
collection of debts or for the purpose of canvassing, harassing, or 
propaganda. Neither will a letter be forwarded if the contents could be 
harmful to the physical or mental health of the recipient.
    (d) Subject to the conditions set forth in Sec. 1.922, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs may disclose to consumer reporting 
agencies information contained in a debtor's claims folder. Such 
information may include the debtor's name and/or address, Department of

Normally, evidence establishing that the organization is exempt from 
taxation in accordance with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 501 or is a 
governmental body or institution will be accepted as satisfying this 
criteria;
    (3) Contain a statement clearly setting forth the purpose for which 
the list is sought, the programs and the resources the organization 
proposes to devote to this purpose, and establish how such purpose is 
``directly connected with the conduct of programs and the utilization of 
benefits'' under title 38, U.S.C.; and
    (4) Contain a certification that the organization, and all members 
thereof who will have access to the list, are aware of the penalty 
provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5701(f) and will not use the list for any 
purpose other than that stated in the application.
    (b) If the Director of the regional office concerned finds that the 
organization requesting the list of names and addresses of educationally 
disadvantaged veterans is a nonprofit organization and operates an 
approved program of special secondary, remedial, preparatory or other 
educational or supplementary assistance to veterans as provided under 
subchapter V, title 38 U.S.C., then he or she may authorize the release 
of such names and addresses to the organization requesting them.
    (c) The Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information 
Resources Management, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, is 
authorized to release lists of names and addresses to organizations 
which have applied for such lists in accordance with paragraph (a) of 
this section if he or she

[[Page 50]]

finds that the purpose for which the organization desires the names and 
addresses is directly connected with the conduct of programs and the 
utilization of benefits under title 38 U.S.C. Lists of names and 
addresses authorized to be released pursuant to this paragraph shall not 
duplicate lists released to other elements, segments, or chapters of the 
same organization.
    (d) If the list requested is one that the Department of Veterans 
Affairs has previously compiled or created, in the same format, to carry 
out one or more of its basic program responsibilities and it is 
determined that it can be released, the list may be furnished without 
charge. For other types of lists, a charge will be made in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 1.526.
    (e) Upon denial of a request, the Department of Veterans Affairs 
Controller or Regional Office Director will inform the requester in 
writing of the denial and the reasons therefor and advise the 
organization that it may appeal the denial to the General Counsel. In 
each instance of a denial of a request, the denial and the reasons 
therefor will be made a matter of record.
    (f) Section 5701(f), title 38 U.S.C., provides that any 
organization, or member thereof, which uses the names and addresses 
furnished it for any purpose other than one directly connected with the 
conduct of programs and the utilization of benefits under title 38 
U.S.C., shall be fined not more than $500 in the case of the first 
offense and not more than $5,000 in the case of the subsequent offenses. 
Any instance in which there is evidence of a violation of these penal 
provisions will be reported in accordance with Sec. 14.560.

Sec. 1.520  Confidentiality of social data.

    Persons having access to social data will be conscious of the fact 
that the family, acquaintances, and even the veteran have been willing 
to reveal these data only on the promise that they will be held in 
complete confidence. There will be avoided direct, ill-considered 
references which may jeopardize the personal safety of these individuals 
and the relationship existing among them, the patient, and the social 
worker, or may destroy their mutual confidence and influence, rendering 
it impossible to secure further cooperation from these individuals and 
agencies. Physicians in talking with beneficiaries will not quote these 
data directly but will regard them as indicating possible directions 
toward which they may wish to guide the patient's self-revelations 
without reproaching the patient for his or her behavior or arousing 
natural curiosity or suspicion regarding any informant's statement. The 
representatives of service organizations and duly authorized 
representatives of veterans will be especially cautioned as to their 
grave responsibility in this connection.

Sec. 1.521  Special restrictions concerning social security records.

    Information received from the Social Security Administration may be 
filed in the veteran's claims folder without special provisions. Such 
information will be deemed privileged and may not be released by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs except that information concerning the 
amount of social security benefits paid to a claimant or the amount of 
social security tax contributions made by the claimant may be disclosed 
to the claimant or his or her duly authorized representative. Any 
request from outside the Department of Veterans Affairs for other social 
security information will be referred to the Social Security 
Administration for such action as they deem proper.

Sec. 1.524  Persons authorized to represent claimants.

    A duly authorized representative will be:
    (a) Any person authorized in writing by the claimant to act for him 
or her,
    (b) An attorney who has filed the declaration required by Sec. 
14.629(b)(1) of this chapter, or
    (c) His or her legally constituted fiduciary, if the claimant is 
incompetent. Where for proper reasons no legally constituted fiduciary 
has been or will be appointed, his or her spouse, his or her children, 
or, if the claimant is unmarried, either of his or her parents shall be 
recognized as the fiduciary of the claimant.

[33 FR 6536, Apr. 30, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 1.525  Inspection of records by or disclosure of information to 

recognized representatives of organizations and recognized attorneys.

    (a)(1) The accredited representatives of recognized organizations 
(Sec. 14.627 of this chapter) holding appropriate power of attorney and 
recognized attorneys (Sec. 14.629(b) of this chapter) with the written 
authorization of the claimant may, subject to the restrictions imposed 
by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, inspect the claims, insurance and 
allied folders of any claimant upon the condition that only such 
information contained therein as may be properly disclosed under 
Sec. Sec. 1.500 through 1.526 will be disclosed by him or her to the 
claimant or, if the claimant is incompetent, to his or her legally 
constituted fiduciary. Under the same restrictions, it is permissible to 
release information from and permit inspection of loan guaranty folders 
in which a request for a waiver of the debt of a veteran or his or her 
spouse has been received, or where there has been a denial of basic 
eligibility for loan guaranty benefits. All other information in the 
files shall be treated as confidential and will be used only in 
determining the status of the cases inspected or in connection with the 
presentation to officials of the Department of Veterans Affairs of the 
claim of the claimant. The heads of field facilities and the directors 
of the services concerned in Central Office will each designate a 
responsible officer to whom requests for all files must be made, except 
that managers of centers with insurance activities will designate two 
responsible officials, recommended by the division chiefs concerned, one 
responsible for claims and allied folders and the other for insurance 
files. The term claimant as used in this paragraph includes insureds.
    (2) In the case of a living veteran a representative acting under a 
power of attorney from any person not acting on behalf of the veteran 
will not be permitted to review the records of the veteran or be 
furnished any information therefrom to which the person is not entitled, 
i.e., information not relating to such person alone. Powers of attorney 
submitted by the other person will be considered ``Limited'' and will be 
so noted when associated with the veteran's records. The provisions of 
this subparagraph are also applicable to recognized attorneys and the 
requisite declarations filed by them.
    (3) When power of attorney does not obtain, the accredited 
representative will explain to the designated officer of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs the reason for requesting information from the file, 
and the information will be made available only when in the opinion of 
the designated officer it is justified; in no circumstances will such 
representatives be allowed to inspect the file; in such cases a contact 
report will be made out and attached to the case, outlining the reasons 
which justify the verbal or written release of the information to the 
accredited representative.
    (4) In any case where there is an unrevoked power of attorney or 
declaration of representation, no persons or organizations other than 
the one named in such document shall be afforded information from the 
file except under the conditions set forth in Sec. 14.629(b)(2) of this 
chapter. When any claimant has filed notice with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs that he or

[[Page 52]]

she does not want his or her file inspected, such file will not be made 
available for inspection.
    (b)(1) Inspection of folders by accredited representatives or 
recognized attorneys holding a written authorization where such cases 
are being processed shall be in space assigned for such inspection. 
Otherwise station heads may permit inspection of folders at the desks of 
the accredited representatives, in the office(s) which they regularly 
occupy.
    (2) An insured or after maturity of the insurance by death of the 
insured, the beneficiary, may authorize the release to a third person of 
such insurance information as the insured or the beneficiary would be 
entitled to receive, provided there is submitted to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, a specific authorization in writing for this purpose.
    (3) Unless otherwise authorized by the insured or the beneficiary, 
as the case may be, such authorized representative, recognized attorney 
or accredited representative shall not release information as to the 
designated beneficiary to anyone other than the insured or to the 
beneficiary after death of the insured. Otherwise, information in the 
insurance file shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.500 
through 1.526.
    (4) Clinical records and medical files, including files for 
outpatient treatment, may be inspected by accredited representatives or 
recognized attorneys holding a written authorization only to the extent 
such records or parts thereof are incorporated in the claims folder, or 
are made available to Department of Veterans Affairs personnel in the 
adjudication of the claim. Records or data in clinical or medical files 
which are not incorporated in the claims folder or which are not made 
available to Department of Veterans Affairs personnel for adjudication 
purposes will not be inspected by anyone other than those employees of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs whose duties require same for the 
purpose of clinical diagnosis or medical treatment.
    (5) Under no circumstances shall any paper be removed from a file, 
except by a Department of Veterans Affairs employee, for purpose of 
having an authorized copy made. Copying of material in a file shall not 
be permitted except in connection with the performance of authorized 
functions under the power of attorney or requisite declaration of a 
recognized attorney.
    (6) In any case involving litigation against the Government, whether 
contemplated or initiated, inspection, subject to the foregoing, shall 
be within the discretion of the General Counsel or Regional Counsel, 
except that in insurance suits under 38 U.S.C. 1975, 1984, inspection 
shall be within the discretion of the official having jurisdiction of 
the claim. Files in such cases may be released to the Department of 
Justice, but close liaison will be maintained to insure their return 
intact upon termination of the litigation.
    (c) Facility heads and the directors of the services concerned in 
central office will be responsible for the administrative compliance 
with and accomplishment of the foregoing within their jurisdiction, and 
any violations of the prescribed conditions for inspection of files or 
release of information therefrom will be brought to the immediate 
attention of the Secretary.
    (d) Any person holding power of attorney, a recognized attorney who 
has filed the requisite declaration, or the accredited representative of 
a recognized organization holding power of attorney shall be supplied 
with a copy of each notice to the claimant respecting the adjudication 
of the claim. If a claimant dies before action on the claim is 
completed, the person or organization holding power of attorney or the 
attorney who has filed the requisite declaration may continue to act 
until the action is completed except where the power of attorney or 
requisite declaration was filed on behalf of a dependent.
    (e) When in developing a claim the accredited representative of a 
recognized organization finds it necessary to call upon a local 
representative to assemble information or evidence, he or she may make 
such disclosures to the local representative as the circumstances of the 
case may warrant, provided the power of attorney to the recognized 
organization contains an

[[Page 53]]

authorization permitting such disclosure.

Sec. 1.526  Copies of records and papers.

    (a) Any person desiring a copy of any record or document in the 
custody of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is subject to be 
furnished under Sec. Sec. 1.501 through 1.526, must make written 
application for such copy to the Department of Veterans Affairs 
installation having custody of the subject matter desired, stating 
specifically: (1) The particular record or document the copy of which is 
desired and whether certified and validated, or uncertified, (2) the 
purpose for which such copy is desired to be used.
    (b) The types of services provided by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs for which fees will be charged are identified in paragraph (i) 
of this section.
    (c) This section applies to the services furnished in paragraph (b) 
of this section when rendered to members of the public by the Department 
of Veterans Affairs. It does not apply to such services when rendered to 
or for other agencies or branches of the Federal Government, or State 
and local governments when furnishing the service will help to 
accomplish an objective of the Department of Veterans Affairs, or when 
performed in connection with a special research study or compilation 
when the party requesting such services is charged an amount for the 
whole job.
    (d) When copies of a record or document are furnished under 
Sec. Sec. 1.506, 1.507, 1.510, and 1.514, such copies shall be supplied 
without charge. Moreover, free service may be provided, to the extent of 
one copy, to persons who have been required to furnish original 
documents for retention by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (e) The following are circumstances under which services may be 
provided free at the discretion of facility heads or responsible Central 
Office officials:
    (1) When requested by a court, when the copy will serve as a 
substitute for personal court appearance of a Government witness.
    (2) When furnishing the service free saves costs or yields income 
equal to the direct costs of the agency providing the service. This 
includes cases where the fee for the service would be included in a 
billing against the Government (for example, in cost-type contracts, or 
in the case of private physicians who are treating Government 
beneficiaries at Government expense).
    (3) When a service is occasional and incidental, not of a type that 
is requested often, and if it is administratively determined that a fee 
would be inappropriate in such an occasional case.
    (f) When information, statistics, or reports are released or 
furnished under Sec. 1.501 or Sec. 1.519, the fee charge, if any, will 
be determined upon the merits of each individual application.
    (g) In those cases where it is determined that a fee shall be 
charged, the applicant will be advised to deposit the amount of the 
lawful charge for the copy desired. The amount of such charge will be 
determined in accordance with the schedule of fees prescribed in 
paragraph (i) of this section. The desired copy will not be delivered, 
except under court subpoena, until the full amount of the lawful charge 
is deposited. Any excess deposit of $1 or more over the lawful charge 
will be returned to the applicant. Excess deposits of less than $1 will 
be returned upon request. When a deposit is received with an 
application, such a deposit will be returned to the applicant should the 
application be denied.

Sec. 1.550  General.

    The Department of Veterans Affairs policy is one of disclosure of 
information from agency records to the extent permitted by law. This 
includes the release of information which the Department of Veterans 
Affairs is authorized to withhold under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (see Sec. 
1.554) if it is determined: (a) By the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or 
the Deputy Secretary that disclosure of such information will serve a 
useful purpose or (b) by an administration, staff office, or field 
facility head or designee under Sec. 1.556(a) that disclosure will not 
adversely affect the proper conduct of official business or constitute 
an invasion of personal privacy.

<R05>
Sec. 1.552  Public access to information that affects the public when not published in the Federal Register as constructive notice.

    (a) Those statements of policy and interpretations adopted by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs but not published in the Federal 
Register, and administrative manuals and staff instructions that affect 
any member of the public, unless promptly published and copies offered 
for sale, will be kept currently indexed by the office of primary 
program responsibility or the Manager, Administrative Services, as 
determined by the Secretary or designee. Such index or indexes or 
supplements thereto will be promptly published, quarterly or more 
frequently, and distributed (by sale or otherwise) unless the Department 
of Veterans Affairs determines by order published in the Federal 
Register that publication would be unnecessary and impracticable, in 
which case the Department of Veterans Affairs will nonetheless provide 
copies of such index or indexes or supplements thereto on request at a 
cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication. Both the index and 
the materials indexed as required by this paragraph will be made 
available to the public, for inspection and copying. Public reading 
facilities for this purpose will be maintained in Department of Veterans 
Affairs Central Office and Department of Veterans Affairs field 
facilities, open to the public during the normal duty hours of the 
office in which located. Orders made in the adjudication of individual 
claims under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs are 
confidential and privileged by statute (38 U.S.C. 5701) and so are 
exempt from this requirement.
    (b) When publishing or making available to the public any opinion, 
order, statement of policy, interpretation, staff manual or instruction 
to staff, identifying details will be deleted, and the deletion 
justified in writing, to the extent required to prevent a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
    (c) No final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, 
staff manual or instruction which is issued, adopted, or promulgated 
after July 4, 1967, that affects any member of the public may be relied 
upon, used, or cited as precedent against any private party unless it 
has been indexed and either made available or published as provided in 
this section or unless that private party shall have actual and timely 
notice of the terms thereof.

in title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, all requests for records shall 
be processed under paragraph (b) of this section, as well as under any 
other VA law or regulation governing access to or confidentiality of 
records or information. Records or information customarily furnished to 
the public in the regular course of the performance of official duties 
may be furnished to the public without reference to paragraph (b) of 
this section. To the extent permitted by other laws and regulations, VA 
will also consider making available records which it is permitted to 
withhold under the FOIA if it determines that such disclosure could be 
in the public interest.
    (b) Reasonably described records in VA custody, or copies thereof, 
other than records made available to the

public under provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.551 and 1.552 of this part, or 
unless otherwise provided for in title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, 
requested in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, 
fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, will be made promptly 
available, except as provided in Sec. 1.554 of this part, to any person 
upon request. Such request must be in writing, over the signature of the 
requester and must contain a reasonable description of the record 
desired so that it may be located with relative ease. The request should 
be made to the office concerned (having jurisdiction of the record 
desired) or, if not known, to the Director or Veterans Service Center 
Manager in the nearest VA regional office; the Director, or Chief, 
Medical Administration Service, or other responsible official of VA 
medical facility where most recently treated; or to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs Central Office, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC

legal public holidays) after the receipt of the request whether the 
Department of Veterans Affairs will comply with the request. Upon 
determination to comply or deny the request the person making the 
request will be notified immediately of the determination and the 
reasons therefor, and of the right of the person to appeal to the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs any adverse determination. Records to be 
furnished will be supplied promptly.
    (c) Upon receipt of such an appeal from an adverse determination it 
will be evaluated and a further determination made within 20 days 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt 
of the appeal. If on appeal the denial is in whole or in part upheld the 
Department of Veterans Affairs will notify the requester of the 
provisions for judicial review of this determination. (See Sec. Sec. 
1.557 and 1.558.)
    (d) In unusual circumstances, specifically as follows, the time 
limits in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be extended by 
written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for such 
extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be 
dispatched. The date specified will not result in an extension for more 
than 10 working days. Unusual circumstances will be interpreted to mean, 
but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of 
the particular request, as follows:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs having substantial subject-matter 
interest therein.
    (e) Pursuant to section 552(a)(6), title 5 U.S.C., any person making 
a request to the Department of Veterans Affairs for records under 
section 552(a) (1), (2) or (3) (see Sec. Sec. 1.551, 1.552 and 1.553) 
will be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies with 
respect to such request if the Department of Veterans Affairs fails to 
comply with the applicable time limit provisions of

[[Page 57]]

this section. If, however, the Government can show exceptional 
circumstances exist and that the Department of Veterans Affairs is 
exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the statute also 
permits the court to retain jurisdiction and allow the Department of 
Veterans Affairs additional time to complete its review of the records.
    (f) Requests for the release of information from files, records, 
reports, and other papers and documents in Department of Veterans 
Affairs custody pertaining to claims under any of the laws administered 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs (covered by Sec. Sec. 1.500 
through 1.527) may also be initiated under 5 U.S.C. 552. Such requests 
will also be evaluated, a determination made within 10 days (excepting 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of the 
request whether the Department of Veterans Affairs will comply with the 
request, and the requester notified immediately of the determination and 
the reasons therefor, and of the right of the person to appeal to the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs any adverse determination. Records to be 
furnished will be supplied promptly.

    (c)(1) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records 
described in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section and
    (i) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of 
criminal law, and
    (ii) There is reason to believe that
    (A) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of 
its pendency, and
    (B) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be 
expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the Agency may, 
during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records 
as not subject to the requirements of this section.
    (2) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law 
enforcement agency under an informant's name or personal identifier are 
requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal

Sec. 1.554a  Predisclosure notification procedures for confidential commercial information.

    (a) General. During the conduct of its business the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) may acquire records which contain confidential 
commercial information, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Such records will not be released in response to a Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) request, except under the provisions of this 
section. This section establishes uniform VA procedures for giving 
submitters predisclosure notice of requests for their records which 
contain confidential commercial information that may be exempt from 
disclosure under 38 CFR 1.554(a)(4). These procedures are required by 
Executive Order 12600, Predisclosure Notification Procedures for 
Confidential Commercial Information, dated June 23, 1987.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Confidential commercial information means 
records provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contain 
material exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552 
(b)(4), as implemented by Sec. 1.554 of this part, because disclosure 
could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (2) Submitter means any person or entity who provides confidential 
commercial information to the government. The term ``submitter'' 
includes, but is not limited to corporations, State governments, and 
foreign governments.
    (c) Notification to submitters of confidential commercial 
information. When a request is received, for a submitter's record(s), or 
information which contains confidential commercial information, and the 
request is being processed under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552, the submitter 
will be promptly notified in writing of the request when required by 
paragraph (d) of this section. The notification will advise the 
submitter that a request for its record(s) has been received and is 
being processed under the FOIA. The notice will describe the exact 
nature of the record(s) requested or will provide to the submitter 
copies of the record(s) or portions thereof containing the requested 
confidential commercial information. It will also inform the submitter 
of the opportunity

[[Page 59]]

to object to the disclosure in writing within 10 working days, and of 
the requirements for such a written objection, as described in paragraph 
(f) of this section. The notification will be sent by certified mail, 
return receipt requested.
    (d) When notification is required. (1) For confidential commercial 
information submitted to VA prior to January 1, 1988, notification to 
submitters is required whenever:
    (i) The records are less than 10 years old and the requested 
information has been designated by the submitter as confidential 
commercial information; or
    (ii) VA facility, administration, or staff office which has custody 
of the requested records has reason to believe that disclosure of the 
requested information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm.
    (2) For confidential commercial information submitted to VA on or 
after January, 1, 1988, notification is required whenever:
    (i) The submitter has in good faith designated the requested records 
as confidential information in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section; or
    (ii) VA facility, administration, or staff office which has custody 
of the requested records has reason to believe that disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (e) Designation by submitters of information as confidential 
commercial information. (1) When business records are provided to VA, 
the submitter may appropriately designate any records or portions 
thereof which contain confidential commercial information, the 
disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm. This designation may be made at the time the 
information or record is given to VA or within a reasonable period of 
time thereafter, but not later than 60 days after receipt of the 
information by VA. Information so designated will be clearly identified 
by marking it with the words ``confidential commercial information'' or 
by an accompanying detailed written description of the specific kinds of 
information that is designated. If a complete document or record is 
designated, the cover page of the document or record will be clearly 
marked ``This entire (document, record, etc.) consists of confidential 
commercial information.'' If only portions of documents are designated, 
only those specific designated portions will be conspicuously annotated 
as ``confidential commercial information.''
    (2) A designation described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section will 
remain in effect for a period of not more than 10 years after submission 
to VA, unless the submitter provides acceptable justification for a 
longer specific period. If a shorter designation period is adequate, the 
submitter's designation should include the earlier expiration date. 
Whenever possible, the submitter's designation should be supported by a 
statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of 
the submitter that the records are in fact confidential commercial 
information and have not been published or made available to the public.
    (f) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) When notification to a 
submitter is made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the 
submitter or designee may object to the disclosure of any specified 
portion of the record(s). Such objection will be in writing, will be 
addressed to the VA official who provided notice, will identify the 
specific record(s) or portion(s) of records that should not be 
disclosed, will specify all grounds upon which disclosure is opposed, 
and will explain in detail why the information is considered to be a 
trade secret or confidential commercial information, i.e., why 
disclosure of the specified records could reasonably be expected to 
cause substantial competitive harm. Information provided by a submitter 
pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the 
FOIA.
    (2) Any objection to disclosure must be submitted within 10 working 
days after receipt by the submitter of notification as provided for in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) If an objection to disclosure is received within the 10 working 
day time period, careful consideration will be

[[Page 60]]

given to all specified grounds for nondisclosure prior to making an 
administrative determination whether to disclose the record. When it is 
determined to disclose the requested record(s) or portions of records 
which are the subject of an objection, the submitter will be provided a 
written statement of the VA decision, the reason(s) that the submitter's 
objections to disclosure were overruled, a description or copy of the 
exact information or record(s) to be disclosed which were the subject of 
an objection, and the specified date of disclosure. The date of 
disclosure will not be less than 10 working days from the date this 
notice is placed into mail delivery channels.
    (g) Notices to requester. (1) When a request is received for records 
that may contain confidential commercial information protected by FOIA 
exemption (b)(4), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(4), the requester will be notified 
that the request is being processed under the provisions of this 
regulation and, as a consequence, there may be a delay in receiving a 
response.
    (2) Whenever a submitter is notified, pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, that VA has received a request for records which had been 
provided by such submitter, and that such request was being processed 
under the FOIA, the requester will be notified that the submitter is 
being provided an opportunity to comment on the request. The notice to 
the requester should not include any of the specific information 
contained in the records being requested.
    (3) Whenever VA notifies a submitter of a final decision, the 
requester will also be notified by separate correspondence. This 
notification to the requester may be contained in VA's FOIA decision.
    (h) Notices of lawsuit. Whenever a FOIA requester brings suit 
seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the 
submitter of the information will be promptly notified.
    (i) Exceptions to the notification requirements. The predisclosure 
notification requirements in paragraph (c) of this section need not be 
followed if:
    (1) It is determined that the record(s) or information should not be 
disclosed;
    (2) The record(s) requested have been published or have been 
officially made available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the record(s) or information is required by law 
(other than the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552);
    (4) Disclosure is required by an Agency rule that:
    (i) Was adopted pursuant to notice and public comment;
    (ii) Specifies narrow classes of records submitted to VA that are to 
be released under the FOIA; and
    (iii) Provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the 
submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is 
submitted or a reasonable time thereafter, that disclosure of the 
information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm;
    (5) The record(s) requested are not designated by the submitter as 
exempt from disclosure in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, 
and the submitter had an opportunity to do so at the time of submission 
of the record(s) or a reasonable time thereafter, and VA does not have 
substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would 
result in competitive harm; or
    (6) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, 
in such case, VA must still provide the submitter with advance written 
notice of any final administrative disclosure determination not less 
than 10 working days prior to the specified disclosure date.

<R05>
Sec. 1.555  Fees.

    (a) Definitions of terms. For the purpose of this section, the 
following definitions apply:
    (1) Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of one 
who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, 
trade or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf 
the request is made. To determine whether a request

[[Page 61]]

properly belongs in this category, consideration must be given to the 
use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Where the use 
of the records sought is not clear in the request or where there is 
reasonable cause to doubt the use to which the requester will put the 
records sought, additional information may be sought from the requester 
before assigning the request to a specific category.
    (2) Direct costs means those expenditures which VA actually incurs 
in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial use 
requests, reviewing) documents to respond to a Freedom of Information 
Act (FOIA) request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the 
employee performing work, i.e., the basic rate of pay for the employee, 
plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits, and the cost of 
operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are 
overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting of the 
facility in which the records are stored.
    (3) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a document 
necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of 
paper copy, microform, audiovisual materials or machine readable 
documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy 
provided must be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.
    (4) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher 
education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational 
education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. 
To determine whether a request properly belongs in this category, the 
request must be evaluated to ensure that it is apparent from the nature 
of the request that it serves a scholarly research goal of the 
institution, rather than an individual goal of the requester or a 
commercial goal of the institution.
    (5) Non-commercial scientific institution means an institution that 
is not operated on a commercial basis (as that term is referenced under 
Commercial use request of this paragraph) and which is operated solely 
for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which 
are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (6) Representative of the news media means any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is 
about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. 
Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but 
only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news) 
who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the 
general public. These examples are not intended to be all inclusive. As 
traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic 
dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such 
alternative media will be included in this category. Freelance 
journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they 
can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that 
organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication 
contract would be the clearest proof, but the requester's past 
publication history can be considered also. In any case, freelancers who 
do not qualify for inclusion in the representative of the news media 
category may seek a reduction or waiver of fees under paragraph (f) of 
this section.
    (7) Review means the process of examining documents located in 
response to a commercial use request (see definition of commercial use 
request in this section) to determine whether any portion of any 
document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes 
processing any documents for disclosure in response to a commercial use 
request, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise 
prepare them for release. The term review does not include time spent 
resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of 
exemptions.
    (8) Search means all the time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or

[[Page 62]]

line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searches may 
be done manually or by computer using existing programs. The most 
efficient and least expensive manner of searching for material will be 
used to minimize costs to VA and the requester. For example, line-by-
line searches will not be conducted when duplicating an entire document 
is the least expensive and quicker method of complying with a request. 
The term search does not cover the time spent to review documents to 
determine whether all or portions thereof can be withheld under one of 
the nine categories of exemptions identified in Sec. 1.554 of this 
part.
    (b) Fees to be charged. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c), 
(d), (f) and (g) of this section, the Department of Veterans Affairs 
will charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs for 
responding to each request from the public. Such fees will be charged in 
accordance with the schedule of fees in paragraph (e) of this section, 
and other requirements or restrictions in this regulation. The most 
efficient and least costly methods will be used to comply with requests 
for documents made under the FOIA.
    (2) If it is estimated that charges for duplication determined by 
using the fee schedule in Sec. 1.555(e) of this part are likely to 
exceed $25, the requester will be notified of the estimated amount of 
fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his or her 
willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such notice will 
offer the requester the opportunity to confer with Department personnel 
with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at 
a lower cost.
    (3) Each administration and staff office upon approval of the 
Secretary is authorized to contract with private sector services to 
locate, reproduce, and disseminate records in response to FOIA requests 
when that is the most efficient and least costly method. If a contractor 
is used, the ultimate cost to the requester can be no greater than it 
would if the administration, staff office, or field facility performed 
the task, itself. In no case may an administration, staff office, or 
field facility contract out responsibilities which the FOIA provides 
that they alone may discharge, such as determining the applicability of 
an exemption, or determining whether to waive or reduce fees.
    (4) When documents that would be responsive to a request are 
maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutory-based fee 
schedule programs, in which the agency is required to set the level of 
fees for particular types of records, such as the National Technical 
Information Service or the Government Printing Office, the requester of 
such documents will be informed of the steps necessary to obtain records 
from those sources, rather than from VA.
    (c) Restrictions on assessing fees. With the exception of commercial 
use requests no charges will be assessed for the first 100 pages of 
duplication and the first two hours of search time. Moreover, no fees 
are to be charged any requester, including commercial use requesters, if 
the cost of collecting the fee is equal to or greater than the fee 
itself. These provisions work together so that, except for commercial 
use requests, fees will not be assessed until the free search and 
duplication have been provided. For example, if a request takes two 
hours and ten minutes of search time and results in 105 reproduced pages 
of documents, fees can be charged for only 10 minutes of search time and 
for only five pages of reproduction. If this cost were equal to or less 
than the cost to VA of billing the requester and processing the fee 
collected, no charges would be assessed. (NOTE: The cost of collecting 
fees are VA's administrative costs of receiving and recording a 
requester's remittance, and processing the fee for deposit in the 
Treasury Department's special account. The cost is determined to be 
negligible. The per-transaction costs to the Treasury to handle such 
remittances is negligible and will not be considered in the Department's 
determination.)
    (1) For purposes of the restriction on assessing fees, the word 
pages refers to one-sided paper copies of the standard sizes 8\1/
2\<gr-thn-eq> x 11<gr-thn-eq> or 8\1/2\<gr-thn-eq> x 14<gr-thn-eq> or 11 
<gr-thn-eq> x 14<gr-thn-eq>. Accordingly, requesters will not be 
entitled to 100 microfiche or 100 computer disks free. One microfiche 
containing the equivalent of 100 pages or 100 pages

[[Page 63]]

of computer printout might meet the terms of the restriction.
    (2) The term search time in this context is based on manual 
searches. To calculate the computer search time for the purpose of 
applying the two-hour search restriction, the hourly cost of operating 
the computer's central processing unit will be combined with the 
operator's hourly salary, plus 16 percent of the salary. When the cost 
of the search (including the operator time and the cost of the computer 
to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours 
of the salary of the person performing the search, i.e., the operator, 
charges will begin to be assessed for a computer search.
    (d) Categories of requesters and fees to be charged each category. 
There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; 
educational and non-commercial scientific institutional requesters; 
requesters who are representatives of news media; and all other 
requesters. Specific levels of fees will be charged for each of these 
categories as follows:
    (1) Commercial use requesters. When a request for documents for 
commercial use is received, the full direct costs of searching for, 
reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought will be 
charged to the requester. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to 
two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduced 
documents. Moreover, the commercial use requester will be charged the 
cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately 
no disclosure of records. The requester must reasonably describe the 
records sought.
    (2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution 
requesters. These requesters will be charged only for the cost of 
reproduction, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. In order to be 
considered a member of this category, a requester must show that the 
request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a 
qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a 
commercial use. If the request is from an educational institution, the 
requester must show that the records sought are in furtherance of 
scholarly research. If the request is from a non-commercial scientific 
institution, the requester has to show that the records are sought in 
furtherance of scientific research. Information necessary to support a 
claim of being categorized as an educational or non-commercial 
scientific institution requester will be provided by the requester, and 
the requester must reasonably describe the records sought.
    (3) Representatives of news media. These requesters will be charged 
for the cost of reproduction, only, excluding charges for the first 100 
pages. To be included in this category, a requester must fall within the 
definition of a representative of the news media specified in paragraph 
(a)(vi) of this section, and the request must not be made for commercial 
use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of 
the requester will not be considered to be a request that is for 
commercial use. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.
    (4) All other requesters. Any requester that does not fit into any 
of the categories in this section will be charged fees which recover the 
full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records 
that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of 
reproduction and the first two hours of search time will be furnished 
without charge. In addition, under certain circumstances specified in 
paragraph (f) of this section, fees will be waived or reduced at the 
discretion of field facility heads, their designee, or responsible 
Central Office officials. Requests from VA beneficiaries, applicants for 
VA benefits, or other individuals for records retrievable by their name 
or other personal identifier will initially be processed under 38 U.S.C. 
5701 and 5 U.S.C. 552a and will be assessed fees in accordance with the 
applicable fee provisions of Sec. 1.526(i) or Sec. 1.577(f) of this 
part. To the extent that records are not disclosable under these 
provisions, the disclosure of such records will be evaluated under 
Sec. Sec. 1.550 through 1.559 of this part, and fees will be assessed 
under paragraph (e) of this section. Requesters must reasonably describe 
the records sought.

 administrative appeal level once the initial exemptions are applied.
 However, records or portions of records withheld in full under an
 exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed
 again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously
 considered. The cost for such a subsequent review may be properly
 assessed).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Waiving or reducing fees. (1) Fees for records and services 
provided in response to a FOIA request will be waived or reduced when it 
is determined by responsible Central Office officials or field station 
heads or their designee that furnishing the document(s) is in the public 
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is 
not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
    (2) The following factors will be considered in sequence in 
determining whether disclosure of information is in the public interest 
because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public 
understanding of the operations or activities of the government:
    (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns the operations or activities of the government;
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of 
government operations or activities;
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the 
requested information will contribute to public understanding; and
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of government operations or activities.

[[Page 65]]

    (3) The following factors will be considered in sequence in 
determining whether disclosure of information is primarily in the 
commercial interest of the requester:
    (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure; and, if so
    (ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of 
the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
    (4) An appeal from an adverse fee waiver or reduction determination 
will be processed in the same manner as described in Sec. 1.557 of this 
part.
    (g) Other administrative considerations to improve assessment and 
collection of fees--(1) Charging interest--notice and rate. The 
Department of Veterans Affairs may charge interest to those requesters 
who fail to timely pay fees assessed in accordance with these 
regulations. Determination to charge interest will be made by the 
responsible Central Office official or field facility head or designee. 
Interest will be assessed on the unpaid bill beginning on the 31st day 
following the day on which the original building was sent. Interest will 
be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C., and will 
accrue from the date of the billing. Accounting procedures ensure that a 
requester who has remitted the full amount within the time period is 
properly credited with the payment. The fact that the fee has been 
received by VA, even if not processed, will suffice to stay the accrual 
of interest.
    (2) Charges for unsuccessful search. When it is determined by the 
responsible Central Office official or field facility head or designee, 
charges for searching may be assessed, even if records are not located 
to satisfy a request or if records located are determined to be exempt 
from disclosure. If it is determined that search charges are likely to 
exceed $25, the requester will be notified of the estimated amount of 
fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance a willingness to pay 
fees as high as those anticipated. Such notice will offer the requester 
the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of 
reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.
    (3) Aggregating requests. When the responsible Central Office 
official or field facility head or designee reasonably believes that a 
requester or, on rare occasions, a group of requesters acting in 
concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests 
for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the responsible 
Central Office official, or field facility head or designee may 
aggregate (combine) any such requests and charge accordingly. One 
element to consider in determining whether a belief would be reasonable 
is the time period in which the requests occurred. For example, it is 
reasonable to presume that multiple requests within a 30-day time period 
that seek portion(s) of the same document(s) is an attempt to avoid 
payment of charges. For requests made over a longer period, however, 
such presumption becomes harder to sustain. In each case, there must be 
a solid basis for determining that aggregation is warranted. Caution 
will be exercised before aggregating requests from more than one 
requester. There must be a concrete basis on which to conclude that the 
requesters are acting in concert and are acting specifically to avoid 
payment. In no case will multiple requests on unrelated subjects from 
one requester be aggregated.
    (4) Advance payments. The Department of Veterans Affairs may not 
require a requester to make an advance payment, i.e., payment before 
work is commenced or continued on a request, unless:
    (i) The allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay 
are likely to exceed $250. Then, the Department of Veterans Affairs 
should either notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain 
satisfactory assurance of full payment, or require an advance payment of 
an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters 
with no history of payment; or
    (ii) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a 
timely fashion

[[Page 66]]

(i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing). Then, the Department 
of Veterans Affairs may require the requester to pay the full amount 
owed, plus any applicable interest as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section, or to demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid the 
fee, and to make an advance payment of the estimated fee before the 
Department begins to process a new request or a pending request from 
that requester.
    (iii) If a requester is required to make advance payments, as 
described in this section, the time limits prescribed in Sec. 1.553a of 
this part, for responding to initial requests and appeals from initial 
denials, will begin only after the Department has received the advance 
fee payments.
    (5) Debt collection. In the event of non-payment of billed charges 
for disclosure of records, the procedures authorized by the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365) may be used. This may include 
disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection 
agencies.

Sec. 1.556  Requests for other reasonably described records.

    Each administration, staff office, and field facility head will 
designate an employee(s) who will be responsible for initial action on 
(granting or denying) requests to inspect or obtain information from or 
copies of records under their jurisdiction and within the purview of 
Sec. 1.553. This responsibility includes maintaining a uniform listing 
of such requests. Data logged will consist of: Name and address of 
requester; date of receipt of request; brief description of request; 
action taken on request, granted or denied; citation of the specific 
section when request is denied; and date of reply to the requester. In 
the field a denial of any such request may be made only by the Director 
or the designated employee and in Central Office only by the 
administration or staff office head or designee. The letter notifying 
the requester of the denial will be signed by the official making the 
denial decision. Any legal question arising in a field station 
concerning the release of information will be referred to the 
appropriate Regional Counsel for disposition as contemplated by Sec. 
13.401* of this chapter. In Central Office such legal questions will be 
referred to the General Counsel. Any administrative question will be 
referred through administrative channels to the appropriate 
administration or staff office head. All denials or proposed denials at 
the Central Office level will be coordinated with the Director, 
Information Service as well as the General Counsel.

Sec. 1.557  Administrative review.

    (a) Upon denial of a request, the responsible Department of Veterans 
Affairs official or designated employee will inform the requester in 
writing of the denial, cite the specific exemption in Sec. 1.554 upon 
which the denial is based, set forth the names and titles or positions 
of each person responsible for the denial of such request, and advise 
that the denial may be appealed to the General Counsel.
    (b) The final agency decision in such appeals will be made by the 
General Counsel or the Deputy General Counsel.

Sec. 1.575  Social security numbers in veterans' benefits matters.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no one will 
be denied any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of 
refusal to disclose to the Department of Veterans Affairs a social 
security number.
    (b) VA shall require mandatory disclosure of a claimant's or 
beneficiary's social security number (including the social security 
number of a dependent of a claimant or beneficiary) on necessary forms 
as prescribed by the Secretary as a condition precedent to receipt or 
continuation of receipt of compensation or pension payable under the 
provisions of chapters 11, 13 and 15 of title 38, United States Code, 
provided, however, that a claimant shall not be required to furnish VA 
with a social security number for any person to whom a social security 
number has not been assigned. VA may also require mandatory disclosure 
of an applicant's social security number as a condition for receiving 
loan guaranty benefits and a social security number or other taxpayer 
identification number from existing direct and vendee loan borrowers and 
as a condition precedent to receipt of a VA-guaranteed loan, direct loan 
or vendee loan, under chapter 37 of title 38, United States Code. (Pub. 
L. 97-365, sec. 4)
    (c) A person requested by VA to disclose a social security number 
shall be told, as prescribed by Sec. 1.578(c), whether disclosure is 
voluntary or mandatory. The person shall also be told that VA is 
requesting the social security number under the authority of title 38 
U.S.C., or in the case of existing direct or vendee loan borrowers, 
under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6109(a) in conjunction with sections 
145 and 148 of Pub. L. 98-369, or in the case of loan applicants, under 
the authority of section 4 of Pub. L. 97-365. The person shall also be 
told that it will be used in the administration of veterans' benefits in 
the identification of veterans or persons claiming or receiving VA 
benefits and their records, that it may be used in making reports to the 
Internal Revenue Service where required by law, and to determine whether 
a loan guaranty applicant has been identified as a delinquent taxpayer 
by the Internal Revenue Service, and that such taxpayers may have their 
loan applications rejected, and that it may be used to verify social 
security benefit entitlement (including amounts payable) with the Social 
Security Administration and, for other purposes where authorized by both 
title 38 U.S.C., and the Privacy Act of 1974, (Pub. L. 93-579), or, 
where required by another statute. (Pub. L. 97-365, sec. 4)

some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular 
assigned to the individual) under Department of Veterans Affairs 
control, the Department of Veterans Affairs will (except for disclosures 
made under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section) keep an accurate 
accounting as follows:
    (1) For each disclosure of a record to any person or to another

    (2) Retain the accounting made under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section for at least 5 years or the life of the record, whichever is 
longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made;
    (3) Except for disclosures made under paragraph (b)(7) of this 
section, make the accounting under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
available to the individual named in the record at his or her request; 
and
    (4) Inform any person or other agency about any correction or 
notation of dispute made by the agency in accordance with Sec. 1.579 of 
any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an 
accounting of the disclosure was made.
    (d) For the purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.575 through 1.584, the parent 
of any minor, or the legal guardian of any individual who has been 
declared incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, may act on behalf of the individual.
    (e) Section 552a(i), title 5 U.S.C., provides that:
    (1) Any officer or employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
who by

[[Page 69]]

virtue of his or her employment or official position, has possession of, 
or access to, Department of Veterans Affairs records which contain 
individually identifiable information the disclosure of which is 
prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 552a or by Sec. 1.575 series established 
thereunder, and who knowing that disclosure of the specific material is 
so prohibited, willfully discloses the material in any manner to any 
person or agency not entitled to receive it, shall be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.
    (2) Any officer or employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
who willfully maintains a system of records without meeting the notice 
requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) (see Sec. 1.578(d)) shall be guilty 
of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.
    (3) Any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any 
record concerning an individual from the Department of Veterans Affairs 
under false pretenses shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not 
more than $5,000.
    (f) For purposes of Sec. 1.575 series the following definitions 
apply:
    (1) The term agency includes any executive department, military

disseminate.
    (4) The term record means any item, collection, or grouping of

including, but not limited to, his or her education, financial 
transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and 
that contains his or her name, or the identifying number, symbol, or 
other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a 
finger or voice print or a photograph.
    (5) The term system of records means a group of any records under 
the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the 
name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other

    (6) The term statistical record means a record in a system of 
records maintained for statistical research or reporting purposes only 
and not used in whole or in part in making any determination about an 
identifiable individual except as provided by section 8 of title 13 
U.S.C.
    (7) The term routine use means, with respect to the disclosure of a 
record, the use of such record for a purpose which is compatible with 
the purpose for which it was collected.
    (g) When the Department of Veterans Affairs provides by a contract 
for the operation by or on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
of a system of records to accomplish a Department of Veterans Affairs 
function, the Department of Veterans Affairs will, consistent with its 
authority, cause the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (as required by 
subsection (m)) and those of the Sec. 1.575 series to be applied to 
such system. For the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) and Sec. 1.576(e) any 
such contractor and any employee of such contractor, if such contract is 
agreed to on or after September 27, 1975, will be considered to be an 
employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (h) The Department of Veterans Affairs will, for the purposes of 5 
U.S.C. 552a, consider that it maintains any agency record which it 
deposits with the Administrator of General Services for storage, 
processing, and servicing in accordance with section 3103 of title 44 
U.S.C. Any such record will be considered subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1.575 series implementing 5 U.S.C. 552a and any other applicable 
Department of Veterans Affairs regulations. The Administrator of General 
Services is not authorized to disclose such a record except to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, or under regulations established by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs which are not inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. 
552a.
    (i) The Department of Veterans Affairs will, for the purposes of 5 
U.S.C. 552a, consider that a record is maintained by the National 
Archives of the

[[Page 70]]

United States if it pertains to an identifiable individual and was 
transferred to the National Archives prior to September 27, 1975, as a 
record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its 
continued preservation by the United States Government. Such records are 
not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a except that a statement 
generally describing such records (modeled after the requirements 
relating to records subject to subsections (e)(4)(A) through (G) of 5 
U.S.C. 552a) will be published in the Federal Register.
    (j) The Department of Veterans Affairs will also, for the purposes 
of 5 U.S.C. 552a, consider that a record is maintained by the National 
Archives of the United States if it pertains to an identifiable 
individual and is transferred to the National Archives on or after 
September 27, 1975, as a record which has sufficient historical or other 
value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States 
Government. Such records are exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 
552a except subsections (e)(4) (A) through (G) and (e)(9) thereof.

Sec. 1.577  Access to records.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided by law or regulation any individual 
upon request may gain access to his or her record or to any information 
pertaining to him or her which is contained in any system of records 
maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The individual will be 
permitted, and upon his or her request, a person of his or her own 
choosing permitted to accompany him or her, to review the record and 
have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible 
to him or her. The Department of Veterans Affairs will require, however, 
a written statement from the individual authorizing discussion of that 
individual's record in the accompanying person's presence.
    (b) Any individual will be notified, upon request, if any Department 
of Veterans Affairs system of records named contains a record pertaining 
to him or her. Such request must be in writing, over the signature of 
the requester. The request must contain a reasonable description of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs system or systems of records involved, as 
described at least annually by notice published in the Federal Register 
describing the existence and character of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs system or systems of records pursuant to Sec. 1.578(d). The 
request should be made to the office concerned (having jurisdiction over 
the system or systems of records involved) or, if not known, to the 
Director or Department of Veterans Affairs Officer in the nearest 
Department of Veterans Affairs regional office, or to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs Central Office, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 
20420. Personal contact should normally be made during the regular duty 
hours of the office concerned, which are 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday 
through Friday for Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office and 
most field facilities. Identification of the individual requesting the 
information will be required and will consist of the requester's name, 
signature, address, and claim, insurance or other identifying file 
number, if any, as a minimum. Additional identifying data or documents 
may be required in specified categories as determined by operating 
requirements and established and publicized by the promulgation of 
Department of Veterans Affairs regulations. (5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1))
    (c) The department or staff office having jurisdiction over the 
records involved will establish appropriate disclosure procedures and 
will notify the individual requesting disclosure of his or her record or 
information pertaining to him or her of the time, place and conditions 
under which the Department of Veterans Affairs will comply to the extent 
permitted by law and Department of Veterans Affairs regulation. (5 
U.S.C. 552a(f)(2))
    (d) Access to sensitive material in records, including medical and 
psychological records, is subject to the following special procedures. 
When an individual requests access to his or her records, the Department 
of Veterans

[[Page 71]]

Affairs official responsible for administering those records will review 
them and identify the presence of any sensitive records. Sensitive 
records are those that contain information which may have a serious 
adverse effect on the individual's mental or physical health if they are 
disclosed to him or her. If, on review of the records, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs official concludes that there are sensitive records 
involved, the official will refer the records to a Department of 
Veterans Affairs physician, other than a rating board physician, for 
further review. If the physician who reviews the records believes that 
disclosure of the information directly to the individual could have an 
adverse effect on the physical or mental health of the individual, the 
responsible Department of Veterans Affairs official will then advise the 
requesting individual: (1) That the Department of Veterans Affairs will 
disclose the sensitive records to a physician or other professional 
person selected by the requesting individual for such redisclosure as 
the professional person may believe is indicated, and (2) in indicated 
cases, that the Department of Veterans Affairs will arrange for the 
individual to report to a Department of Veterans Affairs facility for a 
discussion of his or her records with a designated Department of 
Veterans Affairs physician and for an explanation of what is included in 
the records. Following such discussion, the records should be disclosed 
to the individual; however, in those extraordinary cases where a careful 
and conscientious explanation of the information considered harmful in 
the record has been made by a Department of Veterans Affairs physician 
and where it is still the physician's professional medical opinion that 
physical access to the information could be physically or mentally 
harmful to the patient, physical access may be denied. Such a denial 
situation should be an unusual, very infrequent occurrence. When denial 
of a request for direct physical access is made, the responsible 
Department of Veterans Affairs official will: (1) Promptly advise the 
individual making the request of the denial; (2) state the reasons for 
the denial of the request (e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(3), 38 U.S.C. 
5701(b)(1)); and (3) advise the requester that the denial may be 
appealed to the General Counsel and of the procedure for such an 
appeal.(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(3))
    (e) Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a, however, allows an individual access 
to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of civil action 
or proceeding. (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(5))
    (f) Fees to be charged, if any, to any individual for making copies 
of his or her record shall not include the cost of any search for and 
review of the record, and will be as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Activity                               Fees

1.526(i) or (j) of this part of any other applicable law.)
    (g) When VA benefit records, which are retrievable by name or 
individual identifier of a VA beneficiary or applicant for VA benefits, 
are requested by the individual to whom the record pertains, the 
duplication fee for one complete set of such records will be waived.

<R05>
Sec. 1.579  Amendment of records.

    (a) Any individual may request amendment of any Department of 
Veterans Affairs record pertaining to him or her. Not later than 10 days 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date 
or receipt of such request, the Department of Veterans Affairs will 
acknowledge in writing such receipt. The Department of Veterans Affairs 
will complete the review to amend or correct a record as soon as 
reasonably possible, normally within 30 days from the receipt of the 
request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) unless 
unusual circumstances preclude completing action within that time. The 
Department of Veterans Affairs will promptly either:
    (1) Correct any part thereof which the individual believes is not 
accurate, relevant, timely or complete; or
    (2) Inform the individual of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
refusal to amend the record in accordance with his or her request, the 
reason for the refusal, the procedures by which the individual may 
request a review of that refusal by the Secretary or designee, and the 
name and address of such official.


(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2))

    (b) The administration or staff office having jurisdiction over the 
records involved will establish procedures for reviewing a request from 
an individual concerning the amendment of any record or information 
pertaining to the individual, for making a determination on the request, 
for an appeal within the Department of Veterans Affairs of an initial 
adverse Department of Veterans Affairs determination, and for whatever 
additional means may be necessary for each individual to be able to 
exercise fully, his or her right under 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (1) Headquarters officials designated as responsible for the 
amendment of records or information located in Central Office and under 
their jurisdiction include, but are not limited to: Secretary; Deputy 
Secretary, as well as other appropriate individuals responsible for the 
conduct of business within the various Department of Veterans Affairs 
administrations and staff offices. These officials will determine and 
advise the requester of the identifying information required to relate 
the request to the appropriate record, evaluate and grant or deny 
requests to amend, review initial adverse determinations upon request, 
and assist requesters desiring to amend or appeal initial adverse 
determinations or learn further of the provisions for judicial review.
    (2) The following field officials are designated as responsible for 
the amendment of records or information located in facilities under 
their jurisdiction, as appropriate: The Director of each Center, 
Domiciliary, Medical Center, Outpatient Clinic, Regional Office, Supply 
Depot, and Regional Counsels. These officials will function in the same 
manner at field facilities as that specified in the preceding 
subparagraph for headquarters officials in Central Office.


(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(4))

    (c) Any individual who disagrees with the Department of Veterans 
Affairs refusal to amend his or her record may request a review of such 
refusal. The Department of Veterans Affairs will complete such review 
not later than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) from the date on which the individual request such review and 
make a final determination unless, for good cause shown, the Secretary 
extends such 30-day period. If, after review, the Secretary or designee 
also refuses to amend the record in accordance with the request the 
individual will be advised of the right to file with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his 
or her disagreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs refusal and 
also advise of the provisions for judicial review of the reviewing 
official's determination. (5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A))
    (d) In any disclosure, containing information about which the 
individual has filed a statement of disagreement, occurring after the 
filing of the statement under paragraph (c) of this section, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs will clearly note any part of the

[[Page 73]]

record which is disputed and provide copies of the statement (and, if 
the Department of Veterans Affairs deems it appropriate, copies of a 
concise statement of the Department of Veterans Affairs reasons for not 
making the amendments requested) to persons or other agencies to whom 
the disputed record has been disclosed. (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(4)) (38 U.S.C.

<R05>
Sec. 1.581  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.582  Exemptions.

    (a) Certain systems of records maintained by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs are exempted from provisions of the Privacy Act in 
accordance with exemptions (j) and (k) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (b) Exemption of Inspector General Systems of Records. The 
Department of Veterans Affairs provides limited access to Inspector 
General Systems of Records as indicated.
    (1) The following systems of records are exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c)(3) and (4), (d), 
(e)(1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I), (e)(5) and (8), (f) and 
(g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a; in addition, the following systems of records are 
exempted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from 
subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f) of 5 
U.S.C. 552a:
    (i) Investigation Reports of Persons Allegedly Involved in 
Irregularities Concerning VA and Federal Laws, Regulations, Programs, 
etc.--VA (11 VA51); and
    (ii) Inspector General Complaint Center Records--VA (66VA53).
    (2) These exemptions apply to the extent that information in those 
systems is subject to exemptions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) and 
(k)(2).
    (3) For the reasons set forth, the systems of records listed under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section are exempted under sections 552a (j)(2) 
and (k)(2) from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (i) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that upon request, an agency must 
give an individual named in a record an accounting which reflects the 
disclosure of the record to other persons or agencies. This accounting 
must state the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure of the record 
and the name and address of the recipient. The application of this 
provision would alert subjects to the existence of the investigation and 
identify that such persons are subject of that investigation. Since 
release of such information to subjects would provide them with 
significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, it 
could result in the altering or destruction of derivative evidence which 
is obtained from third parties, improper influencing of witnesses, and 
other activities that could impede or compromise the investigation.
    (ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4), (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (f) and (g) 
relate to an individual's right to be notified of the existence of 
records pertaining to such individual; requirements for identifying an 
individual who requests access to records; the agency procedures 
relating to access to records and the amendment of information contained 
in such records; and the civil remedies available to the individual in 
the event of adverse determinations by an agency concerning access to or 
amendment of information contained in record systems. This system is 
exempt from the foregoing provisions for the following reasons: To 
notify an individual at the individual's request of the existence of 
records in an investigative file pertaining to such individual or to 
grant access to an investigative file could interfere with investigative 
and enforcement proceedings, threaten the

[[Page 74]]

safety of individuals who have cooperated with authorities, constitute 
an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of others, disclose the 
identity of confidential sources, reveal confidential information 
supplied by these sources, and disclose investigative techniques and 
procedures.
    (iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires the publication of the 
categories of sources of records in each system of records. The 
application of this provision could disclose investigative techniques 
and procedures and cause sources to refrain from giving such information 
because of fear of reprisal, or fear of breach of promises of anonymity 
and confidentiality. This could compromise the ability to conduct 
investigations and to identify, detect and apprehend violators. Even 
though the agency has claimed an exemption from this particular 
requirement, it still plans to generally identify the categories of 
records and the sources for these records in this system. However, for 
the reasons stated in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, this 
exemption is still being cited in the event an individual wants to know 
a specific source of information.
    (iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its 
records only such information about an individual that is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or 
Executive order. These systems of records are exempt from the foregoing 
provisions because:
    (A) It is not possible to detect the relevance or necessity of 
specific information in the early stages of a criminal or other 
investigation.
    (B) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing. 
What appears relevant and necessary may ultimately be determined to be 
unnecessary. It is only after the information is evaluated that the 
relevance and necessity of such information can be established.
    (C) In any investigation the Inspector General may obtain 
information concerning the violations of laws other than those within 
the scope of his/her jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law 
enforcement, the Inspector General should retain this information as it 
may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity and provide leads 
for those law enforcement agencies charged with enforcing other segments 
of civil or criminal law.
    (v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to 
the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual 
when the information may result in adverse determinations about an 
individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. 
The application of this provision would impair investigations of illegal 
acts, violations of the rules of conduct, merit system and any other 
misconduct for the following reasons:
    (A) In order to successfully verify a complaint, most information 
about a complainant or an individual under investigation must be 
obtained from third parties such as witnesses and informers. It is not 
feasible to rely upon the subject of the investigation as a source for 
information regarding his/her activities because of the subject's rights 
against self-incrimination and because of the inherent unreliability of 
the suspect's statements. Similarly, it is not always feasible to rely 
upon the complainant as a source of information regarding his/her 
involvement in an investigation.
    (B) The subject of an investigation will be alerted to the existence 
of an investigation if an attempt is made to obtain information from the 
subject. This would afford the individual the opportunity to conceal any 
criminal activities to avoid apprehension.
    (vi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires that an agency must inform the 
subject of an investigation who is asked to supply information of:
    (A) The authority under which the information is sought and whether 
disclosure of the information is mandatory or voluntary;
    (B) The purposes for which the information is intended to be used;
    (C) The routine uses which may be made of the information; and
    (D) The effects on the subject, if any, of not providing the 
requested information. The reasons for exempting this system of records 
from the foregoing provision are as follows:
    (1) The disclosure to the subject of the purposes of the 
investigation as

[[Page 75]]

stated in paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(B) of this paragraph would provide the 
subject with substantial information relating to the nature of the 
investigation and could impede or compromise the investigation.
    (2) If the complainant or the subject were informed of the 
information required by this provision, it could seriously interfere 
with undercover activities requiring disclosure of the authority under 
which the information is being requested. This could conceivably 
jeopardize undercover agents' identities and impair their safety, as 
well as impair the successful conclusion of the investigation.
    (3) Individuals may be contacted during preliminary information 
gathering in investigations before any individual is identified as the 
subject of an investigation. Informing the individual of the matters 
required by this provision would hinder or adversely affect any present 
or subsequent investigations.
    (vii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires that records be maintained with 
such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably 
necessary to assure fairness to the individual in making any 
determination about an individual. Since the law defines maintain to 
include the collection of information, complying with this provision 
would prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate, 
relevant, timely, and complete at the moment of its collection. In 
gathering information during the course of an investigation it is not 
always possible to determine this prior to collection of the 
information. Facts are first gathered and then placed into a logical 
order which objectively proves or disproves criminal behavior on the 
part of the suspect. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant, 
incomplete, untimely, etc., may take on added meaning as an 
investigation progresses. The restrictions in this provision could 
interfere with the preparation of a complete investigative report.
    (viii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable 
efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on such 
individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal 
process when such process becomes a matter of public record. The notice 
requirement of this provision could prematurely reveal an ongoing 
criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation.
    (c) Exemption of Loan Guaranty Service, Veterans Benefits 
Administration, Systems of Records. The Department of Veterans Affairs 
provides limited access to Loan Guaranty Service, Veterans Benefits 
Administration, systems of records as indicated:
    (1) The following systems of records are exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1) 
and (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I) and (f):
    (i) Loan Guaranty Fee Personnel and Program Participant Records--VA 
(17VA26); and
    (ii) Loan Guaranty Home Condominium and Mobile Home Loan Applicant 
Records and Paraplegic Grant Application Records--VA (55VA26).
    (2) These exemptions apply to the extent that information in these 
systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
    (3) For the reasons set forth, the systems of records listed under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section are exempted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) 
from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (i) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of 
disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at 
their request. These accountings must state the date, nature and purpose 
of each disclosure of the record and the name and address of the 
recipient. The application of this provision would alert subjects of an 
investigation to the existence of the investigation and that such 
persons are subjects of that investigation. Since release of such 
information to subjects of an investigation would provide the subjects 
with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, 
it could result in the altering or destruction of documentary evidence, 
improper influencing of witnesses and other activities that could impede 
or compromise the investigation.
    (ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(4) (G) and (H) and (f) relate to an 
individual's right to be notified of the existence of records pertaining 
to such individual; requirements for identifying an individual

[[Page 76]]

who requests access to records; and the agency procedures relating to 
access to records and the contest of information contained in such 
records. This system is exempt from the foregoing provisions for the 
following reasons: To notify an individual at the individual's request 
of the existence of records in an investigative file pertaining to such 
individual or to grant access to an investigative file could interfere 
with investigative and enforcement proceedings; constitute an 
unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of others; disclose the 
identity of confidential sources and reveal confidential information 
supplied by these sources and disclose investigative techniques and 
procedures.
    (iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires the publication of the 
categories of sources of records in each system of records. The 
application of this provision could disclose investigative techniques 
and procedures and cause sources to refrain from giving such information 
because of fear of reprisal, or fear of breach of promises of anonymity 
and confidentiality. This would compromise the ability to conduct 
investigations. Even though the agency has claimed an exemption from 
this particular requirement, it still plans to generally identify the 
categories of records and the sources for these records in this system. 
However, for the reasons stated above, this exemption is still being 
cited in the event an individual wanted to know a specific source of 
information.
    (iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its 
records only such information about an individual that is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or 
Executive order. This system of records is exempt from the foregoing 
provision because:
    (A) It is not possible to detect relevance or necessity of specific 
information in the early stages of an investigation.
    (B) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing. 
What appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be 
determined to be unnecessary. It is only after the information is 
evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be 
established.
    (C) In interviewing persons or obtaining other forms of evidence 
during an investigation, information may be supplied to the investigator 
which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the 
investigation but which is appropriate in a thorough investigation. 
Oftentimes, such information cannot readily be segregated.
    (4) The following system of records is exempt pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), 
(e)(4) (G), (H) and (I) and (f): Loan Guaranty Fee Personnel and Program 
Participant Records--VA (17 VA 26).
    (5) This exemption applies to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
    (6) For the reasons set forth, the system of records listed in 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section is exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) 
from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (i) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of 
disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at 
their request. These accountings must state the date, nature and purpose 
of each disclosure of the record and the name and address of the 
recipient. The application of this provision would alert subjects of 
background suitability investigations to the existence of the 
investigation and reveal that such persons are subjects of that 
investigation. Since release of such information to subjects of an 
investigation would provide the subjects with significant information 
concerning the nature of the investigation, it could result in revealing 
the identity of a confidential source.
    (ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(4) (G) and (H) and (f) relate to an 
individual's right to be notified of the existence of records pertaining 
to such individual; requirements for identifying an individual who 
requests access to records; and the agency procedures relating to access 
to records and the contest of information contained in such records. 
This system is exempt from the foregoing provisions for the following 
reasons: To notify an individual at the individual's

[[Page 77]]

request of the existence of records in an investigative file pertaining 
to such an individual or to grant access to an investigative file would 
disclose the identity of confidential sources and reveal confidential 
information supplied by these sources.
    (iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires the publication of the 
categories of sources of records in each system of records. The 
application of this provision could disclose sufficient information to 
disclose the identity of a confidential source and cause sources to 
refrain from giving such information because of fear of reprisal, or 
fear of breach of promises of anonymity and confidentiality. This would 
compromise the ability to conduct background suitability investigations.
    (iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its 
records only such information about an individual that is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or 
Executive order. This system of records is exempt from the foregoing 
provision because:
    (A) It is not possible to detect relevance and necessity of specific 
information from a confidential source in the early stages of an 
investigation.
    (B) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing. 
What appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be 
determined to be unnecessary. It is only after the information is 
evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be 
established regarding suitability for VA approval as a fee appraiser or 
compliance inspector.
    (C) In interviewing persons or obtaining other forms of evidence 
during an investigation for suitability for VA approval, information may 
be supplied to the investigator which relates to matters incidental to 
the main purpose of the investigation but which is appropriate in a 
thorough investigation. Oftentimes, such information cannot readily be 
segregated and disclosure might jeopardize the identity of a 
confidential source.
    (d) Exemption of Police and Security Records. VA provides limited 
access to one Security and Law Enforcement System of Records, Police and 
Security Records--VA (103VA07B).
    (1) The investigations records and reports contained in this System 
of Records are exempted [pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) of the Privacy 
Act of 1974] from Privacy Act subsections (c)(3) and (c)(4); (d); (e)(1) 
through (e)(3), (e)(4)(G) through (e)(4)(I), (e)(5), and (e)(8); (f); 
and (g); in addition, they are exempted [pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) 
of the Privacy Act of 1974] from Privacy Act subsections (c)(3); (d); 
(e)(1), (e)(4)(G) through (e)(4)(I); and (f).
    (2) These records contained in the Police and Security Records--VA 
(103VA076B) are exempted for the following reasons:
    (i) The application of Privacy Act subsection (c)(3) would alert 
subjects to the existence of the investigation and reveal that they are 
subjects of that investigation. Providing subjects with information 
concerning the nature of the investigation could result in alteration or 
destruction of evidence which is obtained from third parties, improper 
influencing of witnesses, and other activities that could impede or 
compromise the investigation.
    (ii) The application of Privacy Act subsections (c)(4); (d); 
(e)(4)(G) and (e)(4)(H); (f); and (g) could interfere with investigative 
and enforcement proceedings, threaten the safety of individuals who have 
cooperated with authorities, constitute an unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy of others, disclose the identity of confidential 
sources, reveal confidential information supplied by these sources, and 
disclose investigative techniques and procedures.
    (iii) The application of Privacy Act subsection (e)(4)(I) could 
disclose investigative techniques and procedures and cause sources to 
refrain from giving such information because of fear of reprisal, or 
fear of breach of promises of anonymity and confidentiality. This could 
compromise the ability to conduct investigations and to identify, detect 
and apprehend violators. Even though the agency has claimed an exemption 
from this particular requirement, it still plans to generally identify 
the categories of records and the sources of these records in this 
system.

[[Page 78]]

However, for the reason stated in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, 
this exemption is still being cited in the event an individual wants to 
know a specific source of information.
    (iv) These records contained in the Police and Security Records--VA 
(103VA076B) are exempt from Privacy Act subsection (e)(1) because it is 
not possible to detect the relevance or necessity of specific 
information in the early stages of a criminal or other investigation. 
Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing. What 
appears relevant and necessary may ultimately be determined to be 
unnecessary. It is only after the information is evaluated that the 
relevance and necessity of such information can be established. In any 
investigation, the Office of Security and Law Enforcement may obtain 
information concerning violations of laws other than those within the 
scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, 
the Office of Security and Law Enforcement should retain this 
information as it may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity 
and provide leads for those law enforcement agencies charged with 
enforcing other segments of civil or criminal law.
    (v) The application of Privacy Act subsection (e)(2) would impair 
investigations of illegal acts, violations of the rules of conduct, 
merit system and any other misconduct for the following reasons:
    (A) In order to successfully verify a complaint, most information 
about a complainant or an individual under investigation must be 
obtained from third parties such as witnesses and informers. It is not 
feasible to rely upon the subject of the investigation as a source for 
information regarding his/her activities because of the subject's rights 
against self-incrimination and because of the inherent unreliability of 
the suspect's statements. Similarly, it is not always feasible to rely 
upon the complainant as a source of information regarding his/her 
involvement in an investigation.
    (B) The subject of an investigation will be alerted to the existence 
of an investigation if an attempt is made to obtain information from the 
subject. This would afford the individual the opportunity to conceal any 
criminal activities to avoid apprehension.
    (vi) The reasons for exempting these records in the Police and 
Security Records--VA (103VA07B) from Privacy Act subsection (e)(3) are 
as follows:
    (A) The disclosure to the subject of the purposes of the 
investigation would provide the subject with substantial information 
relating to the nature of the investigation and could impede or 
compromise the investigation.
    (B) Informing the complainant or the subject of the information 
required by this provision could seriously interfere with undercover 
activities, jeopardize the identities of undercover agents and impair 
their safety, and impair the successful conclusion of the investigation.
    (C) Individuals may be contacted during preliminary information 
gathering in investigations before any individual is identified as the 
subject of an investigation. Informing the individual of the matters 
required by this provision would hinder or adversely affect any present 
or subsequent investigations.
    (vii) Since the Privacy Act defines ``maintain'' to include the 
collection of information, complying with subsection (e)(5) would 
prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate, relevant, 
timely, and complete at the moment of its collection. In gathering 
information during the course of an investigation, it is not always 
possible to make this determination prior to collecting the information. 
Facts are first gathered and then placed into a logical order which 
objectively proves or disproves criminal behavior on the part of the 
suspect. Material that may seem unrelated, irrelevant, incomplete, 
untimely, etc., may take on added meaning as an investigation 
progresses. The restrictions in this provision could interfere with the 
preparation of a complete investigative report.
    (viii) The notice requirement of Privacy Act subsection (e)(8) could 
prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of 
the investigation.

and return a notice provided by the Regional Office Director (or the 
Regional Office

[[Page 80]]

Director's designee) of the Regional Office of jurisdiction for the 
claim. The notice will specify the applicable operational and security 
requirements for access and an acknowledgment that the breach of any of 
these requirements is grounds for disqualification from access.

[59 FR 47084, Sept. 14, 1994. Redesignated at 73 FR 29870, May 22, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 1.602  Utilization of access.

    (a) Once an individual or organization has been issued the necessary 
passwords to obtain read-only access to the automated claims records of 
individuals represented, access will be exercised in accordance with the 
following requirements:
    (1) The individual or organization will obtain access only from 
equipment and software approved in advance by the Regional Office from 
the location where the individual or organization primarily conducts its 
representation activities which also has been approved in advance;
    (2) The individual will use only his or her assigned password to 
obtain access;
    (3) The individual will not reveal his or her password to anyone 
else, or allow anyone else to use his or her password;
    (4) The individual will access only the VBA automated claims records 
of VA claimants who are represented by the person obtaining access or by 
the organization employing the person obtaining access;
    (5) The individual will access a claimant's automated claims record 
solely for the purpose of representing that claimant in a claim for 
benefits administered by VA;
    (6) Upon receipt of the password, the individual will destroy the 
hard copy; no written or printed record containing the password will be 
retained; and
    (7) The individual and organization will comply with all security 
requirements VBA deems necessary to ensure the integrity and 
confidentiality of the data and VBA's automated computer systems.
    (b) An organization granted access shall ensure that all employees 
provided access in accordance with these regulations will receive 
regular, adequate training on proper security, including the items 
listed in Sec. 1.603(a). Where an individual such as an attorney or 
registered agent is granted access, he or she will regularly review the 
security requirements for the system as set forth in these regulations 
and in any additional materials provided by VBA.
    (c) VBA may, at any time without notice:
    (1) Inspect the computer hardware and software utilized to obtain 
access and their location;
    (2) Review the security practices and training of any individual or 
organization granted access under these regulations; and
    (3) Monitor an individual's or organization's access activities. By 
applying for, and exercising, the access privileges under Sec. Sec. 
1.600 through 1.603, the applicant expressly consents to VBA monitoring 
the access activities of the applicant at any time.

29879, May 22, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 1.603  Disqualification.

    (a) The Regional Office Director or the Regional Office Director's 
designee may revoke an individual's or an organization's access 
privileges to a particular claimant's records because the individual or 
organization no longer represents the claimant, and, therefore, the 
beneficiary's consent is no longer in effect. The individual or 
organization is no longer entitled to access as a matter of law under 
the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 38 U.S.C. 5701 and 7332. Under these 
circumstances, the individual or organization is not entitled to any 
hearing or to present any evidence in opposition to the revocation.
    (b) The Regional Office Director or the Regional Office Director's 
designee may revoke an individual's or an organization's access 
privileges either to an individual claimant's records or to all 
claimants' records in the VBA automated claims benefits systems if the 
individual or organization:
    (1) Violates any of the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.600 through 
1.603;
    (2) Accesses or attempts to access data for a purpose other than 
representation of an individual veteran;

[[Page 81]]

    (3) Accesses or attempts to access data other than the data 
specified in these regulations;
    (4) Accesses or attempts to access data on a VA beneficiary who is 
not represented either by the individual who obtains access or by the 
organization employing the individual who obtains access;
    (5) Utilizes unapproved computer hardware or software to obtain or 
attempt to obtain access to VBA computer systems;
    (6) Modifies or attempts to modify data in the VBA computer systems.
    (c) If VBA is considering revoking an individual's access under 
Sec. 1.603(b), and that individual works for an organization, the 
Regional Office of jurisdiction will notify the organization of the 
pendency of the action.
    (d) After an individual's access privileges are revoked, if the 
conduct which resulted in revocation was such that it merits reporting 
to an appropriate governmental licensing organization such as a State 
bar, the VBA Regional Office of jurisdiction will immediately inform the 
licensing organization in writing of the fact that the individual's 
access privileges were revoked and the reasons why.
    (e) The VBA Regional Office of jurisdiction may temporarily suspend 
access privileges prior to any determination on the merits of the 
proposed revocation where the Regional Office Director or the Director's 
designee determines that such immediate suspension is necessary in order 
to protect the integrity of the system or confidentiality of the data in 
the system from a reasonably foreseeable compromise. However, in such 
case, the Regional Office shall offer the individual or organization an 
opportunity to respond to the charges immediately after the temporary 
suspension.

domestic patent and other necessary documents executed by the employee 
inventor prepared by or through the General Counsel, Deputy General 
Counsel or Assistant General Counsel for Professional Staff Group IV, 
unless some other agency has primary interest or it is decided to 
dedicate the invention to the public. Such dedication requires approval 
of the Secretary of Commerce. Applications on behalf of the Government 
for foreign patents may be made if determined to be in the public 
interest. The payment of necessary expenses in connection with any 
application filed or patent obtained under this section by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs is authorized.

<R05>
Sec. 1.655  Government license in invention of employee.

    If an invention is made by an employee and it is determined that the 
employee inventor is entitled to full ownership under 37 CFR 501.6, 
subject to a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the 
Government with power to grant sublicenses for all Governmental 
purposes, it shall be the duty of the employee inventor to notify the 
Office of General Counsel of the status of the patent application, 
including the patent application number, so that the Department may 
protect the interests reserved to the Government under 37 CFR 501.6.

[61 FR 29658, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.656  Information to be submitted by inventor.

    (a) In the case of an invention or believed invention, the inventor 
will prepare a statement for submission to his or her immediate 
superior. It will be submitted regardless of where the ownership is 
believed to exist. The statement will consist of two parts:
    (1) One part of the statement will be a disclosure of the invention 
sufficient to permit the preparation of a patent applicant. It shall 
consist of a description, including where applicable, of the parts or 
components of the invention as shown on the drawings or blueprints, 
accompanied further by a description of the construction and operation 
of the invention. Photographs of the invention may be included. The 
inventor should state pertinent prior art known to him or her, and set 
forth in detail as clearly as possible the respects which his or her 
invention differs.
    (2) The other part of the statement will set forth the circumstances 
attending the making of the invention. It will include the full name and 
address of the inventor; the grade and title of his or her position; 
whether full time or part time; his or her duties at the time the 
invention was made; the facts pertinent to a determination whether the 
invention bore a direct relation to or was made in consequence of such 
official duties; whether there was, and if so, the terms of any special 
agreement or understanding with respect to use or manufacture of his or 
her invention; date of the invention; when and where it was conceived, 
constructed and tested; whether it was made entirely during working 
hours; whether, and to what extent there was a contribution by the 
Government of any of the following: Facilities; equipment; materials or 
supplies; funds; information; time or services of other Government 
employees on duty. When the invention is disclosed through publication, 
or in consultation with a manufacturer or attorney, simultaneous 
notification of

[[Page 83]]

the publication shall be given to the Office of General Counsel. A copy 
of the article will accompany the notification.
    (b) The inventor's immediate superior shall promptly review the 
statement of the employee inventor for completeness and accuracy, and 
shall certify that the employee's statement of circumstances attending 
the invention is or is not correct, giving reasons if pertinent. The 
file should then be submitted through the facility head (or 
administration heads or top staff officials in the case of Central 
Office employees) to the General Counsel together with any comments or 
recommendations.

[61 FR 29658, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.657  Determination of rights.

<R05>
Sec. 1.659  Relationship to incentive awards program.

    Procedures set out in the regulations concerning inventions by 
employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs are not affected by the 
submission or proposed submission of an employee suggestion or idea on 
an item which may be patentable. Consideration of an item for a 
determination of ownership rights and also for an incentive award will 
proceed simultaneously, usually on separate correspondence. An employee 
suggestion or copies and extracts of the file may be forwarded to the 
General Counsel by the reviewing or awarding authority, or by the 
facility head, for an ownership determination where the employee idea or 
suggestion involves an invention. The employee shall be directed to 
submit a disclosure of invention in accordance with these regulations if 
such has not been previously submitted.

<R05>
Sec. 1.660  Expeditious handling.

    No patent may be granted where the invention has been in public use 
or publicly disclosed for more than one year before filing of a patent 
application. Hence, submissions involving inventions should be made as 
promptly as possible in order to avoid delay which might jeopardize 
title to the invention or impair the rights of the inventor or the 
Government.

Sec. 1.663  Licensing of Government-owned inventions.

    (a) The licensing of Government-owned inventions under VA control 
and custody will be conducted pursuant to the regulations on the 
licensing of Government-owned inventions contained in 37 CFR part 404, 
and 15 U.S.C. 3710a, as appropriate.

[[Page 84]]

    (b) Any person whose application for a license in an invention under 
VA control and custody has been denied; whose license in such an 
invention has been modified or terminated, in whole or in part; or who 
timely filed a written objection in response to a proposal to grant an 
exclusive or partially exclusive license in an invention under VA 
control or custody, may, if damaged, appeal any decision or 
determination concerning the grant, denial, interpretation, 
modification, or termination of a license to the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs. Such appeal shall be in writing; shall set forth with 
specificity the basis of the appeal; and shall be postmarked not later 
than 60 days after the action being appealed. Upon request of the 
appellant, such appeal may be considered by one to three persons 
appointed on a case-by-case basis by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. 
Such a request will be granted only if it accompanies the written 
appeal. Appellant may appear and be represented by counsel before such a 
panel, which will sit in Washington, DC. If the appeal challenges a 
decision to grant an exclusive or partially exclusive license in an 
invention under VA control or custody, the licensee shall be furnished a 
copy of the appeal, shall be given the opportunity to respond in 
writing, may appear and be represented by counsel at any hearing 
requested by appellant, and may request a hearing if appellant has not, 
under the same terms and conditions, at which the appellant may also 
appear and be represented by counsel.

    (a) Administrative subdivision of funds. An administrative 
subdivision of funds is any administrative subdivision of an 
appropriation or fund which makes funds available in a specified amount 
for the purpose of controlling apportionments or reapportionments.
    (b) Allotment. An allotment is an authorization by the Director, 
Office of Budget and Finance, to department and staff office heads 
(allottees) to incur obligations within specified amounts, during a 
specified period, pursuant to an Office of Management and Budget 
apportionment or reapportionment action. The creation of an obligation 
in excess of an allotment is a violation of the administrative 
subdivision of funds.
    (c) Allowance. An allowance is a subdivision below the allotment 
level, and is a guideline which may be issued by department or staff 
office heads (allottees) to facility directors and other officials, 
showing the expenditure pattern or operating budget they will be 
expected to follow in light of the program activities contemplated by 
the overall VA budget or plan of expenditure. The creation of an 
obligation in excess of an allowance is not a violation of the 
administrative subdivision of funds.

(Authority: 31 U.S.C. 1514)


<R05>
Sec. 1.672  Responsibilities.

    (a) The issuance of an allotment to the administration and staff 
office heads (allottees) is required and is the responsibility of the 
Director, Office of Budget and Finance. The sum of such allotments shall 
not be in excess of the amount indicated in the apportionment or 
reapportionment document.

[[Page 85]]

    (b) The issuance of an allowance is discretionary with department or 
staff office heads (allottees), as an allowance is merely a management 
device which allottees may utilize in carrying out their 
responsibilities. Allottees are responsible for keeping obligations 
within the amounts of their allotments, whether allowances are issued or 
not.
    (c) The Director, Office of Budget and Finance, is responsible for 
requesting apportionments and reapportionments from the Office of 
Management and Budget. Administration and staff heads shall promptly 
request that an appropriation or fund be reapportioned if feasible 
whenever it appears that obligations may exceed the level of the 
apportionment.

(Authority: 31 U.S.C. 1514)


<R05>
Sec. 1.673  Responsibility for violations of the administrative subdivision of funds.

    (a) In the event an allotment or an apportionment is exceeded except 
in the circumstances described in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
following factors will be considered in determining which official, or 
officials, are responsible for the violation.
    (1) Knowledge of circumstances which could lead to an allotment or 
apportionment being exceeded;
    (2) Whether the official had received explicit instructions to 
continue or cease incurring obligations;
    (3) Whether any action was taken in contravention of or with 
disregard for, instructions to monitor obligations incurred;
    (4) Whether the official had the authority to curtail obligations by 
directing a change in the manner of operations of the department or 
staff office; or
    (5) Any other facts which tend to fix the responsibility for the 
obligations which resulted in the allotment or apportionment being 
exceeded.
    (b) In the event that the sum of the allotments made in a particular 
fiscal year exceeds the amount apportioned by the Office of Management 
and Budget, and the apportionment is subsequently exceeded because of 
this action, the official who made the excess allotments will be the 
official responsible for the violation.

<R05>
Sec. 1.702  Policy.

    (a) The Department of Veterans Affairs will supplement and expand 
the national effort to assist in the location and recovery of missing 
children by maximizing the economical use of missing children 
information in domestic official mail and publications directed to 
members of the public and Department of Veterans Affairs employees.
    (b) The Department of Veterans Affairs will insert pictures and 
biographical information related to missing children in a variety of 
official mail originating at the Department of Veterans Affairs 
automation centers. In addition, pictures and biographical information 
are printed in self-mailers and other Department of Veterans Affairs 
publications (newsletters, bulletins, etc.).

[[Page 86]]

    (c) The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (National 
Center) is the sole source from which the Department of Veterans Affairs 
will acquire the camera-ready and other photographic and biographical 
materials to be disseminated for use by Department of Veterans Affairs 
organizational units. The information is ordered and disseminated by 
Information Management Service.
    (d) The Department of Veterans Affairs will remove all printed 
inserts and other materials from circulation or other use within a 
three-month period from the date the National Center notifies the 
Department of Veterans Affairs that a child whose picture and 
biographical information have been made available to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs has been recovered or that permission of the parent(s) 
or guardian to use the child's photograph and biographical information 
has been withdrawn. The National Center is responsible for immediately 
notifying the Department of Veterans Affairs contact person, in writing, 
of the need to withdraw from circulation official mail and other 
materials related to a particular child. Photographs which were 
reasonably current as of the time of the child's disappearence shall be 
the only acceptable form of visual medium or pictorial likeness used in 
official mail.
    (e) The Department of Veterans Affairs will give priority to 
official mail that is addressed to:
    (1) Members of the public that will be received in the United 
States, its territories and possessions; and
    (2) Inter- and intra-agency publications and other media that will 
also be widely disseminated to Department of Veterans Affairs employees.
    (f) The Department of Veterans Affairs will avoid repetitive 
mailings of material to the same individuals.
    (g) All Department of Veterans Affairs employee suggestions and/or 
recommendations for additional cost-effective opportunities to use 
photographs and biographical data on missing children will be provided 
to the Department of Veterans Affairs contact person.
    (h) These shall be the sole regulations for the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and its component organizational units.

    (b) To ensure prompt delivery of benefit payments and 
correspondence, claimants who seek personal assistance from Veterans

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103; 5120)

    (d) If a claimant fails or refuses to provide a current mailing 
address to the Department of Veterans Affairs, all correspondence and 
any checks for benefits to which the claimant is entitled will be 
delivered to the Agent Cashier of the regional office which adjudicated 
or is adjudicating the claim in the case of compensation, pension or 
survivors' benefits, to the Agent Cashier of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs facility closest to the educational institution or training 
establishment attended by a claimant in the case of education benefits, 
or to the Agent Cashier of any other Department of Veterans Affairs 
facility deemed by the Agency to be appropriate under the circumstances 
of the particular case. The claimant, within 30 days after issuance, may 
obtain delivery of any check or correspondence held by an Agent Cashier 
upon presentation of proper identification. Checks unclaimed after 30 
days will be returned to the Department of the Treasury and the 
correspondence to the regional office or facility of jurisdiction. 
Thereafter, the claimant must request the reissuance of any such check 
or item of correspondence by written notice to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs.

                   Part-Time Career Employment Program

    Source: 44 FR 55172, Sept. 25, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.891  Purpose of program.

    Many individuals in society possess great productive potential which 
goes unrealized because they cannot meet the requirements of a standard 
workweek. Permanent part-time employment also provides benefits to other 
individuals in a variety of ways, such as providing older individuals 
with a gradual transition into retirement, providing employment 
opportunities to handicapped individuals or others who requires a 
reduced workweek, providing parents opportunities to balance family 
responsibilities with the need for additional income, and assisting 
students who must finance their own education or vocational training. In 
view of this, the Department of Veterans Affairs will operate a part-
time career employment program, consistent with the needs of its 
beneficiaries and its responsibilities.

review are:
    (a) Mission requirements.
    (b) Workload.
    (c) Employment ceilings and budgetary considerations.

Sec. 1.893  Establishing and converting part-time positions.

    Position management and other internal reviews may indicate that 
positions may be either converted from full-time or initially 
established as part-time positions. Criteria listed in Sec. 1.892 may 
be used during these reviews. If a decision is made to convert to or to 
establish a part-time position, regular position management and 
classification procedures will be followed.

(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 3402)

annual goals and set interim and final deadlines for achieving these 
goals. This plan will be applicable throughout the agency, but may be 
supplemented by field facilities.

(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 3402)


<R05>
Sec. 1.895  Review and evaluation.

    The part-time career employment program will be reviewed through

    (a) The standards contained in Sec. Sec. 1.900 through 1.953 are 
issued pursuant to the Federal Claims Collection Standards, issued by 
the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) in parts 900 through 904 of 31 CFR, as well as other debt 
collection authority issued by Treasury in part 285 of 31 CFR, and apply

apply to any debt based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of 
the antitrust laws or to any debt involving fraud, the presentation of a 
false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party 
having an interest in the claim. Only the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
has the authority to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection 
activity on such claims. The standards in Sec. Sec. 1.900 through 1.953 
relating to the administrative collection of claims do apply, but only

presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the 
debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, VA shall promptly 
refer the case to DOJ. At its discretion, DOJ may return the claim to VA 
for further handling in accordance with the standards in Sec. Sec. 
1.900 through 1.953.

arising from its activities.
    (b) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g) and the procedures set 
forth at 31 CFR 285.12, VA shall transfer to Treasury any non-tax debt 
or claim that has been delinquent for a period of 180 days or more so 
that Treasury may take appropriate action to collect the debt or 
terminate collection action. This requirement does not apply to any debt 
that:
    (1) Is in litigation or foreclosure;
    (2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program;
    (3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a 
period of time acceptable to the Secretary of the Treasury;
    (4) Is at a debt collection center for a period of time acceptable 
to the Secretary of the Treasury;
    (5) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within 3 
years after the debt first became delinquent; or
    (6) Is exempt from this requirement based on a determination by the 
Secretary of the Treasury that exemption for a certain class of debt is 
in the best interest of the United States. VA may request that the 
Secretary of the Treasury exempt specific classes of debts.
    (c) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6) and the procedures set 
forth in 31 CFR part 285, VA shall notify Treasury of all past due, 
legally enforceable non-tax debt that is over 180 days delinquent for 
purposes of administrative offset, including tax refund offset and 
federal salary offset. (Procedures for referral to Treasury for tax 
refund offset are found at 31 CFR 285.2 and procedures for referral to 
Treasury for federal salary offset are found at 38 CFR 1.995 and 31 CFR

Sec. 1.911  Collection of debts owed by reason of participation in a benefits program.

    (a) Scope. This section applies to the collection of debts resulting 
from an individual's participation in a VA benefit or home loan program. 
It does not apply to VA's other debt collection activities. Standards 
for the demand for payment of all other debts owed to VA are set forth 
in Sec. 1.911a. School liability debts are governed by Sec. 21.4009 of 
this title.
    (b) Written demands. When VA has determined that a debt exists by 
reason of an administrative decision or by operation of law, VA shall 
promptly demand, in writing, payment of the debt. VA shall notify the 
debtor of his or her

[[Page 91]]

rights and remedies and the consequences of failure to cooperate with 
collection efforts. Generally, one demand letter is sufficient, but 
subsequent demand letters may be issued as needed.
    (1) The Secretary determines that further demand would be futile;
    (2) The debtor has indicated in writing that he or she does not 
intend to pay the debt;
    (3) Judicial action to protect the Government's interest is 
indicated under the circumstances; or
    (4) Collection by offset pursuant to Sec. 1.912a can be made.
    (c) Rights and remedies. Subject to limitations referred to in this 
paragraph, the debtor has the right to informally dispute the existence 
or amount of the debt, to request waiver of collection of the debt, to a 
hearing on the waiver request, and to appeal the Department of Veterans 
Affairs decision underlying the debt. These rights can be exercised 
separately or simultaneously. Except as provided in Sec. 1.912a 
(collection by offset), the exercise of any of these rights will not 
stay any collection proceeding.
    (1) Informal dispute. This means that the debtor writes to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs and questions whether he or she owes the 
debt or whether the amount is accurate. The Department of Veterans 
Affairs will, as expeditiously as possible, review the accuracy of the 
debt determination. If the resolution is adverse to the debtor, he or 
she may also request waiver of collection as indicated in paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (2) Request for waiver; hearing on request. The debtor has the right 
to request waiver of collection, in accordance with Sec. 1.963 or Sec. 
1.964, and the right to a hearing on the request. Requests for waivers 
must be filed in writing. A waiver request must be filed within the time 
limit set forth in 38 U.S.C. 5302. If waiver is granted, in whole or in 
part, the debtor has a right to refund of amounts already collected up 
to the amount waived.
    (3) Appeal. In accordance with parts 19 and 20 of this title, the 
debtor may appeal the decision underlying the debt.
    (d) Notification. The Department of Veterans Affairs shall notify 
the debtor in writing of the following:
    (1) The exact amount of the debt;
    (2) The specific reasons for the debt, in simple and concise 
language;
    (3) The rights and remedies described in paragraph (c) of this 
section, including a brief explanation of the concept of, and 
requirements for, waiver;
    (4) That collection may be made by offset from current or future VA 
benefit payments (see Sec. 1.912a). In addition, the debtor shall be 
advised of any policies with respect to the use of credit bureaus, debt 
collection centers, and collection agencies; any other remedies to 
enforce payment of the debt, including administrative wage garnishment, 
Federal salary offset, tax refund offset, and litigation; and the 
requirement that any debt delinquent for more than 180 days be 
transferred to Treasury for administrative offset or collection.
    (5) That interest and administrative costs may be assessed in 
accordance with Sec. 1.915, as appropriate;
    (6) That the debtor shall have the opportunity to inspect and copy 
records; and
    (7) That the debtor shall have the opportunity to enter into a 
repayment agreement.
    (e) Sufficiency of notification. Notification is sufficient when 
sent by ordinary mail directed to the debtor's last known address and 
not returned as undeliverable by postal authorities.
    (f) Further explanation. Further explanation may be found for--
    (1) Appellate rights, in parts 19 and 20 of this title;
    (2) Notification of any decision affecting the payment of benefits 
or granting relief, in Sec. 3.103(e);
    (3) Right to appeal a waiver decision, in Sec. 1.958;
    (4) Refund to a successful waiver applicant of money already 
collected, in Sec. 1.967; and
    (5) The assessment of interest and administrative costs, in Sec. 
1.915.

Sec. 1.911a  Collection of non-benefit debts.

    (a) This section is written in accordance with 31 CFR 901.2 and 
applies to the demand for payment of all debts, except those debts 
arising out of participation in a VA benefit or home loan program. 
Procedures for the demand for payment of VA benefit or home loan program 
debts are set forth in Sec. 1.911.
    (b) Written demand as described in paragraph (c) of this section 
shall be made promptly upon a debtor of VA in terms that inform the 
debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with VA to resolve 
the debt. Generally, one demand letter is sufficient, but subsequent 
letters may be issued. In determining the timing of the demand letter, 
VA should give due regard to the need to refer debts promptly to the 
Department of Justice for litigation, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
1.950 through 1.953. When necessary to protect VA's interest (for 
example, to prevent the running of a statute of limitations), written 
demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under 38 CFR 1.900 
through 1.953, including immediate referral for litigation.
    (c) The written demand letter shall inform the debtor of:
    (1) The basis for the indebtedness and any rights the debtor may 
have to seek review within VA, including the right to request waiver;
    (2) The applicable standards for imposing any interest or other late 
payment charges;
    (3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid interest and 
other late payment charges and enforced collection, which generally 
should not be more than 30 days from the date that the demand letter is 
mailed;
    (4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or 
office within the agency;
    (5) The opportunity to inspect and copy VA records related to the 
debt; and
    (6) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.
    (d) In addition to the items listed in paragraph (c) of this 
section, VA should include in the demand letter VA's willingness to 
discuss alternative methods of payment and its policies with respect to 
the use of credit bureaus, debt collection centers, and collection 
agencies. The letter should also indicate the agency's remedies to 
enforce payment of the debt (including assessment of interest, 
administrative costs and penalties, administrative garnishment, Federal 
salary offset, tax refund offset, administrative offset, and litigation) 
and the requirement that any debt delinquent for more than 180 days be 
transferred to Treasury for collection.
    (e) VA should respond promptly to communications from debtors and 
should advise debtors who dispute debts, or request waiver, to furnish 
available evidence to support their contentions.
    (f) Prior to referring a debt for litigation, VA should advise each 
debtor determined to be liable for the debt that, unless the debt can be 
collected administratively, litigation may be initiated. This 
notification may be given as part of a demand letter under paragraph (c) 
of this section or in a separate letter.
    (g) When VA learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with 
respect to a debtor, before proceeding with further collection action, 
VA should immediately seek legal advice from either VA's General Counsel 
or Regional Counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code on any 
pending or contemplated collection activities. Unless VA determines that 
the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 
362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect, in most cases collection 
activity against the debtor should stop immediately.
    (1) After VA seeks legal advice, a proof of claim should be filed in 
most cases with the bankruptcy court or the Trustee. VA should refer to 
the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 106 relating to the consequences on 
sovereign immunity of filing a proof of claim.
    (2) If VA is a secured creditor, it may seek relief from the 
automatic stay regarding its security, subject to the provisions and 
requirements of 11 U.S.C. 362.
    (3) Offset is prohibited in most cases by the automatic stay. 
However, VA should seek legal advice from VA's General Counsel or 
Regional Counsel to

[[Page 93]]

determine whether payments to the debtor and payments of other agencies 
available for offset may be frozen by VA until relief from the automatic 
stay can be obtained from the bankruptcy court. VA also should seek 
legal advice from VA's General Counsel or Regional Counsel to determine 
whether recoupment is available.

<R05>
Sec. 1.912  Collection by offset.

    (a) Authority and scope. In accordance with the procedures set forth 
in 31 CFR 901.3, as well as 31 CFR part 285, VA shall collect debts by 
administrative offset from payments made by VA to a debtor indebted to 
VA. Also in accordance with 31 CFR 901.3(b), as well as 31 CFR part 285, 
VA shall refer past due, legally enforceable non-tax debts which are 
over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for collection by centralized 
administrative offset (further procedures are set forth in paragraph (g) 
of this section). This section does not pertain to offset from either VA 
benefit payments made under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 5314 or from 
current salary, but does apply to offset from all other VA payments, 
including an employee's final salary check and lump-sum leave payment. 
Procedures for offset from benefit payments are found in Sec. 1.912a. 
Procedures for offset from current Federal salary are found in 
Sec. Sec. 1.980 through 1.995. NOTE: VA cannot offset, or refer for the 
purpose of offset, either under the authority of this section or under 
any other authority found in Sec. Sec. 1.900 through 1.953 and 
Sec. Sec. 1.980 through 1.995, any VA home loan program debt described 
in 38 U.S.C. 3726 unless the requirements set forth in that section have 
been met.
    (b) Notification. Prior to initiation of administrative offset, if 
not provided in the initial notice of indebtedness, VA is required to 
provide the debtor with written notice of:
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (2) VA's intention to pursue collection by offset procedures from 
the specified VA payment, the date of commencement of offset, and the 
exact amount to be offset;
    (3) The opportunity to inspect and copy VA records pertaining to the 
debt;
    (4) The right to contest either the existence or amount of the debt 
or the proposed offset schedule, or if applicable, to request a waiver 
of collection of the debt, or to request a hearing on any of these 
matters;
    (5) That commencement of offset will begin, unless the debtor makes 
a written request for the administrative relief discussed in paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section within 30 days of the date of this notice; and
    (6) The oppportunity to enter into a written agreement with VA to 
repay the debt in lieu of offset.
    (c) Deferral of offset. (1) If the debtor, within 30 days of the 
date of the notification required by paragraph (b) of this section, 
disputes in writing the existence or amount of the debt or the amount of 
the scheduled offset, offset shall not commence until the dispute is 
reviewed and a decision is rendered by VA adverse to the debtor.
    (2) If the debtor, within 30 days of the date of the required 
notification by VA, requests in writing the waiver of collection of the 
debt in accordance with Sec. 1.963, Sec. 1.963a, or Sec. 1.964, 
offset shall not commence until VA has made an initial decision to deny 
the waiver request.
    (3) If the debtor, within 30 days of the required notification by 
VA, requests in writing a hearing on the issues found in paragraphs 
(c)(1) and (2) of this section, offset shall not commence until a 
decision is rendered by VA on the issue which is the basis of the 
hearing.
    (d) Exceptions. (1) Offset may commence prior to either resolution 
of a dispute or decision on a waiver request as discussed in paragraph 
(c) of this section, if collection of the debt would be jeopardized by 
deferral of offset (for example, if VA first learns of the debt when 
there is insufficient time before a final payment would be made to the 
debtor to allow for prior notice and opportunity for review or waiver 
consideration). In such a case, notification pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section shall be made at the time offset begins or as soon 
thereafter as possible. VA shall promptly refund any money

[[Page 94]]

that has been collected that is ultimately found not to have been owed 
to the Government.
    (2) If the United States has obtained a judgment against the debtor, 
offset may commence without the notification required by paragraph (b) 
of this section. However, a waiver request filed in accordance with the 
time limits and other requirements of Sec. 1.963, Sec. 1.963a, or 
Sec. 1.964 will be considered, even if filed after a judgment has been 
obtained against the debtor. If waiver is granted, in whole or in part, 
refund of amounts already collected will be made in accordance with 
Sec. 1.967.
    (3) The procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section may be 
omitted when the debt arises under a contract that provides for notice 
and other procedural protections.
    (4) Offset may commence without the notification required by 
paragraph (b) of this section when the offset is in the nature of a 
recoupment. As defined in 31 CFR 900.2(d), recoupment is a special 
method for adjusting debts arising under the same transaction or 
occurrence.
    (e) Hearing. (1) After a debtor requests a hearing, VA shall notify 
the debtor of the form of the hearing to be provided; i.e., whether the 
hearing will either be oral or paper. If an oral hearing is determined 
to be proper by the hearing official, the notice shall set forth the 
date, time, and location of the hearing. If the hearing is to be a paper 
review, the debtor shall be notified that he or she should submit his or 
her position and arguments in writing to the hearing official by a 
specified date, after which the record shall be closed. This date shall 
give the debtor reasonable time to submit this information.
    (2) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this 
paragraph is not required to be a formal evidentiary type of hearing.
    (3) A debtor who requests a hearing shall be provided an oral 
hearing if VA determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of 
documentary evidence. Whenever an issue of credibility or veracity is 
involved, an oral hearing will always be provided the debtor. For 
example, the credibility or veracity of a debtor is always an issue 
whenever the debtor requests a waiver of collection of the debt. Thus, a 
hearing held in conjunction with a waiver request will always be an oral 
hearing. If a determination is made to provide an oral hearing, the 
hearing official may offer the debtor the opportunity for a hearing by 
telephone conference call. If this offer is rejected or if the hearing 
official declines to offer a telephone conference call, the debtor shall 
be provided an oral hearing permitting the personal appearance of the 
debtor, his or her personal representative, and witnesses. Witnesses 
shall testify under oath or affirmation.
    (4) In all other cases where a debtor requests a hearing, a paper 
hearing shall be provided. The debtor shall be provided an opportunity 
to submit material for the record. A paper hearing shall consist of a 
review of the written evidence of record by the designated hearing 
official.
    (f) Statutes of limitation; multiple debts. When collecting multiple 
debts by administrative offset, VA shall apply the recovered amounts to 
those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, 
as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, 
paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitation. In 
accordance with 31 CFR 901.3(a)(4), VA may not initiate offset to 
collect a debt more than 10 years after VA's right to collect the debt 
first accrued (with certain exceptions as specified in 31 CFR 
901.3(a)(4)).
    (g) Centralized administrative offset. (1) When VA refers delinquent 
debts to Treasury for centralized administrative offset in accordance 
with 31 CFR part 285, VA must certify that:
    (i) The debts are past due and legally enforceable; and
    (ii) VA has complied with all due process requirements under 31 
U.S.C. 3716(a) and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (2) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt 
from centralized administrative offset.
    (h) Computer Matching and Privacy Act waiver. In accordance with 31 
U.S.C. 3716(f), the Secretary of the Treasury may waive the provisions 
of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection

[[Page 95]]

Act of 1988 concerning matching agreements and post-match notification 
and verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized 
administrative offset upon receipt of a certification from a creditor 
agency that the due process requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) 
and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section have been met. The 
certification of a debt in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section 
will satisfy this requirement. If such a waiver is granted, only the 
Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury is required to 
oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(g).
    (i) Requests by creditor agencies for offset. Unless the offset 
would not be in VA's best interest, or would otherwise be contrary to 
law, VA will comply with requests by creditor agencies to offset VA 
payments (except for current salary or benefit payments) made to a 
person indebted to the creditor agency. However, before VA may initiate 
offset, the creditor agency must certify in writing to VA that the 
debtor has been provided:
    (1) Written notice of the type and amount of the debt and the intent 
of the creditor agency to use administrative offset to collect the debt;
    (2) The opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to 
the debt;
    (3) The opportunity for review within the agency of the 
determination of the indebtedness; and
    (4) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.

Sec. 1.912a  Collection by offset--from VA benefit payments.

    (a) Authority and scope. VA shall collect debts governed by Sec. 
1.911 of this part by offset against any current or future VA benefit 
payments to the debtor. Unless paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section 
apply, offset shall commence promptly after notification to the debtor 
as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Certain military service 
debts shall be collected by offset against current or future 
compensation or pension benefit payments to the debtor under authority 
of 38 U.S.C. 5301(c), as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Notification. Unless paragraph (d) of this section applies, 
offset shall not commence until the debtor has been notified in writing 
of the matters described in Sec. 1.911(c) and (d) and paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (c) Deferral of offset. (1) If the debtor, within thirty days of the 
date of the notification required by paragraph (b) of this section, 
disputes, in writing, the existence or amount of the debt in accordance 
with Sec. 1.911(c)(1), offset shall not commence until the dispute is 
reviewed as provided in Sec. 1.911(c)(1) and unless the resolution is 
adverse to the debtor.
    (2) If the debtor, within thirty days of the date of notification 
required by paragraph (b) of this section, requests, in writing, waiver 
of collection in accordance with Sec. 1.963 or Sec. 1.964, as 
applicable, offset shall not commence until the Department of Veterans 
Affairs has made an initial decision on waiver.
    (3) If the debtor, within thirty days of the notification required 
by paragraph (b) of this section, requests, in writing, a hearing on the 
waiver request, no decision shall be made on the waiver request until 
after the hearing has been held.
    (4) VA will pursue collection action once an adverse initial 
decision is reached on the debtor's request for waiver and/or the 
debtor's informal dispute (as described in Sec. 1.911(c)(1)) concerning 
the existence or amount of the debt, even if the debtor subsequently 
pursues appellate relief in accordance with parts 19 and 20 of this 
title.
    (d) Exceptions. Offset may commence prior to the resolution of a 
dispute or a decision on a waiver request if collection of the debt 
would be jeopardized by deferral of offset. In such case, notification 
pursuant to Sec. 1.911(d) shall be made at the time offset begins or as 
soon thereafter as possible.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5314, Ch. 37)

    (e) Offset of military service debts. (1) In accordance with 38 
U.S.C. 5301(c), VA shall collect by offset from any current or future 
compensation or pension benefits payable to a veteran under

[[Page 96]]

laws administered by VA, the uncollected portion of the amount of any 
indebtedness associated with the veteran's participation in a plan 
prescribed in subchapter I or II of 10 U.S.C. chapter 73.
    (2) Offsets of a veteran's compensation or pension benefit payments 
to recoup indebtedness to the military services as described in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall only be made by VA when the 
military service owed the debt has:
    (i) Determined the amount of the indebtedness of the veteran;
    (ii) Certified to VA that due process in accordance with the 
procedures prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3716 have been provided to the 
veteran; and
    (iii) Requested collection of the total debt amount due.
    (3) Offset from any compensation or pension benefits under the 
authority of 38 U.S.C. 5301(c) shall not exceed 15% of the net monthly 
compensation or pension benefit payment. The net monthly compensation or 
pension benefit payment is defined as the authorized monthly 
compensation or pension benefit payment less all current deductions.

<R05>
Sec. 1.913  Liquidation of collateral.

    (a) VA should liquidate security or collateral through the exercise 
of a power of sale in the security instrument or a nonjudicial 
foreclosure, and apply the proceeds to the applicable debt, if the 
debtor fails to pay the debt within 180 days after demand and if such 
action is in the best interest of the United States. Collection from 
other sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a 
prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety, insurer, or guarantor, 
unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.
    (b) When VA learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with 
respect to a debtor, VA should seek legal advice from VA's General 
Counsel or Regional Counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy 
Code, including, but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. 362, to determine the 
applicability of the automatic stay and the procedures for obtaining 
relief from such stay prior to proceeding under paragraph (a) of this 
section.

Sec. 1.914  Collection in installments.

    (a) Whenever feasible, VA shall collect the total amount of a debt 
in one lump sum. If a debtor is financially unable to pay a debt in one 
lump sum, VA may accept payment in regular installments. VA should 
obtain financial statements from debtors who represent that they are 
unable to pay in one lump sum and independently verify such 
representations whenever possible. If VA agrees to accept payments in 
regular installments, VA should obtain a legally enforceable written 
agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the 
arrangement and contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event 
of default.
    (b) The size and frequency of installment payments should bear a 
reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to 
pay. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size 
and frequency to liquidate the debt in 3 years or less.
    (c) Security for deferred payments should be obtained in appropriate 
cases. However, VA may accept installment payments if the debtor refuses 
to execute a written agreement or to give security.

Sec. 1.915  Interest, administrative costs, and penalties.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided by statute, contract, or other 
regulation to the contrary, and subject to 38 U.S.C. 3485(e) and 5302, 
VA shall assess:
    (1) Interest on all indebtedness to the United States arising out of 
participation in a VA benefit, medical care, or home loan program under 
authority of Title 38, U.S. Code.
    (2) Interest and administrative costs of collection on such debts 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section where repayment has become 
delinquent (as defined in 31 CFR 900.2(b)), and

[[Page 97]]

    (3) Interest, administrative costs, and penalties in accordance with 
31 CFR 901.9 on all debts other than those described in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section.
    (b) Every party entering into an agreement with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs for repayment of indebtedness in installments shall be 
advised of the interest charges to be added to the debt. All debtors 
being provided notice of indebtedness, including those entering into 
repayment agreements, shall be advised that upon the debt becoming 
delinquent, or in the case of repayment of already delinquent debts, 
interest and the administrative costs of collection will be added to the 
principal amount of the debt.
    (c) The rate of interest charged by VA shall be based on the rate 
established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with 
31 U.S.C. 3717 and shall be adjusted annually by VA on the first day of 
the calendar year. Once the rate of interest has been determined for a 
particular debt, the rate shall remain in effect throughout the duration 
of repayment of that debt. When a debtor defaults on a repayment 
agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, VA may require 
payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the current value of 
funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is executed. 
Interest shall not be compounded, that is, interest shall not be charged 
on accrued interest and administrative costs required by this section. 
If, however, a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, 
interest and administrative costs that accrued but were not collected 
under the defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal under the 
new agreement.
    (d) Interest on amounts covered by this section shall accrue from 
the date the initial notice of the debt is mailed to the debtor. 
Notification shall be considered sufficient when effected by ordinary 
mail, addressed to the last known address, and such notice is not 
returned as undeliverable by postal authorities.
    (e) Interest under this section shall not be charged if the debt is 
paid in full within 30 days of mailing of the initial notice described 
in paragraph (b) of this section. Once interest begins to accrue, and 
after expiration of the time period for payment of the debt in full to 
avoid assessment of interest and administrative costs, any amount 
received toward the payment of such debt shall be first applied to 
payment of outstanding administrative cost charges and then to accrued 
interest or costs, and then to principal, unless a different rule is 
prescribed by statute, contract, or other regulation.
    (f) All or any part of the interest and administrative costs 
assessed under this section are subject to consideration for waiver 
under section 5302 of title 38 U.S.C., and appropriate administrative 
procedures.
    (1) In general, interest and administrative costs may be waived only 
when the principal of the debt on which they are assessed is waived by a 
Committee on Waivers and Compromises. However, VA may forbear collection 
of interest and administrative costs, exclusive of collection of the 
principal of the debt on which they are assessed, as well as terminate 
further assessment of interest and administrative costs when the 
collection of such interest and costs are determined to be not in the 
government's best interest. Collection of interest and administrative 
costs shall not be considered to be in the best interest of the 
government when the amount of assessed interest and administrative cost 
is so large that there is a reasonable certainty that the original debt 
will never be repaid. The determination to forbear collection of 
interest and administrative cost, exclusive of collection of the 
principal of the debt, shall be made by the Chief of the Fiscal activity 
at the station responsible for the collection of the debt. Such a 
determination is not within the jurisdiction of a Committee on Waivers 
and Compromises.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (g) Administrative costs assessed under this section shall be the 
average costs of collection of similar debts, or actual collection costs 
as may be accurately determined in the particular case. No 
administrative costs of collection will be assessed under this section 
in any cases where the indebtedness is paid in full prior to the 30-day 
period specified in paragraph (e) of this section, or in any case where 
a repayment

[[Page 98]]

plan is proposed by the debtor and accepted by VA within that 30-day 
period, unless such repayment agreement becomes delinquent (as defined 
in 31 CFR 900.2(b)).

Sec. 1.916  Disclosure of debt information to consumer reporting agencies (CRA).

    (a) The Department of Veterans Affairs may disclose all information 
determined to be necessary, including the name, address, Department of 
Veterans Affairs file number, Social Security number, and date of birth, 
to consumer reporting agencies for the purpose of--
    (1) Obtaining the location of an individual indebted to the United 
States as a result of participation in any benefits program administered 
by VA or indebted in any other manner to VA;
    (2) Obtaining a consumer report in order to assess an individuals 
ability to repay a debt when such individual has failed to respond to 
the Department's demand for repayment or when such individual has 
notified the Department that he/she will not repay the indebtedness; or
    (3) Obtaining the location of an individual in order to conduct 
program evaluation studies as required by 38 U.S.C. 527 or any other 
law.
    (b) Information disclosed by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
under paragraph (a) of this section to consumer reporting agencies shall 
neither expressly nor implicitly indicate that an individual is indebted 
to the United States nor shall such information be recorded by consumer 
reporting agencies in a manner that reflects adversely upon the 
individual. Prior to disclosing this information, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs shall ascertain that consumer reporting agencies with 
which it contracts are able to comply with this requirement. The 
Department of Veterans Affairs shall also make reasonable efforts to 
insure compliance by its contractor with this requirement.
    (c) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section, information concerning individuals may be disclosed to consumer 
reporting agencies for inclusion in consumer reports pertaining to the 
individual, or for the purpose of locating the individual. Disclosure of 
the fact of indebtedness will be made if the individual fails to respond 
in accordance with written demands for repayment, or refuses to repay a 
debt to the United States. In making any disclosure under this section, 
VA will provide consumer reporting agencies with sufficient information 
to identify the individual, including the individual's name, address, if 
known, date of birth, VA file number, and Social Security number.
    (d)(1) Prior to releasing information under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Department of Veterans Affairs will send a notice to the 
individual. This notice will inform the individual that--
    (i) The Department of Veterans Affairs has determined that he or she 
is indebted to the Department of Veterans Affairs;
    (ii) The debt is presently delinquent; and
    (iii) The fact of delinquency may be reported to consumer reporting 
agencies after 30 days have elapsed from the date of the notice.
    (2)(i) In accordance with Sec. 1.911 and Sec. 1.911a, VA shall 
notify each individual of the right to dispute the existence and amount 
of the debt and to request a waiver of the debt, if applicable.
    (ii) If the Department of Veterans Affairs has not previously 
notified the individual of the rights described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) 
of this section, the Department of Veterans Affairs will include this 
information in the notice described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. 
The individual shall be afforded a minimum of 30 days from the date of 
the notice to respond to it before information is reported to consumer 
reporting agencies.
    (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs will defer reporting 
information to a consumer reporting agency if the individual disputes 
the existence or amount of any debt or requests waiver of the debt 
within the time limits set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this 
section. The Department of Veterans Affairs will review any dispute and 
notify the individual of its findings. If the

[[Page 99]]

original decision is determined to be correct, or if the individual's 
request for waiver is denied, the Department of Veterans Affairs may 
report the fact of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency. However, 
the individual shall be afforded 30 days from date of the notice of the 
agency's determination to repay the debt.
    (4) Nothing in this section affects an individual's right to appeal 
an agency decision to the Board of Veterans Appeals. However, 
information concerning the debt may be disclosed while an appeal is 
pending before the Board of Veterans Appeals.
    (5) Upon request, the Department of Veterans Affairs will notify an 
individual--
    (i) Whether information concerning a debt has been reported to 
consumer reporting agencies;
    (ii) Of the name and address of each consumer reporting agency to 
which information has been released; and
    (iii) Of the specific information released.

A notice of the right to request this information will be sent with the 
notice described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) Subsequent to disclosure of information to consumer reporting 
agencies as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Department 
of Veterans Affairs shall:
    (1) Notify on a monthly basis each consumer reporting agency 
concerned of any substantial change in the status or amount of 
indebtedness.
    (2) Promptly verify any and all information disclosed if so 
requested by the consumer reporting agency concerned.
    (f) In the absence of a different rule prescribed by statute, 
contract, or other regulation, an indebtedness is considered delinquent 
if not paid by the individual by the date due specified in the notice of 
indebtedness, unless satisfactory arrangements are made by such date.
    (g) Notification shall be considered sufficient when effected by 
ordinary mail, addressed to the last known address, and such notice is 
not returned as undeliverable by postal authorities.
    (h) The Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) does not apply to any contract 
between the Department of Veterans Affairs and a consumer reporting 
agency, nor does it apply to a consumer reporting agency and its 
employees. See 38 U.S.C. 5701(i). This paragraph does not relieve the 
Department of Veterans Affairs of its obligation to comply with the 
Privacy Act.
    (i) The term ``consumer reporting agency'' means any person or 
agency which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit 
basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of 
assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other 
information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports 
to third parties or to other consumer reporting agencies. The term 
``consumer reporting agency'' shall also mean any person or agency which 
serves as a marketing agent under arrangements enabling third parties to 
obtain such information from consumer reporting agencies, or which 
obtain such information for the purpose of furnishing it to consumer 
reporting agencies.

Sec. 1.917  Contracting for collection services.

    (a) VA has authority to contract for collection services to recover 
delinquent debts, provided that:
    (1) The authority to resolve disputes, compromise claims, suspend or 
terminate collection and refer the matter for litigation shall be 
retained by VA;
    (2) The contractor shall be subject to 38 U.S.C. 5701, and to the 
Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 
552a(m), and to applicable Federal and State laws and regulations 
pertaining to debt collection practices, such as the Fair Debt 
Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq.
    (3) The contractor shall be required to strictly account for all 
amounts collected;
    (4) Upon returning an account to VA for subsequent referral to the 
Department of Justice for litigation, the contractor must agree to 
provide any data contained in its files relating to Sec. 1.951.
    (b) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), or as otherwise permitted 
by

[[Page 100]]

law, collection service contracts may be funded in the following manner:
    (1) VA may fund a collection service contract on a fixed-fee basis 
(i.e., payment of a fixed fee determined without regard to the amount 
actually collected under the contract). Payment of the fee under this 
type of contract must be charged to available appropriations;
    (2) VA may also fund a collection service contract on a contingent-
fee basis (i.e., by including a provision in the contract permitting the 
contractor to deduct its fee from amounts collected under the contract). 
The fee should be based upon a percentage of the amount collected, 
consistent with prevailing commercial practice;
    (3) VA may enter into a contract under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section only if and to the extent that funding for the contract is 
provided for in advance by an appropriation act or other legislation, 
except that this requirement does not apply to the use of a revolving 
fund authorized by statute;
    (4) Except as authorized under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(5) of this 
section, or unless otherwise specifically provided by law, VA shall 
deposit all amounts recovered under collection service contracts for 
Loan Guaranty debts into the Loan Guaranty Revolving Fund, and for all 
other debts in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. 3302.
    (5) For benefit overpayments recovered under collection service 
contract, VA, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3302, shall deposit:
    (i) Amounts equal to the original overpayments in the appropriations 
account from which the overpayments were made, and
    (ii) Amount of interest or administrative costs in the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts.
    (c) VA shall use government-wide debt collection contracts to obtain 
debt collection services provided by private collection contractors. 
However, VA may refer debts to private collection contractors pursuant 
to a contract between VA and a private collection contractor only if 
such debts are not subject to the requirement to transfer debts to 
Treasury for debt collection. See 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), 31 CFR 285.12(e), 
and 38 CFR 1.910.
    (d) VA may enter into contracts for locating and recovering assets 
of the United States, such as unclaimed assets.
    (e) VA may enter into contracts for debtor asset and income search 
reports. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), such contracts may 
provide that the fee a contractor charges the agency for such services 
may be payable from the amounts recovered, unless otherwise prohibited 
by statute.

Sec. 1.918  Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

    (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to compromise or 
collect a debt in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.900 through 1.953, VA may 
send a request to the Secretary of the Treasury, or his/her designee, in 
order to obtain the debtor's most current mailing address from the 
records of the Internal Revenue Service.
    (b) VA is authorized to use mailing addresses obtained under 
paragraph (a) of this section to enforce collection of a delinquent debt 
and may disclose such mailing addresses to other agencies and to 
collection agencies for collection purposes.

Sec. 1.919  Administrative offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), final 
          salary check, and lump sum leave payments.

    (a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law or regulation, and in 
accordance with 31 CFR 901.3(d), VA may request that money which is due 
and payable to a debtor from either the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund or FERS be administratively offset in reasonable amounts 
in order to collect, in one full payment or a minimal number of 
payments, debts that are owed to VA by the debtor. Such requests shall 
be made to the appropriate officials at

[[Page 101]]

the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in accordance with such 
regulations prescribed by the Director of OPM. (See 5 CFR 831.1801 
through 831.1808). In addition, VA may also offset against a Federal 
employee's final salary check and lump sum leave payment. See Sec. 
1.912 for procedures for offset against a final salary check and lump 
sum leave payment.
    (b) When making a request to the Office of Personnel Management for 
administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, VA shall 
include a written certification that:
    (1) The debtor owes VA a debt, including the amount of the debt;
    (2) VA has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and 
procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and
    (3) VA has complied with Sec. Sec. 1.911, 1.911a, 1.912, 1.912a, 
and 31 CFR 901.3, to the extent applicable, including any required 
hearing or review.
    (c) Once VA decides to request administrative offset from the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund or Federal Employees Retirement 
System (FERS) under paragraph (a) of this section, it shall make the 
request as soon as possible after completion of the applicable 
procedures in order that the Office of Personnel Management may identify 
the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor 
requests or becomes eligible to receive payments from the Fund or FERS. 
This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to 
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations. At such time as 
the debtor makes a claim for payments from the Fund or FERS, if at least 
a year has elapsed since the offset request was originally made, the 
debtor should be permitted to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in 
lieu of offset upon establishing that such offset will create financial 
hardship.
    (d) If VA collects all or part of the debt by other means before 
deductions are made or completed in accordance with paragraph (a) of 
this section, VA shall promptly act to modify or terminate its request 
for offset under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) The Office of Personnel Management is neither required nor 
authorized by this section to review the merits of VA's determination 
with respect to the amount and validity of the debt waiver under 5 
U.S.C. 5584 or 38 U.S.C. 5302, or providing or not providing an oral 
hearing.

Sec. 1.920  Referral of VA debts.

    (a) When authorized, VA may refer an uncollectible debt to another 
Federal or State agency for the purpose of collection action. Collection 
action may include the offsetting of the debt from any current or future 
payment, except salary (see paragraph (e) of this section), made by such 
Federal or State agency to the person indebted to VA.
    (b) VA must certify in writing that the individual owes the debt, 
the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment became due, 
and the date VA's right to collect the debt first accrued.
    (c) This certification will also state that VA provided the debtor 
with written notice of:
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (2) VA's intention to pursue collection by offset procedures;
    (3) The opportunity to inspect and copy VA records pertaining to the 
debt;
    (4) The right to contest both the existence and amount of the debt 
and to request a waiver of collection of the debt (if applicable), as 
well as the right to a hearing on both matters;
    (5) The opportunity to enter into a written agreement with VA for 
the repayment of the debt; and
    (6) Other applicable notices required by Sec. Sec. 1.911, 1.911a, 
1.912, and 1.912a.
    (d) The written certification required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section will also contain (for all debts) a listing of all actions 
taken by both VA and the debtor subsequent to the notice, as well as the 
dates of such actions.
    (e) The referral by VA of a VA debt to another agency for the 
purpose of salary offset shall be done in accordance with 38 CFR 1.980 
through 1.995

Sec. 1.921  Analysis of costs.

    VA collection procedures should provide for periodic comparison of 
costs incurred and amounts collected. Data on costs and corresponding 
recovery rates for debts of different types and in various dollar ranges 
should be used to compare the cost effectiveness of alternative 
collection techniques, establish guidelines with respect to points at 
which costs of further collection efforts are likely to exceed 
recoveries, assist in evaluating offers in compromise, and establish 
minimum debt amounts below which collection efforts need not be taken.

    (a) Sections 1.900 through 1.953, to the extent they reflect 
remedies or procedures prescribed by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and 
the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, such as administrative 
offset, use of credit bureaus, contracting for collection agencies, and 
interest and related charges, do not apply to debts arising under, or 
payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 
U.S.C. 1 et seq.); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), 
except to the extent provided under 42 U.S.C. 404 and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c); 
or the tariff laws of the United States. These remedies and procedures, 
however, may be authorized with respect to debts that are exempt from 
the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the DCIA of 1996, to the extent that 
they are authorized under some other statute or the common law.
    (b) This section should not be construed as prohibiting the use of 
Sec. Sec. 1.900 through 1.953 when collecting debts owed by persons 
employed by agencies administering the laws cited in paragraph (a) of 
this section unless the debt arose under those laws.

Sec. 1.923  Administrative wage garnishment.

    (a) In accordance with the procedures set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3720D 
and 31 CFR 285.11, VA or Treasury may request that a non-Federal 
employer garnish the disposable pay of an individual to collect 
delinquent non-tax debt owed to VA. VA may pursue wage garnishment 
independently in accordance with this section or VA or Treasury may 
pursue garnishment after VA refers a debt to Treasury in accordance with 
Sec. 1.910 of this part and 31 CFR 285.12. For the purposes of this 
section, any reference to Treasury also includes any private collection 
agency under contract to Treasury.
    (b) At least 30 days prior to the initiation of garnishment 
proceedings, VA or Treasury shall send a written notice, as described in 
31 CFR 285.11(e), by first class mail to the debtor's last known 
address. This notice shall inform the debtor of:
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (2) The intention of VA or Treasury to initiate proceedings to 
collect the debt through deductions from the debtor's pay until the debt 
and all accumulated interest, and other late payment charges, are paid 
in full, and;
    (3) An explanation of the debtor's rights, including the 
opportunity:
    (i) To inspect and copy VA records pertaining to the debt;
    (ii) To enter into a written repayment agreement with VA or Treasury 
under terms agreeable to VA or Treasury, and;
    (iii) To a hearing in accordance with 31 CFR 285.11(f) and paragraph 
(c) of this section concerning the existence or amount of the debt or 
the terms of the proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment 
order. However, the debtor is not entitled to a hearing concerning the 
terms of the proposed repayment schedule if these terms have been 
established by written agreement under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section.

[[Page 103]]

    (c) Any hearing conducted as part of the administrative wage 
garnishment process shall be conducted by the designated hearing 
official in accordance with the procedures set forth in 31 CFR 
285.11(f). This hearing official may be any VA hearing official. This 
hearing official may also conduct administrative wage garnishment 
hearings for other Federal agencies.
    (1) The hearing may be oral or written as determined by the 
designated hearing official. The hearing official shall provide the 
debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the 
hearing official determines that the issue in dispute cannot be resolved 
by review of documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the 
claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity. The hearing 
official shall establish the time and place of any oral hearing. At the 
debtor's option, an oral hearing may be conducted either in person or by 
telephone conference call. A hearing is not required to be a formal, 
evidentiary-type hearing, but witnesses who testify in oral hearings 
must do so under oath or affirmation. While it is not necessary to 
produce a transcript of the hearing, the hearing official must maintain 
a summary record of the proceedings. All travel expenses incurred by the 
debtor in connection with an in-person hearing shall be borne by the 
debtor. VA or Treasury shall be responsible for all telephone expenses. 
In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor who fails to appear at a 
hearing will be deemed as not having timely filed a request for a 
hearing.
    (2) If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not 
necessary, then he/she shall afford the debtor a ``paper hearing.'' In a 
``paper hearing,'' the hearing official will decide the issues in 
dispute based upon a review of the written record.
    (3) If the debtor's written request for a hearing is received by 
either VA or Treasury within 15 business days following the mailing of 
the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section, then VA or 
Treasury shall not issue a withholding order as described in paragraph 
(d) of this section until the debtor is afforded the requested hearing 
and a decision rendered. If the debtor's written request for a hearing 
is not received within 15 business days following the mailing of the 
notice described in paragraph (b) of this section, then the hearing 
official shall provide a hearing to the debtor, but will not delay 
issuance of a withholding order as described in paragraph (d) of this 
section, unless the hearing official determines that the delay in filing 
was caused by factors beyond the debtor's control.
    (4) The hearing official shall notify the debtor of:
    (i) The date and time of a telephone conference hearing;
    (ii) The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing, or;
    (iii) The deadline for the submission of evidence for a written 
hearing.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)of this section, VA or 
Treasury shall have the burden of going forward to prove the existence 
or amount of the debt, after which the debtor must show, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that no debt exists or that the amount of 
the debt is incorrect. In general, this means that the debtor must show 
that it is more likely than not that a debt does not exist or that the 
amount of the debt is incorrect. The debtor may also present evidence 
that terms of the repayment agreement are unlawful, would cause a 
financial hardship, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued 
due to operation of law.
    (6) If the debtor has previously contested the existence and/or 
amount of the debt in accordance with Sec. 1.911(c)(1) or Sec. 
1.911a(c)(1) and VA subsequently rendered a decision upholding the 
existence or amount of the debt, then such decision shall be 
incorporated by reference and become the basis of the hearing official's 
decision on such matters.
    (7) The hearing official shall issue a written decision as soon as 
practicable, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the 
request for such hearing was received by VA or Treasury. The decision 
will be the final action for the purposes of judicial review under the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.). The decision shall 
include:
    (i) A summary of the facts presented;

[[Page 104]]

    (ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions, 
and;
    (iii) The terms of the repayment schedule, if applicable.
    (d) In accordance with 31 CFR 285.11(g) and (h), VA or Treasury 
shall send a Treasury-approved withholding order and certification form 
by first class mail to the debtor's employer within 30 days after the 
debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing. If a timely request 
for a hearing has been filed by the debtor, then VA or Treasury shall 
send a withholding order and certification form by first class mail to 
the debtor's employer within 30 days after a final decision is made to 
proceed with the garnishment. The employer shall complete and return the 
certification form as described in 31 CFR 285.11(h).
    (e) After receipt of the garnishment order, the employer shall 
withhold the amount of garnishment as described in 31 CFR 285.11(i) from 
all disposable pay payable to the applicable debtor during each pay 
period.
    (f) A debtor whose wages are subject to a wage withholding order 
under 31 CFR 285.11 may request a review, under the procedures set forth 
in 31 CFR 285.11(k), of the amount garnished. A request for review shall 
only be considered after garnishment has been initiated. The request 
must be based on materially changed circumstances such as disability, 
divorce, or catastrophic illness which result in financial hardship that 
limit the debtor's ability to provide food, housing, clothing, 
transportation, and medical care for himself/herself and his/her 
dependents.

status if the debt has not been paid within 90 days of the payment due 
date or by the end of any grace period provided by statute, regulation, 
contract, or agreement. The payment due date is the date specified in 
the initial written demand for payment. Further guidance concerning the

Officer may waive the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section only 
on a person-by-person basis.
    (2) The Chief Financial Officer or Deputy Chief Financial Officer 
should balance the following factors when deciding whether to grant a 
waiver:
    (i) Whether the denial of the financial assistance to the person 
would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the 
financial assistance program or otherwise would not be in the best 
interests of the Federal government; and
    (ii) Whether the granting of the financial assistance to the person 
is contrary to the government's goal of reducing losses by requiring 
proper screening of potential borrowers.
    (3) When balancing the factors described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) and 
(e)(2)(ii) of this section, the Chief Financial Officer or Deputy Chief 
Financial Officer should consider:
    (i) The age, amount, and cause(s) of the delinquency and the 
likelihood that the person will resolve the delinquent debt; and
    (ii) The amount of the total debt, delinquent or otherwise, owed by 
the person and the person's credit history with respect to repayment of 
debt.

[[Page 105]]

    (4) A centralized record shall be retained of the number and type of 
waivers granted under this section.
    (f) In non-bankruptcy cases, in seeking the collection of statutory 
penalties, forfeitures, or other similar types of claims, VA may suspend 
or revoke any license, permit, or other privilege granted a debtor when 
the debtor inexcusably or willfully fails to pay such a debt. The debtor 
should be advised in VA's written demand for payment of VA's ability to 
suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges. VA may suspend or 
disqualify any lender, contractor, or broker who is engaged in making, 
guaranteeing, insuring, acquiring, or participating in loans from doing 
further business with VA or engaging in programs sponsored by VA if such 
lender, contractor, or broker fails to pay its debts to the Government 
within a reasonable time, or if such lender, contractor, or broker has 
been suspended, debarred, or disqualified from participation in a 
program or activity by another Federal agency. The failure of any surety 
to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 should be 
reported to Treasury.
    (g) In bankruptcy cases, before advising the debtor of the intention 
to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges, VA should seek 
legal advice from VA's General Counsel or Regional Counsel concerning 
the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362 and 525, 
which may restrict such action.

Sec. 1.929  Reduction of debt through performance of work-study services.

    (a) Scope. (1) Subject to the provisions of this section VA may 
allow an individual to reduce an indebtedness to the United States 
through offset of benefits to which the individual becomes entitled by 
performance of work-study services under 38 U.S.C. 3485 and 3537 when 
the debt arose by virtue of the individual's participation in a benefits 
program provided under any of the following:
    (i) 38 U.S.C. chapter 30;
    (ii) 38 U.S.C. chapter 31;
    (iii) 38 U.S.C. chapter 32;
    (iv) 38 U.S.C. chapter 34;
    (v) 38 U.S.C. chapter 35;
    (vi) 38 U.S.C. chapter 36 (other than an education loan provided 
under subpart F, part 21 of this title); or
    (vii) 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 (other than an indebtedness arising 
from a refund penalty imposed under 10 U.S.C. 16135).
    (2) This section shall not apply in any case in which the individual 
has a pending request for waiver of the debt under Sec. Sec. 1.950 
through 1.970.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3485(e)(1); Pub. L. 102-16)

    (b) Selection criteria. (1) If there are more candidates for a work-
study allowance than there are work-study positions available in the 
area in which the services are to be performed, VA will give priority to 
the candidates who are pursuing a program of education or 
rehabilitation.
    (2) Only after all candidates in the area described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section either have been given work-study contracts or 
have withdrawn their request for contracts will VA offer contracts to 
those who are not pursuing a program of education or rehabilitation and 
who wish to reduce their indebtedness through performance of work-study 
services.
    (3) VA shall not offer a contract to an individual who is receiving 
compensation from another source for the work-study services the 
individual wishes to perform.
    (4) VA shall not offer a contract to an individual if VA determines 
that the debt can be collected through other means such as collection in 
a lump sum, collection in installments as provided in Sec. 1.917 or 
compromise as provided in Sec. 1.918.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3485(e); Pub. L. 102-16)

    (c) Utilization. The work-study services to be performed under a 
debt-liquidation contract will be limited as follows:
    (1) If the individual is concurrently receiving educational 
assistance in a program administered by VA, work-study services are 
limited to those allowed in the educational program

[[Page 106]]

under which the individual is receiving benefits.
    (2) If the individual is not concurrently receiving educational 
assistance in a program administered by VA, the individual may perform 
only those work-study services and activities which are or were open to 
those students receiving a work-study allowance while pursuing a program 
of education pursuant to the chapter under which the debt was incurred.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3485(e); Pub. L. 102-16)

    (d) Contract to perform services. (1) The work-study services 
performed to reduce indebtedness shall be performed pursuant to a 
contract between the individual and VA.
    (2) The individual shall perform the work-study services required by 
the contract at the place or places designated by VA.
    (3) The number of hours of services to be performed under the 
contract must be sufficient to enable the individual to become entitled 
to a sum large enough to liquidate the debt by offset.
    (4) The number of weeks in the contract will not exceed the lesser 
of--
    (i) The number of weeks of services the individual needs to perform 
to liquidate his or her debt; or
    (ii) 52.
    (5) In determining the number of hours per week and the number of 
weeks under paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section necessary to 
liquidate the debt, VA will use the amount of the account receivable, 
including all accrued interest, administrative costs and marshall fees 
outstanding on the date the contract is offered to the individual and 
all accrued interest, administrative costs and marshall fees VA 
estimates will have become outstanding on the debt on the date the debt 
is to be liquidated.
    (6) The contract will automatically terminate after the total amount 
of the individual's indebtedness described in paragraph (d)(5) of this 
section has been recouped, waived, or otherwise liquidated. An 
individual performing work-study services under a contract to liquidate 
a debt is released from the contract if the debt is liquidated by other 
means.
    (7) The contract to perform work-study services for the purpose of 
liquidating indebtedness will be terminated if:
    (i) The individual is liquidating his or her debt under this section 
while receiving either an educational assistance allowance for further 
pursuit of a program of education or a subsistence allowance for further 
pursuit of a program of rehabilitation;
    (ii) The individual terminates or reduces the rate of pursuit of his 
or her program of education or rehabilitation; and
    (iii) The termination or reduction causes an account receivable as a 
debt owed by the individual.
    (8) VA may terminate the contract at any time the individual fails 
to perform the services required by the contract in a satisfactory 
manner.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3485(e), 7104(a); Pub. L. 102-16)

    (e) Reduction of indebtedness. (1) In return for the individual's 
agreement to perform hours of services totaling not more than 40 times 
the number of weeks in the contract, VA will reduce the eligible 
person's outstanding indebtedness by an amount equal to the higher of--
    (i) The hourly minimum wage in effect under section 6(a) of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act of 1938 times the number of hours the individual 
works; or
    (ii) The hourly minimum wage under comparable law of the State in 
which the services are performed times the number of hours the 
individual works.
    (2) VA will reduce the individual's debt by the amount of the money 
earned for the performance of work-study services after the completion 
of each 50 hours of services (or in the case of any remaining hours 
required by the contract, the amount for those hours).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3485(e); Pub. L. 102-16)

    (f) Suspension of collections by offset. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of Sec. 1.912a, during the period covered by the work-study 
debt-liquidation contract with the individual, VA will ordinarily 
suspend the collection by offset of a debt described in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section. However, the individual

[[Page 107]]

may voluntarily permit VA to collect part of the debt through offset 
against other benefits payable while the individual is performing work-
study services. If the contract is terminated before its scheduled 
completion date, and the debt has not been liquidated, collection 
through offset against other benefits payable will resume on the date 
the contract terminates.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3485(e); Pub. L. 102-16)

    (g) Payment for additional hours. (1) If an individual, without 
fault on his or her part, performs work-study services for which payment 
may not be authorized, including services performed after termination of 
the contract, VA will pay the individual at the applicable hourly 
minimum wage for such services as the Director of the VA field station 
of jurisdiction determines were satisfactorily performed.
    (2) The Director of the VA field station of jurisdiction shall 
determine whether the individual was without fault. In making this 
decision he or she shall consider all evidence of record and any 
additional evidence which the individual wishes to submit.

                   Standards for Compromise of Claims

    Authority: Sections 1.900 through 1.953 are issued under the 
authority of 31 U.S.C. 3711 through 3720E; 38 U.S.C. 501, and as noted 
in specific sections.

    Source: 32 FR 2614, Feb. 8, 1967, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.930  Scope and application.

    (a) The standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.930 through 1.936 of 
this part apply to the compromise of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. 
VA may exercise such compromise authority when the amount of the debt 
due, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does 
not exceed $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney 
General.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of 
a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, 
exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney 
General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the 
Department of Justice (DOJ). If VA receives an offer to compromise any 
debt in excess of $100,000, VA should evaluate the compromise offer 
using the same factors as set forth in Sec. 1.931 of this part. If VA 
believes the offer has merit, it shall refer the debt to the Civil 
Division or other appropriate division in DOJ using a Claims Collection 
Litigation Report (CCLR). The referral shall include appropriate 
financial information and a recommendation for the acceptance of the 
compromise offer. DOJ approval is not required if VA decides to reject a 
compromise offer.
    (c) The $100,000 limit in paragraph (b) of this section does not 
apply to debts that arise out of participation in a VA loan program 
under Chapter 37 of Title 38 of the U.S. Code. VA has unlimited 
authority to compromise debts arising out of participation in a Chapter 
37 loan program, regardless of the amount of the debt.

(Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3711; 38 U.S.C 501, 3720)

[69 FR 62198, Oct. 25, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 1.931  Bases for compromise.

    (a) VA may compromise a debt if it cannot collect the full amount 
because:
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable 
time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information;
    (2) VA is unable to collect the debt in full within a reasonable 
time by enforced collection proceedings;
    (3) The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced 
collection of the full amount; or
    (4) There is significant doubt concerning VA's ability to prove its 
case in court.
    (b) In determining the debtor's inability to pay, VA will consider 
relevant factors such as the following:
    (1) Age and health of the debtor;
    (2) Present and potential income;
    (3) Inheritance prospects;
    (4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly 
transferred by the debtor; and
    (5) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by 
enforced collection proceedings.

[[Page 108]]

    (c) VA will verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by using a 
credit report and other financial information as provided in paragraph 
(g) of this section. VA should consider the applicable exemptions 
available to the debtor under State and Federal law in determining the 
ability to enforce collection. VA also may consider uncertainty as to 
the price that collateral or other property will bring at a forced sale 
in determining the ability to enforce collection. A compromise effected 
under this section should be for an amount that bears a reasonable 
relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection 
procedures, with regard to the exemptions available to the debtor and 
the time that collection will take.
    (d) If there is significant doubt concerning VA's ability to prove 
its case in court for the full amount claimed, either because of the 
legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute as to the facts, 
then the amount accepted in compromise of such cases should fairly 
reflect the probabilities of successful prosecution to judgment, with 
due regard given to the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary 
support for VA's claim. In determining the risks involved in litigation, 
VA will consider the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees 
pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412, that may be 
imposed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation.
    (e) VA may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the debt does 
not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount 
accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount 
for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, with 
consideration given to the time it will take to effect collection. 
Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small 
debts. In determining whether the cost of collecting justifies enforced 
collection of the full amount, VA will consider whether continued 
collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is necessary to further an 
enforcement principle.
    (f) VA generally will not accept compromises payable in 
installments. If, however, payment of a compromise in installments is 
necessary, VA will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement 
providing that, in the event of default, the full original principal 
balance of the debt prior to compromise, less sums paid thereon, is 
reinstated. Whenever possible, VA will also obtain security for 
repayment.
    (g) To assess the merits of a compromise offer based in whole or in 
part on the debtor's inability to pay the full amount of a debt within a 
reasonable time, VA will obtain a current financial statement from the 
debtor showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. 
Agencies also may obtain credit reports or other financial information 
to assess compromise offers.

Sec. 1.932  Enforcement policy.

    VA may compromise statutory penalties, forfeitures, or claims 
established as an aid to enforcement and to compel compliance, if VA's 
enforcement policy in terms of deterrence and securing compliance, 
present and future, will be adequately served by VA's acceptance of the 
sum to be agreed upon.

Sec. 1.933  Joint and several liability.

    (a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, VA 
will pursue collection activity against all debtors, as appropriate. VA 
will not attempt to allocate the burden of payment between the debtors 
but should proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible.
    (b) VA will ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does 
not release VA's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a 
compromise with one debtor shall not be considered a precedent or 
binding in determining the amount that will be required from other 
debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.

Sec. 1.934  Further review of compromise offers.

    If VA is uncertain whether to accept a firm, written, substantive 
compromise offer on a debt that is within its delegated compromise 
authority, it may refer the offer to VA General Counsel or Regional 
Counsel or to the Civil Division or other appropriate division in the 
Department of Justice (DOJ), using a Claims Collection Litigation Report 
(CCLR) accompanied by supporting data and particulars concerning the 
debt. DOJ may act upon such an offer or return it to the agency with 
instructions or advice.

to the Government. In particular, VA will consider requiring a waiver of 
tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-back rights of the debtor.

    In all appropriate instances, a compromise that is accepted by VA 
shall be implemented by means of a mutual release, in which the debtor 
is released from further non-tax liability on the compromised debt in 
consideration of payment in full of the compromise amount, and VA and 
its officials, past and present, are released and discharged from any 
and all claims and causes of action that the debtor may have arising 
from the same transaction. In the event a mutual release is not executed 
when a debt is compromised, unless prohibited by law, the debtor is 
still deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes of action 
against VA and its officials related to the transaction giving rise to 
the compromised debt.

    Source: 32 FR 2615, Feb. 8, 1967, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.940  Scope and application.

    (a) The standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.940 through 1.944 apply 
to the suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. 3711 on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount 
as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, 
and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments 
or collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to the Department of 
Justice (DOJ) for litigation, VA may suspend or terminate collection 
under this part with respect to the debt.
    (b) If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or 
collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such 
other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or 
terminate rests solely with DOJ. If VA believes that suspension or 
termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, it 
shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate division 
in DOJ, using the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR). The 
referral should specify the reasons for VA's recommendation. If, prior 
to referral to DOJ, VA determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or 
clearly without legal merit, VA may terminate collection activity 
regardless of the amount involved without obtaining DOJ concurrence.

Sec. 1.941  Suspension of collection activity.

    (a) VA may suspend collection activity on a debt when:
    (1) It cannot locate the debtor;
    (2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or

[[Page 110]]

    (3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.
    (b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, VA may 
suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects 
justify retention of the debt for periodic review and collection 
activity and:
    (1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or
    (2) Future collection can be effected by administrative offset, 
notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 
for litigation of claims, and with due regard to the 10-year limitation 
for administrative offset prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or
    (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on 
which collection will be suspended, and such suspension is likely to 
enhance the debtor's ability to pay the full amount of the principal of 
the debt with interest at a later date.
    (c) Collection action may also be suspended, in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 1.911, 1.911a, 1.912, and 1.912a, pending VA action on 
requests for administrative review of the existence or amount of the 
debt or a request for waiver of collection of the debt. However, 
collection action will be resumed once VA issues an initial decision on 
the administrative review or waiver request.
    (d) When VA learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with 
respect to a debtor, in most cases the collection activity on a debt 
must be suspended, pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 362, 1201, 
and 1301, unless VA can clearly establish that the automatic stay does 
not apply, has been lifted, or is no longer in effect. VA shall seek 
legal advice immediately from either the VA General Counsel or Regional 
Counsel and, if legally permitted, take the necessary steps to ensure 
that no funds or money are paid by VA to the debtor until relief from 
the automatic stay is obtained.

Sec. 1.942  Termination of collection activity.

    Termination of collection activity involves a final determination. 
Collection activity may be terminated on cases previously suspended. The 
Department of Veterans Affairs may terminate collection activity and 
consider closing the agency file on a claim which meets any one of the 
following standards:
    (a) Inability to collect any substantial amount. Collection action 
may be terminated on a claim when it becomes clear that VA cannot 
collect or enforce collection of any significant amount from the debtor, 
having due regard for the judicial remedies available to the agency, the 
debtor's future financial prospects, and the exemptions available to the 
debtor under State and Federal law. In determining the debtor's 
inability to pay, the following factors, among others, shall be 
considered: Age and health of the debtor, present and potential income, 
inheritance prospects, the possibility that assets have been concealed 
or improperly transferred by the debtor, the availability of assets or 
income which may be realized by means of enforced collection 
proceedings.
    (b) Inability to locate debtor. The debtor cannot be located, no 
security remains to be liquidated, the applicable statute of limitations 
has run, and the prospects of collecting by offset are too remote.
    (c) Death of debtor. The debtor is determined to be deceased and the 
Government has no prospect of collection from his/her estate.
    (d) Cost will exceed recovery. The cost of further collection effort 
is likely to exceed the amount recoverable.
    (e) Claim legally without merit. Collection action should be 
terminated on a claim whenever it is determined that the claim is 
legally without merit.
    (f) Claim cannot be substantiated by evidence. VA will terminate 
collection action on once asserted claims because of lack of evidence or 
unavailability of witnesses only in cases where efforts to induce 
voluntary payment are unsuccessful.
    (g) Discharge in bankruptcy. Generally, VA shall terminate 
collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy, 
regardless of the amount. VA may continue collection activity, subject 
to the provisions

[[Page 111]]

of the Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a plan of 
reorganization. Offset and recoupment rights may survive the discharge 
of the debtor in bankruptcy and, under some circumstances, claims also 
may survive the discharge.
    (h) Before terminating collection activity, VA should have pursued 
all appropriate means of collection and determined, based upon the 
results of the collection activity, that the debt is uncollectible. 
Termination of collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. 
The termination of collection activity does not preclude VA from 
retaining a record of the account for purposes of:
    (1) Selling the debt, if the Secretary of the Treasury determines 
that such sale is in the best interests of the United States;
    (2) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a 
change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes 
available;
    (3) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the 
time of termination of collection activity; or
    (4) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.

garnishment, litigation, and foreclosure. Discharge of indebtedness is 
distinct from termination or suspension of collection activity under 
Sec. Sec. 1.940 through 1.943 and is governed by the Internal Revenue 
Code (see 26 U.S.C. 6050P). When collection action on a debt is 
suspended or terminated, the debt remains delinquent and further 
collection action may be pursued at a later date in accordance with the 
standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.900 through 1.953. When VA 
discharges a debt in full or in part, further collection action is 
prohibited. Therefore, VA should make the determination that collection 
action is no longer warranted before discharging a debt. Before 
discharging a debt, VA must terminate debt collection action.
    (b) Upon discharge of an indebtedness, VA must report the discharge 
to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in accordance with the 
requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. VA may request 
Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers to file such a 
discharge report to the IRS on VA's behalf.
    (c) When discharging a debt, VA must request that any liens of 
record securing the debt be released.
    (d) 31 U.S.C. 3711(i)(2) requires agencies to sell a delinquent 
nontax debt upon termination of collection action if the Secretary of 
the Treasury determines such a sale is in the best interests of the 
United States. Since the discharge of a debt precludes any further 
collection action (including the sale of a delinquent debt), VA may not 
discharge a debt until the requirements of Sec. 3711(i)(2) have been 
met.

Sec. 1.950  Prompt referral.

    (a) VA shall promptly refer debts to Department of Justice (DOJ) for 
litigation where aggressive collection activity has been taken in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.900 through 1.953, and such debts cannot be 
compromised, or on which collection activity cannot be suspended or 
terminated, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.930 through 1.936 and 
Sec. Sec. 1.940 through 1.944. Debts for which the principal amount is 
over $1,000,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may 
direct, exclusive of interest and other late payment charges, shall be 
referred to the Civil Division or other division responsible for 
litigating such debts at DOJ. Debts for which the principal amount is 
$1,000,000, or less, or such other amount as the Attorney General may 
direct, exclusive of interest or penalties, shall be referred to DOJ's 
Nationwide Central Intake Facility as required by the Claims Collection 
Litigation Report (CCLR) instructions. Debts should be referred as early 
as possible, consistent with aggressive agency collection activity and 
the observance of the standards contained in Sec. Sec. 1.900 through 
1.953, and, in any event, well within the period for initiating timely 
lawsuits against the debtors. VA shall make every effort to refer 
delinquent debts to DOJ for litigation within 1 year of the date such 
debts last became delinquent. In the case of guaranteed or insured 
loans, VA should make every effort to refer these delinquent debts to 
DOJ for litigation within 1 year from the date the loan was presented to 
VA for payment or reinsurance.
    (b) DOJ has exclusive jurisdiction over the debts referred to it 
pursuant to this section. VA shall immediately terminate the use of any 
administrative collection activities to collect a debt at the time of 
the referral of that debt to DOJ. VA should advise DOJ of the collection 
activities that have been utilized to date, and their result. VA shall 
refrain from having any contact with the debtor and shall direct all 
debtor inquiries concerning the debt to DOJ. VA shall immediately notify 
DOJ of any payments credited to the debtor's account after referral of a 
debt under this section. DOJ shall notify VA, in a timely manner, of any 
payments it receives from the debtor.

    (a) Unless excepted by the Department of Justice (DOJ), VA shall 
complete the CCLR, accompanied by a signed Certificate of Indebtedness, 
to refer all administratively uncollectible claims to DOJ for 
litigation. VA shall complete all of the sections of the CCLR 
appropriate to each claim as required by the CCLR instructions and 
furnish such other information as may be required in specific cases.
    (b) VA shall indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions it wishes DOJ 
to take with respect to the referred claim.
    (c) VA shall also use the CCLR to refer claims to DOJ to obtain 
approval of any proposals to compromise the claims or to suspend or 
terminate agency collection activity.

the basis for the claim when referring such claims to DOJ for 
litigation. VA shall provide originals of such documents immediately 
upon request by DOJ.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, VA shall not refer for litigation claims of less than $2,500, 
exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or such 
other minimum amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time 
prescribe. The Department of Justice (DOJ) shall promptly notify 
referring agencies if the Attorney General changes this minimum amount.

[[Page 113]]

    (b) VA shall not refer claims of less than the minimum amount 
prescribed by the Attorney General unless:
    (1) Litigation to collect such smaller claims is important to ensure 
compliance with VA's policies or programs;
    (2) The claim is being referred solely for the purpose of securing a 
judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the 
debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to VA for 
enforcement; or
    (3) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the 
Government effectively can enforce payment, with due regard for the 
exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the 
judicial remedies available to the Government.
    (c) VA should consult with the Financial Litigation Staff of the 
Executive Office for United States Attorneys, in DOJ, prior to referring 
claims valued at less than the minimum amount.

Sec. 1.955  Regional office Committees on Waivers and Compromises.

    (a) Delegation of authority and establishment. (1) Sections 1.955 et 
seq. are issued to implement the authority for waiver consideration 
found in 38 U.S.C. 5302 and 5 U.S.C. 5584 and the compromise authority 
found 38 U.S.C. 3720(a) and 31 U.S.C. 3711. The duties, delegations of 
authority, and all actions required of the Committees on Waivers and 
Compromises are to be accomplished under the direction of, and authority 
vested in, the Director of the regional office. Delegations of authority 
and limitations for waiver actions under 5 U.S.C. 5584 are set forth in 
Sec. 1.963a of this part.
    (2) There is established in each regional office, a Committee on 
Waivers and Compromises to perform the duties and assume the 
responsibilities delegated by Sec. Sec. 1.956 and 1.957. The term 
regional office, as used in Sec. 1.955 et seq., includes VA Medical and 
Regional Office Centers and VA Centers where such are established.
    (b) Selection. The Director shall designate the employees to serve 
as Chairperson, members, and alternates. Except upon specific 
authorization of the Under Secretary for Benefits, when workload 
warrants a full-time committee, such designation will be part-time 
additional duty upon call of the Chairperson.
    (c) Control and staff. The administrative control of each Committee 
on Waivers and Compromises is the responsibility of the station's Fiscal 
Officer. However, the station Director has the authority to reassign the 
administrative control function to another station activity, rather than 
the Fiscal Officer, whenever the Director determines that such 
reassignment is appropriate. The quality control of the professional and 
clerical staff of the Committee is the responsibility of the 
Chairperson.
    (d) Overall control. The Assistant Secretary for Management is 
delegated complete management authority, including planning, policy 
formulation, control, coordination, supervision, and evaluation of 
Committee operations.
    (e) Committee composition. (1) The Committee shall consist of a 
Chairperson and Alternate Chairperson and as many Committee members and 
alternate members as the Director may appoint. Members and alternates 
shall be selected so that in each of the debt claim areas (i.e., 
compensation, pension, education, insurance, loan guaranty, etc.) there 
are members and alternates with special competence and familiarity with 
the program area.
    (2) When a claim is properly referred to the Committee for either 
waiver consideration or the consideration of a compromise offer, the 
Chairperson shall designate a panel from the available Committee members 
to consider the waiver request or compromise offer. If the debt for 
which the waiver request or compromise offer is made is $20,000 or less 
(exclusive or interest and administrative costs), the Chairperson will 
assign one Committee member as the panel. This one Committee member 
should have experience in the program area where the debt is located. 
The single panel member's decision shall stand as the decision of the 
Committee. If the debt for which the waiver request or compromise offer 
is made is more than $20,000 (exclusive of interest and administrative 
costs), the Chairperson shall assign two Committee members.

[[Page 114]]

One of the two members should be knowledgeable in the program area where 
the debt arose. If the two member panel cannot reach a unanimous 
decision, the Chairperson shall assign a third member of the Committee 
to the panel, or assign the case to three new members, and the majority 
vote shall determine the Committee decision.
    (3) The assignment of a one or two member panel as described in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section is applicable if the debtor files a 
Notice of Disagreement with a Committee decision to deny waiver. That 
is, if the Notice of Disagreement is filed with a decision by a one 
member panel to deny waiver of collection of a debt of $20,000 or less, 
then the Notice of Disagreement should also be assigned to one panel 
member. Likewise, a Notice of Disagreement filed with a decision by a 
two or three member panel to deny waiver of collection of a debt of more 
than $20,000 should also be assigned to a Committee panel of two members 
(three if these two members cannot agree). However, a Chairperson must 
assign the Notice of Disagreement to a different one, two, or three 
member panel than the panel that made the original Committee decision 
that is now the subject of the Notice of Disagreement.

Sec. 1.957  Committee authority.

    (a) Regional office committee. On matters covered in Sec. 1.956, 
the regional office Committee is authorized to determine the following 
issues:
    (1) Waivers. A decision may be rendered to grant or deny waiver of 
collection of a debt in the following debt categories:
    (i) Loan guaranty program (38 U.S.C. 5302(b)). Committees may 
consider waiver of the indebtedness of a veteran or spouse resulting 
from: (A) The payment of a claim under the guaranty or insurance of 
loans, (B) the liquidation

[[Page 115]]

of direct loans, (C) the liquidation of loans acquired under Sec. 
36.4318, and (D) the liquidation of vendee accounts. The phrase veteran 
or spouse includes a veteran-borrower, veteran-transferee, a veteran-
purchaser on a vendee account, a former spouse or surviving spouse of a 
veteran.
    (ii) Other than loan guaranty program. (38 U.S.C. 5302(a))
    (iii) Services erroneously furnished (Sec. 17.101(a)).
    (2) Compromises--(i) Loan program debts (38 U.S.C. 3720(a)). Accept 
or reject a compromise offer irrespective of the amount of the debt 
(loan program matters under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 are unlimited as to 
amount).
    (ii) Other than loan program debts (31 U.S.C. 3711).
    (A) Accept or reject a compromise offer on a debt which exceeds 
$1,000 but which is not over $100,000 (both amounts exclusive of 
interest and other late payment charges).
    (B) Accept or reject a compromise offer on a debt of a $1,000 or 
less, exclusive of interest and other late payment charges, which is not 
disposed of by the Chief, Fiscal activity, pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (C) Reject a compromise offer on a debt which exceeds $100,000, 
exclusive of interest and other late payment charges.
    (D) Recommend approval of a compromise offer on a debt which exceeds 
$100,000, exclusive of interest and other late payment charges. The 
authority to accept a compromise offer on such a debt rests solely 
within the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice. The Committee 
should evaluate a compromise offer on a debt in excess of $100,000, 
using the factors set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.930 through 1.938. If the 
Committee believes that the compromise offer is advantageous to the 
government, then the Committee members shall so state this conclusion in 
a written memorandum of recommendation of approval to the Chairperson. 
This recommendation, along with a Claims Collection Litigation Report 
(CCLR) completed in accordance with Sec. 1.951, will be referred to VA 
Central Office, Office of Financial Management (047G7), for submission 
to the Department of Justice for final approval.

of whether or not there has been a prior denial of waiver.
    (2) On other than loan program debts under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37,

Sec. 1.962  Waiver of overpayments.

    There shall be no collection of an overpayment, or any interest 
thereon, which results from participation in a benefit program 
administered under any law by VA when it is determined by a regional 
office Committee on Waivers and Compromises that collection would be 
against equity and good conscience. For the purpose of this regulation, 
the term overpayment refers only to those benefit payments made to a 
designated living payee or beneficiary in excess of the amount due or to 
which such payee or beneficiary is entitled. The death of an indebted 
payee, either prior to a request for waiver of the indebtedness or 
during Committee consideration of the waiver request, shall not preclude 
waiver consideration. There shall be no waiver consideration of an 
indebtedness that results from the receipt of a benefit payment by a 
non-payee who has no claim or entitlement to such payment.
    (a) Waiver consideration is applicable in an indebtedness resulting 
from work study and education loan default, as well as indebtedness of a 
veteran-borrower, veteran transferee, or indebted spouse of either, 
arising out of participation in the loan program administered under 38 
U.S.C. ch. 37. Also subject to waiver consideration is an indebtedness 
which is the result of VA hospitalization, domiciliary care, or 
treatment of a veteran, either furnished in error or on the basis of 
tentative eligibility.
    (b) In any case where there is an indication of fraud or 
misrepresentation of a material fact on the part of the debtor or any 
other party having an interest in the claim, action on a request for 
waiver will be deferred pending appropriate disposition of the matter. 
However, the existence of a prima facie case of fraud shall, 
nevertheless, entitle a claimant to an opportunity to make a rebuttal 
with countervailing evidence; similiarly, the misrepresentation must be 
more than non-willful or mere inadvertence. The Committee may act on a 
request for waiver concerning such debts, after the Inspector General or 
the Regional Counsel has determined that prosecution is not indicated, 
or the Department of Justice has notified VA that the alleged fraud or 
misrepresentation does not warrant action by that department, or the 
Department of Justice or the appropriate United States Attorney, 
specifically authorized action on the request for waiver.

Sec. 1.963  Waiver; other than loan guaranty.

laws

[[Page 117]]

administered by the VA shall be waived if there is no indication of 
fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of the person or 
persons having an interest in obtaining the waiver and recovery of the 
indebtedness from the payee who received such benefits would be against 
equity and good conscience.
    (b) Application. A request for waiver of an indebtedness under this 
section shall only be considered:
    (1) If made within 2 years following the date of a notice of 
indebtedness issued on or before March 31, 1983, by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to the debtor, or
    (2) Except as otherwise provided herein, if made within 180 days 
following the date of a notice of indebtedness issued on or after April 
1, 1983, by the Department of Veterans Affairs to the debtor. The 180 
day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver 
demonstrated to the Chairperson of the Committee on Waivers and 
Compromises that, as a result of an error by either the Department of 
Veterans Affairs or the postal authorities, or due to other 
circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a delay in such 
individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time 
customarily required for mailing (including forwarding). If the 
requester does substantiate that there was such a delay in the receipt 
of the notice of indebtedness, the Chairperson shall direct that the 180 
day period be computed from the date of the requester's actual receipt 
of the notice of indebtedness.

Sec. 1.963a  Waiver; erroneous payments of pay and allowances.

    (a) The provisions applicable to VA (including refunds) concerning 
waiver actions relating to erroneous payments to VA employees of pay and 
allowances, and travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and 
allowances, are set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5584. The members of Committees on 
Waivers and Compromises assigned to waiver actions under Sec. 1.955 of 
this part are delegated all authority granted the Secretary under 5 
U.S.C. 5584 to deny waiver or to grant waiver in whole or in part of any 
debt regardless of the amount of the indebtedness. Committee members 
also have exclusive authority to consider and render a decision on the 
appeal of a waiver denial or the granting of a partial waiver. However, 
the Chairperson of the Committee must assign the appeal to a different 
Committee member or members than the member or members who made the 
original decision that is now the subject of the appeal. The following 
are the only provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.955 through 1.970 of this part 
applicable to waiver actions concerning erroneous payments of pay and 
allowances, and travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and 
allowances, under 5 U.S.C. 5584: Sec. Sec. 1.955(a) through (e)(2), 
1.956(a)(introductory text) and (a)(3), 1.959, 1.960, 1.963a, and 
1.967(c).
    (b) Waiver may be granted under this section and 5 U.S.C. 5584 when 
collection would be against equity and good conscience and not in the 
best interest of the United States. Generally, these criteria will be 
met by a finding that the erroneous payment occurred through 
administrative error and that there is no indication of fraud, 
misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the 
employee or other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the 
claim, and waiver would not otherwise be inequitable. Generally, waiver 
is precluded when an employee receives a significant unexplained 
increase in pay or allowances, or otherwise knows, or reasonably should 
know, that an erroneous payment has occurred, and fails to make 
inquiries or bring the matter to the attention of the appropriate 
officials. Waiver under this standard will depend upon the facts 
existing in each case.
    (c) An application for waiver must be received within 3 years 
immediately following the date on which the erroneous payment was 
discovered.

Sec. 1.964  Waiver; loan guaranty.

    (a) General. Any indebtedness of a veteran or the indebtedness of 
the spouse shall be waived only when the following factors are 
determined to exist:
    (1) Following default there was a loss of the property which 
constituted security for the loan guaranteed, insured or made under 
chapter 37 of title 38 United States Code;
    (2) There is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith 
on the part of the person or persons having an interest in obtaining the 
waiver; and
    (3) Collection of such indebtedness would be against equity and good 
conscience.
    (b) Spouse. The waiver of a veteran's indebtedness shall inure to 
the spouse of such veteran insofar as concerns said indebtedness, unless 
the obligation of the spouse is specifically excepted. However, the 
waiver of the indebtedness of the veteran's spouse shall not inure to 
the benefit of the veteran unless specifically provided for in the 
waiver decision.
    (c) Surviving spouse or former spouse. A surviving spouse of a 
veteran or the former spouse of a veteran may be granted a waiver of the 
indebtedness provided the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
are met.
    (d) Preservation of Government rights. In cases in which it is 
determined that waiver may be granted, the action will take such form 
(covenant not to sue, or otherwise) as will preserve the rights of the 
Government against obligors other than the veteran or the spouse.
    (e) Application. A request for waiver of an indebtedness under this 
section shall be made within one year after the date on which the debtor 
receives, by Certified Mail-Return Receipt Requested, written notice 
from VA of the indebtedness. If written notice of indebtedness is sent 
by means other than Certified Mail-Return Receipt Requested, then there 
is no time limit for filing a request for waiver of indebtedness under 
this section.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5302(b))

    (f) Exclusion. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the 
indebtedness of a nonveteran obligor under the loan program is excluded 
from waiver.

Sec. 1.965  Application of standard.

    (a) The standard ``Equity and Good Conscience'', will be applied 
when the facts and circumstances in a particular case indicate a need 
for reasonableness and moderation in the exercise of the Government's 
rights. The decision reached should not be unduly favorable or adverse 
to either side. The phrase equity and good conscience means arriving at 
a fair decision between the obligor and the Government. In making this 
determination, consideration will be given to the following elements, 
which are not intended to be all inclusive:
    (1) Fault of debtor. Where actions of the debtor contribute to 
creation of the debt.
    (2) Balancing of faults. Weighing fault of debtor against Department 
of Veterans Affairs fault.
    (3) Undue hardship. Whether collection would deprive debtor or 
family of basic necessities.
    (4) Defeat the purpose. Whether withholding of benefits or recovery 
would nullify the objective for which benefits were intended.
    (5) Unjust enrichment. Failure to make restitution would result in 
unfair gain to the debtor.
    (6) Changing position to one's detriment. Reliance on Department of 
Veterans Affairs benefits results in relinquishment of a valuable right 
or incurrence of a legal obligation.
    (b) In applying this single standard for all areas of indebtedness, 
the following elements will be considered, any indication of which, if 
found, will preclude the granting of waiver:
    (1) Fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact (see Sec. 
1.962(b)).
    (2) Bad faith. This term generally describes unfair or deceptive 
dealing by one who seeks to gain thereby at another's expense. Thus, a 
debtor's conduct in connection with a debt arising from participation in 
a VA benefits/services program exhibits bad faith if

[[Page 119]]

such conduct, although not undertaken with actual fraudulent intent, is 
undertaken with intent to seek an unfair advantage, with knowledge of 
the likely consequences, and results in a loss to the government.

Sec. 1.966  Scope of waiver decisions.

    (a) Decisions will be based on the evidence of record. A hearing may 
be held at the request of the claimant or his/her representative. No 
expenses incurred by a claimant, his representative, or any witness 
incident to a hearing will be paid by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.
    (b) A regional office Committee may:
    (1) Waive recovery as to certain persons and decline to waive as to 
other persons whose claims are based on the same veteran's service.
    (2) Waive or decline to waive recovery from specific benefits or 
sources, except that:
    (i) There shall be no waiver of recovery out of insurance of an 
indebtedness secured thereby; i.e., an insurance overpayment to an 
insured. However, recovery may be waived of any or all of such 
indebtedness out of benefits other than insurance then or thereafter 
payable to the insured.

Sec. 1.967  Refunds.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any portion 
of an indebtedness resulting from participation in benefits programs 
administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs which has been 
recovered by the U.S. Government from the debtor may be considered for 
waiver, provided the debtor requests waiver in accordance with the time 
limits of Sec. 1.963(b). If collection of an indebtness is waived as to 
the debtor, such portions of the indebtedness previously collected by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs will be refunded. In the event that 
waiver of collection is granted for either an education, loan guaranty, 
or direct loan debt, there will be a reduction in the debtor's 
entitlement to future benefits in the program in which the debt 
originated.
    (b) The Department of Veterans Affairs may not waive collection of 
the indebtedness of an educational institution found liable under 38 
U.S.C. 3685. Waiver of collection of educational benefit overpayments 
from all or a portion of the eligible persons attending an educational 
institution which has been found liable under 38 U.S.C. 3685 shall not 
relieve the institution of its assessed liability. (See 38 CFR 
21.4009(f)).
    (c) The regulatory provisions concerning refunds of indebtedness 
collected by the Department of Veterans Affairs arising from erroneous 
payments of pay and allowances and travel, transportation, and 
relocation expenses and allowances are set forth in 4 CFR Parts 91 and 
92.
    (d) Refund of the entire amount collected may not be made when only 
a part of the debt is waived or when collection of the balance of a loan 
guaranty indebtedness by the Department of Veterans Affairs from 
obligors, other than a husband or wife of the person requesting waiver, 
will be adversely affected. Only where the amount collected exceeds the 
balance of the indebtedness still in existence will a refund be made in 
the amount of the difference between the two. Otherwise, refunds will be 
made in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.969  Revision of waiver decisions.

    (a) Jurisdiction. A decision involving waiver may be reversed or 
modified on the basis of new and material evidence, fraud, a change in 
law or interpretation of law specifically stated in a Department of 
Veterans Affairs issue, or clear and unmistakable error shown by the 
evidence in file at the time the prior decision was rendered by the same 
or any other regional office Committee.

[[Page 120]]

    (b) Finality of decisions. Except as provided in paragraph (a) of 
this section, a decision involving waiver rendered by the Committee 
having jurisdiction is final, subject to the provisions of:
    (1) Sections 3.104(a), 19.153 and 19.154 of this chapter as to 
finality of decisions;
    (2) Section 3.105 (a) and (b) of this chapter as to revision of

administrative appeals and the time limits for filing such appeals.
    (c) Difference of opinion. Where reversal or amendment of a decision 
involving waiver is authorized under Sec. 3.105(b) of this chapter 
because of a difference of opinion, the effective date of waiver will be 
governed by the principle contained in Sec. 3.400(h) of this chapter.

other obligor to effect a compromise must relate to an indebtedness 
established after the liquidation of the security, if any, and shall be 
reviewed by the Committee. An offer to effect a compromise may be 
accepted if it is deemed advantageous to the Government. A decision on 
an offer of compromise may be revised or modified on the basis of any 
information which would warrant a change in the original decision.

a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the 
amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.
    (f) These regulations do not apply to a routine intra-agency 
adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay 
attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in 
processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four

adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the individual is 
provided written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment and a 
point of contact for contesting such adjustment.
    (g) These regulations do not apply to any adjustment to collect a 
debt

[[Page 121]]

amounting to $50 or less, if at the time of such adjustment, or as soon 
thereafter as practicable, the individual is provided with written 
notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment and a point of contact 
for contesting such adjustment.
    (h) These regulations do not preclude the compromise, suspension, or 
termination of collection action under the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards (FCCS) (31 CFR parts 900-904) and VA regulations 38 CFR 1.930 
through 1.944.
    (i) The procedures and requirements of these regulations do not 
apply to salary offset used to recoup a Federal employee's debt where a 
judgment has been obtained against the employee for the debt.

days from the date of the notice.
    (b) If the employee files a request for a hearing after the 
expiration of the 30 day period provided for in paragraph (a) of this

Sec. 1.985  Form, notice of, and conduct of hearing.

    (a) After an employee requests a hearing, the hearing official or 
administrative law judge shall notify the employee of the form of the 
hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall 
set forth the date, time, and location for the hearing. If the hearing 
will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should 
submit his or her position and arguments in writing to the hearing 
official or administrative law judge by a specified date after which the 
record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable 
time to submit this information.
    (b) An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an 
oral hearing if the hearing official or administrative law judge 
determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary 
evidence, for example, when an issue of credibility or veracity is 
involved. If a determination is made to provide an oral hearing, the 
hearing official or administrative law judge may offer the employee the 
opportunity for a hearing by telephone conference call. If this offer is 
rejected or if the hearing official or administrative law judge declines 
to offer a telephone conference call hearing, the employee shall be 
provided an oral hearing permitting the personal appearance of the 
employee, his or her personal representative, and witnesses. A record or 
transcript of every oral hearing shall be made. Witnesses shall testify 
under

oath or affirmation. VA shall not be responsible for the payment of any 
expenses incident to attendance at the hearing which are incurred by 
either the employee, his or her representative or Counsel, or witnesses.
    (c) In all other cases where an employee requests a hearing, a paper 
hearing shall be provided. A paper hearing shall consist of a review of 
the written evidence of record by the administrative law judge or 
hearing official.
    (d) In any hearing under this section, the administrative law judge 
or hearing official may exclude from consideration evidence or testimony 
which is irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious.

employee and the VA under Sec. 1.990.
    (b) If the employee filed a request for a hearing as provided by

section, deductions will not begin until after the hearing official or

has rendered a final written decision.
    (c) If the employee failed to file a timely request for a hearing, 
deductions will begin on the date specified in the notice of intention 
to offset, unless a hearing is granted pursuant to Sec. 1.984(b).

before collection of the amount of the indebtedness is completed, the 
remaining indebtedness will be collected according to procedures for 
administrative offset (see 5 CFR 831.1801 through 831.1808, 31 CFR 
901.3, and 38 CFR 1.912).

<R05>
Sec. 1.992  Procedures for salary offset.

    (a) Types of collection. A debt will be collected in a lump-sum or 
in installments. Collection will be in a lump-sum unless the employee is 
financially unable to pay in one lump-sum, or if the amount of the debt 
exceeds 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay. In these cases, 
deduction will be by installments.
    (b) Installment deductions. (1) A debt to be collected in 
installments will be deducted at officially established pay intervals 
from an employee's current pay account unless the employee and the 
Secretary agree to alternative arrangements for repayment. The 
alternative arrangement must be in writing and signed by both the 
employee and Secretary or designee.
    (2) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater 
than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of 
installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of 
the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted 
for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from 
which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing 
to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment 
payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt 
in three years. Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period or 
$50 a month will be acceptable only in the most unusual circumstances.
    (c) Imposition of interest, penalties, and administrative costs. 
Interest, penalties, and administrative costs shall be charged in 
accordance with 31 CFR 901.9 and 38 CFR 1.915.

Sec. 1.993  Non-waiver of rights.

    So long as there are not statutory or contractual provisions to the 
contrary, an employee's involuntary payment (of all or a portion of a 
debt) under these regulations will not be interpreted as a waiver of any 
rights that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514.

(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5514)
    VA will refund promptly to the appropriate individual amounts offset 
under these regulations when:
    (a) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owed the United States 
(unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
    (b) VA is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund 
amounts deducted from the employee's current pay.

(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5514)


<R05>
Sec. 1.995  Requesting recovery through centralized administrative offset.

    (a) Under 31 U.S.C. 3716, VA and other creditor agencies must notify 
Treasury of all debts over 180 days delinquent so that recovery of such 
debts may be made by centralized administrative offset. This includes 
those debts that VA and other agencies seek from the pay account of an 
employee of another Federal agency via salary offset. Treasury and other 
disbursing officials will match payments, including Federal salary 
payments, against these debts. Where a match occurs, and all the 
requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be offset to 
satisfy the debt in whole or part.
    (b) Prior to submitting a debt to Treasury for the purpose of 
collection by offset, including salary offset, VA shall provide written 
certification to Treasury that:
    (1) The debt is past due and legally enforceable in the amount 
submitted to Treasury and that VA will ensure that any subsequent 
collections are credited to the debt and that Treasury shall be notified 
of such;
    (2) Except in the case of a judgment debt or as otherwise allowed by 
law, the debt is referred to Treasury for offset within 10 years after 
VA's right of action accrues;
    (3) VA has complied with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 38 CFR 
1.912 and 1.912a including, but not limited to, those provisions 
requiring that VA provide the debtor with applicable notices and 
opportunities for a review of the debt; and
    (4) VA has complied with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514 (salary 
offset) and 38 CFR 1.980 through 1.994 including, but not limited to, 
those provisions requiring that VA provide the debtor with applicable 
notices and opportunities for a hearing.
    (c) Specific procedures for notifying Treasury of debts for purposes 
of collection by centralized administrative offset are contained in the 
31 CFR 285.7. VA and other creditor agencies may notify Treasury of 
debts that have been delinquent for 180 days or less, including debts 
that VA and other creditor agencies seek to recover from the pay of an 
employee via salary offset.

Sec. 2.7  Delegation of authority to provide relief on account of administrative error.

    (a) Section 503(a) of title 38 U.S.C., provides that if the 
Secretary determines that benefits administered by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs have not been provided by reason of administrative 
error on the part of the Federal Government or any of its employees, the 
Secretary is authorized to provide such relief on account of such error 
as the Secretary determines equitable, including the payment of moneys 
to any person whom he determines equitably entitled thereto.
    (b) Section 503(b) of title 38 U.S.C., provides that if the 
Secretary determines that any veteran, surviving spouse, child of a 
veteran, or other person, has suffered loss, as a consequence of 
reliance upon a determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs of 
eligibility or entitlement to benefits, without knowledge that it was 
erroneously made, the Secretary is authorized to provide such relief as 
the Secretary determines equitable, including the payment of moneys to 
any person equitably entitled thereto. The Secretary is also required to 
submit an annual report to the Congress, containing a brief summary of 
each recommendation for relief and its disposition. Preparation of the 
report shall be the responsibility of the General Counsel.
    (c) The authority to grant the equitable relief, referred to in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, has not been delegated and is 
reserved to the Secretary. Recommendation for the correction of 
administrative error and for appropriate equitable relief therefrom will 
be submitted to the Secretary, through the General Counsel. Such 
recommendation may be initiated by the head of the administration having 
responsibility for the benefit, or of any concerned staff office, or by

relief under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is initiated by the 
head of a staff office, or the Chairman, Board of Veterans Appeals, the 
views of the head of the administration having responsibility for the 
benefit will be obtained and

    (y) Former prisoner of war. The term former prisoner of war means a 
person who, while serving in the active military, naval or air service, 
was forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by an enemy or 
foreign government, the agents of either, or a hostile force.
    (1) Decisions based on service department findings. The Department 
of Veterans Affairs shall accept the findings of the appropriate service 
department that a person was a prisoner of war during a period of war 
unless a reasonable basis exists for questioning it. Such findings shall 
be accepted only when detention or internment is by an enemy government 
or its agents.
    (2) Other decisions. In all other situations, including those in 
which the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot accept the service 
department findings, the following factors shall be used to determine 
prisoner of war status:
    (i) Circumstances of detention or internment. To be considered a 
former prisoner of war, a serviceperson must have been forcibly detained 
or interned under circumstances comparable to those under which persons 
generally have been forcibly detained or interned by enemy governments 
during periods of war. Such circumstances include, but are not limited 
to, physical hardships or abuse, psychological hardships or abuse, 
malnutrition, and unsanitary conditions. Each individual member of a 
particular group of detainees or internees shall, in the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, be considered to have experienced the same 
circumstances as those experienced by the group.
    (ii) Reason for detainment or internment. The reason for which a 
serviceperson was detained or interned is immaterial in determining POW 
status, except that a serviceperson who is detained or interned by a 
foreign government for an alleged violation of its laws is not entitled 
to be considered a

[[Page 141]]

former POW on the basis of that period of detention or internment, 
unless the charges are a sham intended to legitimize the period of 
detention or internment.
    (3) Central Office approval. The Director of the Compensation and 
Pension Service, VA Central Office, shall approve all VA regional office 
determinations establishing or denying POW status, with the exception of 
those service department determinations accepted under paragraph (y)(1) 
of this section.
    (4) In line of duty. The Department of Veterans Affairs shall 
consider that a serviceperson was forcibly detained or interned in line 
of duty unless the evidence of record discloses that forcible detainment 
or internment was the proximate result of the serviceperson's own 
willful misconduct.
    (5) Hostile force. The term hostile force means any entity other 
than an enemy or foreign government or the agents of either whose 
actions are taken to further or enhance anti-American military, 
political or economic objectives or views, or to attempt to embarrass 
the United States.

failure to disclose pertinent facts, for the purpose of obtaining or 
retaining, or assisting an individual to obtain or retain, eligibility

award or retention of such benefits.

Sec. 3.10  Dependency and indemnity compensation rate for a surviving spouse.

    (a) General determination of rate. When VA grants a surviving spouse 
entitlement to DIC, VA will determine the rate of the benefit it will 
award. The rate of the benefit will be the total of the basic monthly 
rate specified in paragraph (b) or (d) of this section and any 
applicable increases specified in paragraph (c) or (e) of this section.
    (b) Basic monthly rate. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the basic monthly rate of DIC for a surviving spouse will be 
the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(a)(1).
    (c) Section 1311(a)(2) increase. The basic monthly rate under 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be increased by the amount specified 
in 38 U.S.C. 1311(a)(2) if the veteran, at the time of death, was 
receiving, or was entitled to receive, compensation for service-
connected disability that was rated by VA as totally disabling for a 
continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death. 
Determinations of entitlement to this increase shall be made in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (d) Alternative basic monthly rate for death occurring prior to 
January 1, 1993. The basic monthly rate of DIC for a surviving spouse 
when the death of the veteran occurred prior to January 1, 1993, will be 
the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 1311(a)(3) corresponding to the 
veteran's pay grade in service, but only if such rate is greater than 
the total of the basic monthly rate and the section 1311(a)(2) increase 
(if applicable) the surviving spouse is entitled to receive under 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The Secretary of the concerned 
service department will certify the veteran's pay grade and the 
certification will be binding on VA. DIC paid pursuant to this paragraph 
may not be increased by the section 1311(a)(2) increase under paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (e) Additional increases. One or more of the following increases may 
be paid in addition to the basic monthly rate and the section 1311(a)(2) 
increase.
    (1) Increase for children. If the surviving spouse has one or more 
children under the age of 18 of the deceased veteran (including a child 
not in the surviving spouse's actual or constructive custody, or a child 
who is in active military service), the monthly DIC rate will be 
increased by the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(b) for each child.
    (2) Increase for regular aid and attendance. If the surviving spouse 
is determined to be in need of regular aid and attendance under the 
criteria in Sec. 3.352 or is a patient in a nursing home, the monthly 
DIC rate will be increased by the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(c).
    (3) Increase for housebound status. If the surviving spouse does not 
qualify for the regular aid and attendance allowance but is housebound 
under the criteria in Sec. 3.351(f), the monthly DIC rate will be 
increased by the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(d).
    (4) For a two-year period beginning on the date entitlement to 
dependency and indemnity compensation commenced, the dependency and 
indemnity compensation paid monthly to a surviving spouse with one or 
more children below the age of 18 shall be increased by the amount set 
forth in 38 U.S.C. 1311(e), regardless of the number of such children. 
The dependency and indemnity compensation payable under this paragraph 
is in addition to any other dependency and indemnity compensation 
payable. The increase in dependency and indemnity compensation of a 
surviving spouse under this paragraph shall cease beginning with the 
first month commencing after the month in which all children of the 
surviving spouse have attained the age of 18.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1311(e))


[[Page 152]]


    (f) Criteria governing section 1311(a)(2) increase. In determining 
whether a surviving spouse qualifies for the section 1311(a)(2) increase 
under paragraph (c) of this section, the following standards shall 
apply.
    (1) Marriage requirement. The surviving spouse must have been 
married to the veteran for the entire eight-year period referenced in 
paragraph (c) of this section in order to qualify for the section 
1311(a)(2) increase.
    (2) Determination of total disability. As used in paragraph (c) of 
this section, the phrase ``rated by VA as totally disabling'' includes 
total disability ratings based on unemployability (Sec. 4.16 of this 
chapter).
    (3) Definition of ``entitled to receive''. As used in paragraph (c) 
of this section, the phrase ``entitled to receive'' means that the 
veteran filed a claim for disability compensation during his or her 
lifetime and one of the following circumstances is satisfied:
    (i) The veteran would have received total disability compensation 
for the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section but for clear 
and unmistakable error committed by VA in a decision on a claim filed 
during the veteran's lifetime; or
    (ii) Additional evidence submitted to VA before or after the 
veteran's death, consisting solely of service department records that 
existed at the time of a prior VA decision but were not previously 
considered by VA, provides a basis for reopening a claim finally decided 
during the veteran's lifetime and for awarding a total service-connected 
disability rating retroactively in accordance with Sec. Sec. 3.156(c) 
and 3.400(q)(2) of this part for the period specified in paragraph (c) 
of this section; or
    (iii) At the time of death, the veteran had a service-connected 
disability that was continuously rated totally disabling by VA for the 
period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, but was not receiving 
compensation because:
    (A) VA was paying the compensation to the veteran's dependents;
    (B) VA was withholding the compensation under the authority of 38 
U.S.C. 5314 to offset an indebtedness of the veteran;
    (C) The veteran had not waived retired or retirement pay in order to 
receive compensation;
    (D) VA was withholding payments under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 
1174(h)(2);
    (E) VA was withholding payments because the veteran's whereabouts 
were unknown, but the veteran was otherwise entitled to continued 
payments based on a total service-connected disability rating; or
    (F) VA was withholding payments under 38 U.S.C. 5308 but determines 
that benefits were payable under 38 U.S.C. 5309.

Sec. 3.11  Homicide.

    Any person who has intentionally and wrongfully caused the death of 
another person is not entitled to pension, compensation, or dependency 
and indemnity compensation or increased pension, compensation, or 
dependency and indemnity compensation by reason of such death. For the 
purpose of this section the term dependency and indemnity compensation 
includes benefits at dependency and indemnity compensation rates paid 
under 38 U.S.C. 1318.

[44 FR 22718, Apr. 17, 1979, as amended at 54 FR 31829, Aug. 2, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 3.12  Character of discharge.

    (a) If the former service member did not die in service, pension, 
compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation is not payable 
unless the period of service on which the claim is based was terminated 
by discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable. (38 
U.S.C. 101(2)). A discharge under honorable conditions is binding on the 
Department of Veterans Affairs as to character of discharge.
    (b) A discharge or release from service under one of the conditions 
specified in this section is a bar to the payment of benefits unless it 
is found that the person was insane at the time of committing the 
offense causing such discharge or release or unless otherwise 
specifically provided (38 U.S.C. 5303(b)).

[[Page 153]]

    (c) Benefits are not payable where the former service member was 
discharged or released under one of the following conditions:
    (1) As a conscientious objector who refused to perform military 
duty, wear the uniform, or comply with lawful order of competent 
military authorities.
    (2) By reason of the sentence of a general court-martial.
    (3) Resignation by an officer for the good of the service.
    (4) As a deserter.
    (5) As an alien during a period of hostilities, where it is 
affirmatively shown that the former service member requested his or her 
release. See Sec. 3.7(b).
    (6) By reason of a discharge under other than honorable conditions 
issued as a result of an absence without official leave (AWOL) for a 
continuous period of at least 180 days. This bar to benefit entitlement 
does not apply if there are compelling circumstances to warrant the 
prolonged unauthorized absence. This bar applies to any person awarded 
an honorable or general discharge prior to October 8, 1977, under one of 
the programs listed in paragraph (h) of this section, and to any person 
who prior to October 8, 1977, had not otherwise established basic 
eligibility to receive Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. The term 
established basic eligibility to receive Department of Veterans Affairs 
benefits means either a Department of Veterans Affairs determination 
that an other than honorable discharge was issued under conditions other 
than dishonorable, or an upgraded honorable or general discharge issued 
prior to October 8, 1977, under criteria other than those prescribed by 
one of the programs listed in paragraph (h) of this section. However, if 
a person was discharged or released by reason of the sentence of a 
general court-martial, only a finding of insanity (paragraph (b) of this 
section) or a decision of a board of correction of records established 
under 10 U.S.C. 1552 can estalish basic eligibility to receive 
Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. The following factors will be 
considered in determining whether there are compelling circumstances to 
warrant the prolonged unauthorized absence.
    (i) Length and character of service exclusive of the period of 
prolonged AWOL. Service exclusive of the period of prolonged AWOL should 
generally be of such quality and length that it can be characterized as 
honest, faithful and meritorious and of benefit to the Nation.
    (ii) Reasons for going AWOL. Reasons which are entitled to be given 
consideration when offered by the claimant include family emergencies or 
obligations, or similar types of obligations or duties owed to third 
parties. The reasons for going AWOL should be evaluated in terms of the 
person's age, cultural background, educational level and judgmental 
maturity. Consideration should be given to how the situation appeared to 
the person himself or herself, and not how the adjudicator might have 
reacted. Hardship or suffering incurred during overseas service, or as a 
result of combat wounds of other service-incurred or aggravated 
disability, is to be carefully and sympathetically considered in 
evaluating the person's state of mind at the time the prolonged AWOL 
period began.
    (iii) A valid legal defense exists for the absence which would have 
precluded a conviction for AWOL. Compelling circumstances could occur as 
a matter of law if the absence could not validly be charged as, or lead 
to a conviction of, an offense under the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice. For purposes of this paragraph the defense must go directly to 
the substantive issue of absence rather than to procedures, 
technicalities or formalities.
    (d) A discharge or release because of one of the offenses specified 
in this paragraph is considered to have been issued under dishonorable 
conditions.
    (1) Acceptance of an undesirable discharge to escape trial by 
general court-martial.
    (2) Mutiny or spying.
    (3) An offense involving moral turpitude. This includes, generally, 
conviction of a felony.
    (4) Willful and persistent misconduct. This includes a discharge 
under other than honorable conditions, if it is determined that it was 
issued because of willful and persistent misconduct. A discharge because 
of a minor offense will not, however, be considered willful

[[Page 154]]

and persistent misconduct if service was otherwise honest, faithful and 
meritorious.
    (5) Homosexual acts involving aggravating circumstances or other 
factors affecting the performance of duty. Examples of homosexual acts 
involving aggravating circumstances or other factors affecting the 
performance of duty include child molestation, homosexual prostitution, 
homosexual acts or conduct accompanied by assault or coercion, and 
homosexual acts or conduct taking place between service members of 
disparate rank, grade, or status when a service member has taken 
advantage of his or her superior rank, grade, or status.
    (e) An honorable discharge or discharge under honorable conditions 
issued through a board for correction of records established under 
authority of 10 U.S.C. 1552 is final and conclusive on the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. The action of the board sets aside any prior bar to 
benefits imposed under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
    (f) An honorable or general discharge issued prior to October 8, 
1977, under authority other than that listed in paragraphs (h) (1), (2) 
and (3) of this section by a discharge review board established under 10 
U.S.C. 1553 set aside any bar to benefits imposed under paragraph (c) or 
(d) of this section except the bar contained in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (g) An honorable or general discharge issued on or after October 8, 
1977, by a discharge review board established under 10 U.S.C. 1553, sets 
aside a bar to benefits imposed under paragraph (d), but not paragraph 
(c), of this section provided that:
    (1) The discharge is upgraded as a result of an individual case 
review;
    (2) The discharge is upgraded under uniform published standards and 
procedures that generally apply to all persons administratively 
discharged or released from active military, naval or air service under 
conditions other than honorable; and
    (3) Such standards are consistent with historical standards for 
determining honorable service and do not contain any provision for 
automatically granting or denying an upgraded discharge.
    (h) Unless a discharge review board established under 10 U.S.C. 1553 
determines on an individual case basis that the discharge would be 
upgraded under uniform standards meeting the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (g) of this section, an honorable or general discharge awarded 
under one of the following programs does not remove any bar to benefits 
imposed under this section:
    (1) The President's directive of January 19, 1977, implementing 
Presidential Proclamation 4313 of September 16, 1974; or
    (2) The Department of Defense's special discharge review program 
effective April 5, 1977; or
    (3) Any discharge review program implemented after April 5, 1977, 
that does not apply to all persons administratively discharged or 
released from active military service under other than honorable 
conditions.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5303 (e))

    (i) No overpayments shall be created as a result of payments made 
after October 8, 1977, based on an upgraded honorable or general 
discharge issued under one of the programs listed in paragraph (h) of 
this section which would not be awarded under the standards set forth in 
paragraph (g) of this section. Accounts in payment status on or after 
October 8, 1977, shall be terminated the end of the month in which it is 
determined that the original other than honorable discharge was not 
issued under conditions other than dishonorable following notice from 
the appropriate discharge review board that the discharge would not have 
been upgraded under the standards set forth in paragraph (g) of this 
section, or April 7, 1978, whichever is the earliest. Accounts in 
suspense (either before or after October 8, 1977) shall be terminated on 
the date of last payment or April 7, 1978, whichever is the earliest.
    (j) No overpayment shall be created as a result of payments made 
after October 8, 1977, in cases in which the bar contained in paragraph 
(c)(6) of this section is for application. Accounts in payment status on 
or after October 8, 1977, shall be terminated at the end of the month in 
which it is determined that compelling circumstances do not

[[Page 155]]

exist, or April 7, 1978, whichever is the earliest. Accounts in suspense 
(either before or after October 8, 1977) shall be terminated on the date 
of last payment, or April 7, 1978, whichever is the earliest.
    (k) Uncharacterized separations. Where enlisted personnel are 
administratively separated from service on the basis of proceedings 
initiated on or after October 1, 1982, the separation may be classified 
as one of the three categories of administrative separation that do not 
require characterization of service by the military department 
concerned. In such cases conditions of discharge will be determined by 
the VA as follows:
    (1) Entry level separation. Uncharacterized administrative 
separations of this type shall be considered under conditions other than 
dishonorable.
    (2) Void enlistment or induction. Uncharacterized administrative 
separations of this type shall be reviewed based on facts and 
circumstances surrounding separation, with reference to the provisions 
of Sec. 3.14 of this part, to determine whether separation was under 
conditions other than dishonorable.
    (3) Dropped from the rolls. Uncharacterized administrative 
separations of this type shall be reviewed based on facts and 
circumstances surrounding separation to determine whether separation was 
under conditions other than dishonorable.

Sec. 3.12a  Minimum active-duty service requirement.

    (a) Definitions. (1) The term minimum period of active duty means, 
for the purposes of this section, the shorter of the following periods.
    (i) Twenty-four months of continuous active duty. Non-duty periods 
that are excludable in determining the Department of Veterans Affairs 
benefit entitlement (e.g., see Sec. 3.15) are not considered as a break 
in service for continuity purposes but are to be subtracted from total 
time served.
    (ii) The full period for which a person was called or ordered to 
active duty.
    (2) The term benefit includes a right or privilege but does not 
include a refund of a participant's contributions under 38 U.S.C. Ch. 
32.
    (b) Effect on Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. Except as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a person listed in paragraph 
(c) of this section who does not complete a minimum period of active 
duty is not eligible for any benefit under title 38, United States Code 
or under any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
based on that period of active service.
    (c) Persons included. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section apply to the 
following persons:
    (1) A person who originally enlists (enlisted person only) in a 
regular component of the Armed Forces after September 7, 1980 (a person 
who signed a delayed-entry contract with one of the service branches 
prior to September 8, 1980, and under that contract was assigned to a 
reserve component until entering on active duty after September 7, 1980, 
shall be considered to have enlisted on the date the person entered on 
active duty); and
    (2) Any other person (officer as well as enlisted) who enters on 
active duty after October 16, 1981 and who has not previously completed 
a continuous period of active duty of at least 24 months or been 
discharged or released from active duty under 10 U.S.C. 1171 (early 
out).
    (d) Exclusions. The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are 
not applicable to the following cases:
    (1) To a person who is discharged or released under 10 U.S.C. 1171 
or 1173 (early out or hardship discharge).
    (2) To a person who is discharged or released from active duty for a 
disability adjudged service connected without presumptive provisions of 
law, or who at time of discharge had such a service-connected 
disability, shown by

[[Page 156]]

official service records, which in medical judgment would have justified 
a discharge for disability.
    (3) To a person with a compensable service-connected disability.
    (4) To the provision of a benefit for or in connection with a 
service-connected disability, condition, or death.
    (5) To benefits under chapter 19 of title 38, United States Code.
    (e) Dependent or survivor benefits--(1) General. If a person is, by 
reason of this section, barred from receiving any benefits under title 
38, United States Code (or under any other law administered by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs based on a period of active duty, the 
person's dependents or survivors are also barred from receiving benefits 
based on the same period of active duty.
    (2) Exceptions. Paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply to 
benefits under chapters 19 and 37 of title 38, United States Code. (38

    (1) World War I; prior to November 11, 1918. As to reenlistments, 
this subparagraph applies only to Army and National Guard. No 
involuntary extension or other restrictions existed on Navy enlistments.
    (2) World War II, the Korean conflict or the Vietnam era; prior to 
the date the person was eligible for discharge under the point or length 
of service system, or under any other criteria in effect.
    (3) Peacetime service; prior to the date the person was eligible for 
an unconditional discharge.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the entire 
period of service under the circumstances stated in paragraph (a) of 
this section constitutes one period of service and entitlement will be 
determined by the character of the final termination of such period of 
active service except that, for death pension purposes, Sec. 3.3(b)(3) 
and (4) is controlling as to basic entitlement when the conditions 
prescribed therein are met.
    (c) Despite the fact that no unconditional discharge may have been 
issued, a person shall be considered to have been unconditionally 
discharged or released from active military, naval or air service when 
the following conditions are met:
    (1) The person served in the active military, naval or air service 
for the period of time the person was obligated to serve at the time of 
entry into service;
    (2) The person was not discharged or released from such service at 
the time of completing that period of obligation due to an intervening 
enlistment or reenlistment; and
    (3) The person would have been eligible for a discharge or release 
under conditions other than dishonorable at that time except for the 
intervening enlistment or reenlistment.

Sec. 3.14  Validity of enlistments.

    Service is valid unless the enlistment is voided by the service 
department.
    (a) Enlistment not prohibited by statute. Where an enlistment is 
voided by the service department for reasons other than those stated in 
paragraph (b) of this section, service is valid from the date of entry 
upon active duty to the date of voidance by the service department. 
Benefits may not be paid, however, unless the discharge is held to have 
been under conditions other than dishonorable. Generally discharge for 
concealment of a physical or mental defect except incompetency or 
insanity which would have prevented enlistment will be held to be under 
dishonorable conditions.
    (b) Statutory prohibition. Where an enlistment is voided by the 
service department because the person did not have legal capacity to 
contract for a reason other than minority (as in the case of an insane 
person) or because the enlistment was prohibited by statute (a deserter 
or person convicted of a felony), benefits may not be paid based

[[Page 157]]

on that service even though a disability was incurred during such 
service. An undesirable discharge by reason of the fraudulent enlistment 
voids the enlistment from the beginning.
    (c) Misrepresentation of age. Active service which was terminated 
because of concealment of minority or misrepresentation of age is 
honorable if the veteran was released from service under conditions 
other than dishonorable. Service is valid from the date of entry upon 
active duty to the date of discharge.
    (d) Honorable discharges. Determinations as to honorable service 
will be made by the service departments and the finding shall be binding 
on the Department of Veterans Affairs, but, in the case of an alien, the 
effect of the discharge will be governed by Sec. 3.7(b).

Sec. 3.15  Computation of service.

    For nonservice-connected or service-connected benefits, active 
service is countable exclusive of time spent on an industrial, 
agricultural, or indefinite furlough, time lost on absence without leave 
(without pay), under arrest (without acquittal), in desertion, while 
undergoing sentence of court-martial or a period following release from 
active duty under the circumstances outlined in Sec. 3.41. In claims 
based on Spanish-American War service, leave authorized under General 
Order No. 130, War Department, is included.

Sec. 3.16  Service pension.

    In computing the 70 or 90 days required under Sec. 3.3(a) active

included if such service was continuous. Broken periods of service 
during a war period may be added together to meet the requirement for 
length of service.

before and extended into the Mexican border period or ended during World 
War I, or began or ended during World War II, the Korean conflict, the 
Vietnam era or the Persian Gulf War, if such service was continuous. 
Service during different war periods may be combined with service during 
any other war period to meet the 90 days' service requirement.

Sec. 3.20  Surviving spouse's benefit for month of veteran's death.

    (a) Where the veteran died on or after December 1, 1962, and before 
October 1, 1982, the rate of death pension or dependency and indemnity 
compensation otherwise payable for the surviving spouse for the month in 
which the death occurred shall be not less than the amount of pension or 
compensation which would have been payable to or for the veteran for 
that month but for his or her death.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5310)

    (b) Where the veteran dies on or after October 1, 1982, the 
surviving spouse may be paid death pension or dependency and indemnity 
compensation for the month in which the veteran died at a rate equal to 
the amount of compensation or pension which would have been payable to 
the veteran for that month had death not occurred, but only if such rate 
is equal to or greater than the monthly rate of death pension or 
dependency and indemnity compensation to which the surviving spouse is 
entitled. Otherwise, no payment of death pension or dependency and 
indemnity compensation may be made for the month in which the veteran 
died.

    (c)(1) Where a veteran receiving compensation or pension dies after 
December 31, 1996, the surviving spouse, if not entitled to death 
compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or death pension 
for the month of death, shall be entitled to a benefit for that month in 
an amount equal to the amount of compensation or pension the veteran 
would have received for that month but for his or her death.
    (2) A payment issued to a deceased veteran as compensation or 
pension for the month in which death occurred shall be treated as 
payable to that veteran's surviving spouse, if the surviving spouse is 
not entitled to death compensation, dependency and indemnity 
compensation or death pension for that month and, if negotiated or 
deposited, shall be considered to be the benefit to which the surviving 
spouse is entitled under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, if 
such payment is in an amount less than the amount of the benefit under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the unpaid difference shall be treated

Sec. 3.22  DIC benefits for survivors of certain veterans rated totally disabled at time of death.

    (a) Even though a veteran died of non-service-connected causes, VA 
will pay death benefits to the surviving spouse or children in the same 
manner as if the veteran's death were service-connected, if:
    (1) The veteran's death was not the result of his or her own willful 
misconduct, and
    (2) At the time of death, the veteran was receiving, or was entitled 
to receive, compensation for service-connected disability that was:
    (i) Rated by VA as totally disabling for a continuous period of at 
least 10 years immediately preceding death;
    (ii) Rated by VA as totally disabling continuously since the 
veteran's release from active duty and for at least 5 years immediately 
preceding death; or
    (iii) Rated by VA as totally disabling for a continuous period of 
not less than one year immediately preceding death, if the veteran was a 
former prisoner of war who died after September 30, 1999.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1318(b))

    (b) For purposes of this section, ``entitled to receive'' means that 
the veteran filed a claim for disability compensation during his or her 
lifetime and one of the following circumstances is satisfied:
    (1) The veteran would have received total disability compensation at 
the time of death for a service-connected disability rated totally 
disabling for the period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
but for clear and unmistakable error committed by VA in a decision on a 
claim filed during the veteran's lifetime; or
    (2) Additional evidence submitted to VA before or after the 
veteran's death, consisting solely of service department records that 
existed at the time of a prior VA decision but were not previously 
considered by VA, provides a basis for reopening a claim finally decided 
during the veteran's lifetime and for awarding a total service-connected 
disability rating retroactively in accordance with Sec. Sec. 3.156(c) 
and 3.400(q)(2) of this part for the relevant period

[[Page 159]]

specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or
    (3) At the time of death, the veteran had a service-connected 
disability that was continuously rated totally disabling by VA for the 
period specified in paragraph (a)(2), but was not receiving compensation 
because:
    (i) VA was paying the compensation to the veteran's dependents;
    (ii) VA was withholding the compensation under authority of 38 
U.S.C. 5314 to offset an indebtedness of the veteran;
    (iii) The veteran had not waived retired or retirement pay in order 
to receive compensation;
    (iv) VA was withholding payments under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 
1174(h)(2);
    (v) VA was withholding payments because the veteran's whereabouts 
were unknown, but the veteran was otherwise entitled to continued 
payments based on a total service-connected disability rating; or
    (vi) VA was withholding payments under 38 U.S.C. 5308 but determines 
that benefits were payable under 38 U.S.C. 5309.
    (c) For purposes of this section, ``rated by VA as totally 
disabling'' includes total disability ratings based on unemployability 
(Sec. 4.16 of this chapter).
    (d) To be entitled to benefits under this section, a surviving 
spouse must have been married to the veteran--
    (1) For at least 1 year immediately preceding the date of the 
veteran's death; or
    (2) For any period of time if a child was born of the marriage, or 
was born to them before the marriage.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1318)

    (e) Effect of judgment or settlement. If a surviving spouse or child 
eligible for benefits under paragraph (a) of this section receives any 
money or property pursuant to a judicial proceeding based upon, or a 
settlement or compromise of, any cause of action or other right of 
recovery for damages for the death of the veteran, benefits payable 
under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be paid for any month 
following the month in which such money or property is received until 
the amount of benefits that would otherwise have been payable under 
paragraph (a) of this section equals the total of the amount of money 
received and the fair market value of the property received. The 
provisions of this paragraph do not apply, however, to any portion of 
such benefits payable for any period preceding the end of the month in 
which such money or property of value is received.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (f) Social security and worker's compensation. Benefits received 
under social security or worker's compensation are not subject to 
recoupment under paragraph (e) of this section even though such benefits 
may have been awarded pursuant to a judicial proceeding.
    (g) Beneficiary's duty to report. Any person entitled to benefits 
under paragraph (a) of this section shall promptly report to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs the receipt of any money or property 
received pursuant to a judicial proceeding based upon, or a settlement 
or compromise of, any cause of action or other right of recovery for 
damages for the death of the veteran. The amount to be reported is the 
total of the amount of money received and the fair market value of 
property received. Expenses incident to recovery, such as attorney's 
fees, may not be deducted from the amount to be reported.
    (h) Relationship to survivor benefit plan. For the purpose of 10 
U.S.C. 1448(d) and 1450(c) eligibility for benefits under paragraph (a) 
of this section shall be deemed eligibility for dependency and indemnity 
compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1311(a).

countable annual income of the veteran or surviving spouse.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1521, 1541)

    (c) Mexican border period and World War I veterans. The applicable 
maximum annual rate payable to a Mexican border period or World War I 
veteran under this section shall be increased by the amount specified in 
38 U.S.C. 1521(g), as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C 5312. 
Each time there is an increase under 38 U.S.C. 5312, the actual rate 
will be published in the ``Notices'' section of the Federal Register.

    (d) Definitions of terms used in this section--(1) Dependent. A 
veteran's spouse or child. A veteran's spouse who resides apart from the 
veteran and is estranged from the veteran may not be considered the 
veteran's dependent unless the spouse receives reasonable support 
contributions from the veteran. (Note that under Sec. 3.60 a veteran 
and spouse who reside apart are considered to be living together unless 
they are estranged.) A child of a veteran not in custody of the veteran 
and to whose support the veteran is not reasonably contributing, may not 
be considered the veteran's dependent.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1521(b))

    (2) In need of aid and attendance. As defined in Sec. 3.351(b).
    (3) Housebound. As defined in Sec. 3.351(d)(2), (f). This term also 
includes a veteran who has a disability or disabilities evaluated as 60 
percent or more disabling in addition to a permanent and totally 
disabling condition. See Sec. 3.351(d)(1).
    (4) Veteran's annual income. This term includes the veteran's annual 
income, the annual income of the veteran's dependent spouse, and the 
annual income of each child of the veteran (other than a child for whom 
increased pension is not payable under 38 U.S.C. 1522(b)) in the 
veteran's custody or to whose support the veteran is reasonably 
contributing (to the extent such child's income is reasonably available 
to or for the veteran, unless in the judgment of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to do so would work a hardship on the veteran.) There 
is a rebuttable presumption that all of such a child's income is 
reasonably available to or for the veteran.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1521 (c), (h))

    (5) Surviving spouse's annual income. This term includes the 
surviving spouse's annual income and the annual income of each child of 
the veteran (other than a child for whom increased pension is not 
payable under 38 U.S.C. 1543(a)(2)) in the custody of the surviving 
spouse to the extent that such child's income is reasonably available to 
or for the surviving spouse, unless in the judgment of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to do so would work a

[[Page 161]]

hardship on the surviving spouse. There is a rebuttable presumption that 
all of such a child's income is available to or for the surviving 
spouse.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1541(c), (g))

    (6) Reasonable availability and hardship. For the purposes of 
paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section, a child's income shall be 
considered ``reasonably available'' when it can be readily applied to 
meet the veteran's or surviving spouse's expenses necessary for 
reasonable family maintenance, and ``hardship'' shall be held to exist 
when annual expenses necessary for reasonable family maintenance exceed 
the sum of countable annual income plus VA pension entitlement. Expenses 
necessary for reasonable family maintenance include expenses for basic 
necessities (such as food, clothing, shelter, etc.) and other expenses, 
determined on a case-by-case basis, which are necessary to support a 
reasonable quality of life.

Sec. 3.24  Improved pension rates--Surviving children.

    (a) General. The provisions of this section apply to children of a 
deceased veteran not in the custody of a surviving spouse who has basic 
eligibility to receive improved pension. Children in custody of a 
surviving spouse who has basic eligibility to receive improved pension 
do not have separate entitlement. Basic eligibility to receive improved 
pension means that the surviving spouse is in receipt of improved 
pension or could become entitled to receive improved pension except for 
the amount of the surviving spouse's countable annual income or the size 
of the surviving spouse's estate (See Sec. 3.274(c)). Under Sec. 
3.23(d)(5) the countable annual income of a surviving spouse includes 
the countable annual income of each child of the veteran in custody of 
the surviving spouse to the extent the child's income is reasonably 
available to or for the surviving spouse, unless in the judgment of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to do so would work a hardship on the 
surviving spouse.
    (b) Child with no personal custodian or in the custody of an 
institution. In cases in which there is no personal custodian, i.e., 
there is no person who has the legal right to exercise parental control 
and responsibility for the child's welfare (See Sec. 3.57(d)), or the 
child is in the custody of an institution, pension shall be paid to the 
child at the annual rate specified in 38 U.S.C. 1542, as increased from 
time to time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, reduced by the amount of the child's 
countable annual income. Each time there is an increase under 38 U.S.C. 
5312, the actual rate will be published in the ``Notices'' section of 
the Federal Register.
    (c) Child in the custody of person legally responsible for support--
(1) Single child. Pension shall be paid to a child in the custody of a 
person legally responsible for the child's support at an annual rate 
equal to the difference between the rate for a surviving spouse and one 
child under Sec. 3.23(a)(5), and the sum of the annual income of such 
child and the annual income of such person or, the maximum annual 
pension rate under paragraph (b) of this section, whichever is less.
    (2) More than one child. Pension shall be paid to children in 
custody of a person legally responsible for the children's support at an 
annual rate equal to the difference between the rate for a surviving 
spouse and an equivalent number of children (but not including any child 
who has countable annual income equal to or greater than the maximum 
annual pension rate under paragraph (b) of this section) and the sum of 
the countable annual income of the person legally responsible for 
support and the combined countable annual income of the children (but 
not including the income of any child whose countable annual income is 
equal to or greater than the maximum annual pension rate under paragraph 
(b) of this section, or the maximum annual pension rate under paragraph 
(b) of this section times the number of eligible children, whichever is 
less).

Sec. 3.25  Parent's dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC)--Method of payment computation.

    Monthly payments of parents' DIC shall be computed in accordance 
with the following formulas:
    (a) One parent. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
if there is only one parent, the monthly rate specified in 38 U.S.C 
1315(b)(1), as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, reduced 
by $.08 for each dollar of such parent's countable annual income in 
excess of $800. No payments of DIC may be made under this paragraph, 
however, if such parent's countable annual income exceeds the amount 
specified in 38 U.S.C. 1315(b)(3), as increased from time to time under 
38 U.S.C. 5312, and no payment of DIC to a parent under this paragraph 
may be less than $5 a month.
    (b) One parent who has remarried. If there is only one parent and 
the parent has remarried and is living with the parent's spouse, DIC 
shall be paid under paragraph (a) or paragraph (d) of this section, 
whichever shall result in the greater benefit being paid to the 
veteran's parent. In the case of remarriage, the total combined annual 
income of the parent and the parent's spouse shall be counted in 
determining the monthly rate of DIC.
    (c) Two parents not living together. The rate computation method in 
this paragraph applies to:
    (1) Two parents who are not living together, or
    (2) An unremarried parent when both parents are living and the other 
parent has remarried.

The monthly rate of DIC paid to such parent shall be the rate sepcified 
in 38 U.S.C. 1315(c)(1), as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. 
5312, reduced by an amount no greater than $.08 for each dollar of such 
parent's countable annual income in excess of $800, except that no 
payments of DIC may be made under this paragraph if such parent's 
countable annual income exceeds the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 
1315(c)(3), as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, and no 
payment of DIC to a parent under this paragraph may be less than $5 
monthly. Each time there is a rate increase under 38 U.S.C. 5312, the 
amount of the reduction under this paragraph shall be recomputed to 
provide, as nearly as possible, for an equitable distribution of the 
rate increase. The results of this computation method shall be published 
in schedular format in the ``Notices'' section of the Federal Register 
as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (d) Two parents living together or remarried parents living with 
spouse. The rate computation method in this paragraph applies to each 
parent living with another parent and to each remarried parent when both 
parents are alive. The monthly rate of DIC paid to such parents shall be 
the rate specified in 38 U.S.C. 1315(d)(1), as increased from time to 
time under 38 U.S.C. 5312, reduced to an amount no greater than $.08 for 
each dollar of such parent's and spouse's combined countable annual 
income in excess of $1,000 except that no payments of DIC to a parent 
under this paragraph may be less than $5 monthly. Each time there is a 
rate increase under 38 U.S.C. 5312, the amount of the reduction under

Sec. 3.31  Commencement of the period of payment.

    Regardless of VA regulations concerning effective dates of awards, 
and except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, payment of 
monetary benefits based on original, reopened, or increased awards of 
compensation, pension, dependency and indemnity compensation, or a 
monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 for an individual who is a 
child of a Vietnam veteran may not be made for any period prior to the 
first day of the calendar month following the month in which the award 
became effective. However, beneficiaries will be deemed to be in receipt 
of monetary benefits during the period between the effective date of the 
award and the date payment commences for the purpose of all laws 
administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs except that nothing 
in this section will be construed as preventing the receipt of retired 
or retirement pay prior to the effective date of waiver of such pay in 
accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5305.
    (a) Increased award defined. For the purposes of this section the 
term increased award means an award which is increased because of an 
added dependent, increase in disability or disability rating, or 
reduction in income. The term also includes elections of improved 
pension under section 306 of Pub. L. 95-588 and awards pursuant to 
paragraphs 29 and 30 of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) General rule of applicability. The provisions of this section 
apply to all original, reopened, or increased awards unless such awards 
provide only for continuity of entitlement with no increase in rate of 
payment.
    (c) Specific exclusions. The provisions of this section do not apply 
to the following types of awards.
    (1) Surviving spouse's rate for the month of a veteran's death (for 
exception see Sec. 3.20(b))
    (2) In cases where military retired or retirement pay is greater 
than the amount of compensation payable, compensation will be paid as of 
the effective date of waiver of such pay. However, in cases where the 
amount of compensation payable is greater than military retired or 
retirement pay, payment of the available difference for any period prior 
to the effective date of total waiver of such pay is subject to the 
general provisions of this section.
    (3) Adjustments of awards--such as in the case of original or 
increased apportionments or the termination of any withholding, 
reduction, or suspension by reason of:
    (i) Recoupment,
    (ii) An offset to collect indebtedness,
    (iii) Institutionalization (hospitalization),
    (iv) Incompetency,
    (v) Incarceration,
    (vi) An estate that exceeds the limitation for certain hospitalized 
incompetent veterans, or
    (vii) Discontinuance of apportionments.
    (4) Increases resulting solely from the enactment of legislation--
such as
    (i) Cost-of-living increases in compensation or dependency and 
indemnity compensation,
    (ii) Increases in Improved Pension, parents' dependency and 
indemnity compensation, or a monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 
18 pursuant to Sec. 3.27, or
    (iii) Changes in the criteria for statutory award designations.
    (5) Temporary total ratings pursuant to paragraph 29 of the Schedule 
for Rating Disabilities when the entire period of hospitalization or 
treatment, including any period of post-hospitalization convalescence, 
commences and terminates within the same calendar month. In such cases 
the period of payment shall commence on the first day of the month in 
which the hospitalization or treatment began.

Sec. 3.32  Exchange rates for foreign currencies.

    When determining the rates of pension or parents' DIC or the amounts 
of burial, plot or headstone allowances or accrued benefits to which a 
claimant or beneficiary may be entitled, income received or expenses 
paid in a foreign currency shall be converted into U.S.

[[Page 166]]

dollar equivalents employing quarterly exchange rates established by the 
Department of the Treasury.
    (a) Pension and parents' DIC. (1) Because exchange rates for foreign 
currencies cannot be determined in advance, rates of pension and 
parents' DIC shall be projected using the most recent quarterly exchange 
rate and shall be adjusted retroactively based upon actual exchange 
rates when an annual eligibility verification report is filed.
    (2) Retroactive adjustments due to fluctuations in exchange rates 
shall be calculated using the average of the four most recent quarterly 
exchange rates. If the claimant reports income and expenses for a prior 
reporting period, the retroactive adjustment shall be calculated using 
the average of the four quarterly rates which were the most recent 
available on the closing date of the twelve-month period for which 
income and expenses are reported.
    (b) Burial, plot or headstone allowances and accrued benefits. 
Payment amounts for burial, plot or headstone allowances and claims for 
accrued benefits as reimbursement from the person who bore the expenses 
of a deceased beneficiary's last illness or burial shall be determined 
using the quarterly exchange rate for the quarter in which the expenses 
forming the basis of the claim were paid. If the claim is filed by an 
unpaid creditor, however, the quarterly rate for the quarter in which 
the veteran died shall apply. When entitlement originates during a 
quarter for which the Department of the Treasury has not yet published a 
quarterly rate, amounts due shall be calculated using the most recent 
quarterly exchange rate.

    (b) Other Philippine Scouts. Service of persons enlisted under 
section 14, Pub. L. 190, 79th Congress (Act of October 6, 1945), is 
included for compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation. 
Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 3.42 and 3.43, benefits based on 
service described in this paragraph are payable at a rate of $0.50 for 
each dollar authorized under the law. All enlistments and reenlistments 
of Philippine Scouts in the Regular Army between October 6, 1945, and 
June 30, 1947, inclusive, were made under the provisions of Pub. L. 190 
as it constituted the sole authority for such enlistments during that 
period. This paragraph does not apply to officers who were commissioned 
in connection with the administration of Pub. L. 190.

allowance, from and after the dates and hours, respectively, when they 
were called into service of the Armed Forces of the United States by 
orders issued from time to time by the General Officer, U.S. Army, 
pursuant to the Military Order of the President of the United States 
dated July 26, 1941. Service as a guerrilla under the circumstances 
outlined in paragraph (d) of this section is also included. Except as 
provided in Sec. Sec. 3.42 and 3.43, benefits based on service 
described in this paragraph are payable at a rate of $0.50 for each 
dollar authorized under the law.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 107)

    (2) Unless the record shows examination at time of entrance into the 
Armed Forces of the United States, such persons are not entitled to the 
presumption of soundness. This also applies upon reentering the Armed 
Forces after a period of inactive service.

[[Page 167]]

    (d) Guerrilla service. (1) Persons who served as guerrillas under a 
commissioned officer of the United States Army, Navy or Marine Corps, or 
under a commissioned officer of the Commonwealth Army recognized by and 
cooperating with the United States Forces are included. (See paragraph 
(c) of this section.) Service as a guerrilla by a member of the 
Philippine Scouts or the Armed Forces of the United States is considered 
as service in his or her regular status. (See paragraph (a) of this 
section.)
    (2) The following certifications by the service departments will be 
accepted as establishing guerrilla service:
    (i) Recognized guerrilla service;
    (ii) Unrecognized guerrilla service under a recognized commissioned 
officer only if the person was a former member of the United States 
Armed Forces (including the Philippine Scouts), or the Commonwealth 
Army. This excludes civilians.


A certification of Anti-Japanese Activity will not be accepted as 
establishing guerrilla service.
    (e) Combined service. Where a veteran who had Commonwealth Army or 
guerrilla service and also had other service, wartime or peacetime, in 
the Armed Forces of the United States, has disabilities which are 
compensable separately on a dollar and a $0.50 for each dollar 
authorized basis, and the disabilities are combined under the authority 
contained in 38 U.S.C. 1157, the evaluation for which dollars are 
payable will be first considered and the difference between this 
evaluation and the combined evaluation will be the basis for computing 
the amount payable at the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized.

    (a) For a Regular Philippine Scout or a member of one of the regular 
components of the Philippine Commonwealth Army while serving with Armed 
Forces of United States, the period of active service will be from the 
date certified by the Armed Forces as the date of enlistment or date of 
report for active duty whichever is later to date of release from active 
duty, discharge, death, or in the case of a member of the Philippine 
Commonwealth Army June 30, 1946, whichever was earlier. Release from 
active duty includes:
    (1) Leaving one's organization in anticipation of or due to the 
capitulation.
    (2) Escape from prisoner-of-war status.
    (3) Parole by the Japanese.
    (4) Beginning of missing-in-action status, except where factually 
shown at that time he was with his or her unit or death is presumed to 
have occurred while carried in such status: Provided, however, That 
where there is credible evidence that he was alive after commencement of 
his or her missing-in-action status, the presumption of death will not 
apply for Department of Veterans Affairs purposes.
    (5) Capitulation on May 6, 1942, except that periods of recognized 
guerrilla service or unrecognized guerrilla service under a recognized 
commissioned officer or periods of service in units which continued 
organized resistance against Japanese prior to formal capitulation will 
be considered return to active duty for period of such service.
    (b) Active service of a Regular Philippine Scout or a member of the 
Philippine Commonwealth Army serving with the Armed Forces of the United 
States will include a prisoner-of-war status immediately following a 
period of active duty, or a period of recognized guerrilla service or 
unrecognized guerrilla service under a recognized commissioned officer. 
In those cases where following release from active duty as set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the veteran is factually found by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to have been injured or killed by the 
Japanese because of anti-Japanese activities or his or her former 
service in the Armed Forces of the United States, such injury or death 
may be held to have been incurred in active service for Department of 
Veterans Affairs purposes. Determination shall be based on all available 
evidence, including service department reports, and consideration shall 
be given to the character

[[Page 168]]

and length of the veteran's former active service in the Armed Forces of 
the United States.
    (c) A prisoner-of-war status based upon arrest during general 
zonification will not be sufficient of itself to bring a case within the 
definition of return to military control.
    (d) The active service of members of the irregular forces guerrilla 
will be the period certified by the service department.

    (4) Lawfully admitted for permanent residence means that an 
individual has been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing 
permanently in the U.S. as an immigrant by the U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services under title 8, United States Code, and still has 
this status.
    (b) Eligibility requirements. Compensation and dependency and 
indemnity compensation is payable at the full-dollar rate, based on 
service described in Sec. 3.40(b), (c), or (d), to a veteran or a 
veteran's survivor who is residing in the U.S. and is either:
    (1) A citizen of the U.S., or
    (2) An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.
    (c) Evidence of eligibility. (1) A valid original or copy of one of

veteran's survivor is a natural born citizen of the U.S.:
    (i) A valid U.S. passport;
    (ii) A birth certificate showing that he or she was born in the 
U.S.; or
    (iii) A Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the U.S. issued by a

    (2) Only verification by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services to VA that a veteran or a veteran's survivor is a naturalized 
citizen of the U.S., or a valid U.S. passport, will be sufficient proof 
of such status.
    (3) Only verification by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services to VA that a veteran or a veteran's survivor is an alien 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. will be sufficient 
proof of such status.
    (4) VA will not pay benefits at the full-dollar rate under this 
section unless the evidence establishes that the veteran or survivor is 
lawfully residing in the U.S.
    (i) Such evidence should identify the veteran's or survivor's name 
and relevant dates, and may include:
    (A) A valid driver's license issued by the state of residence;
    (B) Employment records, which may consist of pay stubs, W-2 forms,

least 183 days of each calendar year in which he or she receives 
payments at the full-dollar rate, and may not be absent from the U.S. 
for more than 60 consecutive days at a time unless good cause is shown. 
However, if a veteran or a veteran's survivor becomes eligible for full-
dollar rate benefits for the first time on or after July 1 of any 
calendar year, the 183-day rule will not apply during that calendar 
year. VA will not consider a veteran or a veteran's survivor to have 
been absent from the U.S. if he or she left and returned to the U.S. on 
the same date.
    (2) A veteran or a veteran's survivor receiving benefits at the 
full-dollar rate under this section must notify VA within 30 days of 
leaving the U.S., or within 30 days of losing either his or her U.S. 
citizenship or lawful permanent resident alien status. When a veteran or 
a veteran's survivor no longer meets the eligibility requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section, VA will reduce his or her payment to the 
rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized under the law, effective on the 
date determined under Sec. 3.505. If such veteran or survivor regains 
his or her U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident alien status, 
VA will restore full-dollar rate benefits, effective the date the 
veteran or survivor meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (3) When requested to do so by VA, a veteran or survivor receiving 
benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section must verify that he 
or she continues to meet the residency and citizenship or permanent 
resident alien status requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. VA 
will advise the veteran or survivor at the time of the request that the 
verification must be furnished within 60 days and that failure to do so 
will result in the reduction of benefits. If the veteran or survivor 
fails to furnish the evidence within 60 days, VA will reduce his or her 
payment to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized, as provided in 
Sec. 3.652.
    (4) A veteran or survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate 
under this section must promptly notify VA of any change in his or her 
address. If mail from VA to the veteran or survivor is returned to VA by 
the U.S. Postal Service, VA will make reasonable efforts to determine 
the correct mailing address. If VA is unable to determine the correct 
mailing address through reasonable efforts, VA will reduce benefit 
payments to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized under law, 
effective on the date determined under Sec. 3.505.
    (e) Effective date for restored eligibility. In the case of a 
veteran or survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate, if VA 
reduces his or her payment to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar 
authorized under the law, VA will resume payments at the full-dollar 
rate, if otherwise in order, effective the first day of the month 
following the date on which he or she again meets the requirements. 
However, such increased payments will be retroactive no more than one 
year prior to the date on which VA receives evidence that he or she 
again meets the requirements.

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (2) Residing in the U.S. means an individual's principal, actual 
dwelling place was in the U.S. When death occurs outside the U.S., VA 
will consider the deceased individual to have been residing in the U.S. 
on the date of death if the individual maintained his or her principal 
actual dwelling place in the U.S. until his or her most recent departure 
from the U.S., and he or she had been physically absent from the U.S.

United States Code, or through naturalization, and has not renounced his 
or her U.S. citizenship, or had such citizenship cancelled, revoked, or 
otherwise terminated.
    (4) Lawfully admitted for permanent residence means that the 
individual was lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently 
in the U.S. as an immigrant by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services under title 8, United States Code, and on the date of death, 
still had this status.
    (b) Eligibility requirements. VA will pay burial benefits under 
chapter 23 of title 38, United States Code, at the full-dollar rate, 
based on service described in Sec. 3.40(c) or (d), when an individual 
who performed such service dies after November 1, 2000, or based on 
service described in Sec. 3.40(b) when an individual who performed such 
service dies after December 15, 2003, and was on the date of death:

eligible for pension if the veteran's service had been deemed to be 
active military, naval, or air service.

    (ii) A birth certificate showing that he or she was born in the 
U.S.; or
    (iii) A Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the U.S. issued by a

    (2) In a claim based on the deceased veteran having been a 
naturalized citizen of the U.S., only verification of that status by the 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to VA, or a valid U.S. 
passport, will be sufficient proof for purposes of eligibility for full-
dollar rate benefits.
    (3) In a claim based on the deceased veteran having been an alien 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S., only verification 
of that status by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to VA 
will be sufficient proof for purposes of eligibility for full-dollar 
rate benefits.
    (4) VA will not pay benefits at the full-dollar rate under this 
section unless the evidence establishes that the veteran was lawfully 
residing in the U.S. on the date of death.

dates, and may include:

Sec. 3.50  Spouse and surviving spouse.

    (a) Spouse. ``Spouse'' means a person of the opposite sex whose 
marriage to the veteran meets the requirements of Sec. 3.1(j).
    (b) Surviving spouse. Except as provided in Sec. 3.52, ``surviving 
spouse'' means a person of the opposite sex

[[Page 171]]

whose marriage to the veteran meets the requirements of Sec. 3.1(j) and 
who was the spouse of the veteran at the time of the veteran's death 
and:
    (1) Who lived with the veteran continuously from the date of 
marriage to the date of the veteran's death except where there was a 
separation which was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, the 
veteran without the fault of the spouse; and
    (2) Except as provided in Sec. 3.55, has not remarried or has not 
since the death of the veteran and after September 19, 1962, lived with 
another person of the opposite sex and held himself or herself out

[62 FR 5529, Feb. 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 3.52  Marriages deemed valid.

    Where an attempted marriage of a claimant to the veteran was invalid 
by reason of a legal impediment, the marriage will nevertheless be 
deemed valid if:
    (a) The marriage occurred 1 year or more before the veteran died or 
existed for any period of time if a child was born of the purported 
marriage or was born to them before such marriage (see Sec. 3.54(d)), 
and
    (b) The claimant entered into the marriage without knowledge of the 
impediment, and
    (c) The claimant cohabited with the veteran continuously from the 
date of marriage to the date of his or her death as outlined in Sec.

<R05>
Sec. 3.53  Continuous cohabitation.

    (a) General. The requirement that there must be continuous 
cohabitation from the date of marriage to the date of death of the 
veteran will be considered as having been met when the evidence shows 
that any separation was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, the 
veteran without the fault of the surviving spouse. Temporary separations 
which ordinarily occur, including those caused for the time being 
through fault of either party, will not break the continuity of the 
cohabitation.
    (b) Findings of fact. The statement of the surviving spouse as to 
the reason for the separation will be accepted in the absence of 
contradictory information. If the evidence establishes that the 
separation was by mutual consent and that the parties lived apart for 
purposes of convenience, health, business, or any other reason which did 
not show an intent on the part of the surviving spouse to desert the 
veteran, the continuity of the cohabitation will not be considered as 
having been broken. State laws will not control in determining questions 
of desertion; however, due weight will be given to findings of fact in 
court decisions made during the life of the veteran on issues 
subsequently involved in the application of this section.

the Department of Veterans Affairs in effect on December 31, 1957, or

    (1) Before the expiration of 15 years after termination of the 
period of service in which the injury or disease which caused the 
veteran's death was incurred or aggravated, or
    (2) One year or more, or

period of service in which the injury or disease causing the death of

or after the date of the marriage on which the surviving spouse's 
entitlement is predicated. The term born to them before the marriage 
means a birth prior to the date of such marriage. Either term includes a

under the law of the jurisdiction in which the fetus was delivered.
    (e) More than one marriage to veteran. For periods commencing on or 
after January 1, 1958, where a surviving spouse has been married legally 
to a veteran more than once, the date of the original marriage will be 
used in determining whether the statutory requirement as to date of 
marriage has been met.

member of the veteran's household at the time he or she became 18 years 
of age, and who was adopted by the veteran, regardless of the age of 
such person at the time of adoption.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 101(4)(A))

    (b) Stepchild. The term means a legitimate or an illegitimate child

services or assistance for children, recurring contributions of 
sufficient size to constitute the major portion of the child's support.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 101(4))

    (d) Definition of child custody. The provisions of this paragraph 
are for the purpose of determining entitlement to improved pension under 
Sec. Sec. 3.23 and 3.24.
    (1) Custody of a child shall be considered to rest with a veteran, 
surviving spouse of a veteran or person legally responsible for the 
child's support if that person has the legal right to exercise parental 
control and responsibility for the welfare and care of the child. A 
child of the veteran residing with the veteran, surviving spouse of the 
veteran who is the child's natural or adoptive parent, or person legally 
responsible for the child's support shall be presumed to be in the 
custody of that individual. Where the veteran, surviving spouse, or 
person legally responsible for the child's support has not been divested

the child shall be considered in the custody of the individual for 
purposes of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits.

means a person who is under a legally imposed obligation (e.g., by 
statute or court order) to provide for the child's support, as well as a 
natural or adoptive parent who has not been divested of legal custody. 
If the child's natural or adoptive parent has remarried, the stepparent 
may also be considered a person legally responsible for the child's 
support. A child shall be considered in the joint custody of his or her 
stepparent and natural or adoptive parent so long as the natural or 
adoptive parent and the stepparent are not estranged and residing apart, 
and the natural or adoptive parent has not been divested of legal 
custody. When a child is in such joint custody the combined income of 
the natural or adoptive parent and the stepparent shall be included as 
income of the person legally responsible for support under Sec. 
3.24(c).
    (3) A person having custody of a child prior to the time the child 
attains age 18 shall be considered to retain custody of the child for 
periods on and after the child's 18th birthday, unless the person is 
divested of legal custody. This applies without regard to when a child 
reaches the age of majority under applicable State law. This also 
applies without regard to whether the child was entitled to pension 
prior to age 18, or whether increased pension was payable to a veteran 
or surviving spouse on behalf of the child prior to the child's 18th 
birthday. If the child's custodian dies after the child has attained age 
18, the child shall be considered to be in custody of a successor 
custodian provided the successor custodian has the right to exercise 
parental control and responsibility for the welfare and care of the 
child.

    (e) Child adopted under foreign law--(1) General. The provisions of 
this paragraph are applicable to a person adopted under the laws of any 
jurisdiction other than a State. The term State is defined in 38 U.S.C. 
101(20) and also includes the Commonwealth of the

[[Page 176]]

Northern Mariana Islands. The term veteran includes, for the purposes of 
this paragraph, a Commonwealth Army veteran or new Philippine Scout as 
defined in 38 U.S.C. 3566.
    (2) Adopted child of living veteran. A person residing outside any 
of the States shall not be considered to be a legally adopted child of a 
veteran during the lifetime of the veteran unless all of the following 
conditions are met.
    (i) The person was less than 18 years of age at the time of 
adoption.
    (ii) The person is receiving one-half or more of the person's 
support from the veteran.
    (iii) The person is not in the custody of the person's natural 
parent unless the natural parent is the veteran's spouse.
    (iv) The person is residing with the veteran (or in the case of 
divorce following adoption, with the divorced spouse who is also a 
natural or adoptive parent) except for periods during which the person 
is residing apart from the veteran for purposes of full-time attendance 
at an educational institution or during which the person or the veteran 
is confined in a hospital, nursing home, other health-care facility, or 
other institution.
    (3) Adopted child of deceased veteran. A person shall not be 
considered to have been a legally adopted child of a veteran as of the 
date of the veteran's death and thereafter unless one of the following 
conditions is met.
    (i) The veteran was entitled to and was receiving for the person a 
dependent's allowance or similar monetary benefit payable under title 
38, United States Code at any time within the 1-year period immediately 
preceding the veteran's death; or
    (ii) The person met the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section for a period of at least 1 year prior to the veteran's death.
    (4) Verification. In the case of an adopted child of a living 
veteran, the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of 
this section are for prospective application. That is, in addition to 
meeting all of the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section at 
the time of initial adjudication, benefits are not payable thereafter 
for or to a child adopted under the laws of any jurisdiction other than 
a State unless the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) 
of this section continue to be met. Consequently, whenever Department of 
Veterans Affairs benefits are payable to or for a child adopted under 
the laws of any jurisdiction other than a State, and the veteran who 
adopted the child is living, the beneficiary shall submit, upon 
Department of Veterans Affairs request, a report, or other evidence, to 
determine if the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) 
of this section were met for any period for which payment was made for 
or to the child and whether such requirements will continue to be met 
for future entitlement periods. Failure to submit the requested report 
or evidence within a reasonable time from date of request may result in 
termination of benefits payable for or to the child.

    (a) Authority is delegated to the Under Secretary for Benefits and 
to supervisory or adjudicative personnel within the jurisdiction of the 
Veterans Benefits Administration designated by the Under Secretary to 
make findings and decisions under the applicable laws, regulations, 
precedents, and instructions, as to entitlement of claimants to benefits

dependents, within the jurisdiction of Compensation and Pension Service.

Service, and to personnel of that service designated by him to determine 
whether a claimant or payee has forfeited the right to gratuitious 
benefits or to remit a prior forfeiture pursuant to the provisions of 38 
U.S.C. 6103 or 6104. See Sec. 3.905.

Sec. 3.102  Reasonable doubt.

    It is the defined and consistently applied policy of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs to administer the law under a broad interpretation, 
consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case. When, after 
careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable 
doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability, or any 
other point, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. By 
reasonable doubt is meant one which exists because of an approximate 
balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily 
prove or disprove the claim. It is a substantial doubt and one within 
the range of probability as distinguished from pure speculation or 
remote possibility. It is not a means of reconciling actual conflict or 
a contradiction in the evidence. Mere suspicion or doubt as to the truth 
of any statements submitted, as distinguished from impeachment or 
contradiction by evidence or known facts, is not justifiable basis for 
denying the application of the reasonable doubt doctrine if the entire, 
complete record otherwise warrants invoking this doctrine. The 
reasonable doubt doctrine is also applicable even in the absence of 
official records, particularly if the basic incident allegedly arose 
under combat, or similarly strenuous conditions, and is consistent with 
the probable results of such known hardships.

<R05>
Sec. 3.103  Procedural due process and appellate rights.

    (a) Statement of policy. Every claimant has the right to written 
notice of the decision made on his or her claim, the right to a hearing, 
and the right of representation. Proceedings before VA

[[Page 178]]

are ex parte in nature, and it is the obligation of VA to assist a 
claimant in developing the facts pertinent to the claim and to render a 
decision which grants every benefit that can be supported in law while 
protecting the interests of the Government. The provisions of this 
section apply to all claims for benefits and relief, and decisions 
thereon, within the purview of this part 3.
    (b) The right to notice--(1) General. Claimants and their 
representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA 
affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief. Such notice 
shall clearly set forth the decision made, any applicable effective 
date, the reason(s) for the decision, the right to a hearing on any 
issue involved in the claim, the right of representation and the right, 
as well as the necessary procedures and time limits, to initiate an 
appeal of the decision.
    (2) Advance notice and opportunity for hearing. Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, no award of compensation, 
pension or dependency and indemnity compensation shall be terminated, 
reduced or otherwise adversely affected unless the beneficiary has been 
notified of such adverse action and has been provided a period of 60 
days in which to submit evidence for the purpose of showing that the 
adverse action should not be taken.
    (3) Exceptions. In lieu of advance notice and opportunity for a 
hearing, VA will send a written notice to the beneficiary or his or her 
fiduciary at the same time it takes an adverse action under the 
following circumstances:
    (i) An adverse action based solely on factual and unambiguous 
information or statements as to income, net worth, or dependency or 
marital status that the beneficiary or his or her fiduciary provided to 
VA in writing or orally (under the procedures set forth in Sec. 
3.217(b)), with knowledge or notice that such information would be used 
to calculate benefit amounts.
    (ii) An adverse action based upon the beneficiary's or fiduciary's 
failure to return a required eligibility verification report.
    (iii) Evidence reasonably indicates that a beneficiary is deceased. 
However, in the event that VA has received a death certificate, a 
terminal hospital report verifying the death of a beneficiary or a claim 
for VA burial benefits, no notice of termination (contemporaneous or 
otherwise) will be required.
    (iv) An adverse action based upon a written and signed statement 
provided by the beneficiary to VA renouncing VA benefits (see Sec. 
3.106 on renouncement).
    (v) An adverse action based upon a written statement provided to VA 
by a veteran indicating that he or she has returned to active service, 
the nature of that service, and the date of reentry into service, with 
the knowledge or notice that receipt of active service pay precludes 
concurrent receipt of VA compensation or pension (see Sec. 3.654 
regarding active service pay).
    (vi) An adverse action based upon a garnishment order issued under 
42 U.S.C. 659(a).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a))

    (4) Restoration of benefits. VA will restore retroactively benefits 
that were reduced, terminated, or otherwise adversely affected based on 
oral information or statements if within 30 days of the date on which VA 
issues the notification of adverse action the beneficiary or his or her 
fiduciary asserts that the adverse action was based upon information or 
statements that were inaccurate or upon information that was not 
provided by the beneficiary or his or her fiduciary. This will not 
preclude VA from taking subsequent action that adversely affects 
benefits.
    (c) The right to a hearing. (1) Upon request, a claimant is entitled 
to a hearing at any time on any issue involved in a claim within the 
purview of part 3 of this chapter, subject to the limitations described 
in Sec. 20.1304 of this chapter with respect to hearings in claims 
which have been certified to the Board of Veterans Appeals for appellate 
review. VA will provide the place of hearing in the VA office having 
original jurisdiction over the claim or at the VA office nearest the 
claimant's home having adjudicative functions, or, subject to available 
resources and solely at the

[[Page 179]]

option of VA, at any other VA facility or federal building at which 
suitable hearing facilities are available. VA will provide one or more 
employees who have original determinative authority of such issues to 
conduct the hearing and be responsible for establishment and 
preservation of the hearing record. Hearings in connection with proposed 
adverse actions and appeals shall be held before one or more VA 
employees having original determinative authority who did not 
participate in the proposed action or the decision being appealed. All 
expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with the hearing are the 
responsibility of the claimant.
    (2) The purpose of a hearing is to permit the claimant to introduce 
into the record, in person, any available evidence which he or she 
considers material and any arguments or contentions with respect to the 
facts and applicable law which he or she may consider pertinent. All 
testimony will be under oath or affirmation. The claimant is entitled to 
produce witnesses, but the claimant and witnesses are expected to be 
present. The Veterans Benefits Administration will not normally schedule 
a hearing for the sole purpose of receiving argument from a 
representative. It is the responsibility of the VA employee or employees 
conducting the hearings to explain fully the issues and suggest the 
submission of evidence which the claimant may have overlooked and which 
would be of advantage to the claimant's position. To assure clarity and 
completeness of the hearing record, questions which are directed to the 
claimant and to witnesses are to be framed to explore fully the basis 
for claimed entitlement rather than with an intent to refute evidence or 
to discredit testimony. In cases in which the nature, origin, or degree 
of disability is in issue, the claimant may request visual examination 
by a physician designated by VA and the physician's observations will be 
read into the record.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (d) Submission of evidence. Any evidence whether documentary, 
testimonial, or in other form, offered by the claimant in support of a 
claim and any issue a claimant may raise and any contention or argument 
a claimant may offer with respect thereto are to be included in the 
records.
    (e) The right to representation. Subject to the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 14.626 through 14.637 of this title, claimants are entitled 
to representation of their choice at every stage in the prosecution of a 
claim.
    (f) Notification of decisions. The claimant or beneficiary and his 
or her representative will be notified in writing of decisions affecting 
the payment of benefits or granting relief. All notifications will 
advise the claimant of the reason for the decision; the date the 
decision will be effective; the right to a hearing subject to paragraph 
(c) of this section; the right to initiate an appeal by filing a Notice 
of Disagreement which will entitle the individual to a Statement of the 
Case for assistance in perfecting an appeal; and the periods in which an 
appeal must be initiated and perfected (See part 20 of this chapter, on 
appeals). Further, any notice that VA has denied a benefit sought will 
include a summary of the evidence considered.

evidence on file at the time VA issues written notification in

shall not be subject to revision on the same factual basis except by 
duly constituted appellate authorities or except as provided in Sec. 
3.105 and Sec. 3.2600 of this part.
    (b) Current determinations of line of duty, character of discharge, 
relationship, dependency, domestic relations questions, homicide, and 
findings of fact of death or presumptions of death

[[Page 180]]

made in accordance with existing instructions, and by application of the 
same criteria and based on the same facts, by either an Adjudication 
activity or an Insurance activity are binding one upon the other in the 
absence of clear and unmistakable error.

<R05>
Sec. 3.105  Revision of decisions.

    The provisions of this section apply except where an award was based 
on an act of commission or omission by the payee, or with his or her 
knowledge (Sec. 3.500(b)); there is a change in law or a Department of 
Veterans Affairs issue, or a change in interpretation of law or a 
Department of Veterans Affairs issue (Sec. 3.114); or the evidence 
establishes that service connection was clearly illegal. The provisions 
with respect to the date of discontinuance of benefits are applicable to 
running awards. Where the award has been suspended, and it is determined 
that no additional payments are in order, the award will be discontinued 
effective date of last payment.
    (a) Error. Previous determinations which are final and binding, 
including decisions of service connection, degree of disability, age, 
marriage, relationship, service, dependency, line of duty, and other 
issues, will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and 
unmistakable error. Where evidence establishes such error, the prior 
decision will be reversed or amended. For the purpose of authorizing 
benefits, the rating or other adjudicative decision which constitutes a 
reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable 
error has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on 
the date of the reversed decision. Except as provided in paragraphs (d) 
and (e) of this section, where an award is reduced or discontinued 
because of administrative error or error in judgment, the provisions of 
Sec. 3.500(b)(2) will apply.
    (b) Difference of opinion. Whenever an adjudicative agency is of the 
opinion that a revision or an amendment of a previous decision is 
warranted, a difference of opinion being involved rather than a clear 
and unmistakable error, the proposed revision will be recommended to 
Central Office. However, a decision may be revised under Sec. 3.2600 
without being recommended to Central Office.
    (c) Character of discharge. A determination as to character of 
discharge or line of duty which would result in discontinued entitlement 
is subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Severance of service connection. Subject to the limitations 
contained in Sec. Sec. 3.114 and 3.957, service connection will be 
severed only where evidence establishes that it is clearly and 
unmistakably erroneous (the burden of proof being upon the Government). 
(Where service connection is severed because of a change in or 
interpretation of a law or Department of Veterans Affairs issue, the 
provisions of Sec. 3.114 are for application.) A change in diagnosis 
may be accepted as a basis for severance action if the examining 
physician or physicians or other proper medical authority certifies 
that, in the light of all accumulated evidence, the diagnosis on which 
service connection was predicated is clearly erroneous. This 
certification must be accompanied by a summary of the facts, findings, 
and reasons supporting the conclusion. When severance of service 
connection is considered warranted, a rating proposing severance will be 
prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The claimant will 
be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated 
action and furnished detailed reasons therefor and will be given 60 days 
for the presentation of additional evidence to show that service 
connection should be maintained. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph 
(i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that 
period, final rating action will be taken and the award will be reduced 
or discontinued, if in order, effective the last day of the month in 
which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the 
final rating action expires.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5112(b)(6))

    (e) Reduction in evaluation--compensation. Where the reduction in 
evaluation

[[Page 181]]

of a service-connected disability or employability status is considered 
warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or 
discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, a rating 
proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth 
all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at his 
or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished 
detailed reasons therefor, and will be given 60 days for the 
presentation of additional evidence to show that compensation payments 
should be continued at their present level. Unless otherwise provided in 
paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received 
within that period, final rating action will be taken and the award will 
be reduced or discontinued effective the last day of the month in which 
a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final 
rating action expires.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5112(b)(6))

    (f) Reduction in evaluation--pension. Where a change in disability 
or employability warrants a reduction or discontinuance of pension 
payments currently being made, a rating proposing the reduction or 
discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and 
reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at his or her latest address 
of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons 
therefor, and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional 
evidence to show that pension benefits should be continued at their 
present level. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this 
section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, 
final rating action will be taken and the award will be reduced or 
discontinued effective the last day of the month in which the final 
rating action is approved.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5112(b)(5))

    (g) Reduction in evaluation--monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. 
chapter 18 for certain individuals who are children of Vietnam veterans. 
Where a reduction or discontinuance of a monetary allowance currently 
being paid under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 is considered warranted, VA will 
notify the beneficiary at his or her latest address of record of the 
proposed reduction, furnish detailed reasons therefor, and allow the 
beneficiary 60 days to present additional evidence to show that the 
monetary allowance should be continued at the present level. Unless 
otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if VA does not 
receive additional evidence within that period, it will take final 
rating action and reduce the award effective the last day of the month 
following 60 days from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the 
proposed reduction.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1822, 5112(b)(6))

    (h) Other reductions/discontinuances. Except as otherwise specified 
at Sec. 3.103(b)(3) of this part, where a reduction or discontinuance 
of benefits is warranted by reason of information received concerning 
income, net worth, dependency, or marital or other status, a proposal 
for the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all 
material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at his or 
her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished 
detailed reasons therefor, and will be given 60 days for the 
presentation of additional evidence to show that the benefits should be 
continued at their present level. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph 
(i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that 
period, final adverse action will be taken and the award will be reduced 
or discontinued effective as specified under the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 3.500 through 3.503 of this part.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5112)

    (i) Predetermination hearings. (1) In the advance written notice 
concerning proposed actions under paragraphs (d) through (h) of this 
section, the beneficiary will be informed that he or she will have an 
opportunity for a predetermination hearing, provided that a request for 
such a hearing is received by VA within 30 days from the date of the 
notice. If a timely request is received, VA will notify the beneficiary 
in writing of the time and place of the hearing at least 10 days in 
advance of the scheduled hearing date. The 10 day

[[Page 182]]

advance notice may be waived by agreement between VA and the beneficiary 
or representative. The hearing will be conducted by VA personnel who did 
not participate in the proposed adverse action and who will bear the 
decision-making responsibility. If a predetermination hearing is timely 
requested, benefit payments shall be continued at the previously 
established level pending a final determination concerning the proposed 
action.
    (2) Following the predetermination procedures specified in this 
paragraph and paragraph (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) of this section, 
whichever is applicable, final action will be taken. If a 
predetermination hearing was not requested or if the beneficiary failed 
without good cause to report for a scheduled predetermination hearing, 
the final action will be based solely upon the evidence of record. 
Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or 
hospitalization of the claimant or beneficiary, death of an immediate 
family member, etc. If a predetermination hearing was conducted, the 
final action will be based on evidence and testimony adduced at the 
hearing as well as the other evidence of record including any additional 
evidence obtained following the hearing pursuant to necessary 
development. Whether or not a predetermination hearing was conducted, a 
written notice of the final action shall be issued to the beneficiary 
and his or her representative, setting forth the reasons therefor and 
the evidence upon which it is based. Where a reduction or discontinuance 
of benefits is found warranted following consideration of any additional 
evidence submitted, the effective date of such reduction or 
discontinuance shall be as follows:
    (i) Where reduction or discontinuance was proposed under the 
provisions of paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, the effective date 
of final action shall be the last day of the month in which a 60-day 
period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final action 
expires.

Sec. 3.106  Renouncement.

    (a) Any person entitled to pension, compensation, or dependency and 
indemnity compensation under any of the laws administered by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs may renounce his or her right to that 
benefit but may not renounce less than all of the component items which 
together comprise the total amount of the benefit to which the person is 
entitled nor any fixed monetary amounts less than the full amount of 
entitlement. The renouncement will be in writing over the person's 
signature. Upon receipt of such renouncement in the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, payment of such benefits and the right thereto will be 
terminated, and such person will be denied any and all rights thereto 
from such filing.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5306(a))

    (b) The renouncement will not preclude the person from filing a new 
application for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity 
compensation at any future date. Such new application will be treated as 
an original application, and no payments will be made thereon for any 
period before the date such new application is received in the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5306(b))

    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
if a new

application for pension or parents' dependency and indemnity 
compensation is filed within one year after the date that the Department 
of Veterans Affairs receives a renouncement of that benefit, such 
application shall not be treated as an original application and benefits 
will be payable as if the renouncement had not occurred.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5306(c))

    (d) The renouncement of dependency and indemnity compensation by one 
beneficiary will not serve to increase the rate payable to any other 
beneficiary in the same class.
    (e) The renouncement of dependency and indemnity compensation by a 
surviving spouse will not serve to vest title to this benefit in 
children under the age of 18 years or to increase the rate payable to a 
child or children over the age of 18 years.

Sec. 3.107  Awards where not all dependents apply.

    Except as provided in Sec. 3.251(a)(4), in any case where claim has 
not been filed by or on behalf of all dependents who may be entitled, 
the awards (original or amended) for those dependents who have filed 
claim will be made for all periods at the rates and in the same manner 
as though there were no other dependents. However, if the file reflects 
the existence of other dependents who have not filed claim and there is 
potential entitlement to benefits for a period prior to the date of 
filing claim, the award to a person who has filed claim will be made at 
the rate which would be payable if all dependents were receiving 
benefits. If at the expiration of the period allowed, claims have not 
been filed for such dependents, the full rate will be authorized for the 
first payee.

Sec. 3.109  Time limit.

    (a) Notice of time limit for filing evidence. (1) If a claimant's 
application is incomplete, the claimant will be notified of the evidence 
necessary to complete the application. If the evidence is not received 
within 1 year from the date of such notification, pension, compensation, 
or dependency and indemnity compensation may not be paid by reason of 
that application (38 U.S.C. 5103(a)). Information concerning the 
whereabouts of a person who has filed claim is not considered evidence.
    (2) The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to original 
applications, formal or informal, and to applications for increased 
benefits by reason of increased disability, age, or the existence of a 
dependent and to applications for reopening or resumption of payments. 
If substantiating evidence is required with respect to the veracity of a 
witness or the authenticity of documentary evidence timely filed, there 
will be allowed for the submission of such evidence 1 year from the date 
of the request therefor. However, any evidence to enlarge the proofs and 
evidence originally submitted is not so included.
    (b) Extension of time limit. Time limits within which claimants or 
beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an 
adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown. Where an 
extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the action 
required of the claimant or beneficiary must be taken concurrent with or 
prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit, and 
good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have 
been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken 
sooner

than it was. Denials of time limit extensions are separately appealable 
issues.

Sec. 3.110  Computation of time limit.

    (a) In computing the time limit for any action required of a 
claimant or beneficiary, including the filing of claims or evidence 
requested by VA, the first day of the specified period will be excluded 
and the last day included. This rule is applicable in cases in which the 
time limit expires on a workday. Where the time limit would expire on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next succeeding workday will be 
included in the computation.
    (b) The first day of the specified period referred to in paragraph 
(a) of this section shall be the date of mailing of notification to the 
claimant or beneficiary of the action required and the time limit 
therefor. The date of the letter of notification shall be considered the 
date of mailing for purposes of computing time limits. As to appeals, 
see Sec. Sec. 20.302 and 20.305 of this chapter.

Sec. 3.114  Change of law or Department of Veterans Affairs issue.

    (a) Effective date of award. Where pension, compensation, dependency 
and indemnity compensation, or a monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. 
chapter 18 for an individual who is a child of a Vietnam veteran is 
awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing law, or a liberalizing 
VA issue approved by the Secretary or by the Secretary's direction, the 
effective date of such award or increase shall be fixed in accordance 
with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the effective date 
of the act or administrative issue. Where pension, compensation, 
dependency and indemnity compensation, or a monetary allowance under 38 
U.S.C. chapter 18 for an individual who is a child of a Vietnam veteran 
is awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing law or VA issue which 
became effective on or after the date of its enactment or issuance, in 
order for a claimant to be eligible for a retroactive payment under the 
provisions of this paragraph the evidence must show that the claimant 
met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the 
effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue and that such 
eligibility existed continuously from that date to the date of claim or 
administrative determination of entitlement. The provisions of this 
paragraph are applicable to original and reopened claims as well as 
claims for increase.
    (1) If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of VA within 1 year 
from the effective date of the law or VA issue, or at the request of a 
claimant received within 1 year from that date, benefits may be 
authorized from the effective date of the law or VA issue.
    (2) If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of VA more than 1 year 
after the effective date of the law or VA issue, benefits may be 
authorized for a period of 1 year prior to the date of administrative 
determination of entitlement.
    (3) If a claim is reviewed at the request of the claimant more than 
1 year after the effective date of the law or VA issue, benefits may be 
authorized for a period of 1 year prior to the date of receipt of such 
request.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1822, 5110(g))

    (b) Discontinuance of benefits. Where the reduction or 
discontinuance of an award is in order because of a change in law or a 
Department of Veterans Affairs issue, or because of a change in 
interpretation of a law or Department of Veterans Affairs issue, the 
payee will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the 
contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor, and will be 
given 60 days for

[[Page 185]]

the presentation of additional evidence. If additional evidence is not 
received within that period, the award will be reduced or discontinued 
effective the last day of the month in which the 60-day period expired.

however, shall include a certification that the information is necessary 
for the proper administration of benefits programs under the laws 
administered by the Secretary, and cannot be obtained by a reasonable 
search of records and information of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (b) Information received pursuant to a request referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall not be used for any purpose other 
than the administration of benefits programs under the laws administered

Affairs, the appropriate application form will be furnished.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5102)

    (b) Upon receipt of notice of death of a veteran, the appropriate 
application form will be forwarded for execution by or on behalf of any 
dependent who has apparent entitlement to pension, compensation, or 
dependency and indemnity compensation. If it is not indicated that any 
person would be entitled to such benefits, but there is payable an 
accrued benefit not paid during the veteran's lifetime, the appropriate 
application form will be forwarded to the preferred dependent. Notice of 
the time limit will be included in letters forwarding applications for 
benefits.
    (c) When disability or death is due to Department of Veterans 
Affairs hospital treatment, training, medical or surgical treatment, or 
examination, a specific application for benefits will not be initiated.

Sec. 3.151  Claims for disability benefits.

    (a) General. A specific claim in the form prescribed by the 
Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any 
individual under the laws administered by VA. (38 U.S.C. 5101(a)). A 
claim by a veteran for compensation may be considered to be a claim for 
pension; and a claim by a veteran for pension may be considered to be a 
claim for compensation. The greater benefit will be awarded, unless the 
claimant specifically elects the lesser benefit.
    (b) Retroactive disability pension claims. Where disability pension 
entitlement is established based on a claim received by VA on or after 
October 1, 1984, the pension award may not be effective prior to the 
date of receipt of the pension claim unless the veteran specifically 
claims entitlement to retroactive benefits. The claim for retroactivity 
may be filed separately or included in the claim for disability pension, 
but it must be received by VA within one year from the date on which the 
veteran became permanently and totally disabled. Additional requirements 
for entitlement to a retroactive pension award are contained in Sec. 
3.400(b) of this part.

must be filed in order for death benefits to be paid to any individual 
under the laws administered by VA. (See Sec. 3.400(c) concerning 
effective dates of awards.)


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5101(a))

    (b)(1) A claim by a surviving spouse or child for compensation or 
dependency and indemnity compensation will also be considered to be a 
claim for death pension and accrued benefits, and a claim by a surviving 
spouse or child for death pension will be considered to be a claim for 
death compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation and accrued 
benefits.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5101(b)(1))

    (2) A claim by a parent for compensation or dependency and indemnity 
compensation will also be considered to be a claim for accrued benefits.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5101(b)(2))

    (c)(1) Where a child's entitlement to dependency and indemnity 
compensation arises by reason of termination of a surviving spouse's 
right to dependency and indemnity compensation or by reason of attaining 
the age of 18 years, a claim will be required. (38 U.S.C. 5110(e).) (See 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section.) Where the award to the surviving 
spouse is terminated by reason of her or his death, a claim for the 
child will be considered a claim for any accrued benefits which may be 
payable.
    (2) A claim filed by a surviving spouse who does not have 
entitlement will be accepted as a claim for a child or children in her 
or his custody named in the claim.
    (3) Where a claim of a surviving spouse is disallowed for any reason 
whatsoever and where evidence requested in order to determine 
entitlement from a child or children named in the surviving spouse's 
claim is submitted within 1 year from the date of request, requested 
either before or after disallowance of the surviving spouse's claim, an 
award for the child or children will be made as though the disallowed 
claim had been filed solely on their behalf. Otherwise, payments may not 
be made for the child or children for any period prior to the date of 
receipt of a new claim.
    (4) Where payments of pension, compensation or dependency and 
indemnity compensation to a surviving spouse have been discontinued 
because of remarriage or death, or a child becomes eligible for 
dependency and indemnity compensation by reason of attaining the age of 
18 years, and any necessary evidence is submitted within 1 year from 
date of request, an award for the child or children named in the 
surviving spouse's claim will be made on the basis of the surviving 
spouse's claim having been converted to a claim on behalf of the child. 
Otherwise, payments may not be made for any period prior to the date of 
receipt of a new claim.

one or more benefits under the laws administered by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, from a claimant, his or her duly authorized 
representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next 
friend of a claimant who is not sui juris may be considered an informal 
claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon 
receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an 
application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If 
received within 1 year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it 
will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal 
claim.
    (b) A communication received from a service organization, an 
attorney, or agent may not be accepted as an informal claim if a power 
of attorney was not executed at the time the communication was written.
    (c) When a claim has been filed which meets the requirements of

Sec. 3.156  New and material evidence.

    (a) General. A claimant may reopen a finally adjudicated claim by 
submitting new and material evidence. New evidence means existing 
evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. Material 
evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with 
previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary 
to substantiate the claim. New and material evidence can be neither 
cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the 
last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened, and must 
raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 5103A(f), 5108)

    (b) Pending claim. New and material evidence received prior to the 
expiration of the appeal period, or prior to the appellate decision if a 
timely appeal has been filed (including evidence received prior to an 
appellate decision and referred to the agency of original jurisdiction 
by the Board of Veterans Appeals without consideration in that decision 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 20.1304(b)(1) of this 
chapter), will be considered as having been filed in connection with the 
claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period.

    (c) Service department records. (1) Notwithstanding any other 
section in this part, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, 
if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official 
service department records that existed and had not been associated with 
the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the 
claim, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section. Such records 
include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Service records that are related to a claimed in-service event, 
injury, or disease, regardless of whether such records mention the 
veteran by name, as long as the other requirements of paragraph (c) of 
this section are met;
    (ii) Additional service records forwarded by the Department of 
Defense or the service department to VA any time after VA's original 
request for service records; and
    (iii) Declassified records that could not have been obtained because 
the records were classified when VA decided the claim.
    (2) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to records that 
VA

[[Page 188]]

could not have obtained when it decided the claim because the records 
did not exist when VA decided the claim, or because the claimant failed 
to provide sufficient information for VA to identify and obtain the 
records from the respective service department, the Joint Services 
Records Research Center, or from any other official source.
    (3) An award made based all or in part on the records identified by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section is effective on the date entitlement 
arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is 
later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this 
part applicable to the previously decided claim.
    (4) A retroactive evaluation of disability resulting from disease or 
injury subsequently service connected on the basis of the new evidence 
from the service department must be supported adequately by medical 
evidence. Where such records clearly support the assignment of a 
specific rating over a part or the entire period of time involved, a 
retroactive evaluation will be assigned accordingly, except as it may be 
affected by the filing date of the original claim.

Sec. 3.157  Report of examination or hospitalization as claim for increase or to reopen.

    (a) General. Effective date of pension or compensation benefits, if 
otherwise in order, will be the date of receipt of a claim or the date 
when entitlement arose, whichever is the later. A report of examination 
or hospitalization which meets the requirements of this section will be 
accepted as an informal claim for benefits under an existing law or for 
benefits under a liberalizing law or Department of Veterans Affairs 
issue, if the report relates to a disability which may establish 
entitlement. Acceptance of a report of examination or treatment as a 
claim for increase or to reopen is subject to the requirements of Sec. 
3.114 with respect to action on Department of Veterans Affairs 
initiative or at the request of the claimant and the payment of 
retroactive benefits from the date of the report or for a period of 1 
year prior to the date of receipt of the report.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5110(a))

    (b) Claim. Once a formal claim for pension or compensation has been 
allowed or a formal claim for compensation disallowed for the reason 
that the service-connected disability is not compensable in degree, 
receipt of one of the following will be accepted as an informal claim 
for increased benefits or an informal claim to reopen. In addition, 
receipt of one of the following will be accepted as an informal claim in 
the case of a retired member of a uniformed service whose formal claim 
for pension or compensation has been disallowed because of receipt of 
retirement pay. The evidence listed will also be accepted as an informal 
claim for pension previously denied for the reason the disability was 
not permanently and totally disabling.
    (1) Report of examination or hospitalization by Department of 
Veterans Affairs or uniformed services. The date of outpatient or 
hospital examination or date of admission to a VA or uniformed services 
hospital will be accepted as the date of receipt of a claim. The date of 
a uniformed service examination which is the basis for granting 
severance pay to a former member of the Armed Forces on the temporary 
disability retired list will be accepted as the date of receipt of 
claim. The date of admission to a non-VA hospital where a veteran was 
maintained at VA expense will be accepted as the date of receipt of a 
claim, if VA maintenance was previously authorized; but if VA 
maintenance was authorized subsequent to admission, the date VA received 
notice of admission will be accepted. The provisions of this paragraph 
apply only when such reports relate to examination or treatment of a 
disability for which service-connection has previously been established 
or when a claim specifying the benefit sought is received within one 
year from

[[Page 189]]

the date of such examination, treatment or hospital admission.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (2) Evidence from a private physician or layman. The date of receipt 
of such evidence will be accepted when the evidence furnished by or in 
behalf of the claimant is within the competence of the physician or lay 
person and shows the reasonable probability of entitlement to benefits.
    (3) State and other institutions. When submitted by or on behalf of 
the veteran and entitlement is shown, date of receipt by the Department 
of Veterans Affairs of examination reports, clinical records, and 
transcripts of records will be accepted as the date of receipt of a 
claim if received from State, county, municipal, recognized private 
institutions, or other Government hospitals (except those described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section). These records must be authenticated 
by an appropriate official of the institution. Benefits will be granted 
if the records are adequate for rating purposes; otherwise findings will 
be verified by official examination. Reports received from private 
institutions not listed by the American Hospital Association must be 
certified by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs or physician designee.

Sec. 3.158  Abandoned claims.

    (a) General. Except as provided in Sec. 3.652 of this part, where 
evidence requested in connection with an original claim, a claim for 
increase or to reopen or for the purpose of determining continued 
entitlement is not furnished within 1 year after the date of request, 
the claim will be considered abandoned. After the expiration of 1 year, 
further action will not be taken unless a new claim is received. Should 
the right to benefits be finally established, pension, compensation, 
dependency and indemnity compensation, or monetary allowance under the 
provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 based on such evidence shall commence 
not earlier than the date of filing the new claim.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (b) Department of Veterans Affairs examinations. Where the veteran 
fails without adequate reason to respond to an order to report for 
Department of Veterans Affairs examination within 1 year from the date 
of request and payments have been discontinued, the claim for such 
benefits will be considered abandoned.
    (c) Disappearance. Where payments of pension, compensation, 
dependency and indemnity compensation, or monetary allowance under the 
provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 have not been made or have been 
discontinued because a payee's present whereabouts is unknown, payments 
will be resumed effective the day following the date of last payment if 
entitlement is otherwise established, upon receipt of a valid current 
address.

Sec. 3.159  Department of Veterans Affairs assistance in developing claims.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
    (1) Competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person 
who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer 
medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. Competent medical evidence 
may also mean statements conveying sound medical principles found in 
medical treatises. It would also include statements contained in 
authoritative writings such as medical and scientific articles and 
research reports or analyses.
    (2) Competent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring that the 
proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Lay 
evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of 
facts or circumstances and conveys matters that

[[Page 190]]

can be observed and described by a lay person.
    (3) Substantially complete application means an application 
containing the claimant's name; his or her relationship to the veteran, 
if applicable; sufficient service information for VA to verify the 
claimed service, if applicable; the benefit claimed and any medical 
condition(s) on which it is based; the claimant's signature; and in 
claims for nonservice-connected disability or death pension and parents' 
dependency and indemnity compensation, a statement of income.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, event means 
one or more incidents associated with places, types, and circumstances 
of service giving rise to disability.
    (5) Information means non-evidentiary facts, such as the claimant's 
Social Security number or address; the name and military unit of a 
person who served with the veteran; or the name and address of a medical 
care provider who may have evidence pertinent to the claim.
    (b) VA's duty to notify claimants of necessary information or 
evidence. (1) When VA receives a complete or substantially complete 
application for benefits, it will notify the claimant of any information 
and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim 
(hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the ``notice''). In the 
notice, VA will inform the claimant which information and evidence, if 
any, that the claimant is to provide to VA and which information and 
evidence, if any, that VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the 
claimant. The information and evidence that the claimant is informed 
that the claimant is to provide must be provided within one year of the 
date of the notice. If the claimant has not responded to the notice 
within 30 days, VA may decide the claim prior to the expiration of the 
one-year period based on all the information and evidence contained in 
the file, including information and evidence it has obtained on behalf 
of the claimant and any VA medical examinations or medical opinions. If 
VA does so, however, and the claimant subsequently provides the 
information and evidence within one year of the date of the notice, VA 
must readjudicate the claim.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103)

    (2) If VA receives an incomplete application for benefits, it will 
notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the 
application and will defer assistance until the claimant submits this 
information.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5102(b), 5103A(3))

    (3) No duty to provide the notice described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section arises:
    (i) Upon receipt of a Notice of Disagreement; or
    (ii) When, as a matter of law, entitlement to the benefit claimed 
cannot be established.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103(a), 5103A(a)(2))

    (c) VA's duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence. Upon 
receipt of a substantially complete application for benefits, VA will 
make reasonable efforts to help a claimant obtain evidence necessary to 
substantiate the claim. In addition, VA will give the assistance 
described in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) to an individual 
attempting to reopen a finally decided claim. VA will not pay any fees 
charged by a custodian to provide records requested.
    (1) Obtaining records not in the custody of a Federal department or 
agency. VA will make reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records not 
in the custody of a Federal department or agency, to include records 
from State or local governments, private medical care providers, current 
or former employers, and other non-Federal governmental sources. Such 
reasonable efforts will generally consist of an initial request for the 
records and, if the records are not received, at least one follow-up 
request. A follow-up request is not required if a response to the 
initial request indicates that the records sought do not exist or that a 
follow-up request for the records would be futile. If VA receives 
information showing that subsequent requests to this or another 
custodian could result in obtaining the records sought, then reasonable 
efforts will include an initial request and, if

[[Page 191]]

the records are not received, at least one follow-up request to the new 
source or an additional request to the original source.
    (i) The claimant must cooperate fully with VA's reasonable efforts 
to obtain relevant records from non-Federal agency or department 
custodians. The claimant must provide enough information to identify and 
locate the existing records, including the person, company, agency, or 
other custodian holding the records; the approximate time frame covered 
by the records; and, in the case of medical treatment records, the 
condition for which treatment was provided.
    (ii) If necessary, the claimant must authorize the release of 
existing records in a form acceptable to the person, company, agency, or 
other custodian holding the records.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(b))

    (2) Obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or 
agency. VA will make as many requests as are necessary to obtain 
relevant records from a Federal department or agency. These records 
include but are not limited to military records, including service 
medical records; medical and other records from VA medical facilities; 
records from non-VA facilities providing examination or treatment at VA 
expense; and records from other Federal agencies, such as the Social 
Security Administration. VA will end its efforts to obtain records from 
a Federal department or agency only if VA concludes that the records 
sought do not exist or that further efforts to obtain those records 
would be futile. Cases in which VA may conclude that no further efforts 
are required include those in which the Federal department or agency 
advises VA that the requested records do not exist or the custodian does 
not have them.
    (i) The claimant must cooperate fully with VA's reasonable efforts 
to obtain relevant records from Federal agency or department custodians. 
If requested by VA, the claimant must provide enough information to 
identify and locate the existing records, including the custodian or 
agency holding the records; the approximate time frame covered by the 
records; and, in the case of medical treatment records, the condition 
for which treatment was provided. In the case of records requested to 
corroborate a claimed stressful event in service, the claimant must 
provide information sufficient for the records custodian to conduct a 
search of the corroborative records.
    (ii) If necessary, the claimant must authorize the release of 
existing records in a form acceptable to the custodian or agency holding 
the records.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(b))

    (3) Obtaining records in compensation claims. In a claim for 
disability compensation, VA will make efforts to obtain the claimant's 
service medical records, if relevant to the claim; other relevant 
records pertaining to the claimant's active military, naval or air 
service that are held or maintained by a governmental entity; VA medical 
records or records of examination or treatment at non-VA facilities 
authorized by VA; and any other relevant records held by any Federal 
department or agency. The claimant must provide enough information to 
identify and locate the existing records including the custodian or 
agency holding the records; the approximate time frame covered by the 
records; and, in the case of medical treatment records, the condition 
for which treatment was provided.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(c))

    (4) Providing medical examinations or obtaining medical opinions. 
(i) In a claim for disability compensation, VA will provide a medical 
examination or obtain a medical opinion based upon a review of the 
evidence of record if VA determines it is necessary to decide the claim. 
A medical examination or medical opinion is necessary if the information 
and evidence of record does not contain sufficient competent medical 
evidence to decide the claim, but:
    (A) Contains competent lay or medical evidence of a current 
diagnosed disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability;
    (B) Establishes that the veteran suffered an event, injury or 
disease in service, or has a disease or symptoms of a disease listed in 
Sec. 3.309, Sec. 3.313, Sec. 3.316, and Sec. 3.317 manifesting 
during an

[[Page 192]]

applicable presumptive period provided the claimant has the required 
service or triggering event to qualify for that presumption; and
    (C) Indicates that the claimed disability or symptoms may be 
associated with the established event, injury, or disease in service or 
with another service-connected disability.
    (ii) Paragraph (4)(i)(C) could be satisfied by competent evidence 
showing post-service treatment for a condition, or other possible 
association with military service.
    (iii) Paragraph (c)(4) applies to a claim to reopen a finally 
adjudicated claim only if new and material evidence is presented or 
secured.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(d))

    (d) Circumstances where VA will refrain from or discontinue 
providing assistance. VA will refrain from providing assistance in 
obtaining evidence for a claim if the substantially complete application 
for benefits indicates that there is no reasonable possibility that any 
assistance VA would provide to the claimant would substantiate the 
claim. VA will discontinue providing assistance in obtaining evidence 
for a claim if the evidence obtained indicates that there is no 
reasonable possibility that further assistance would substantiate the 
claim. Circumstances in which VA will refrain from or discontinue 
providing assistance in obtaining evidence include, but are not limited 
to:
    (1) The claimant's ineligibility for the benefit sought because of 
lack of qualifying service, lack of veteran status, or other lack of 
legal eligibility;
    (2) Claims that are inherently incredible or clearly lack merit; and
    (3) An application requesting a benefit to which the claimant is not 
entitled as a matter of law.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(a)(2))

    (e) Duty to notify claimant of inability to obtain records. (1) If 
VA makes reasonable efforts to obtain relevant non-Federal records but 
is unable to obtain them, or after continued efforts to obtain Federal 
records concludes that it is reasonably certain they do not exist or 
further efforts to obtain them would be futile, VA will provide the 
claimant with oral or written notice of that fact. VA will make a record 
of any oral notice conveyed to the claimant. For non-Federal records 
requests, VA may provide the notice at the same time it makes its final 
attempt to obtain the relevant records. In either case, the notice must 
contain the following information:
    (i) The identity of the records VA was unable to obtain;
    (ii) An explanation of the efforts VA made to obtain the records;
    (iii) A description of any further action VA will take regarding the 
claim, including, but not limited to, notice that VA will decide the 
claim based on the evidence of record unless the claimant submits the 
records VA was unable to obtain; and
    (iv) A notice that the claimant is ultimately responsible for 
providing the evidence.
    (2) If VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before 
deciding the claim, VA will notify the claimant of the records and 
request that the claimant provide a release for the records. If the 
claimant does not provide any necessary release of the relevant records 
that VA is unable to obtain, VA will request that the claimant obtain 
the records and provide them to VA.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5103A(b)(2))

    (f) For the purpose of the notice requirements in paragraphs (b) and 
(e) of this section, notice to the claimant means notice to the claimant 
or his or her fiduciary, if any, as well as to his or her 
representative, if any.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5102(b), 5103(a))

    (g) The authority recognized in subsection (g) of 38 U.S.C. 5103A is 
reserved to the sole discretion of the Secretary and will be 
implemented, when deemed appropriate by the Secretary, through the 
promulgation of regulations.

Sec. 3.202  Evidence from foreign countries.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where an 
affidavit or other document is required to be executed under oath before 
an official in a foreign country, the signature of that official must be 
authenticated by a United States Consular Officer in that

[[Page 194]]

jurisdiction or by the State Department. Where the United States has no 
consular representative in a foreign country, such authentication may be 
made as follows:
    (1) By a consular agent of a friendly government whereupon the 
signature and seal of the official of the friendly government may be 
authenticated by the State Department; or
    (2) By the nearest American consul who will attach a certificate 
showing the result of the investigation concerning its authenticity.
    (b) Authentication will not be required: (1) On documents approved 
by the Deputy Minister of Veterans Affairs, Department of Veterans 
Affairs, Ottawa, Canada: or
    (2) When it is indicated that the attesting officer is authorized to 
administer oaths for general purposes and the document bears his or her 
signature and seal; or
    (3) When the document is executed before a Department of Veterans 
Affairs employee authorized to administer oaths; or
    (4) When a copy of a public or church record from any foreign 
country purports to establish birth, adoption, marriage, annulment, 
divorce, or death, provided it bears the signature and seal of the 
custodian of such record and there is no conflicting evidence in the 
file which would serve to create doubt as to the correctness of the 
record; or
    (5) When a copy of the public or church record from one of the 
countries comprising the United Kingdom, namely: England, Scotland, 
Wales, or Northern Ireland, purports to establish birth, marriage, or 
death, provided it bears the signature or seal or stamp of the custodian 
of such record and there is no evidence which would serve to create 
doubt as to the correctness of the records; or
    (6) When affidavits prepared in the Republic of the Philippines are 
certified by a Department of Veterans Affairs representative located in

<R05>
Sec. 3.203  Service records as evidence of service and character of discharge.

    (a) Evidence submitted by a claimant. For the purpose of 
establishing entitlement to pension, compensation, dependency and 
indemnity compensation or burial benefits the Department of Veterans 
Affairs may accept evidence of service submitted by a claimant (or sent 
directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs by the service 
department), such as a DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge 
from Active Duty, or original Certificate of Discharge, without 
verification from the appropriate service department if the evidence 
meets the following conditions:
    (1) The evidence is a document issued by the service department. A 
copy of an original document is acceptable if the copy was issued by the 
service department or if the copy was issued by a public custodian of 
records who certifies that it is a true and exact copy of the document 
in the custodian's custody or, if the copy was submitted by an 
accredited agent, attorney or service organization representative who 
has successfully completed VA-prescribed training on military records, 
and who certifies that it is a true and exact copy of either an original 
document or of a copy issued by the service department or a public 
custodian of records; and
    (2) The document contains needed information as to length, time and 
character of service; and
    (3) In the opinion of the Department of Veterans Affairs the 
document is genuine and the information contained in it is accurate.
    (b) Additional requirements for pension claimants. In addition to 
meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a document 
submitted to establish a creditable period of wartime service for 
pension entitlement may be

[[Page 195]]

accepted without verification if the document (or other evidence of 
record) shows:
    (1) Service of 4 months or more; or
    (2) Discharge for disability incurred in line of duty; or
    (3) Ninety days creditable service based on records from the service 
department such as hospitalization for 90 days for a line of duty 
disability.
    (c) Verification from the service department. When the claimant does 
not submit evidence of service or the evidence submitted does not meet 
the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section (and paragraph (b) of 
this section in pension claims), the Department of Veterans Affairs 
shall request verification of service from the service department. 
However, payment of nonservice-connected burial benefits may be 
authorized, if otherwise in order, based upon evidence of service which 
VA relied upon to authorize payment of compensation or pension during 
the veteran's lifetime, provided that there is no evidence which would 
serve to create doubt as to the correctness of that service evidence. If 
it appears that a length of service requirement may not be met (e.g., 
the 90 days wartime service requirement to receive pension under 38 
U.S.C. 1521(j)), the Department of Veterans Affairs shall request a 
complete statement of service to determine if there are any periods of 
active service that are required to be excluded under Sec. 3.15.

Sec. 3.204  Evidence of dependents and age.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, VA 
will accept, for the purpose of determining entitlement to benefits 
under laws administered by VA, the statement of a claimant as proof of 
marriage, dissolution of a marriage, birth of a child, or death of a 
dependent, provided that the statement contains: the date (month and 
year) and place of the event; the full name and relationship of the 
other person to the claimant; and, where the claimant's dependent child 
does not reside with the claimant, the name and address of the person 
who has custody of the child. In addition, a claimant must provide the 
social security number of any dependent on whose behalf he or she is 
seeking benefits (see Sec. 3.216).
    (2) VA shall require the types of evidence indicated in Sec. Sec. 
3.205 through 3.211 where: the claimant does not reside within a state; 
the claimant's statement on its face raises a question of its validity; 
the claimant's statement conflicts with other evidence of record; or, 
there is a reasonable indication, in the claimant's statement or 
otherwise, of fraud or misrepresentation of the relationship in 
question.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5124)

    (b) Marriage or birth. The classes of evidence to be furnished for 
the purpose of establishing marriage, dissolution of marriage, age, 
relationship, or death, if required under the provisions of paragraph 
(a)(2), are indicated in Sec. Sec. 3.205 through 3.211 in the order of 
preference. Failure to furnish the higher class, however, does not 
preclude the acceptance of a lower class if the evidence furnished is 
sufficient to prove the point involved.
    (c) Acceptability of photocopies. Photocopies of documents necessary 
to establish birth, death, marriage or relationship under the provisions 
of Sec. Sec. 3.205 through 3.215 of this part are acceptable as 
evidence if the Department of Veterans Affairs is satisfied that the 
copies are genuine and free from alteration. Otherwise, VA may request a 
copy of the document certified over the signature and official seal of 
the person having custody of such record.

    (a) Proof of marriage. Marriage is established by one of the 
following types of evidence:

[[Page 196]]

    (1) Copy or abstract of the public record of marriage, or a copy of 
the church record of marriage, containing sufficient data to identify 
the parties, the date and place of marriage, and the number of prior 
marriages if shown on the official record.
    (2) Official report from service department as to marriage which 
occurred while the veteran was in service.
    (3) The affidavit of the clergyman or magistrate who officiated.
    (4) The original certificate of marriage, if the Department of 
Veterans Affairs is satisfied that it is genuine and free from 
alteration.
    (5) The affidavits or certified statements of two or more 
eyewitnesses to the ceremony.
    (6) In jurisdictions where marriages other than by ceremony are 
recognized the affidavits or certified statements of one or both of the 
parties to the marriage, if living, setting forth all of the facts and 
circumstances concerning the alleged marriage, such as the agreement 
between the parties at the beginning of their cohabitation, the period 
of cohabitation, places and dates of residences, and whether children 
were born as the result of the relationship. This evidence should be 
supplemented by affidavits or certified statements from two or more 
persons who know as the result of personal observation the reputed 
relationship which existed between the parties to the alleged marriage 
including the periods of cohabitation, places of residences, whether the 
parties held themselves out as married, and whether they were generally 
accepted as such in the communities in which they lived.
    (7) Any other secondary evidence which reasonably supports a belief 
by the Adjudicating activity that a valid marriage actually occurred.
    (b) Valid marriage. In the absence of conflicting information, proof 
of marriage which meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section together with the claimant's certified statement concerning the 
date, place and circumstances of dissolution of any prior marriage may 
be accepted as establishing a valid marriage, provided that such facts, 
if they were to be corroborated by record evidence, would warrant 
acceptance of the marriage as valid. Where necessary to a determination 
because of conflicting information or protest by a party having an 
interest therein, proof of termination of a prior marriage will be shown 
by proof of death, or a certified copy or a certified abstract of final 
decree of divorce or annulment specifically reciting the effects of the 
decree.
    (c) Marriages deemed valid. Where a surviving spouse has submitted 
proof of marriage in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and 
also meets the requirements of Sec. 3.52, the claimant's signed 
statement that he or she had no knowledge of an impediment to the 
marriage to the veteran will be accepted, in the absence of information 
to the contrary, as proof of that fact.

Sec. 3.206  Divorce.

    The validity of a divorce decree regular on its face, will be 
questioned by the Department of Veterans Affairs only when such validity 
is put in issue by a party thereto or a person whose interest in a claim 
for Department of Veterans Affairs benefits would be affected thereby. 
In cases where recognition of the decree is thus brought into question:
    (a) Where the issue is whether the veteran is single or married 
(dissolution of a subsisting marriage), there must be a bona fide 
domicile in addition to the standards of the granting jurisdiction 
respecting validity of divorce;
    (b) Where the issue is the validity of marriage to a veteran 
following a divorce, the matter of recognition of the divorce by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (including any question of bona fide 
domicile) will be determined according to the laws of the jurisdictions 
specified in Sec. 3.1(j).

[[Page 197]]

    (c) Where a foreign divorce has been granted the residents of a 
State whose laws consider such decrees to be valid, it will thereafter 
be considered as valid under the laws of the jurisdictions specified in 
Sec. 3.1(j) in the absence of a determination to the contrary by a 
court of last resort in those jurisdictions.

Sec. 3.207  Void or annulled marriage.

    Proof that a marriage was void or has been annulled should consist 
of:
    (a) Void. A certified statement from the claimant setting forth the 
circumstances which rendered the marriage void, together with such other 
evidence as may be required for a determination.
    (b) Annulled. A copy or abstract of the decree of annulment. A 
decree regular on its face will be accepted unless there is reason to 
question the basic authority of the court to render annulment decrees or 
there is evidence indicating that the annulment may have been obtained 
through fraud by either party or by collusion.

Sec. 3.209  Birth.

    Age or relationship is established by one of the following types of 
evidence. If the evidence submitted for proof of age or relationship 
indicates a difference in the name of the person as shown by other 
records, the discrepancy is to be reconciled by an affidavit or 
certified statement identifying the person having the changed name as 
the person whose name appears in the evidence of age or relationship.
    (a) A copy or abstract of the public record of birth. Such a record 
established more than 4 years after the birth will be accepted as proof 
of age or relationship if, it is not inconsistent with material of 
record with the Department of Veterans Affairs, or if it shows on its 
face that it is based upon evidence which would be acceptable under this 
section.
    (b) A copy of the church record of baptism. Such a record of baptism 
performed more than 4 years after birth will not be accepted as proof of 
age or relationship unless it is consistent with material of record with 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, which will include at least one 
reference to age or relationship made at a time when such reference was 
not essential to establishing entitlement to the benefit claimed.
    (c) Official report from the service department as to birth which 
occurred while the veteran was in service.
    (d) Affidavit or a certified statement of the physician or midwife 
in attendance at birth.
    (e) Copy of Bible or other family record certified to by a notary 
public or other officer with authority to administer oaths, who should 
state in what year the Bible or other book in which the record appears 
was printed, whether the record bears any erasures or other marks of 
alteration, and whether from the appearance of the writing he or she 
believes the entries to have been made at the time purported.
    (f) Affidavits or certified statements of two or more persons, 
preferably disinterested, who will state their ages, showing the name, 
date, and place of birth of the person whose age or relationship is 
being established, and that to their own knowledge such person is

[[Page 198]]

the child of such parents (naming the parents) and stating the source of 
their knowledge.
    (g) Other evidence which is adequate to establish the facts in 
issue, including census records, original baptismal records, hospital 
records, insurance policies, school, employment, immigration, or 
naturalization records.

<R05>
Sec. 3.210  Child's relationship.

    (a) Legitimate child. Where it is necessary to determine the 
legitimacy of a child, evidence will be required to establish the 
legality of the marriage of the mother of the child to the veteran or to 
show that the child is otherwise legitimate by State laws together with 
evidence of birth as outlined in Sec. 3.209. Where the legitimacy of a 
child is not a factor, evidence to establish legitimacy will not be 
required: Provided, That, evidence is on file which meets the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section sufficient to warrant 
recognition of the relationship of the child without regard to 
legitimacy.
    (b) Illegitimate child. As to the mother of an illegitimate child, 
proof of birth is all that is required. As to the father, the 
sufficiency of evidence will be determined in accordance with the facts 
in the individual case. Proof of such relationship will consist of:
    (1) An acknowledgment in writing signed by him; or
    (2) Evidence that he has been identified as the child's father by a 
judicial decree ordering him to contribute to the child's support or for 
other purposes; or
    (3) Any other secondary evidence which reasonably supports a finding 
of relationship, as determined by an official authorized to approve such 
findings, such as:
    (i) A copy of the public record of birth or church record of 
baptism, showing that the veteran was the informant and was named as 
parent of the child; or
    (ii) Statements of persons who know that the veteran accepted the 
child as his; or
    (iii) Information obtained from service department or public 
records, such as school or welfare agencies, which shows that with his 
knowledge the veteran was named as the father of the child.
    (c) Adopted child. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section evidence of relationship will include a copy of the decree of 
adoption or a copy of the adoptive placement agreement and such other 
evidence as may be necessary.
    (1) In jurisdictions where petition must be made to the court for 
release of adoption documents or information, or where release of such 
documents or information is prohibited, the following may be accepted to 
establish the fact of adoption:
    (i) As to a child adopted into the veteran's family, a copy of the 
child's revised birth certificate.
    (ii) As to a child adopted out of the veteran's family, a statement 
over the signature of the judge or the clerk of the court setting forth 
the child's former name and the date of adoption, or a certified 
statement by the veteran, the veteran's surviving spouse, apportionee, 
or their fiduciaries setting forth the child's former name, date of 
birth, and the date and fact of adoption together with evidence 
indicating that the child's original public record of birth has been 
removed from such records. Where application is made for an 
apportionment under Sec. 3.458(d) on behalf of a child adopted out of 
the veteran's family, the evidence must be sufficient to establish the 
veteran as the natural parent of the child.
    (2) As to a child adopted by the veteran's surviving spouse after 
the veteran's death, the statement of the adoptive parent or custodian 
of the child will be accepted in absence of information to the contrary, 
to show that the child was a member of the veteran's household at the 
date of the veteran's death and that recurring contributions were not 
being received for the child's maintenance sufficient to provide for the 
major portion of the child's support, from any person other than the 
veteran or surviving spouse or

[[Page 199]]

from any public or private welfare organization which furnished services 
or assistance to children. (Pub. L. 86-195)
    (d) Stepchild. Evidence of relationship of a stepchild will consist 
of proof of birth as outlined in Sec. 3.209, evidence of the marriage 
of the veteran to the natural parent of the child, and evidence that the 
child is a member of the veteran's household or was a member of the 
veteran's household at the date of the veteran's death.

Sec. 3.211  Death.

    Death should be established by one of the following types of 
evidence:
    (a)(1) A copy of the public record of the State or community where 
death occurred.
    (2) A copy of a coroner's report of death or a verdict of a 
coroner's jury of the State or community where death occurred, provided 
such report or verdict properly identified the deceased.
    (b) Where death occurs in a hospital or institution under the 
control of the United States Government:
    (1) A death certificate signed by a medical officer; or
    (2) A clinical summary or other report showing fact and date of 
death signed by a medical officer.
    (c) An official report of death of a member of a uniformed service 
from the Secretary of the department concerned where death occurs while 
deceased was on the retired list, in an inactive duty status, or in the 
active service.
    (d) Where death occurs abroad:
    (1) A United States consular report of death bearing the signature 
and seal of the United States consul; or
    (2) A copy of the public record of death authenticated (see Sec. 
3.202(b)(4) for exception) by the United States consul or other agency 
of the State Department; or
    (3) An official report of death from the head of the department 
concerned, where the deceased person was, at the time of death, a 
civilian employee of such department.
    (e) If the foregoing evidence cannot be furnished, the reason must 
be stated. The fact of death may then be established by the affidavits 
of persons who have personal knowledge of the fact of death, have viewed 
the body of the deceased, know it to be the body of the person whose 
death is being established, setting forth all the facts and 
circumstances concerning the death, place, date, time, and cause 
thereof.
    (f) If proof of death, as defined in paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section cannot be furnished, a finding of fact of death, where 
death is otherwise shown by competent evidence, may be made by an 
official authorized to approve such findings. Where it is indicated that 
the veteran died under circumstances which precluded recovery or 
identification of the body, the fact of death should be established by 
the best evidence, which from the nature of the case must be supposed to 
exist.
    (g) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a finding of fact of 
death made by another Federal agency will be accepted for the purposes 
of paragraph (f) of this section.

home and family for a period of 7 years or more and that a diligent 
search disclosed no evidence of his or her existence after the date of 
disappearance, and if evidence as provided in Sec. 3.211 cannot be 
furnished, the death of such individual as of the expiration of such 
period may be considered as sufficiently proved.
    (b) No State law providing for presumption of death will be 
applicable to claims for benefits under laws administered by the

Sec. 3.213  Change of status affecting entitlement.

    (a) General. For the purpose of establishing entitlement to a higher 
rate of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation 
based on the existence of a dependent, VA will require evidence which 
satisfies the requirements of Sec. 3.204. For the purpose of reducing 
or discontinuing such benefits, a statement by a claimant or payee 
setting forth the month and year of change of status which would result 
in a reduction or discontinuance of benefits to that person will be 
accepted, in the absence of contradictory information. This includes:
    (1) Veteran. A statement by the veteran setting forth the month and 
year of death of a spouse, child, or dependent parent.
    (2) Surviving spouse. A statement by the surviving spouse or 
remarried surviving spouse setting forth the month and year of 
remarriage and any change of name. (An award for a child or children who 
are otherwise entitled may be made to commence the day following the 
date of discontinuance of any payments to the surviving spouse.)
    (3) Child. A statement by the veteran or surviving spouse (where an 
additional allowance is being paid to the veteran or surviving spouse 
for a child), or fiduciary, setting forth the month and year of the 
child's death, marriage, or discontinuance of school attendance. A 
similar statement by a child who is receiving payments direct will be 
accepted to establish the child's marriage or the discontinuance of 
school attendance. Where appropriate, the month and year of 
discontinuance of school attendance will be required in addition to the 
month and year of death or marriage of a child.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (4) Parent. A statement by a parent setting forth the month and 
year:
    (i) Of marriage or remarriage;
    (ii) When two parents or a parent and spouse ceased living together;
    (iii) When two parents or a parent and spouse resumed living 
together following a period of separation;
    (iv) Of divorce or death of a spouse.
    (b) Date not reported. If the month and year of the event is not 
reported, the award will be reduced or discontinued, whichever is 
appropriate, effective date of last payment. The payee will be requested 
to furnish within 60 days from the date of request a statement setting 
forth the date of the event. Where payments are continued at a reduced 
rate, the award will be discontinued effective date of last payment if 
the required statement is not received within the 60-day period. 
Payments on a discontinued award may be resumed, if otherwise in order, 
from the date of discontinuance if the necessary information is received 
within 1 year from the date of request; otherwise from the date of 
receipt of a new claim.
    (c) Contradictory information. Where there is reason to believe that 
the event reported may have occurred at an earlier date, formal proof 
will be required.

electronic means, will satisfy a requirement or authorization that the 
statement or information be submitted in writing.

    Note to paragraph(a): Section 3.217(a) merely concerns the 
submission of information or a statement in writing. Other requirements

    (b) For purposes of this part, unless specifically provided 
otherwise, VA may take action affecting entitlement to benefits based on 
oral or written information or statements provided to VA by a

based on oral information or statements unless the VA employee receiving 
the information meets the following conditions:
    (1) During the conversation in which the information or statement is 
provided, the VA employee:
    (i) Identifies himself or herself as a VA employee who is authorized 
to receive the information or statement (these are VA employees 
authorized to take actions under Sec. Sec. 2.3 or 3.100 of this 
chapter);
    (ii) Verifies the identity of the provider as either the beneficiary 
or his or her fiduciary by obtaining specific information about the 
beneficiary that can be verified from the beneficiary's VA records, such 
as Social Security number, date of birth, branch of military service, 
dates of military service, or other information; and

[[Page 202]]

    (iii) Informs the provider that the information or statement will be 
used for the purpose of calculating benefit amounts; and
    (2) During or following the conversation in which the information or 
statement is provided, the VA employee documents in the beneficiary's VA 
records the specific information or statement provided, the date such 
information or statement was provided, the identity of the provider, the 
steps taken to verify the identity of the provider as being either the 
beneficiary or his or her fiduciary, and that he or she informed the 
provider that the information would be used for the purpose of

  Regulations Applicable to Programs in Effect Prior to January 1, 1979


<R05>
Sec. 3.250  Dependency of parents; compensation.

    (a) Income--(1) Conclusive dependency. Dependency of a parent (other 
than one who is residing in a foreign country) will be held to exist 
where the monthy income does not exceed:
    (i) $400 for a mother or father not living together;
    (ii) $660 for a mother and father, or remarried parent and spouse, 
living together:
    (iii) $185 for each additional ``member of the family'' as defined 
in paragraph (b)(2).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 102(a))

    (2) Excess income. Where the income exceeds the monthly amounts 
stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section dependency will be determined 
on the facts in the individual case under the principles outlined in 
paragraph (b) of this section. In such cases, dependency will not be 
held to exist if it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of the 
claimant's estate be consumed for his or her maintenance.
    (3) Foreign residents. There is no conclusive presumption of 
dependency. Dependency will be determined on the facts in the individual 
case under the principles outlined in this section.
    (b) Basic rule. Dependency will be held to exist if the father or 
mother of the veteran does not have an income sufficient to provide 
reasonable maintenance for such father or mother and members of his or 
her family under legal age and for dependent adult members of the family 
if the dependency of such adult member results from mental or physical 
incapacity.
    (1) ``Reasonable Maintenance'' includes not only housing, food, 
clothing, and medical care sufficient to sustain life, but such items 
beyond the bare necessities as well as other requirements reasonably 
necessary to provide those conveniences and comforts of living suitable 
to and consistent with the parents' reasonable mode of life.
    (2) ``Member of the family'' means a person (other than spouse) 
including a relative in the ascending as well as descending class, whom 
the father or mother is under moral or legal obligation to support. In 
determining whether other members of the family under legal age are 
factors in necessary expenses of the mother or father, consideration 
will be given to any income from business or property (including trusts) 
actually available, directly or indirectly, to the mother or father for 
the support of the minor but not to the corpus of the estate or the 
income of the minor which is not so available.
    (c) Inception of dependency. The fact that the veteran has made 
habitual contributions to the father or mother, or both, is not 
conclusive evidence that dependency existed but will be considered in 
connection with all other evidence. In death claims, it is not material 
whether dependency arose prior or subsequent to the veteran's death. 
(See Sec. 3.1000(d)(3) as to accrued.)


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 102(a))

    (d) Remarriage. Dependency will not be denied solely because of 
remarriage (38 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)). Compensation may be continued if the 
parent submits evidence to show that dependency exists, considering the 
combined income and expenses of the parent and spouse.

Sec. 3.251  Income of parents; dependency and indemnity compensation.

    (a) Annual income limitations and rates. (1) Dependency and 
indemnity compensation is not payable to a parent or parents whose 
annual income exceeds the limitations set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1315 (b), 
(c), or (d).
    (2) Where there is only one parent, and the parent has remarried and 
is living with his or her spouse, dependency and indemnity compensation 
will be paid under either the formula in 38 U.S.C. 1315(b)(1) or the 
formula in 38 U.S.C. 1315(d), whichever will provide the greater monthly 
rate of dependency and indemnity compensation. The total combined annual 
income of the parent and spouse will be counted.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1315)

    (3) Where the claim is based on service in the Commonwealth Army of 
the Philippines, or as a guerrilla or as a Philippine Scout under 
section 14, Pub. L. 190, 79th Congress, the income limitation will be at 
a rate of $0.50 for each dollar. See Sec. 3.100(b).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 107)

    (4) If the remarriage of a parent has been terminated, or the parent 
is separated from his or her spouse, the rate of dependency and 
indemnity compensation for the parent will be that which would be 
payable if there were one parent alone or two parents not living 
together, whichever is applicable.
    (5) Where there are two parents living and only one parent has filed 
claim, the rate of dependency and indemnity compensation will be that 
which would be payable if both parents had filed claim.
    (b) Basic rule. Payments of any kind or from any source will be 
counted as income unless specifically excluded. Income will be counted 
for the calendar year in which it is received and total income for the 
full calendar year will be considered except as provided in Sec. 3.260.

Sec. 3.252  Annual income; pension; Mexican border period and later war periods.

    (a) Annual income limitations; old-law pension. Where the right to 
old-law pension is payable under section 306(b) of Pub. L. 95-588 (92 
Stat. 2497), pension is not payable if the pensioner's annual income 
exceeds the income limitations prescribed by Sec. 3.26(c).
    (b) Annual income and net worth limitations; Pub. L. 86-211. Pension 
is not payable to a veteran, surviving spouse or child whose annual 
income exceeds the limitations set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1521, 1541 or 
1542; or to a veteran, surviving spouse or child if it is reasonable 
that some part of the claimant's estate be consumed for his or her 
maintenance. Where a veteran and spouse are living together, the 
separate income of the spouse will be considered as the veteran's income 
as provided in Sec. 3.262(b).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1543)

    (c) Basic rule. Payments of any kind or from any source will be 
counted as income unless specifically excluded. Income will be counted 
for the calendar year in which it is received and total income for the 
full calendar year will be considered except as provided in Sec. 3.260.
    (d) Veteran with a spouse. For the purpose of determining 
eligibility under paragraph (b) of this section the pension rates 
provided by 38 U.S.C. 1521(c) may be authorized for a married veteran if 
he or she is living with or, if estranged, is reasonably contributing to 
the support of his or her spouse. The determination of ``reasonable'' 
contribution will be based on all the circumstances in the case, 
considering the income and estate of the veteran and the separate income 
and estate of the spouse. Apportionment of the veteran's pension under 
Sec. 3.451 meets the requirement of reasonable contribution.
    (e) Surviving spouse with a child--(1) Child. The term ``child'' 
means a child as defined in Sec. 3.57. Where a veteran's child is born 
after the veteran dies, the surviving spouse will not be considered a 
surviving spouse with a child prior to the child's date of birth.
    (2) Veteran's child not in surviving spouse's custody. Where the 
veteran was

[[Page 204]]

survived by a surviving spouse and by a child, the income increments for 
a surviving spouse and child apply even though the child is not the 
child of the surviving spouse and not in his or her custody.
    (3) Income of child. The separate income received by a child or 
children, regardless of custody, will not be considered in computing the 
surviving spouse's income. Where the separate income of the child is 
turned over to the surviving spouse, only so much of the money as is 
left after deducting any expenses for maintenance of the child will be 
considered the surviving spouse's income.
    (4) Alternative rate. Whenever the monthly pension rate payable to 
the surviving spouse under the formula in 38 U.S.C. 1541(c) is less than 
the rate payable for one child under section 1542 if the surviving 
spouse were not entitled, the surviving spouse will be paid the child's 
rate.
    (f) Income over maximum; reduced aid and attendance allowance. 
Beginning January 1, 1977, veterans in need of regular aid and 
attendance who are not receiving pension because their income exceeds 
the applicable statutory limitation may be eligible for a reduced aid 
and attendance allowance. The amount payable is the regular aid and 
attendance allowance authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1521(d)(1) reduced by 16.6 
percent for each $100, or portion thereof, by which the veteran's annual 
income exceeds the applicable maximum income limitation. The reduced aid 
and attendance allowance is payable when:
    (1) A veteran in need of regular aid and attendance is denied 
pension under 38 U.S.C. 1521 solely because the veteran's annual income 
exceeds the applicable maximum income limitation in 38 U.S.C. 1521 
(b)(3) and (c)(3); or
    (2) Pension payable under 38 U.S.C. 1521 to a veteran in need of 
regular aid and attendance is discontinued solely because the veteran's 
annual income exceeds the applicable maximum income limitation in 38 
U.S.C. 1521 (b)(3) or (c)(3); and
    (3) The veteran's annual income exceeds the applicable maximum 
income limitation in 38 U.S.C. 1521 (b)(3) or (c)(3) by an amount not 
greater than the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 1521 (d)(2).

Sec. 3.256  Eligibility reporting requirements.

    (a) Obligation to report changes in factors affecting entitlement. 
Any individual who has applied for or receives pension or parents' 
dependency and indemnity compensation must promptly notify the Secretary 
of any change affecting entitlement in any of the following:
    (1) Income;
    (2) Net worth or corpus of estate;
    (3) Marital status;
    (4) Nursing home patient status;
    (5) School enrollment status of a child 18 years of age or older; or
    (6) Any other factor that affects entitlement to benefits under the 
provisions of this part.
    (b) Eligibility verification reports. (1) For purposes of this 
section the term eligibility verification report means a form prescribed 
by the Secretary that is used to request income, net worth (if 
applicable), dependency status, and any other information necessary to 
determine or verify entitlement to pension or parents' dependency and 
indemnity compensation.
    (2) VA will not require old law or section 306 pensioners to submit 
eligibility verification reports unless the Secretary determines that 
doing so is necessary to preserve program integrity.
    (3) The Secretary shall require an eligibility verification report 
from individuals receiving parents' dependency and indemnity 
compensation under the following circumstances:
    (i) If the Social Security Administration has not verified the 
beneficiary's Social Security number and, if the beneficiary is married, 
his or her spouse's Social Security number.

[[Page 205]]

    (ii) If there is reason to believe that the beneficiary or, if the 
spouse's income could affect entitlement, his or her spouse may have 
received income other than Social Security during the current or 
previous calendar year; or
    (iii) If the Secretary determines that an eligibility verification 
report is necessary to preserve program integrity.
    (4) An individual who applies for or receives pension or parents' 
dependency and indemnity compensation as defined in Sec. Sec. 3.3 or 
3.5 of this part shall, as a condition of receipt or continued receipt 
of benefits, furnish the Department of Veterans Affairs an eligibility 
verification report upon request.
    (c) If VA requests that a claimant or beneficiary submit an 
eligibility verification report but he or she fails to do so within 60 
days of the date of the VA request, the Secretary shall suspend the 
award or disallow the claim.

Sec. 3.257  Children; no surviving spouse entitled.

her net worth, payments will be made to or for the child or children as 
if there were no surviving spouse.

<R05>
Sec. 3.260  Computation of income.

    For entitlement to pension or dependency and indemnity compensation, 
income will be counted for the calendar year in which it is received.
    (a) Installments. Income will be determined by the total amount 
received or anticipated during the calendar year.
    (b) Deferred determinations. Where there is doubt as to the amount 
of the anticipated income, pension or dependency and indemnity 
compensation will be allowed at the lowest appropriate rate or will be 
withheld, as may be in order, until the end of the calendar year when 
the total income received during the year may be determined.
    (c) Proportionate income limitations; excess income. A proportionate 
income limitation will be established under the conditions set forth in 
paragraph (d) of this section except where application of a 
proportionate income limitation would result in payment of a lower rate 
than would be payable on the basis of income for the full calendar year.
    (d) Proportionate income limitations; computation. Income 
limitations will be computed proportionately for the purpose of 
determining initial entitlement, or for resuming payments on an award 
which was discontinued for a reason other than excess income or a change 
in marital or dependency status. A proportionate income limitation will 
be established for the period from the date of entitlement to the end of 
that calendar year. The total amount of income received by the claimant 
during that period will govern the payment of benefits. Income received 
prior to the date of entitlement will be disregarded.
    (e) Proportionate income limitations; spouse. In determining whether 
proportionate computation is applicable to a claim under Pub. L. 86-211 
(73 Stat. 432), the total income for the calendar year of entitlement of 
both veteran and that of the spouse available for use of the veteran 
will be considered. If a proportionate income limitation is then 
applicable, it will be applied to both the veteran's and the spouse's 
income. The spouse's income will not be included, however, where his or 
her total income for the calendar year does not exceed $1,200.
    (f) Rate changes. In years after that for which entitlement to 
pension or dependency and indemnity compensation has been established or 
reestablished as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, total income 
for the calendar year will govern the payment of benefits. Where there 
is a change in the conditions of entitlement because of a change in 
marital or dependency status, entitlement for each period will be 
determined separately. For the period

[[Page 206]]

when the claimant was married or had a dependent, the rate payable will 
be determined under the annual income limitation or increment applicable 
to a claimant who is married or has a dependent. For the period when the 
claimant was unmarried or without a dependent, the rate payable will be 
determined under the annual income limitation or increment applicable to 
a claimant who is not married or has no dependent. Since these 
determinations will be based on total income for the calendar year, it 
is not material whether such income was received before or after the 
change of status.
    (g) Fractions of dollars. In computing a claimant's annual income a 
fraction of a dollar will be disregarded for the purpose of determining 
entitlement to monthly payments of pension and dependency and indemnity 
compensation.

<R05>
Sec. 3.262  Evaluation of income.

    (a) Total income. All income from sources such as wages, salaries, 
earnings, bonuses from employers, income from a business or profession 
or from investments or rents as well as the fair value of personal 
services, goods or room and board received in lieu thereof will be 
included.
    (1) Salary is not determined by ``takehome'' pay, but includes 
deductions made under a retirement act or plan and amounts withheld by 
virtue of income tax laws.
    (2) The gross income from a business or profession may be reduced by 
the necessary operating expenses, such as cost of goods sold, or 
expenditures for rent, taxes, and upkeep. Depreciation is not a 
deductible expense. The cost of repairs or replacement may be deducted. 
The value of an increase in stock inventory of a business is not 
considered income.
    (3) A loss sustained in operating a business, profession, or farm or 
from investments may not be deducted from income derived from any other 
source.
    (b) Income of spouse. Income of the spouse will be determined under 
the rules applicable to income of the claimant.
    (1) Parents. Where the mother and father, or remarried parent and 
spouse are living together, the total combined income will be considered 
in determining dependency, or in determining the rate of dependency and 
indemnity compensation payable to the parent. This rule is equally 
applicable where both parents have remarried and each is living with his 
or her spouse. If the remarriage of a parent has been terminated, or the 
parent is separated from his or her spouse, income of the spouse will be 
excluded.
    (2) Veterans. The separate income of the spouse of a disabled 
veteran who is entitled to pension under laws in effect on June 30, 
1960, will not be considered. Where pension is payable under section 
306(a) of Pub. L. 95-588, to a veteran who is living with a spouse there 
will

[[Page 210]]

be included as income of the veteran all income of the spouse in excess 
of whichever is the greater, the amount of the spouse income exclusion 
specified in section 306(a)(2)(B) of Pub. L. 95-588 as increased from 
time to time under section 306 (a)(3) of Pub. L. 95-588 or the total 
earned income of the spouse, which is reasonably available to or for the 
veteran, unless hardship to the veteran would result. Each time there is 
an increase in the spouse income exclusion pursuant to section 306(a)(3) 
of Pub. L. 95-588, the actual amount of the exclusion will be published 
in the ``Notices'' section of the Federal Register. The presumption that 
inclusion of such income is available to the veteran and would not work 
a hardship on him or her may be rebutted by evidence of unavailability 
or of expenses beyond the usual family requirements.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1521(f); sec. 306(a)(2)(B) of Pub. L. 95-588)

    (c) Maintenance. The value of maintenance furnished by a relative, 
friend, or a charitable organization (civic or governmental) will not be 
considered income. Where the claimant is maintained in a rest home or 
other community institution or facility, public or private, because of 
impaired health or advanced age, money paid to the home or to the 
claimant to cover the cost of maintenance will not be considered income, 
regardless of whether it is furnished by a relative, friend or 
charitable organization. The expense of maintenance is not deductible if 
it is paid from the claimant's income, except as provided in paragraph 
(l) of this section in claims for dependency and indemnity compensation.
    (d) Charitable donations. Charitable donations from public or 
private relief or welfare organizations will not be considered income 
except in claims for pension under laws in effect on June 30, 1960. In 
the latter cases, additional charitable allowances received by a 
claimant for members of his or her family may not be divided per capita 
in determining the amount of the claimant's income.
    (e) Retirement benefits; general. Retirement benefits, including an 
annuity or endowment, paid under a Federal, State, municipal, or private 
business or industrial plan are considered income as limited by this 
paragraph. Where the payments received consist of part principal and 
part interest, interest will not be counted separately.
    (1) Protected pension. Except as provided in this paragraph (e)(1), 
effective January 1, 1965, in determining income for pension purposes 
under laws in effect on June 30, 1960, 10 percent of the retirement 
payments received by a veteran, surviving spouse, or child will be 
excluded. The remaining 90 percent will be considered income as 
received. Where the retirement benefit is based on the claimant's own 
employment, payments will not be considered income until the amount of 
the claimant's personal contribution (as distinguished from amounts 
contributed by the employer) has been received. Thereafter the 10 
percent exclusion will apply.
    (2) Pension; Pub. L. 86-211. Except as provided in this 
subparagraph, effective January 1, 1965, in determining income for 
pension purposes, under Pub. L. 86-211 (73 Stat. 432), 10 percent of the 
retirement payments received by a veteran, the veteran's spouse, 
surviving spouse, or child will be excluded. The remaining 90 percent 
will be considered income as received. Where a person was receiving or 
entitled to receive pension and retirement benefits based on his or her 
own employment on December 31, 1964, the retirement payments will not be 
considered income until the amount of the claimant personal contribution 
(as distinguished from amounts contributed by the employer) has been 
received. Thereafter the 10 percent exclusion will apply.
    (3) Compensation. In determining dependency of a parent for 
compensation purposes, all payments will be considered income as 
received.
    (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation. Except as provided in 
this subparagraph, effective January 1, 1967, in determining income for 
dependency and indemnity compensation purposes, 10 percent of the 
retirement payments received by a deceased veteran's parent or by the 
parent's spouse will be excluded. The remaining 90 percent will be 
considered income as received.

[[Page 211]]

Where a parent was receiving or entitled to receive dependency and 
indemnity compensation and retirement benefits based on his or her own 
employment on December 31, 1966, the retirement payments will not be 
considered income until the amount of the claimant's personal 
contribution (as distinguished from amounts contributed by the employer) 
has been received. Thereafter the 10 percent exclusion will apply.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1315(g), 1503(a)(6))

    (f) Social security benefits. Old age and survivor's insurance and 
disability insurance under title II of the Social Security Act will be 
considered income as a retirement benefit under the rules contained in 
paragraph (e) of this section. Benefits received under noncontributory 
programs, such as old age assistance, aid to dependent children, and 
supplemental security income are subject to the rules contained in 
paragraph (d) of this section applicable to charitable donations. The 
lumpsum death payment under title II of the Social Security Act will be 
considered as income except in claims for dependency and indemnity 
compensation and for pension under Pub. L. 86-211 (73 Stat. 432).
    (g) Railroad retirement benefits--(1) Parents, surviving spouses and 
children. Retirement benefits received from the Railroad Retirement 
Board will be considered as income under the rules contained in 
paragraph (e) of this section. (See paragraph (h) of this section as to 
waivers.)
    (2) Veterans. Effective July 1, 1959, retirement benefits received 
from the Railroad Retirement Board were excluded from consideration as 
income in determining eligibility for disability pension. (45 U.S.C. 
228s-1) This exclusion continues to be applicable to claims under laws 
in effect on June 30, 1960. For purposes of section 306 pension, such 
retirement benefits will be considered as income under the rules 
contained in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (h) Retirement benefits waived. Except as provided in this 
paragraph, retirement benefits (pension or retirement payments) which 
have been waived will be included as income. For the purpose of 
determining dependency of a parent, or eligibility of a parent for 
dependency and indemnity compensation or eligibility of a veteran, 
surviving spouse, or child for pension under laws in effect on June 30, 
1960, retirement benefits from the following sources which have been 
waived pursuant to Federal statute will not be considered as income:
    (1) Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund;
    (2) Railroad Retirement Board (see paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section);
    (3) District of Columbia, firemen, policemen, or public school 
teachers;
    (4) Former lighthouse service.
    (i) Compensation (civilian) for injury or death. (1) Compensation 
paid by the Bureau of Employees' Compensation, Department of Labor (of 
the United States), or by Social Security Administration, or by Railroad 
Retirement Board, or pursuant to any workmen's compensation or 
employer's liability statute, or damages collected because of personal 
injury or death, less medical, legal, or other expenses incident to the 
injury or death, or the collection or recovery of such moneys will be 
considered income as received, except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of 
this section. The criteria of paragraph (i)(1) of this section are for 
application as to all medical expenditures after such award or 
settlement.


(Authority: Pub. L. 92-198, 85 Stat. 663)

    (2) For pension, effective October 7, 1966, and for dependency and 
indemnity compensation effective January 1, 1967, if payments based on 
permanent and total disability or death are received from the Bureau of 
Employees' Compensation, Social Security Administration or Railroad 
Retirement Board, or pursuant to any workmen's compensation or 
employer's liability statute, there will be excluded 10 percent of the 
payments received after deduction of medical, legal, and other expenses 
as authorized by paragraph (i)(1) of this section. The 10 percent 
exclusion does not apply to damages collected incident to a tort suit 
under other than an employer's liability law of the United States or a 
political subdivision of the United States, or to determinations of 
dependency for compensation purposes.

[[Page 212]]

    (j) Commercial insurance--(1) Annuity or endowment insurance. For 
pension, effective January 1, 1965, or for dependency and indemnity 
compensation, effective January 1, 1967, the provisions of paragraph (e) 
of this section apply. In such cases, 10 percent of the payments 
received will be excluded. In dependency and indemnity compensation 
claims, where the parent is receiving or entitled to receive dependency 
and indemnity compensation on December 31, 1966, and is also receiving 
or entitled to receive annuity payments on that date, or endowment 
insurance matures on or before that date, no part of the payments 
received will be considered income until the full amount of the 
consideration has been received, after which 10 percent of the amount 
received will be excluded. For compensation, the full amount of each 
payment is considered income as received.
    (2) Life insurance; general. In determining dependency, or 
eligibility for dependency and indemnity compensation, or for section 
306 pension the full amount of payments is considered income as 
received. For section 306 pension, effective October 7, 1966, and for 
dependency and indemnity compensation, effective January 1, 1967, 10 
percent of the payments received will be excluded.
    (3) Life insurance; old-law pension. For pension under laws in 
effect on June 30, 1960, 10 percent of the payments received will be 
excluded. Where it is considered that life insurance was received in a 
lump sum in the calendar year in which the veteran died and payments are 
actually received in succeeding years, no part of the payments received 
in succeeding years will be considered income until an amount equal to 
the lump-sum face value of the policy has been received, after which 10 
percent of the payments received will be excluded. The 10 percent 
exclusion is authorized effective October 7, 1966.
    (4) Disability, accident or health insurance. For pension, effective 
October 7, 1966, and for dependency and indemnity compensation, 
effective January 1, 1967, there will be excluded 10 percent of the 
payments received for disability after deduction of medical, legal, or 
other expenses incident to the disability. For compensation, after 
deduction of such expenses, the full amount of payments is considered 
income as received.
    (k) Property--(1) Ownership. The terms of the recorded deed or other 
evidence of title will constitute evidence of ownership of real or 
personal property. This includes property acquired through purchase, 
bequest or inheritance except that, effective January 1, 1971, amounts 
in joint accounts in banks and similar institutions acquired by reason 
of the death of another joint owner shall not be considered income of a 
survivor for section 306 pension purposes. With the foregoing exception, 
if property is owned jointly each person will be considered as owning a 
proportionate share. The claimant's share of property held in 
partnership will be determined on the facts found. In the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, the claimant's statement as to the terms of 
ownership will be accepted.


(Authority: Sec. 306, Pub. L. 95-588; 92 Stat. 2508)

    (2) Income-producing property. Income received from real or personal 
property owned by the claimant will be counted. The claimant's share 
will be determined in proportion to his right according to the rules of 
ownership.
    (3) Sale of property. Except as provided in paragraphs (k)(4) and 
(5) of this section, net profit from the sale of real or personal 
property will be counted. In determining net profit from the sale of 
property owned prior to the date of entitlement, the value at the date 
of entitlement will be considered in relation to the selling price. 
Where payments are received in installments, payments will not be 
considered income until the claimant has received amounts equal to the 
value of the property at the date of entitlement. Principal and interest 
will not be counted separately.
    (4) Homes. Net profit from the sale of the claimant's residence 
which is received during the calendar year of sale will not be 
considered as income under the following conditions:
    (i) To the extent that it is applied within the calendar year of the 
sale, or the succeeding calendar year, to the purchase price of another 
residence as his principal dwelling;

[[Page 213]]

    (ii) Such application of the net profit is reported within 1 year 
following the date so applied, and
    (iii) The net profit is so applied after January 10, 1962, to a 
purchase made after said date.

This exclusion will not apply where the net profit is applied to the 
price of a home purchased earlier than the calendar year preceding the 
calendar year of sale of the old residence.
    (5) Sale of property; section 306 pension and dependency and 
indemnity compensation. For pension under section 306 pension and for 
dependency and indemnity compensation, profit from the sale of real or 
personal property other than in the course of a business will not be 
considered income. This applies to property acquired either before or 
after the date of entitlement. Any amounts received in excess of the 
sales price will be counted as income. Where payments are received in 
installments, principal and interest will not be counted separately. For 
pension, this provision is effective January 1, 1965; for dependency and 
indemnity compensation, January 1, 1967.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1503(a)(10); 38 U.S.C. 1315(g))

    (6) Payments on mortgages on real property; section 306 pension. 
Effective January 1, 1971, for the purposes of section 306 pension, an 
amount equaling any prepayments made by a veteran or surviving spouse on 
a mortgage or similar type security instrument in existence at the death 
of veteran or spouse on real property which prior to the death was the 
principal residence of the veteran and spouse will be excluded from 
consideration as income if such payment was made after the death and 
prior to the close of the year succeeding the year of death.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1503(a)(14))

    (l) Unusual medical expenses. Within the provisions of paragraphs 
(l)(1) through (4) of this section there will be excluded from the 
amount of the claimant's annual income any unreimbursed amounts which 
have been paid within the calendar year for unusual medical expenses 
regardless of the year the indebtedness was incurred. The term unusual 
means excessive. It does not describe the nature of a medical condition 
but rather the amount expended for medical treatment in relationship to 
the claimant's resources available for sustaining a reasonable mode of 
life. Unreimbursed expenditures which exceed 5 percent of the claimant's 
reported annual income will be considered unusual. Health, accident, 
sickness and hospitalization insurance premiums will be included as 
medical expenses in determining whether the claimant's unreimbursed 
medical expenses meet the criterion for unusual. A claimant's statement 
as to amounts expended for medical expenses ordinarily will be accepted 
unless the circumstances create doubt as to its credibility. An estimate 
based on a clear and reasonable expectation that unusual medical 
expenditure will be realized may be accepted for the purpose of 
authorizing prospective payments of benefits subject to necessary 
adjustment in the award upon receipt of an amended estimate or after the 
end of the calendar year upon receipt of an income questionnaire.

3.252(b). Only the estate of the parent, in claims based on dependency,

value will be accepted.

value, less mortgages or other encumbrances, of all real and personal

suitable to and consistent with the claimant's reasonable mode of life.
    (c) Ownership. See Sec. 3.262(k).
    (d) Evaluation. In determining whether some part of the claimant's 
estate should be consumed for his or her maintenance, consideration will

following factors: whether the property can be readily converted into 
cash at no substantial sacrifice; ability to dispose of property as 
limited by community property laws; life expectancy; number of 
dependents who meet the requirements of Sec. 3.250(b)(2); potential

received or anticipated in equal amounts and at regular intervals (e.g., 
weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.), and which will continue throughout an 
entire 12-month annualization period. The amount of recurring income for 
pension purposes

[[Page 218]]

will be the amount received or anticipated during a 12-month 
annualization period. Recurring income which terminates prior to being 
counted for at least one full 12-month annualization period will be 
treated as nonrecurring income for computation purposes.
    (2) Irregular income. Irregular income means income which is 
received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period, but 
which is received in unequal amounts or at irregular intervals. The 
amount of irregular income for pension purposes will be the amount 
received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period following 
initial receipt of such income.
    (3) Nonrecurring income. Nonrecurring income means income received 
or anticipated on a one-time basis during a 12-month annualization

include nonrecurring income for a full 12-month annualization period 
following receipt of the income.

taxes, and upkeep, or costs of repairs or replacements. The value of an 
increase in stock inventory of a business is not considered income.
    (2) Depreciation is not a deductible expense.
    (3) A loss sustained in operating a business, profession, farm, or 
from investments, may not be deducted from income derived from any other 
source.

countable as income of the property's owner. The terms of a recorded 
deed or other evidence of title shall constitute evidence of ownership. 
This includes property acquired through purchase, gift, devise, or 
descent. If property is owned jointly, income of the various owners 
shall be determined in proportion to shares of ownership of the 
property. The owner's shares of income held in partnership shall be 
determined on the basis of the facts found.
    (e) Installments. Income shall be determined by the total amount 
received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (f) Deferred determinations. (1) When an individual is unable to 
predict with certainty the amount of countable annual income, the annual 
rate of improved pension shall be reduced by the greatest amount of 
anticipated countable income until the end of the 12-month annualization 
period, when total income received during that period will be determined 
and adjustments in pension payable made accordingly.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (2) When a claimed dependent is shown to have income which exceeds 
the additional amount of benefits payable based on the claimed 
dependency, but evidence requirements of Sec. 3.204, Sec. 3.205, Sec. 
3.209, or Sec. 3.210 have not been met, the maximum annual rate of 
improved pension shall be determined without consideration of the 
claimed dependency. This amount shall be reduced by an amount which 
includes the income of the unestablished dependent. Adjustments in 
computation of the maximum annual rate of improved pension shall occur 
following receipt of evidence necessary to establish the dependency.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a))

    (g) Compensation (civilian) for injury or death. Compensation paid 
by the United States Department of Labor, Office of Workers' 
Compensation Programs, Social Security Administration, or the Railroad 
Retirement Board, or pursuant to any worker's compensation or employer's

death, will be considered income as received. However, medical, legal or 
other expenses incident to the injury or death, or incident to the 
collection or recovery of the amount of the award or settlement, may be 
deducted. The criteria in

considered income. Where the individual is maintained in a rest home or 
other community institution or facility, public or private, because of 
impaired health or advanced age, money paid to the home or the 
individual to cover the cost of maintenance will not be considered 
income, regardless of whether it is furnished by a relative, friend, or

reasonable expectation that unusual medical expenditure will be realized 
may be accepted for the purpose of authorizing prospective payments of 
benefits subject to necessary adjustment in the award upon receipt of an 
amended estimate, or after the end of the 12-month annualization period

3.660.
    (a) Initial award. For the purpose of determining initial 
entitlement, or for resuming payments on an award which was previously 
discontinued, the monthly rate of pension payable to a beneficiary shall 
be computed by reducing the beneficiary's applicable maximum pension 
rate by the beneficiary's countable income on the effective date of 
entitlement and dividing the remainder by 12. Effective June 1, 1983, 
the provisions of Sec. 3.29(b) apply to this paragraph. Recomputation 
of rates due to changes in the maximum annual pension rate or rate of 
income following the initial date of entitlement are subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Running awards--(1) Change in maximum annual pension rate. 
Whenever there is change in a beneficiary's applicable maximum annual 
pension rate, the monthly rate of pension payable shall be computed by 
reducing the new applicable maximum annual pension rate by the 
beneficiary's countable income on the effective date of the change in 
the applicable maximum annual pension rate, and dividing the remainder 
by 12. Effective June 1, 1983, the provisions of Sec. 3.29(b) apply to 
this paragraph.
    (2) Change in amount of income. Whenever there is a change in a 
beneficiary's amount of countable income the monthly rate of pension 
payable shall be computed by reducing the beneficiary's applicable 
maximum annual pension rate by the beneficiary's new amount of countable 
income on the effective date of the change in the amount of income, and 
dividing the remainder by 12. Effective June 1, 1983, the provisions of 
Sec. 3.29(b) apply to this paragraph.
    (c) Nonrecurring income. The amount of any nonrecurring countable 
income (e.g. an inheritance) received by a beneficiary shall be added to 
the beneficiary's annual rate of income for a 12-month annualization 
period commencing on the effective date on which the nonrecurring income 
is countable.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (d) Recurring and irregular income. The amount of recurring and 
irregular income anticipated or received by a beneficiary shall be added

for or in receipt of pension in his or her own behalf (hereinafter in 
this section referred to as a surviving child), of any person with whom 
such child is residing who is legally responsible for such child's

Sec. 3.300  Claims based on the effects of tobacco products.

    (a) For claims received by VA after June 9, 1998, a disability or 
death will not be considered service-connected on the basis that it 
resulted from injury or disease attributable to the veteran's use of 
tobacco products during service. For the purpose of this section, the 
term ``tobacco products'' means cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, 
pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco.
    (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not prohibit 
service connection if:
    (1) The disability or death resulted from a disease or injury that 
is otherwise shown to have been incurred or aggravated during service. 
For purposes of this section, ``otherwise shown'' means that the 
disability or death can be service-connected on some basis other than 
the veteran's use of tobacco products during service, or that the 
disability became manifest or death occurred during service; or
    (2) The disability or death resulted from a disease or injury that 
appeared to the required degree of disability within any applicable 
presumptive period under Sec. Sec. 3.307, 3.309, 3.313, or 3.316; or
    (3) Secondary service connection is established for ischemic heart 
disease or other cardiovascular disease under Sec. 3.310(b).
    (c) For claims for secondary service connection received by VA after 
June 9, 1998, a disability that is proximately due to or the result of 
an injury or disease previously service-connected on the basis that it 
is attributable to the veteran's use of tobacco products during service 
will not be service-connected under Sec. 3.310(a).

<R05>
Sec. 3.301  Line of duty and misconduct.

    (a) Line of duty. Direct service connection may be granted only when 
a disability or cause of death was incurred or aggravated in line of 
duty, and not the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct or, for 
claims filed after October 31, 1990, the result of his or her abuse of 
alcohol or drugs.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 105)

    (b) Willful misconduct. Disability pension is not payable for any 
condition due to the veteran's own willful misconduct.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1521)

    (c) Specific applications; willful misconduct. For the purpose of 
determining entitlement to service-connected and nonservice-connected 
benefits the definitions in Sec. Sec. 3.1 (m) and (n) of this part 
apply except as modified within paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this 
section. The provisions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section 
are subject to the provisions of Sec. 3.302 of this part where 
applicable.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (1) Venereal disease. The residuals of venereal disease are not to 
be considered the result of willful misconduct. Consideration of service 
connection for residuals of venereal disease as having

[[Page 227]]

been incurred in service requires that the initial infection must have 
occurred during active service. Increase in service of manifestations of 
venereal disease will usually be held due to natural progress unless the 
facts of record indicate the increase in manifestations was precipitated 
by trauma or by the conditions of the veteran's service, in which event 
service connection may be established by aggravation. Medical principles 
pertaining to the incubation period and its relation to the course of 
the disease; i.e., initial or acute manifestation, or period and course 
of secondary and late residuals manifested, will be considered when time 
of incurrence of venereal disease prior to or after entry into service 
is at issue. In the issue of service connection, whether the veteran 
complied with service regulations and directives for reporting the 
disease and undergoing treatment is immaterial after November 14, 1972, 
and the service department characterization of acquisition of the 
disease as willful misconduct or as not in line of duty will not govern.
    (2) The simple drinking of alcoholic beverage is not of itself 
willful misconduct. The deliberate drinking of a known poisonous 
substance or under conditions which would raise a presumption to that 
effect will be considered willful misconduct. If, in the drinking of a 
beverage to enjoy its intoxicating effects, intoxication results 
proximately and immediately in disability or death, the disability or 
death will be considered the result of the person's willful misconduct. 
Organic diseases and disabilities which are a secondary result of the 
chronic use of alcohol as a beverage, whether out of compulsion or 
otherwise, will not be considered of willful misconduct origin. (See 
Sec. Sec. 21.1043, 21.5041, and 21.7051 of this title regarding the 
disabling effects of chronic alcoholism for the purpose of extending 
delimiting periods under education or rehabilitation programs.)


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (3) Drug usage. The isolated and infrequent use of drugs by itself 
will not be considered willful misconduct; however, the progressive and 
frequent use of drugs to the point of addiction will be considered 
willful misconduct. Where drugs are used to enjoy or experience their 
effects and the effects result proximately and immediately in disability 
or death, such disability or death will be considered the result of the 
person's willful misconduct. Organic diseases and disabilities which are 
a secondary result of the chronic use of drugs and infections coinciding 
with the injection of drugs will not be considered of willful misconduct 
origin. (See paragraph (d) of this section regarding service connection 
where disability or death is a result of abuse of drugs.) Where drugs 
are used for therapeutic purposes or where use of drugs or addiction 
thereto, results from a service-connected disability, it will not be 
considered of misconduct origin.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 105, 1110, 1121, 1131, 1301, and 1521(a))

    (d) Line of duty; abuse of alcohol or drugs. An injury or disease 
incurred during active military, naval, or air service shall not be 
deemed to have been incurred in line of duty if such injury or disease 
was a result of the abuse of alcohol or drugs by the person on whose 
service benefits are claimed. For the purpose of this paragraph, alcohol 
abuse means the use of alcoholic beverages over time, or such excessive 
use at any one time, sufficient to cause disability to or death of the 
user; drug abuse means the use of illegal drugs (including prescription 
drugs that are illegally or illicitly obtained), the intentional use of 
prescription or non-prescription drugs for a purpose other than the 
medically intended use, or the use of substances other than alcohol to 
enjoy their intoxicating effects.

Sec. 3.302  Service connection for mental unsoundness in suicide.

    (a) General. (1) In order for suicide to constitute willful 
misconduct, the act of self-destruction must be intentional.

[[Page 228]]

    (2) A person of unsound mind is incapable of forming an intent (mens 
rea, or guilty mind, which is an essential element of crime or willful 
misconduct).
    (3) It is a constant requirement for favorable action that the 
precipitating mental unsoundness be service connected.
    (b) Evidence of mental condition. (1) Whether a person, at the time 
of suicide, was so unsound mentally that he or she did not realize the 
consequence of such an act, or was unable to resist such impulse is a 
question to be determined in each individual case, based on all 
available lay and medical evidence pertaining to his or her mental 
condition at the time of suicide.
    (2) The act of suicide or a bona fide attempt is considered to be 
evidence of mental unsoundness. Therefore, where no reasonable adequate 
motive for suicide is shown by the evidence, the act will be considered 
to have resulted from mental unsoundness.
    (3) A reasonable adequate motive for suicide may be established by 
affirmative evidence showing circumstances which could lead a rational 
person to self-destruction.
    (c) Evaluation of evidence. (1) Affirmative evidence is necessary to 
justify reversal of service department findings of mental unsoundness 
where Department of Veterans Affairs criteria do not otherwise warrant 
contrary findings.
    (2) In all instances any reasonable doubt should be resolved 
favorably to support a finding of service connection (see Sec. 3.102).

    Cross Reference: Cause of death. See Sec. 3.312.

               Ratings and Evaluations; Service Connection


<R05>
Sec. 3.303  Principles relating to service connection.

    (a) General. Service connection connotes many factors but basically 
it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular 
injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with 
service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was 
aggravated therein. This may be accomplished by affirmatively showing 
inception or aggravation during service or through the application of 
statutory presumptions. Each disabling condition shown by a veteran's 
service records, or for which he seeks a service connection must be 
considered on the basis of the places, types and circumstances of his 
service as shown by service records, the official history of each 
organization in which he served, his medical records and all pertinent 
medical and lay evidence. Determinations as to service connection will 
be based on review of the entire evidence of record, with due 
consideration to the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent 
with the facts in each individual case.
    (b) Chronicity and continuity. With chronic disease shown as such in 
service (or within the presumptive period under Sec. 3.307) so as to 
permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the 
same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service 
connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. This rule 
does not mean that any manifestation of joint pain, any abnormality of 
heart action or heart sounds, any urinary findings of casts, or any 
cough, in service will permit service connection of arthritis, disease 
of the heart, nephritis, or pulmonary disease, first shown as a clearcut 
clinical entity, at some later date. For the showing of chronic disease 
in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient 
to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish 
chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings 
or a diagnosis including the word ``Chronic.'' When the disease identity 
is established (leprosy, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, etc.), there 
is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity. Continuity of 
symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service 
(or in the presumptive period) is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or 
where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned. When 
the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported,

[[Page 229]]

then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the 
claim.
    (c) Preservice disabilities noted in service. There are medical 
principles so universally recognized as to constitute fact (clear and 
unmistakable proof), and when in accordance with these principles 
existence of a disability prior to service is established, no additional 
or confirmatory evidence is necessary. Consequently with notation or 
discovery during service of such residual conditions (scars; fibrosis of 
the lungs; atrophies following disease of the central or peripheral 
nervous system; healed fractures; absent, displaced or resected parts of 
organs; supernumerary parts; congenital malformations or hemorrhoidal 
tags or tabs, etc.) with no evidence of the pertinent antecedent active 
disease or injury during service the conclusion must be that they 
preexisted service. Similarly, manifestation of lesions or symptoms of 
chronic disease from date of enlistment, or so close thereto that the 
disease could not have originated in so short a period will establish 
preservice existence thereof. Conditions of an infectious nature are to 
be considered with regard to the circumstances of the infection and if 
manifested in less than the respective incubation periods after 
reporting for duty, they will be held to have preexisted service. In the 
field of mental disorders, personality disorders which are characterized 
by developmental defects or pathological trends in the personality 
structure manifested by a lifelong pattern of action or behavior, 
chronic psychoneurosis of long duration or other psychiatric 
symptomatology shown to have existed prior to service with the same 
manifestations during service, which were the basis of the service 
diagnosis, will be accepted as showing preservice origin. Congenital or 
developmental defects, refractive error of the eye, personality 
disorders and mental deficiency as such are not diseases or injuries 
within the meaning of applicable legislation.
    (d) Postservice initial diagnosis of disease. Service connection may 
be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the 
evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the 
disease was incurred in service. Presumptive periods are not intended to 
limit service connection to diseases so diagnosed when the evidence 
warrants direct service connection. The presumptive provisions of the 
statute and Department of Veterans Affairs regulations implementing them 
are intended as liberalizations applicable when the evidence would not 
warrant service connection without their aid.

[26 FR 1579, Feb. 24, 1961]


<R05>
Sec. 3.304  Direct service connection; wartime and peacetime.

    (a) General. The basic considerations relating to service connection 
are stated in Sec. 3.303. The criteria in this section apply only to 
disabilities which may have resulted from service in a period of war or 
service rendered on or after January 1, 1947.
    (b) Presumption of soundness. The veteran will be considered to have 
been in sound condition when examined, accepted and enrolled for 
service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at 
entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable (obvious or 
manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior 
thereto and was not aggravated by such service. Only such conditions as 
are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1111)

    (1) History of preservice existence of conditions recorded at the 
time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions 
but will be considered together with all other material evidence in 
determinations as to inception. Determinations should not be based on 
medical judgment alone as distinguished from accepted medical 
principles, or on history alone without regard to clinical factors 
pertinent to the basic character, origin and development of such injury 
or disease. They should be based on thorough analysis of the evidentiary 
showing and careful correlation of all material facts, with due regard 
to accepted medical principles pertaining to the history, 
manifestations, clinical course, and character of the particular injury 
or disease or residuals thereof.

[[Page 230]]

    (2) History conforming to accepted medical principles should be 
given due consideration, in conjunction with basic clinical data, and be 
accorded probative value consistent with accepted medical and 
evidentiary principles in relation to value consistent with accepted 
medical evidence relating to incurrence, symptoms and course of the 
injury or disease, including official and other records made prior to, 
during or subsequent to service, together with all other lay and medical 
evidence concerning the inception, development and manifestations of the 
particular condition will be taken into full account.
    (3) Signed statements of veterans relating to the origin, or 
incurrence of any disease or injury made in service if against his or 
her own interest is of no force and effect if other data do not 
establish the fact. Other evidence will be considered as though such 
statement were not of record.


(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 1219)

    (c) Development. The development of evidence in connection with 
claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary 
but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for 
this determination. In initially rating disability of record at the time 
of discharge, the records of the service department, including the 
reports of examination at enlistment and the clinical records during 
service, will ordinarily suffice. Rating of combat injuries or other 
conditions which obviously had their inception in service may be 
accomplished pending receipt of copy of the examination at enlistment 
and all other service records.
    (d) Combat. Satisfactory lay or other evidence that an injury or 
disease was incurred or aggravated in combat will be accepted as 
sufficient proof of service connection if the evidence is consistent 
with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of such service even 
though there is no official record of such incurrence or aggravation.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1154(b))

    (e) Prisoners of war. Where disability compensation is claimed by a 
former prisoner of war, omission of history or findings from clinical 
records made upon repatriation is not determinative of service 
connection, particularly if evidence of comrades in support of the 
incurrence of the disability during confinement is available. Special 
attention will be given to any disability first reported after 
discharge, especially if poorly defined and not obviously of 
intercurrent origin. The circumstances attendant upon the individual 
veteran's confinement and the duration thereof will be associated with 
pertinent medical principles in determining whether disability 
manifested subsequent to service is etiologically related to the 
prisoner of war experience.
    (f) Post-traumatic stress disorder. Service connection for post-
traumatic stress disorder requires medical evidence diagnosing the 
condition in accordance with Sec. 4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, 
established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-
service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-
service stressor occurred. Although service connection may be 
established based on other in-service stressors, the following 
provisions apply for specified in-service stressors as set forth below:
    (1) If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat 
with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in 
the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and 
provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, 
conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay 
testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service 
stressor.
    (2) If the evidence establishes that the veteran was a prisoner-of-
war under the provisions of Sec. 3.1(y) of this part and the claimed 
stressor is related to that prisoner-of-war experience, in the absence 
of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the 
claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or 
hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone 
may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
    (3) If a post-traumatic stress disorder claim is based on in-service 
personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service 
records may

[[Page 231]]

corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident. Examples of 
such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law 
enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling 
centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually 
transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, 
fellow service members, or clergy. Evidence of behavior changes 
following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may 
be found in these sources. Examples of behavior changes that may 
constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not 
limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty 
assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes 
of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; 
or unexplained economic or social behavior changes. VA will not deny a 
post-traumatic stress disorder claim that is based on in-service 
personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from 
sources other than the veteran's service records or evidence of behavior 
changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor and 
allowing him or her the opportunity to furnish this type of evidence or 
advise VA of potential sources of such evidence. VA may submit any 
evidence that it receives to an appropriate medical or mental health 
professional for an opinion as to whether it indicates that a personal 
assault occurred.

Sec. 3.305  Direct service connection; peacetime service before January 1, 1947.

    (a) General. The basic considerations relating to service connection 
are stated in Sec. 3.303. The criteria in this section apply only to 
disabilities which may have resulted from service other than in a period 
of war before January 1, 1947.
    (b) Presumption of soundness. A peacetime veteran who has had 
active, continuous service of 6 months or more will be considered to 
have been in sound condition when examined, accepted and enrolled for 
service, except as to defects, infirmities or disorders noted at the 
time thereof, or where evidence or medical judgment, as distinguished 
from medical fact and principles, establishes that an injury or disease 
preexisted service. Any evidence acceptable as competent to indicate the 
time of existence or inception of the condition may be considered. 
Determinations based on medical judgment will take cognizance of the 
time of inception or manifestation of disease or injury following 
entrance into service, as shown by proper service authorities in service 
records, entries or reports. Such records will be accorded reasonable 
weight in consideration of other evidence and sound medical reasoning. 
Opinions may be solicited from Department of Veterans Affairs medical 
authorities when considered necessary.
    (c) Campaigns and expeditions. In considering claims of veterans who 
engaged in combat during campaigns or expeditions satisfactory lay or 
other evidence of incurrence or aggravation in such combat of an injury 
or disease, if consistent with the circumstances, conditions or 
hardships of such service will be accepted as sufficient proof of 
service connection, even when there is no official record of incurrence 
or aggravation. Service connection for such injury or disease may be 
rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.

[26 FR 1580, Feb. 24, 1961, as amended at 28 FR 3088, Mar. 29, 1963; 39 
FR 34530, Sept. 26, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 3.306  Aggravation of preservice disability.

    (a) General. A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to 
have been aggravated by active military, naval, or air service, where 
there is an increase in disability during such service, unless there is 
a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural 
progress of the disease.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1153)


[[Page 232]]


    (b) Wartime service; peacetime service after December 31, 1946. 
Clear and unmistakable evidence (obvious or manifest) is required to 
rebut the presumption of aggravation where the preservice disability 
underwent an increase in severity during service. This includes medical 
facts and principles which may be considered to determine whether the 
increase is due to the natural progress of the condition. Aggravation 
may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in 
severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record 
pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during and 
subsequent to service.
    (1) The usual effects of medical and surgical treatment in service, 
having the effect of ameliorating disease or other conditions incurred 
before enlistment, including postoperative scars, absent or poorly 
functioning parts or organs, will not be considered service connected 
unless the disease or injury is otherwise aggravated by service.
    (2) Due regard will be given the places, types, and circumstances of 
service and particular consideration will be accorded combat duty and 
other hardships of service. The development of symptomatic 
manifestations of a preexisting disease or injury during or proximately 
following action with the enemy or following a status as a prisoner of 
war will establish aggravation of a disability.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1154)

    (c) Peacetime service prior to December 7, 1941. The specific 
finding requirement that an increase in disability is due to the natural 
progress of the condition will be met when the available evidence of a 
nature generally acceptable as competent shows that the increase in 
severity of a disease or injury or acceleration in progress was that 
normally to be expected by reason of the inherent character of the 
condition, aside from any extraneous or contributing cause or influence 
peculiar to military service. Consideration will be given to the 
circumstances, conditions, and hardships of service.

Sec. 3.307  Presumptive service connection for chronic, tropical or prisoner-of-war related disease, or disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide 
          agents; wartime and service on or after January 1, 1947.

    (a) General. A chronic, tropical, prisoner of war related disease, 
or a disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents listed 
in Sec. 3.309 will be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated 
by service under the circumstances outlined in this section even though 
there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. No 
condition other than one listed in Sec. 3.309(a) will be considered 
chronic.
    (1) Service. The veteran must have served 90 days or more during a 
war period or after December 31, 1946. The requirement of 90 days' 
service means active, continuous service within or extending into or 
beyond a war period, or which began before and extended beyond December 
31, 1946, or began after that date. Any period of service is sufficient 
for the purpose of establishing the presumptive service connection of a 
specified disease under the conditions listed in Sec. 3.309(c) and (e).
    (2) Separation from service. For the purpose of paragraph (a)(3) and 
(4) of this section the date of separation from wartime service will be 
the date of discharge or release during a war period, or if service 
continued after the war, the end of the war period. In claims based on 
service on or after January 1, 1947, the date of separation will be the 
date of discharge or release from the period of service on which the 
claim is based.
    (3) Chronic disease. The disease must have become manifest to a 
degree of 10 percent or more within 1 year (for Hansen's disease 
(leprosy) and tuberculosis, within 3 years; multiple sclerosis, within 7 
years) from the date of separation from service as specified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) Tropical disease. The disease must have become manifest to a 
degree of 10 percent or more within 1 year from date of separation from 
service as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or at a time 
when standard accepted treatises indicate that the incubation period 
commenced during such service.

[[Page 233]]

The resultant disorders or diseases originating because of therapy 
administered in connection with a tropical disease or as a preventative 
may also be service connected.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1112)

    (5) Diseases specific as to former prisoners of war. The diseases 
listed in Sec. 3.309(c) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 
percent or more at any time after discharge or release from active 
service.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1112)

    (6) Diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents. 
(i) For the purposes of this section, the term ``herbicide agent'' means 
a chemical in an herbicide used in support of the United States and 
allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the period 
beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, specifically: 
2,4-D; 2,4,5-T and its contaminant TCDD; cacodylic acid; and picloram.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1116(a)(4))

    (ii) The diseases listed at Sec. 3.309(e) shall have become 
manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service, 
except that chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with 
chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, and acute and subacute peripheral 
neuropathy shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more 
within a year after the last date on which the veteran was exposed to an 
herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service.
    (iii) A veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, 
served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 
9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been 
exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is 
affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to 
any such agent during that service. The last date on which such a 
veteran shall be presumed to have been exposed to an herbicide agent 
shall be the last date on which he or she served in the Republic of 
Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on 
May 7, 1975. ``Service in the Republic of Vietnam'' includes service in 
the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of 
service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a) and 1116(a)(3))

    (b) Evidentiary basis. The factual basis may be established by 
medical evidence, competent lay evidence or both. Medical evidence 
should set forth the physical findings and symptomatology elicited by 
examination within the applicable period. Lay evidence should describe 
the material and relevant facts as to the veteran's disability observed 
within such period, not merely conclusions based upon opinion. The 
chronicity and continuity factors outlined in Sec. 3.303(b) will be 
considered. The diseases listed in Sec. 3.309(a) will be accepted as 
chronic, even though diagnosed as acute because of insidious inception 
and chronic development, except: (1) Where they result from intercurrent 
causes, for example, cerebral hemorrhage due to injury, or active 
nephritis or acute endocarditis due to intercurrent infection (with or 
without identification of the pathogenic micro-organism); or (2) where a 
disease is the result of drug ingestion or a complication of some other 
condition not related to service. Thus, leukemia will be accepted as a 
chronic disease whether diagnosed as acute or chronic. Unless the 
clinical picture is clear otherwise, consideration will be given as to 
whether an acute condition is an exacerbation of a chronic disease.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1112)

    (c) Prohibition of certain presumptions. No presumptions may be 
invoked on the basis of advancement of the disease when first definitely 
diagnosed for the purpose of showing its existence to a degree of 10 
percent within the applicable period. This will not be interpreted as 
requiring that the disease be diagnosed in the presumptive period, but 
only that there be then shown by acceptable medical or lay evidence 
characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree, 
followed without unreasonable time lapse by definite diagnosis. 
Symptomatology shown in

[[Page 234]]

the prescribed period may have no particular significance when first 
observed, but in the light of subsequent developments it may gain 
considerable significance. Cases in which a chronic condition is shown 
to exist within a short time following the applicable presumptive 
period, but without evidence of manifestations within the period, should 
be developed to determine whether there was symptomatology which in 
retrospect may be identified and evaluated as manifestation of the 
chronic disease to the required 10-percent degree.
    (d) Rebuttal of service incurrence or aggravation. (1) Evidence 
which may be considered in rebuttal of service incurrence of a disease 
listed in Sec. 3.309 will be any evidence of a nature usually accepted 
as competent to indicate the time of existence or inception of disease, 
and medical judgment will be exercised in making determinations relative 
to the effect of intercurrent injury or disease. The expression 
``affirmative evidence to the contrary'' will not be taken to require a 
conclusive showing, but such showing as would, in sound medical 
reasoning and in the consideration of all evidence of record, support a 
conclusion that the disease was not incurred in service. As to tropical 
diseases the fact that the veteran had no service in a locality having a 
high incidence of the disease may be considered as evidence to rebut the 
presumption, as may residence during the period in question in a region 
where the particular disease is endemic. The known incubation periods of 
tropical diseases should be used as a factor in rebuttal of presumptive 
service connection as showing inception before or after service.
    (2) The presumption of aggravation provided in this section may be 
rebutted by affirmative evidence that the preexisting condition was not 
aggravated by service, which may include affirmative evidence that any 
increase in disability was due to an intercurrent disease or injury 
suffered after separation from service or evidence sufficient, under 
Sec. 3.306 of this part, to show that the increase in disability was 
due to the natural progress of the preexisting condition.

Sec. 3.308  Presumptive service connection; peacetime service before January 1, 1947.

    (a) Chronic disease. There is no provision for presumptive service 
connection for chronic disease as distinguished from tropical diseases 
referred to in paragraph (b) of this section based on peacetime service 
before January 1, 1947.
    (b) Tropical disease. In claims based on peacetime service before 
January 1, 1947, a veteran of 6 months or more service who contracts a 
tropical disease listed in Sec. 3.309(b) or a resultant disorder or 
disease originating because of therapy administered in connection with a 
tropical disease or as a preventative, will be considered to have 
incurred such disability in service when it is shown to exist to the 
degree of 10 percent or more within 1 year after separation from active 
service, or at a time when standard and accepted treatises indicate that 
the incubation period commenced during active service unless shown by 
clear and unmistakable evidence not to have been of service origin. The 
requirement of 6 months or more service means active, continuous 
service, during one or more enlistment periods.

Sec. 3.310  Disabilities that are proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury.

    (a) General. Except as provided in Sec. 3.300(c), disability which 
is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or 
injury shall be service connected. When service connection is thus 
established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be 
considered a part of the original condition.
    (b) Aggravation of nonservice-connected disabilities. Any increase 
in severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury that is 
proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or 
injury, and not due to the natural progress of the nonservice-connected 
disease, will be service connected. However, VA will not concede that a 
nonservice-connected disease or injury was aggravated by a service-
connected disease or injury unless the baseline level of severity of the 
nonservice-connected disease or injury is established by medical 
evidence created before the onset of aggravation or by the earliest 
medical evidence created at any time between the onset of aggravation 
and the receipt of medical evidence establishing the current level of 
severity of the nonservice-connected disease or injury. The rating 
activity will determine the baseline and current levels of severity 
under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38 CFR part 4) and determine 
the extent of aggravation by deducting the baseline level of severity, 
as well as any increase in severity due to the natural progress of the 
disease, from the current level.

    (c) Cardiovascular disease. Ischemic heart disease or other 
cardiovascular disease developing in a veteran who has a service-
connected amputation of one lower extremity at or above the knee or 
service-connected amputations of both lower extremities at or above the 
ankles, shall be held to be the proximate result of the service-
connected amputation or amputations.

Sec. 3.311  Claims based on exposure to ionizing radiation.

    (a) Determinations of exposure and dose--(1) Dose assessment. In all 
claims in which it is established that a radiogenic disease first became 
manifest after service and was not manifest to a compensable degree 
within any applicable presumptive period as specified in Sec. 3.307 or 
Sec. 3.309, and it is contended the disease is a result of exposure to 
ionizing radiation in service, an assessment will be made as to the size 
and nature of the radiation dose or doses. When dose estimates provided 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section are reported as a range of 
doses to which a veteran may have been exposed, exposure at the highest 
level of the dose range reported will be presumed.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (2) Request for dose information. Where necessary pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, dose information will be requested as 
follows:
    (i) Atmospheric nuclear weapons test participation claims. In claims 
based upon participation in atmospheric nuclear testing, dose data will 
in all cases be requested from the appropriate office of the Department 
of Defense.
    (ii) Hiroshima and Nagasaki occupation claims. In all claims based 
on participation in the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, 
Japan, prior to July 1, 1946, dose data will be requested from the 
Department of Defense.
    (iii) Other exposure claims. In all other claims involving radiation 
exposure, a request will be made for any available records concerning 
the veteran's exposure to radiation. These records normally include but 
may not be limited to the veteran's Record of Occupational Exposure to 
Ionizing Radiation (DD Form 1141), if maintained, service medical 
records, and other records which may contain information pertaining to 
the veteran's radiation dose in service. All such records will be 
forwarded to the Under Secretary for Health, who will be responsible for 
preparation of a dose estimate, to the extent feasible, based on 
available methodologies.
    (3) Referral to independent expert. When necessary to reconcile a 
material

[[Page 240]]

difference between an estimate of dose, from a credible source, 
submitted by or on behalf of a claimant, and dose data derived from 
official military records, the estimates and supporting documentation 
shall be referred to an independent expert, selected by the Director of 
the National Institutes of Health, who shall prepare a separate 
radiation dose estimate for consideration in adjudication of the claim. 
For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) The difference between the claimant's estimate and dose data 
derived from official military records shall ordinarily be considered 
material if one estimate is at least double the other estimate.
    (ii) A dose estimate shall be considered from a ``credible source'' 
if prepared by a person or persons certified by an appropriate 
professional body in the field of health physics, nuclear medicine or 
radiology and if based on analysis of the facts and circumstances of the 
particular claim.
    (4) Exposure. In cases described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section:
    (i) If military records do not establish presence at or absence from 
a site at which exposure to radiation is claimed to have occurred, the 
veteran's presence at the site will be conceded.
    (ii) Neither the veteran nor the veteran's survivors may be required 
to produce evidence substantiating exposure if the information in the 
veteran's service records or other records maintained by the Department 
of Defense is consistent with the claim that the veteran was present 
where and when the claimed exposure occurred.
    (b) Initial review of claims. (1) When it is determined:
    (i) A veteran was exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of 
participation in the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, the 
occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, from September 1945 until 
July 1946, or other activities as claimed;
    (ii) The veteran subsequently developed a radiogenic disease; and
    (iii) Such disease first became manifest within the period specified 
in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; before its adjudication the claim 
will be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits for further 
consideration in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If any 
of the foregoing 3 requirements has not been met, it shall not be 
determined that a disease has resulted from exposure to ionizing 
radiation under such circumstances.
    (2) For purposes of this section the term ``radiogenic disease'' 
means a disease that may be induced by ionizing radiation and shall 
include the following:
    (i) All forms of leukemia except chronic lymphatic (lymphocytic) 
leukemia;
    (ii) Thyroid cancer;
    (iii) Breast cancer;
    (iv) Lung cancer;
    (v) Bone cancer;
    (vi) Liver cancer;
    (vii) Skin cancer;
    (viii) Esophageal cancer;
    (ix) Stomach cancer;
    (x) Colon cancer;
    (xi) Pancreatic cancer;
    (xii) Kidney cancer;
    (xiii) Urinary bladder cancer;
    (xiv) Salivary gland cancer;
    (xv) Multiple myeloma;
    (xvi) Posterior subcapsular cataracts;
    (xvii) Non-malignant thyroid nodular disease;
    (xviii) Ovarian cancer;
    (xix) Parathyroid adenoma;
    (xx) Tumors of the brain and central nervous system;
    (xxi) Cancer of the rectum;
    (xxii) Lymphomas other than Hodgkin's disease;
    (xxiii) Prostate cancer; and
    (xxiv) Any other cancer.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (3) Public Law 98-542 requires VA to determine whether sound medical 
and scientific evidence supports establishing a rule identifying 
polycythemia vera as a radiogenic disease. VA has determined that sound 
medical and scientific evidence does not support including polycythemia 
vera on the list of known radiogenic diseases in this regulation. Even 
so, VA will consider a claim based on the assertion that polycythemia 
vera is a radiogenic disease under the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section. (Authority: Pub. L. 98-542, section 5(b)(2)(A)(i), (iii)).

[[Page 241]]

    (4) If a claim is based on a disease other than one of those listed 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, VA shall nevertheless consider the 
claim under the provisions of this section provided that the claimant 
has cited or submitted competent scientific or medical evidence that the 
claimed condition is a radiogenic disease.
    (5) For the purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
    (i) Bone cancer must become manifest within 30 years after exposure;
    (ii) Leukemia may become manifest at any time after exposure;
    (iii) Posterior subcapsular cataracts must become manifest 6 months 
or more after exposure; and
    (iv) Other diseases specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
must become manifest 5 years or more after exposure.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501; Pub. L. 98-542)

    (c) Review by Under Secretary for Benefits. (1) When a claim is 
forwarded for review pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
Under Secretary for Benefits shall consider the claim with reference to 
the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section and may request 
an advisory medical opinion from the Under Secretary for Health.
    (i) If after such consideration the Under Secretary for Benefits is 
convinced sound scientific and medical evidence supports the conclusion 
it is at least as likely as not the veteran's disease resulted from 
exposure to radiation in service, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall 
so inform the regional office of jurisdiction in writing. The Under 
Secretary for Benefits shall set forth the rationale for this 
conclusion, including an evaluation of the claim under the applicable 
factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (ii) If the Under Secretary for Benefits determines there is no 
reasonable possibility that the veteran's disease resulted from 
radiation exposure in service, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall so 
inform the regional office of jurisidiction in writing, setting forth 
the rationale for this conclusion.
    (2) If the Under Secretary for Benefits, after considering any 
opinion of the Under Secretary for Health, is unable to conclude whether 
it is at least as likely as not, or that there is no reasonable 
possibility, the veteran's disease resulted from radiation exposure in 
service, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall refer the matter to an 
outside consultant in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, ``sound 
scientific evidence'' means observations, findings, or conclusions which 
are statistically and epidemiologically valid, are statistically 
significant, are capable of replication, and withstand peer review, and 
``sound medical evidence'' means observations, findings, or conclusions 
which are consistent with current medical knowledge and are so 
reasonable and logical as to serve as the basis of management of a 
medical condition.
    (d) Referral to outside consultants. (1) Referrals pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section shall be to consultants selected by the 
Under Secretary for Health from outside VA, upon the recommendation of 
the Director of the National Cancer Institute. The consultant will be 
asked to evaluate the claim and provide an opinion as to the likelihood 
the disease is a result of exposure as claimed.
    (2) The request for opinion shall be in writing and shall include a 
description of:
    (i) The disease, including the specific cell type and stage, if 
known, and when the disease first became manifest;
    (ii) The circumstances, including date, of the veteran's exposure;
    (iii) The veteran's age, gender, and pertinent family history;
    (iv) The veteran's history of exposure to known carcinogens, 
occupationally or otherwise;
    (v) Evidence of any other effects radiation exposure may have had on 
the veteran; and
    (vi) Any other information relevant to determination of causation of 
the veteran's disease.

The Under Secretary for Benefits shall forward, with the request, copies 
of pertinent medical records and, where available, dose assessments from 
official sources, from credible sources as defined in paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this

[[Page 242]]

section, and from an independent expert pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.
    (3) The consultant shall evaluate the claim under the factors 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section and respond in writing, 
stating whether it is either likely, unlikely, or approximately as 
likely as not the veteran's disease resulted from exposure to ionizing 
radiation in service. The response shall set forth the rationale for the 
consultant's conclusion, including the consultant's evaluation under the 
applicable factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The Under 
Secretary for Benefits shall review the consultant's response and 
transmit it with any comments to the regional office of jurisdiction for 
use in adjudication of the claim.
    (e) Factors for consideration. Factors to be considered in 
determining whether a veteran's disease resulted from exposure to 
ionizing radiation in service include:
    (1) The probable dose, in terms of dose type, rate and duration as a 
factor in inducing the disease, taking into account any known 
limitations in the dosimetry devices employed in its measurement or the 
methodologies employed in its estimation;
    (2) The relative sensitivity of the involved tissue to induction, by 
ionizing radiation, of the specific pathology;
    (3) The veteran's gender and pertinent family history;
    (4) The veteran's age at time of exposure;
    (5) The time-lapse between exposure and onset of the disease; and
    (6) The extent to which exposure to radiation, or other carcinogens, 
outside of service may have contributed to development of the disease.
    (f) Adjudication of claim. The determination of service connection 
will be made under the generally applicable provisions of this part, 
giving due consideration to all evidence of record, including any 
opinion provided by the Under Secretary for Health or an outside 
consultant, and to the evaluations published pursuant to Sec. 1.17 of 
this title. With regard to any issue material to consideration of a 
claim, the provisions of Sec. 3.102 of this title apply.
    (g) Willful misconduct and supervening cause. In no case will 
service connection be established if the disease is due to the veteran's 
own willful misconduct, or if there is affirmative evidence to establish 
that a supervening, nonservice-related condition or event is more likely 
the cause of the disease.

Sec. 3.312  Cause of death.

    (a) General. The death of a veteran will be considered as having 
been due to a service-connected disability when the evidence establishes 
that such disability was either the principal or a contributory cause of 
death. The issue involved will be determined by exercise of sound 
judgment, without recourse to speculation, after a careful analysis has 
been made of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of 
the veteran, including, particularly, autopsy reports.
    (b) Principal cause of death. The service-connected disability will 
be considered as the principal (primary) cause of death when such 
disability, singly or jointly with some other condition, was the 
immediate or underlying cause of death or was etiologically related 
thereto.
    (c) Contributory cause of death. (1) Contributory cause of death is 
inherently one not related to the principal cause. In determining 
whether the service-connected disability contributed to death, it must 
be shown that it contributed substantially or materially; that it 
combined to cause death; that it aided or lent assistance to the 
production of death. It is not sufficient to show that it casually 
shared in producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a 
causal connection.
    (2) Generally, minor service-connected disabilities, particularly 
those of a static nature or not materially affecting a vital organ, 
would not be held to have contributed to death primarily due to 
unrelated disability. In the same

[[Page 243]]

category there would be included service-connected disease or injuries 
of any evaluation (even though evaluated as 100 percent disabling) but 
of a quiescent or static nature involving muscular or skeletal functions 
and not materially affecting other vital body functions.
    (3) Service-connected diseases or injuries involving active 
processes affecting vital organs should receive careful consideration as 
a contributory cause of death, the primary cause being unrelated, from 
the viewpoint of whether there were resulting debilitating effects and 
general impairment of health to an extent that would render the person 
materially less capable of resisting the effects of other disease or 
injury primarily causing death. Where the service-connected condition 
affects vital organs as distinguished from muscular or skeletal 
functions and is evaluated as 100 percent disabling, debilitation may be 
assumed.
    (4) There are primary causes of death which by their very nature are 
so overwhelming that eventual death can be anticipated irrespective of 
coexisting conditions, but, even in such cases, there is for 
consideration whether there may be a reasonable basis for holding that a 
service-connected condition was of such severity as to have a material 
influence in accelerating death. In this situation, however, it would 
not generally be reasonable to hold that a service-connected condition 
accelerated death unless such condition affected a vital organ and was 
of itself of a progressive or debilitating nature.

Sec. 3.313  Claims based on service in Vietnam.

    (a) Service in Vietnam. Service in Vietnam includes service in the 
waters offshore, or service in other locations if the conditions of 
service involved duty or visitation in Vietnam.
    (b) Service connection based on service in Vietnam. Service in 
Vietnam during the Vietnam Era together with the development of non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma manifested subsequent to such service is sufficient 
to establish service connection for that disease.

Sec. 3.314  Basic pension determinations.

    (a) Prior to the Mexican border period. While pensions are granted 
based on certain service prior to the Mexican border period, the only 
rating factors in claims therefor are:
    (1) Claims based on service of less than 90 days in the Spanish-
American War require a rating determination as to whether the veteran 
was discharged or released from service for a service-connected 
disability or had at the time of separation from service a service-
connected disability, shown by official service records, which in 
medical judgment would have warranted a discharge for disability. 
Eligibility in such cases requires a finding that the disability was 
incurred in or aggravated by service in line of duty without benefit of 
presumptive provisions of law or Department of Veterans Affairs 
regulations.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1512)

    (2) Veterans entitled to pension on the basis of service in the 
Spanish-American War may be entitled to an increased rate of pension if 
rated as being in need of regular aid and attendance. Veterans who have 
elected pension under Pub. L. 86-211 (73 Stat. 432) who are not rated as 
being in need of regular aid and attendance may be entitled to increased 
pension based on 100 percent permanent disability together with 
independent disability of 60 percent or more or by reason of being 
permanently housebound as provided in Sec. 3.351 (d).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1502 (b), (c), 512)

    (b) Mexican border period and later war periods. Non-service-
connected disability and death pension may be paid based on service in 
the Mexican border period, World War I, World War II, the Korean 
conflict and the Vietnam era. Rating determinations in such claims

[[Page 244]]

will be required in the following situations:
    (1) Claims based on service of less than 90 days may require a 
determination as to whether the veteran was discharged or released from 
service for a service-connected disability or had at the time of 
separation from service a service-connected disability, shown by 
official service records, which in medical judgment would have warranted 
a discharge for disability. Eligibility in such cases requires a finding 
that the disability was incurred in or aggravated by service in line of 
duty without benefit of presumptive provisions of law or Department of 
Veterans Affairs regulations (38 U.S.C. 1521(g)(2)) unless, in the case 
of death pension, the veteran was, at the time of death, receiving (or 
entitled to receive) compensation or retirement pay based upon a wartime 
service-connected disability.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1541(a) and 1542(a))

    (2) Determinations of permanent total disability for pension 
purposes will be based on non-service-connected disability or combined 
non-service-connected and service-connected disabilities not the result 
of willful misconduct. However, for pension under Pub. L. 86-211 (73 
Stat. 432), permanent and total disability will be presumed where the 
veteran has attained age 65 or effective January 1, 1977, where the 
veteran became unemployable after age 65.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1502(a), 1523(a))

    (3) Veterans entitled to nonservice-connected disability pension may 
be entitled to an increased rate of pension if rated as being in need of 
regular aid and attendance. Veterans entitled to protected pension or 
pension under Pub. L. 86-211 (73 Stat. 432) who are not rated as being 
in need of regular aid and attendance may be entitled to increased 
pension based on a 100 percent permanent disability together with 
independent disability of 60 percent or more or by reason of being 
permanently housebound as provided in Sec. 3.351 (d) or (e).

Sec. 3.315  Basic eligibility determinations; dependents, loans, education.

    (a) Child over 18 years. A child of a veteran may be considered a 
``child'' after age 18 for purposes of benefits under title 38, United 
States Code (except ch. 19 and sec. 8502(b) of ch. 85), if found by a 
rating determination to have become, prior to age 18, permanently 
incapable of self-support.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 101(4)(B))

    (b) Loans. If a veteran of World War II the Korean conflict or the 
Vietnam era had less than 90 days of service, or if a veteran who served 
after July 25, 1947, and prior to June 27, 1950, or after January 31, 
1955, and prior to August 5, 1964, or after May 7, 1975, has less than 
181 days of service on active duty as defined in Sec. Sec. 36.4301 and 
36.4501, eligibility of the veteran for a loan under 38 U.S.C. ch. 37 
requires a determination that the veteran was discharged or released 
because of a service-connected disability or that the official service 
department records show that he or she had at the time of separation 
from service a service-connected disability which in medical judgment 
would have warranted a discharge for disability. These determinations 
are subject to the presumption of incurrence under Sec. 3.304(b). 
Determinations based on World War II, Korean conflict and Vietnam era 
service are also subject to the presumption of aggravation under Sec. 
3.306(b) while determination based on service on or after February 1, 
1955, and before August 5, 1964, or after May 7, 1975, are subject to 
the presumption of aggravation under Sec. 3.306 (a) and (c). The 
provisions of this paragraph are also applicable, regardless of length 
of service, in determining eligibility to the maximum period of 
entitlement based on discharge or release for a service-connected 
disability. (See also

the minimum service requirements of Sec. 3.12a.)


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3702, 3707)

    (c) Veterans' educational assistance. (1) A determination is 
required as to whether a veteran was discharged or released from active 
duty service because of a service-connected disability (or whether the 
official service department records show that the veteran had at time of 
separation from service a service-connected disability which in medical 
judgment would have warranted discharge for disability) whenever any of 
the following circumstances exist:
    (i) The veteran applies for benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 32, the 
minimum active duty service requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5303A apply to him 
or her, and the veteran would be eligible for such benefits only if--
    (A) He or she was discharged or released from active duty for a 
disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty, or
    (B) He or she has a disability that VA has determined to be 
compensable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 11; or
    (ii) The veteran applies for benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 
and--
    (A) The evidence of record does not clearly show either that the 
veteran was discharged or released from active duty for disability or 
that the veteran's discharge or release from active duty was unrelated 
to disability, and
    (B) The veteran is eligible for basic educational assistance except 
for the minimum length of active duty service requirements of Sec. 
21.7042(a) or Sec. 21.7044(a) of this chapter.
    (2) A determination is required as to whether a veteran was 
discharged or released from service in the Selected Reserve for a 
service-connected disability or for a medical condition which preexisted 
the veteran's having become a member of the Selected Reserve and which 
VA determines is not service connected when the veteran applies for 
benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 and--
    (i) Either the veteran would be eligible for basic educational 
assistance under that chapter only if he or she was discharged from the 
Selected Reserve for a service-connected disability, or for a medical 
condition which preexisted the veteran's having become a member of the 
Selected Reserve and which VA finds is not service connected, or
    (ii) The veteran is entitled to basic educational assistance and 
would be entitled to receive it at the rates stated in Sec. 21.7136(a) 
or Sec. 21.7137(a) of this chapter only if he or she was discharged 
from the Selected Reserve for a service-connected disability or for a 
medical condition which preexisted the veteran's having become a member 
of the Selected Reserve and which VA finds is not service connected.
    (3) A determination is required as to whether a reservist has been 
unable to pursue a program of education due to a disability which has 
been incurred in or aggravated by service in the Selected Reserve when--
    (i) The reservist is otherwise entitled to educational assistance 
under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, and
    (ii) He or she applies for an extension of his or her eligibility 
period.
    (4) The determinations required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) 
of this section are subject to the presumptions of incurrence under 
Sec. 3.304(b) and aggravation under Sec. 3.306 (a) and (c) of this 
part, based on service rendered after May 7, 1975.

of a chronic form of laryngitis, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma or 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
    (3) Full-body exposure to nitrogen mustard during active military 
service together with the subsequent development of acute nonlymphocytic 
leukemia.
    (b) Service connection will not be established under this section if 
the claimed condition is due to the veteran's own willful misconduct

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, VA will 
pay compensation in accordance with chapter 11 of title 38, United 
States Code, to a Persian Gulf veteran who exhibits objective 
indications of a qualifying chronic disability, provided that such 
disability:
    (i) Became manifest either during active military, naval, or air 
service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian 
Gulf War, or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 
31, 2011; and
    (ii) By history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot 
be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis.
    (2)(i) For purposes of this section, a qualifying chronic disability 
means a chronic disability resulting from any of the following (or any 
combination of the following):
    (A) An undiagnosed illness;
    (B) The following medically unexplained chronic multisymptom 
illnesses that are defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms:
    (1) Chronic fatigue syndrome;
    (2) Fibromyalgia;
    (3) Irritable bowel syndrome; or
    (4) Any other illness that the Secretary determines meets the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for a medically 
unexplained chronic multisymptom illness; or
    (C) Any diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines in 
regulations prescribed under 38 U.S.C. 1117(d) warrants a presumption of 
service-connection.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, the term medically unexplained 
chronic multisymptom illness means a diagnosed illness without 
conclusive pathophysiology or etiology, that is characterized by 
overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, 
disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent 
demonstration of laboratory abnormalities. Chronic multisymptom 
illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology will not 
be considered medically unexplained.
    (3) For purposes of this section, ``objective indications of chronic 
disability'' include both ``signs,'' in the medical sense of objective 
evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical 
indicators that are capable of independent verification.
    (4) For purposes of this section, disabilities that have existed for 
6 months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of 
improvement and worsening over a 6-month period will be considered 
chronic. The 6-month period of chronicity will be measured from the 
earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs 
or symptoms of the disability first became manifest.
    (5) A chronic disability resulting from an undiagnosed illness 
referred to in this section shall be rated using evaluation criteria 
from part 4 of this chapter for a disease or injury in which the 
functions affected, anatomical localization, or symptomatology are 
similar.
    (6) A disability referred to in this section shall be considered 
service connected for purposes of all laws of the United States.
    (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, signs or 
symptoms which may be manifestations of

[[Page 247]]

undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multisymptom 
illness include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Fatigue
    (2) Signs or symptoms involving skin
    (3) Headache
    (4) Muscle pain
    (5) Joint pain
    (6) Neurologic signs or symptoms

lower)
    (9) Sleep disturbances
    (10) Gastrointestinal signs or symptoms
    (11) Cardiovascular signs or symptoms
    (12) Abnormal weight loss
    (13) Menstrual disorders.
    (c) Compensation shall not be paid under this section:
    (1) If there is affirmative evidence that an undiagnosed illness was 
not incurred during active military, naval, or air service in the 
Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War; or
    (2) If there is affirmative evidence that an undiagnosed illness was 
caused by a supervening condition or event that occurred between the 
veteran's most recent departure from active duty in the Southwest Asia 
theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War and the onset of the 
illness; or
    (3) If there is affirmative evidence that the illness is the result 
of the veteran's own willful misconduct or the abuse of alcohol or 
drugs.
    (d) For purposes of this section:
    (1) The term Persian Gulf veteran means a veteran who served on 
active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of 
operations during the Persian Gulf War.
    (2) The Southwest Asia theater of operations includes Iraq, Kuwait, 
Saudi Arabia, the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, 
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of

    (a) Use of rating schedule. The 1945 Schedule for Rating 
Disabilities will be used for evaluating the degree of disabilities in 
claims for disability compensation, disability and death pension, and in 
eligibility determinations. The provisions contained in the rating 
schedule will represent as far as can practicably be determined, the 
average impairment in earning capacity in civil occupations resulting 
from disability.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1155)

    (b) Exceptional cases--(1) Compensation. Ratings shall be based as 
far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity 
with the additional proviso that the Secretary shall from time to time 
readjust this schedule of ratings in accordance with experience. To 
accord justice, therefore, to the exceptional case where the schedular 
evaluations are found to be inadequate, the Under Secretary for Benefits 
or the Director, Compensation and Pension Service, upon field station 
submission, is authorized to approve on the basis of the criteria set 
forth in this paragraph an extra-schedular evaluation commensurate with 
the average earning capacity impairment due exclusively to the service-
connected disability or disabilities. The governing norm in these 
exceptional cases is: A finding that the case presents such an 
exceptional or unusual disability picture with such related factors as 
marked interference with employment or frequent periods of 
hospitalization as to render impractical the application of the regular 
schedular standards.
    (2) Pension. Where the evidence of record establishes that an 
applicant for pension who is basically eligible fails

[[Page 248]]

to meet the disability requirements based on the percentage standards of 
the rating schedule but is found to be unemployable by reason of his or 
her disability(ies), age, occupational background and other related 
factors, the following are authorized to approve on an extra-schedular 
basis a permanent and total disability rating for pension purposes: the 
Veterans Service Center Manager; or where regular schedular standards 
are met as of the date of the rating decision, the rating board.
    (3) Effective dates. The effective date of these extra-schedular 
evaluations granting or increasing benefits will be in accordance with 
Sec. 3.400(b)(1) and (2) as to original and reopened claims and in 
accordance with Sec. 3.400(o) in claims for increased benefits.
    (c) Advisory opinion. Cases in which application of the schedule is 
not understood or the propriety of an extra-schedular rating is 
questionable may be submitted to Central Office for advisory opinion.

3.400(b). Effective dates; increases. See Sec. 3.400(o).

Sec. 3.322  Rating of disabilities aggravated by service.

    (a) Aggravation of preservice disability. In cases involving 
aggravation by active service, the rating will reflect only the degree 
of disability over and above the degree of disability existing at the 
time of entrance into active service, whether the particular condition 
was noted at the time of entrance into active service, or whether it is 
determined upon the evidence of record to have existed at that time. It 
is necessary to deduct from the present evaluation the degree, if 
ascertainable, of the disability existing at the time of entrance into 
active service, in terms of the rating schedule except that if the 
disability is total (100 percent) no deduction will be made. If the 
degree of disability at the time of entrance into service is not 
ascertainable in terms of the schedule, no deduction will be made.
    (b) Aggravation of service-connected disability. Where a disease or 
injury incurred in peacetime service is aggravated during service in a 
period of war, or conversely, where a disease or injury incurred in 
service during a period of war is aggravated during peacetime service, 
the entire disability flowing from the disease or injury will be service 
connected based on the war service.

Sec. 3.323  Combined ratings.

    (a) Compensation--(1) Same type of service. When there are two or 
more service-connected compensable disabilities a combined evaluation 
will be made following the tables and rules prescribed in the 1945 
Schedule for Rating Disabilities.
    (2) Wartime and peacetime service. Evaluation of wartime and 
peacetime service-connected compensable disabilities will be combined to 
provide for the payment of wartime rates of compensation. (38 U.S.C. 
1157) Effective July 1, 1973, it is immaterial whether the disabilities 
are wartime or peacetime service-connected since all disabilities are 
compensable under 38 U.S.C. 1114 and 1115 on and after that date.
    (b) Pension--(1) Nonservice-connected disabilities. Evaluation of 
two or more nonservice-connected disabilities not the result of the 
veteran's own willful misconduct will be combined as provided in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (2) Service-connected and nonservice-connected disabilities. 
Evaluations for service-connected disabilities may be combined with 
evaluations for disabilities not shown to be service connected and not 
the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct.

service-connected disabilities of such character as clearly to interfere 
with normal employability, even though none of the disabilities may be 
of compensable degree under the 1945 Schedule for Rating Disabilities 
the rating agency is authorized to apply a 10-percent rating, but not in 
combination with any other rating.

Sec. 3.326  Examinations.

    For purposes of this section, the term examination includes periods 
of hospital observation when required by VA.
    (a) Where there is a claim for disability compensation or pension 
but medical evidence accompanying the claim is not adequate for rating 
purposes, a Department of Veterans Affairs examination will be 
authorized. This paragraph applies to original and reopened claims as 
well as claims for increase submitted by a veteran, surviving spouse, 
parent, or child. Individuals for whom an examination has been scheduled 
are required to report for the examination.
    (b) Provided that it is otherwise adequate for rating purposes, any 
hospital report, or any examination report, from any government or 
private institution may be accepted for rating a claim without further 
examination. However, monetary benefits to a former prisoner of war will 
not be denied unless the claimant has been offered a complete physical 
examination conducted at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital or 
outpatient clinic.
    (c) Provided that it is otherwise adequate for rating purposes, a 
statement from a private physician may be accepted for rating a claim 
without further examination.

Sec. 3.327  Reexaminations.

    (a) General. Reexaminations, including periods of hospital 
observation, will be requested whenever VA determines there is a need to 
verify either the continued existence or the current severity of a 
disability. Generally, reexaminations will be required if it is likely 
that a disability has improved, or if evidence indicates there has been 
a material change in a disability or that the current rating may be 
incorrect. Individuals for whom reexaminations have been authorized and 
scheduled are required to report for such reexaminations. Paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section provide general guidelines for requesting 
reexaminations, but shall not be construed as limiting VA's authority to 
request reexaminations, or periods of hospital observation, at any time 
in order to ensure that a disability is accurately rated.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (b) Compensation cases--(1) Scheduling reexaminations. Assignment of 
a prestabilization rating requires reexamination within the second 6 
months period following separation from service. Following initial 
Department of Veterans Affairs examination, or any scheduled future or 
other examination, reexamination, if in order, will be scheduled within 
not less than 2 years nor more than 5 years within the judgment of the 
rating board, unless another time period is elsewhere specified.
    (2) No periodic future examinations will be requested. In service-
connected cases, no periodic reexamination will be scheduled: (i) When 
the disability is established as static;
    (ii) When the findings and symptoms are shown by examinations 
scheduled in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section or other examinations 
and hospital reports to have persisted without material improvement for 
a period of 5 years or more;
    (iii) Where the disability from disease is permanent in character 
and of such nature that there is no likelihood of improvement;
    (iv) In cases of veterans over 55 years of age, except under unusual 
circumstances;

[[Page 250]]

    (v) When the rating is a prescribed scheduled minimum rating; or
    (vi) Where a combined disability evaluation would not be affected if 
the future examination should result in reduced evaluation for one or 
more conditions.
    (c) Pension cases. In nonservice-connected cases in which the 
permanent total disability has been confirmed by reexamination or by the 
history of the case, or with obviously static disabilities, further 
reexaminations will not generally be requested. In other cases further 
examination will not be requested routinely and will be accomplished 
only if considered necessary based upon the particular facts of the 
individual case. In the cases of veterans over 55 years of age, 
reexamination will be requested only under unusual circumstances.

Sec. 3.328  lndependent medical opinions.

    (a) General. When warranted by the medical complexity or controversy 
involved in a pending claim, an advisory medical opinion may be obtained 
from one or more medical experts who are not employees of VA. Opinions 
shall be obtained from recognized medical schools, universities, clinics 
or medical institutions with which arrangements for such opinions have 
been made, and an appropriate official of the institution shall select 
the individual expert(s) to render an opinion.
    (b) Requests. A request for an independent medical opinion in 
conjunction with a claim pending at the regional office level may be 
initiated by the office having jurisdiction over the claim, by the 
claimant, or by his or her duly appointed representative. The request 
must be submitted in writing and must set forth in detail the reasons 
why the opinion is necessary. All such requests shall be submitted 
through the Veterans Service Center Manager of the office having 
jurisdiction over the claim, and those requests which in the judgment of 
the Veterans Service Center Manager merit consideration shall be 
referred to the Compensation and Pension Service for approval.
    (c) Approval. Approval shall be granted only upon a determination by 
the Compensation and Pension Service that the issue under consideration 
poses a medical problem of such obscurity or complexity, or has 
generated such controversy in the medical community at large, as to 
justify solicitation of an independent medical opinion. When approval 
has been granted, the Compensation and Pension Service shall obtain the 
opinion. A determination that an independent medical opinion is not 
warranted may be contested only as part of an appeal on the merits of 
the decision rendered on the primary issue by the agency of original 
jurisdiction.
    (d) Notification. The Compensation and Pension Service shall notify 
the claimant when the request for an independent medical opinion has 
been approved with regard to his or her claim and shall furnish the 
claimant with a copy of the opinion when it is received. If, in the 
judgment of the Secretary, disclosure of the independent medical opinion 
would be harmful to the physical or mental health of the claimant, 
disclosure shall be subject to the special procedures set forth in Sec. 
1.577 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 3.340  Total and permanent total ratings and unemployability.

    (a) Total disability ratings--(1) General. Total disability will be 
considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body 
which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to 
follow a substantially gainful occupation. Total disability may or may 
not be permanent. Total ratings will not be assigned, generally, for 
temporary exacerbations or acute infectious diseases except where 
specifically prescribed by the schedule.
    (2) Schedule for rating disabilities. Total ratings are authorized 
for any disability or combination of disabilities for which the Schedule 
for Rating Disabilities prescribes a 100 percent evaluation or, with 
less disability, where the requirements of paragraph 16, page 5 of the 
rating schedule are present or where, in pension cases, the requirements 
of paragraph 17, page 5 of the schedule are met.
    (3) Ratings of total disability on history. In the case of 
disabilities which have undergone some recent improvement, a rating of 
total disability may be made, provided:
    (i) That the disability must in the past have been of sufficient 
severity to warrant a total disability rating;
    (ii) That it must have required extended, continuous, or 
intermittent hospitalization, or have produced total industrial 
incapacity for at least 1 year, or be subject to recurring, severe, 
frequent, or prolonged exacerbations; and
    (iii) That it must be the opinion of the rating agency that despite 
the recent improvement of the physical condition, the veteran will be 
unable to effect an adjustment into a substantially gainful occupation. 
Due consideration will be given to the frequency and duration of totally 
incapacitating exacerbations since incurrence of the original disease or 
injury, and to periods of hospitalization for treatment in determining 
whether the average person could have reestablished himself or herself 
in a substantially gainful occupation.
    (b) Permanent total disability. Permanence of total disability will 
be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue 
throughout the life of the disabled person. The permanent loss or loss 
of use of both hands, or of both feet, or of one hand and one foot, or 
of the sight of both eyes, or becoming permanently helpless or bedridden 
constitutes permanent total disability. Diseases and injuries of long 
standing which are actually totally incapacitating will be regarded as 
permanently and totally disabling when the probability of permanent 
improvement under treatment is remote. Permanent total disability 
ratings may not be granted as a result of any incapacity from acute 
infectious disease, accident, or injury, unless there is present one of 
the recognized combinations or permanent loss of use of extremities or 
sight, or the person is in the strict sense permanently helpless or 
bedridden, or when it is reasonably certain that a subsidence of the 
acute or temporary symptoms will be followed by irreducible totality of 
disability by way of residuals. The age of the disabled person may be 
considered in determining permanence.
    (c) Insurance ratings. A rating of permanent and total disability 
for insurance purposes will have no effect on ratings for compensation 
or pension.

Sec. 3.341  Total disability ratings for compensation purposes.

    (a) General. Subject to the limitation in paragraph (b) of this 
section, total-disability compensation ratings may be assigned under the 
provisions of Sec. 3.340. However, if the total rating is based on a 
disability or combination of disabilities for which the Schedule for 
Rating Disabilities provides an evaluation of less than 100 percent, it 
must be determined that the service-connected disabilities are 
sufficient to produce unemployability without regard to advancing age.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1155)


[[Page 252]]


    (b) Incarcerated veterans. A total rating for compensation purposes 
based on individual unemployability which would first become effective 
while a veteran is incarcerated in a Federal, State or local penal 
institution for conviction of a felony, shall not be assigned during 
such period of incarceration. However, where a rating for individual 
unemployability exists prior to incarceration for a felony and routine 
review is required, the case will be reconsidered to determine if 
continued eligibility for such rating exists.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5313(c))

    (c) Program for vocational rehabilitation. Each time a veteran is 
rated totally disabled on the basis of individual unemployability during 
the period beginning after January 31, 1985, the Vocational 
Rehabilitation and Employment Service will be notified so that an 
evaluation may be offered to determine whether the achievement of a 
vocational goal by the veteran is reasonably feasible.

<R05>
Sec. 3.342  Permanent and total disability ratings for pension purposes.

    (a) General. Permanent total disability ratings for pension purposes 
are authorized for disabling conditions not the result of the veteran's 
own willful misconduct whether or not they are service connected.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1502(a))

    (b) Criteria. In addition to the criteria for determining total 
disability and permanency of total disability contained in Sec. 3.340, 
the following special considerations apply in pension cases:
    (1) Permanent total disability pension ratings will be authorized 
for congenital, developmental, hereditary or familial conditions, 
provided the other requirements for entitlement are met.
    (2) The permanence of total disability will be established as of the 
earliest date consistent with the evidence in the case. Active pulmonary 
tuberculosis not otherwise established as permanently and totally 
disabling will be presumed so after 6 months' hospitalization without 
improvement. The same principle may be applied with other types of 
disabilities requiring hospitalization for indefinite periods. The need 
for hospitalization for periods shorter or longer than 6 months may be a 
proper basis for determining permanence. Where, in application of this 
principle, it is necessary to employ a waiting period to determine 
permanence of totality of disability and a report received at the end of 
such period shows the veteran's condition is unimproved, permanence may 
be established as of the date of entrance into the hospital. Similarly, 
when active pulmonary tuberculosis is improved after 6 months' 
hospitalization but still diagnosed as active after 12 months' 
hospitalization permanence will also be established as of the date of 
entrance into the hospital. In other cases the rating will be effective 
the date the evidence establishes permanence.
    (3) Special consideration must be given the question of permanence 
in the case of veterans under 40 years of age. For such veterans, 
permanence of total disability requires a finding that the end result of 
treatment and adjustment to residual handicaps (rehabilitation) will be 
permanent disability of the required degree precluding more than 
marginal employment. Severe diseases and injuries, including multiple 
fractures or the amputation of a single extremity, should not be taken 
to establish permanent and total disability until it is shown that the 
veteran after treatment and convalescence, has been unable to secure or 
follow employment because of the disability and through no fault of the 
veteran.
    (4) The following shall not be considered as evidence of 
employability:
    (i) Employment as a member-employer or similar employment obtained 
only in competition with disabled persons.
    (ii) Participation in, or the receipt of a distribution of funds as 
a result of participation in, a therapeutic or rehabilitation activity 
under 38 U.S.C. 1718.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1718(f))


[[Page 253]]


    (5) The authority granted the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. 1502(a)(2) 
to classify as permanent and total those diseases and disorders, the 
nature and extent of which, in the Secretary judgment, will justify such 
determination, will be exercised under Sec. 3.321(b).
    (c) Temporary program of vocational rehabilitation training for 
certain pension recipients. (1) When a veteran under age 45 is awarded 
disability pension during the period beginning on February 1, 1985, and 
ending on December 31, 1995, the Vocational Rehabilitation and 
Employment Division will be notified so that an evaluation may be made, 
as provided in Sec. 21.6050, to determine that veteran's potential for 
rehabilitation.
    (2) If a veteran secures employment within the scope of a vocational 
goal identified in his or her individualized written vocational 
rehabilitation plan, or in a related field which requires reasonably 
developed skills and the use of some or all of the training or services 
furnished the veteran under such plan, not later than one year after 
eligibility to counseling under Sec. 21.6040(b)(1) of this chapter 
expires, the veteran's permanent and total evaluation for pension 
purposes shall not be terminated by reason of the veteran's capacity to 
engage in such employment until the veteran has maintained that 
employment for a period of not less than 12 consecutive months.

Sec. 3.343  Continuance of total disability ratings.

    (a) General. Total disability ratings, when warranted by the 
severity of the condition and not granted purely because of hospital, 
surgical, or home treatment, or individual unemployability will not be 
reduced, in the absence of clear error, without examination showing 
material improvement in physical or mental condition. Examination 
reports showing material improvement must be evaluated in conjunction 
with all the facts of record, and consideration must be given 
particularly to whether the veteran attained improvement under the 
ordinary conditions of life, i.e., while working or actively seeking 
work or whether the symptoms have been brought under control by 
prolonged rest, or generally, by following a regimen which precludes 
work, and, if the latter, reduction from total disability ratings will 
not be considered pending reexamination after a period of employment (3 
to 6 months).
    (b) Tuberculosis; compensation. In service-connected cases, 
evaluations for active or inactive tuberculosis will be governed by the 
Schedule for Rating Disabilities (part 4 of this chapter). Where in the 
opinion of the rating board the veteran at the expiration of the period 
during which a total rating is provided will not be able to maintain 
inactivity of the disease process under the ordinary conditions of life, 
the case will be submitted under Sec. 3.321.
    (c) Individual unemployability. (1) In reducing a rating of 100 
percent service-connected disability based on individual 
unemployability, the provisions of Sec. 3.105(e) are for application 
but caution must be exercised in such a determination that actual 
employability is established by clear and convincing evidence. When in 
such a case the veteran is undergoing vocational rehabilitation, 
education or training, the rating will not be reduced by reason thereof 
unless there is received evidence of marked improvement or recovery in 
physical or mental conditions or of employment progress, income earned, 
and prospects of economic rehabilitation, which demonstrates 
affirmatively the veteran's capacity to pursue the vocation or 
occupation for which the training is intended to qualify him or her, or 
unless the physical or mental demands of the course are obviously 
incompatible with total disability. Neither participation in, nor the 
receipt of remuneration as a result of participation in, a therapeutic 
or rehabilitation activity under 38 U.S.C. 1718 shall be considered 
evidence of employability.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1718(f))

    (2) If a veteran with a total disability rating for compensation 
purposes based on individual unemployability begins

[[Page 254]]

to engage in a substantially gainful occuption during the period 
beginning after January 1, 1985, the veteran's rating may not be reduced 
solely on the basis of having secured and followed such substantially 
gainful occupation unless the veteran maintains the occupation for a 
period of 12 consecutive months. For purposes of this subparagraph, 
temporary interruptions in employment which are of short duration shall 
not be considered breaks in otherwise continuous employment.

Sec. 3.344  Stabilization of disability evaluations.

    (a) Examination reports indicating improvement. Rating agencies will 
handle cases affected by change of medical findings or diagnosis, so as 
to produce the greatest degree of stability of disability evaluations 
consistent with the laws and Department of Veterans Affairs regulations 
governing disability compensation and pension. It is essential that the 
entire record of examinations and the medical-industrial history be 
reviewed to ascertain whether the recent examination is full and 
complete, including all special examinations indicated as a result of 
general examination and the entire case history. This applies to 
treatment of intercurrent diseases and exacerbations, including hospital 
reports, bedside examinations, examinations by designated physicians, 
and examinations in the absence of, or without taking full advantage of, 
laboratory facilities and the cooperation of specialists in related 
lines. Examinations less full and complete than those on which payments 
were authorized or continued will not be used as a basis of reduction. 
Ratings on account of diseases subject to temporary or episodic 
improvement, e.g., manic depressive or other psychotic reaction, 
epilepsy, psychoneurotic reaction, arteriosclerotic heart disease, 
bronchial asthma, gastric or duodenal ulcer, many skin diseases, etc., 
will not be reduced on any one examination, except in those instances 
where all the evidence of record clearly warrants the conclusion that 
sustained improvement has been demonstrated. Ratings on account of 
diseases which become comparatively symptom free (findings absent) after 
prolonged rest, e.g. residuals of phlebitis, arteriosclerotic heart 
disease, etc., will not be reduced on examinations reflecting the 
results of bed rest. Moreover, though material improvement in the 
physical or mental condition is clearly reflected the rating agency will 
consider whether the evidence makes it reasonably certain that the 
improvement will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life. 
When syphilis of the central nervous system or alcoholic deterioration 
is diagnosed following a long prior history of psychosis, 
psychoneurosis, epilepsy, or the like, it is rarely possible to exclude 
persistence, in masked form, of the preceding innocently acquired 
manifestations. Rating boards encountering a change of diagnosis will 
exercise caution in the determination as to whether a change in 
diagnosis represents no more than a progression of an earlier diagnosis, 
an error in prior diagnosis or possibly a disease entity independent of 
the service-connected disability. When the new diagnosis reflects mental 
deficiency or personality disorder only, the possibility of only 
temporary remission of a super-imposed psychiatric disease will be borne 
in mind.
    (b) Doubtful cases. If doubt remains, after according due 
consideration to all the evidence developed by the several items 
discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, the rating agency will 
continue the rating in effect, citing the former diagnosis with the new 
diagnosis in parentheses, and following the appropriate code there will 
be added the reference ``Rating continued pending reexamination ------ 
months from this date, Sec. 3.344.'' The rating agency will determine 
on the basis of the facts in each individual case whether 18, 24 or 30 
months will be allowed to elapse before the reexamination will be made.
    (c) Disabilities which are likely to improve. The provisions of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to ratings

[[Page 255]]

which have continued for long periods at the same level (5 years or 
more). They do not apply to disabilities which have not become 
stabilized and are likely to improve. Reexaminations disclosing 
improvement, physical or mental, in these disabilities will warrant 
reduction in rating.

                      Ratings for Special Purposes


<R05>
Sec. 3.350  Special monthly compensation ratings.

    The rates of special monthly compensation stated in this section are 
those provided under 38 U.S.C. 1114.
    (a) Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k). Special monthly compensation 
under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) is payable for each anatomical loss or loss of 
use of one hand, one foot, both buttocks, one or more creative organs, 
blindness of one eye having only light perception, deafness of both 
ears, having absence of air and bone conduction, complete organic 
aphonia with constant inability to communicate by speech or, in the case 
of a woman veteran, loss of 25% or more of tissue from a single breast 
or both breasts in combination (including loss by mastectomy or partial 
mastectomy), or following receipt of radiation treatment of breast 
tissue. This special compensation is payable in addition to the basic 
rate of compensation otherwise payable on the basis of degree of 
disability, provided that the combined rate of compensation does not 
exceed the monthly rate set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) when authorized 
in conjunction with any of the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1114 (a) through 
(j) or (s). When there is entitlement under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l) through 
(n) or an intermediate rate under (p) such additional allowance is 
payable for each such anatomical loss or loss of use existing in 
addition to the requirements for the basic rates, provided the total 
does not exceed the monthly rate set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1114(o). The 
limitations on the maximum compensation payable under this paragraph are 
independent of and do not preclude payment of additional compensation 
for dependents under 38 U.S.C. 1115, or the special allowance for aid 
and attendance provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(r).
    (1) Creative organ. (i) Loss of a creative organ will be shown by 
acquired absence of one or both testicles (other than undescended 
testicles) or ovaries or other creative organ. Loss of use of one 
testicle will be established when examination by a board finds that:
    (a) The diameters of the affected testicle are reduced to one-third 
of the corresponding diameters of the paired normal testicle, or
    (b) The diameters of the affected testicle are reduced to one-half 
or less of the corresponding normal testicle and there is alteration of 
consistency so that the affected testicle is considerably harder or 
softer than the corresponding normal testicle; or
    (c) If neither of the conditions (a) or (b) is met, when a biopsy, 
recommended by a board including a genitourologist and accepted by the 
veteran, establishes the absence of spermatozoa.
    (ii) When loss or loss of use of a creative organ resulted from 
wounds or other trauma sustained in service, or resulted from operations 
in service for the relief of other conditions, the creative organ 
becoming incidentally involved, the benefit may be granted.
    (iii) Loss or loss of use traceable to an elective operation 
performed subsequent to service, will not establish entitlement to the 
benefit. If, however, the operation after discharge was required for the 
correction of a specific injury caused by a preceding operation in 
service, it will support authorization of the benefit. When the 
existence of disability is established meeting the above requirements 
for nonfunctioning testicle due to operation after service, resulting in 
loss of use, the benefit may be granted even though the operation is one 
of election. An operation is not considered to be one of election where 
it is advised on sound medical judgment for the relief of a pathological 
condition or to prevent possible future pathological consequences.
    (iv) Atrophy resulting from mumps followed by orchitis in service is 
service connected. Since atrophy is usually perceptible within 1 to 6 
months after infection subsides, an examination

[[Page 256]]

more than 6 months after the subsidence of orchitis demonstrating a 
normal genitourinary system will be considered in determining rebuttal 
of service incurrence of atrophy later demonstrated. Mumps not followed 
by orchitis in service will not suffice as the antecedent cause of 
subsequent atrophy for the purpose of authorizing the benefit.
    (2) Foot and hand. (i) Loss of use of a hand or a foot will be held 
to exist when no effective function remains other than that which would 
be equally well served by an amputation stump at the site of election 
below elbow or knee with use of a suitable prosthetic appliance. The 
determination will be made on the basis of the actual remaining 
function, whether the acts of grasping, manipulation, etc., in the case 
of the hand, or of balance, propulsion, etc., in the case of the foot, 
could be accomplished equally well by an amputation stump with 
prosthesis; for example:
    (a) Extremely unfavorable complete ankylosis of the knee, or 
complete ankylosis of two major joints of an extremity, or shortening of 
the lower extremity of 3\1/2\ inches or more, will constitute loss of 
use of the hand or foot involved.
    (b) Complete paralysis of the external popliteal nerve (common 
peroneal) and consequent footdrop, accompanied by characteristic organic 
changes including trophic and circulatory disturbances and other 
concomitants confirmatory of complete paralysis of this nerve, will be 
taken as loss of use of the foot.
    (3) Both buttocks. (i) Loss of use of both buttocks shall be deemed 
to exist when there is severe damage by disease or injury to muscle 
group XVII, bilateral, (diagnostic code 5317) and additional disability 
making it impossible for the disabled person, without assistance, to 
rise from a seated position and from a stooped position (fingers to toes 
position) and to maintain postural stability (the pelvis upon head of 
femur). The assistance may be done by the person's own hands or arms, 
and, in the matter of postural stability, by a special appliance.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1114(k))

    (ii) Special monthly compensation for loss or loss of use of both 
lower extremities (38 U.S.C. 1114(l) through (n)) will not preclude 
additional compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) for loss of use of both 
buttocks where appropriate tests clearly substantiate that there is such 
additional loss.
    (4) Eye. Loss of use or blindness of one eye, having only light 
perception, will be held to exist when there is inability to recognize 
test letters at 1 foot and when further examination of the eye reveals 
that perception of objects, hand movements, or counting fingers cannot 
be accomplished at 3 feet. Lesser extents of vision, particularly 
perception of objects, hand movements, or counting fingers at distances 
less than 3 feet is considered of negligible utility.
    (5) Deafness. Deafness of both ears, having absence of air and bone 
conduction will be held to exist where examination in a Department of 
Veterans Affairs authorized audiology clinic under current testing 
criteria shows bilateral hearing loss is equal to or greater than the 
minimum bilateral hearing loss required for a maximum rating evaluation 
under the rating schedule.


(Authority: Pub. L. 88-20)

    (6) Aphonia. Complete organic aphonia will be held to exist where 
there is a disability of the organs of speech which constantly precludes 
communication by speech.


(Authority: Pub. L. 88-22)

    (b) Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114(l). The special monthly 
compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) is payable for anatomical 
loss or loss of use of both feet, one hand and one foot, blindness in 
both eyes with visual acuity of 5/200 or less or being permanently 
bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance.
    (1) Extremities. The criteria for loss and loss of use of an 
extremity contained in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are applicable.
    (2) Eyes, bilateral. 5/200 visual acuity or less bilaterally 
qualifies for entitlement under 38 U.S.C. 1114(l). However, evaluation 
of 5/200 based on acuity in excess of that degree but less than 10/

[[Page 257]]

200 (Sec. 4.83 of this chapter), does not qualify. Concentric 
contraction of the field of vision beyond 5 degrees in both eyes is the 
equivalent of 5/200 visual acuity.
    (3) Need for aid and attendance. The criteria for determining that a 
veteran is so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance 
are contained in Sec. 3.352(a).
    (4) Permanently bedridden. The criteria for rating are contained in 
Sec. 3.352(a). Where possible, determinations should be on the basis of 
permanently bedridden rather than for need of aid and attendance (except 
where 38 U.S.C. 1114(r) is involved) to avoid reduction during 
hospitalization where aid and attendance is provided in kind.
    (c) Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114(m). (1) The special monthly 
compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(m) is payable for any of the 
following conditions:
    (i) Anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands;
    (ii) Anatomical loss or loss of use of both legs at a level, or with 
complications, preventing natural knee action with prosthesis in place;
    (iii) Anatomical loss or loss of use of one arm at a level, or with 
complications, preventing natural elbow action with prosthesis in place 
with anatomical loss or loss of use of one leg at a level, or with 
complications, preventing natural knee action with prosthesis in place;
    (iv) Blindness in both eyes having only light perception;
    (v) Blindness in both eyes leaving the veteran so helpless as to be 
in need of regular aid and attendance.
    (2) Natural elbow or knee action. In determining whether there is 
natural elbow or knee action with prosthesis in place, consideration 
will be based on whether use of the proper prosthetic appliance requires 
natural use of the joint, or whether necessary motion is otherwise 
controlled, so that the muscles affecting joint motion, if not already 
atrophied, will become so. If there is no movement in the joint, as in 
ankylosis or complete paralysis, use of prosthesis is not to be 
expected, and the determination will be as though there were one in 
place.
    (3) Eyes, bilateral. With visual acuity 5/200 or less or the vision 
field reduced to 5 degree concentric contraction in both eyes, 
entitlement on account of need for regular aid and attendance will be 
determined on the facts in the individual case.
    (d) Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114(n). The special monthly 
compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(n) is payable for any of the 
conditions which follow: Amputation is a prerequisite except for loss of 
use of both arms and blindness without light perception in both eyes. If 
a prosthesis cannot be worn at the present level of amputation but could 
be applied if there were a reamputation at a higher level, the 
requirements of this paragraph are not met; instead, consideration will 
be given to loss of natural elbow or knee action.
    (1) Anatomical loss or loss of use of both arms at a level or with 
complications, preventing natural elbow action with prosthesis in place;
    (2) Anatomical loss of both legs so near the hip as to prevent use 
of a prosthetic appliance;
    (3) Anatomical loss of one arm so near the shoulder as to prevent 
use of a prosthetic appliance with anatomical loss of one leg so near 
the hip as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance;
    (4) Anatomical loss of both eyes or blindness without light 
perception in both eyes.
    (e) Ratings under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (o). (1) The special monthly 
compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(o) is payable for any of the 
following conditions:
    (i) Anatomical loss of both arms so near the shoulder as to prevent 
use of a prosthetic appliance;
    (ii) Conditions entitling to two or more of the rates (no condition 
being considered twice) provided in 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) through (n);
    (iii) Bilateral deafness rated at 60 percent or more disabling (and 
the hearing impairment in either one or both ears is service connected) 
in combination with service-connected blindness with bilateral visual 
acuity 5/200 or less.
    (iv) Service-connected total deafness in one ear or bilateral 
deafness rated at 40 percent or more disabling (and the hearing 
impairment in either one of

[[Page 258]]

both ears is service-connected) in combination with service-connected 
blindness of both eyes having only light perception or less.
    (2) Paraplegia. Paralysis of both lower extremities together with 
loss of anal and bladder sphincter control will entitle to the maximum 
rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(o), through the combination of loss of use of 
both legs and helplessness. The requirement of loss of anal and bladder 
sphincter control is met even though incontinence has been overcome 
under a strict regimen of rehabilitation of bowel and bladder training 
and other auxiliary measures.
    (3) Combinations. Determinations must be based upon separate and 
distinct disabilities. This requires, for example, that where a veteran 
who had suffered the loss or loss of use of two extremities is being 
considered for the maximum rate on account of helplessness requiring 
regular aid and attendance, the latter must be based on need resulting 
from pathology other than that of the extremities. If the loss or loss 
of use of two extremities or being permanently bedridden leaves the 
person helpless, increase is not in order on account of this 
helplessness. Under no circumstances will the combination of ``being 
permanently bedridden'' and ``being so helpless as to require regular 
aid and attendance'' without separate and distinct anatomical loss, or 
loss of use, of two extremities, or blindness, be taken as entitling to 
the maximum benefit. The fact, however, that two separate and distinct 
entitling disabilities, such as anatomical loss, or loss of use of both 
hands and both feet, result from a common etiological agent, for 
example, one injury or rheumatoid arthritis, will not preclude maximum 
entitlement.
    (4) Helplessness. The maximum rate, as a result of including 
helplessness as one of the entitling multiple disabilities, is intended 
to cover, in addition to obvious losses and blindness, conditions such 
as the loss of use of two extremities with absolute deafness and nearly 
total blindness or with severe multiple injuries producing total 
disability outside the useless extremities, these conditions being 
construed as loss of use of two extremities and helplessness.
    (f) Intermediate or next higher rate. An intermediate rate 
authorized by this paragraph shall be established at the arithmetic 
mean, rounded to the nearest dollar, between the two rates concerned.

1114 (n) and (o).
    (2) Eyes, bilateral, and blindness in connection with deafness and/
or loss or loss of use of a hand or foot.
    (i) Blindness of one eye with 5/200 visual acuity or less and 
blindness of the other eye having only light perception will entitle to 
the rate between 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l) and (m).
    (ii) Blindness of one eye with 5/200 visual acuity or less and 
anatomical loss of, or blindness having no light

1114(m).
    (iii) Blindness of one eye having only light perception and 
anatomical loss of, or blindness having no light perception in the other 
eye, will entitle to a rate between 38 U.S.C. 1114 (m) and (n).
    (iv) Blindness in both eyes with visual acuity of 5/200 or less, or 
blindness in both eyes rated under subparagraph (2) (i) or (ii) of this 
paragraph, when accompanied by service-connected total deafness in one 
ear, will afford entitlement to the next higher intermediate rate of if 
the veteran is already entitled to an intermediate rate, to the next 
higher statutory rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114, but in no event higher than 
the rate for (o).
    (v) Blindness in both eyes having only light perception or less, or 
rated under subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph, when accompanied by 
bilateral deafness (and the hearing impairment in either one or both 
ears is service-connected) rated at 10 or 20 percent disabling, will 
afford entitlement to the next higher intermediate rate, or if the 
veteran is already entitled to an intermediate rate, to the next higher 
statutory rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114, but in no event higher than the 
rate for (o).


(Authority: Sec. 112, Pub. L. 98-223)

    (vi) Blindness in both eyes rated under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l), (m) or 
(n), or rated under subparagraphs (2)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this 
paragraph, when accompanied by bilaterial deafness rated at no less than 
30 percent, and the hearing impairment in one or both ears is service-
connected, will afford entitlement to the next higher statutory rate 
under 38 U.S.C. 1114, or if the veteran is already entitled to an 
intermediate rate, to the next higher intermediate rate, but in no event 
higher than the rate for (o).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1114(p))

    (vii) Blindness in both eyes rated under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l), (m), or 
(n), or under the intermediate or next higher rate provisions of this 
subparagraph, when accompanied by:
    (A) Service-connected loss or loss of use of one hand, will afford 
entitlement to the next higher statutory rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114 or, 
if the veteran is already entitled to an intermediate rate, to the next 
higher intermediate rate, but in no event higher than the rate for (o); 
or
    (B) Service-connected loss or loss of use of one foot which by 
itself or in combination with another compensable disability would be 
ratable at 50 percent or more, will afford entitlement to the next 
higher statutory rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114 or, if the veteran is already 
entitled to an intermediate rate, to the next higher intermediate rate, 
but in no event higher than the rate for (o); or
    (C) Service-connected loss or loss of use of one foot which is 
ratable at less

[[Page 260]]

than 50 percent and which is the only compensable disability other than 
bilateral blindness, will afford entitlement to the next higher 
intermediate rate or, if the veteran is already entitled to an 
intermediate rate, to the next higher statutory rate under 38 U.S.C. 
1114, but in no event higher than the rate for (o).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1114(p))

    (3) Additional independent 50 percent disabilities. In addition to 
the statutory rates payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l) through (n) and the 
intermediate or next higher rate provisions outlined above, additional 
single permanent disability or combinations of permanent disabilities 
independently ratable at 50 percent or more will afford entitlement to 
the next higher intermediate rate or if already entitled to an 
intermediate rate to the next higher statutory rate under 38 U.S.C. 
1114, but not above the (o) rate. In the application of this 
subparagraph the disability or disabilities independently ratable at 50 
percent or more must be separate and distinct and involve different 
anatomical segments or bodily systems from the conditions establishing 
entitlement under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l) through (n) or the intermediate 
rate provisions outlined above. The graduated ratings for arrested 
tuberculosis will not be utilized in this connection, but the permanent 
residuals of tuberculosis may be utilized.
    (4) Additional independent 100 percent ratings. In addition to the 
statutory rates payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l) through (n) and the 
intermediate or next higher rate provisions outlined above additional 
single permanent disability independently ratable at 100 percent apart 
from any consideration of individual unemployability will afford 
entitlement to the next higher statutory rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114 or if 
already entitled to an intermediate rate to the next higher intermediate 
rate, but in no event higher than the rate for (o). In the application 
of this subparagraph the single permanent disability independently 
ratable at 100 percent must be separate and distinct and involve 
different anatomical segments or bodily systems from the conditions 
establishing entitlement under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l) through (n) or the 
intermediate rate provisions outlined above.
    (i) Where the multiple loss or loss of use entitlement to a 
statutory or intermediate rate between 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l) and (o) is 
caused by the same etiological disease or injury, that disease or injury 
may not serve as the basis for the independent 50 percent or 100 percent 
unless it is so rated without regard to the loss or loss of use.
    (ii) The graduated ratings for arrested tuberculosis will not be 
utilized in this connection, but the permanent residuals of tuberculosis 
may be utilized.
    (5) Three extremities. Anatomical loss or loss of use, or a 
combination of anatomical loss and loss of use, of three extremities 
shall entitle a veteran to the next higher rate without regard to 
whether that rate is a statutory rate or an intermediate rate. The 
maximum monthly payment under this provision may not exceed the amount 
stated in 38 U.S.C. 1114(p).
    (g) Inactive tuberculosis (complete arrest). The rating criteria for 
determining inactivity of tuberculosis are set out in Sec. 3.375.
    (1) For a veteran who was receiving or entitled to receive 
compensation for tuberculosis on August 19, 1968, the minimum monthly 
rate is $67. This minimum special monthly compensation is not to be 
combined with or added to any other disability compensation.
    (2) For a veteran who was not receiving or entitled to receive 
compensation for tuberculosis on August 19, 1968, the special monthly 
compensation authorized by paragraph (g)(1) of this section is not 
payable.
    (h) Special aid and attendance benefit; 38 U.S.C. 1114(r)--(1) 
Maximum compensation cases. A veteran receiving the maximum rate under 
38 U.S.C. 1114 (o) or (p) who is in need of regular aid and attendance 
or a higher level of care is entitled to an additional allowance during 
periods he or she is not hospitalized at United States Government 
expense. (See Sec. 3.552(b)(2) as to continuance following admission 
for hospitalization.) Determination of this need is subject to the 
criteria of Sec. 3.352. The regular or higher level aid and attendance 
allowance is payable whether

[[Page 261]]

or not the need for regular aid and attendance or a higher level of care 
was a partial basis for entitlement to the maximum rate under 38 U.S.C. 
1114 (o) or (p), or was based on an independent factual determination.
    (2) Entitlement to compensation at the intermediate rate between 38 
U.S.C. 1114 (n) and (o) plus special monthly compensation under 38 
U.S.C. 1114(k). A veteran receiving compensation at the intermediate 
rate between 38 U.S.C. 1114 (n) and (o) plus special monthly 
compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) who establishes a factual need for 
regular aid and attendance or a higher level of care, is also entitled 
to an additional allowance during periods he or she is not hospitalized 
at United States Government expense. (See Sec. 3.552(b)(2) as to 
continuance following admission for hospitalization.) Determination of 
the factual need for aid and attendance is subject to the criteria of 
Sec. 3.352:
    (3) Amount of the allowance. The amount of the additional allowance 
payable to a veteran in need of regular aid and attendance is specified 
in 38 U.S.C. 1114(r)(1). The amount of the additional allowance payable 
to a veteran in need of a higher level of care is specified in 38 U.S.C. 
1114(r)(2). The higher level aid and attendance allowance authorized by 
38 U.S.C. 1114(r)(2) is payable in lieu of the regular aid and 
attendance allowance authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1114(r)(1).
    (i) Total plus 60 percent, or housebound; 38 U.S.C. 1114(s). The 
special monthly compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(s) is payable 
where the veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 
percent and,
    (1) Has additional service-connected disability or disabilities 
independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 
percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical 
segments or bodily systems, or
    (2) Is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected 
disability or disabilities. This requirement is met when the veteran is 
substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected 
disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if 
institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas, and it is reasonably 
certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement 
will continue throughout his or her lifetime.

Sec. 3.351  Special monthly dependency and indemnity compensation, death compensation, pension and spouse's compensation ratings.

    (a) General. This section sets forth criteria for determining 
whether:
    (1) Increased pension is payable to a veteran by reason of need for 
aid and attendance or by reason of being housebound.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1521(d), (e))

    (2) Increased compensation is payable to a veteran by reason of the 
veteran's spouse being in need of aid and attendance.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1115(1)(E))

    (3) Increased dependency and indemnity compensation is payable to a 
surviving spouse or parent by reason of being in need of aid and 
attendance.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1311(c), 1315(h))

    (4) Increased dependency and indemnity compensation is payable to a 
surviving spouse who is not in need of aid and attendance but is 
housebound.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1311(d))

    (5) Increased pension is payable to a surviving spouse by reason of 
need for aid and attendance, or if not in need of aid and attendance, by 
reason of being housebound.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1541(d), (e))

    (6) Increased death compensation is payable to a surviving spouse by 
reason of being in need of aid and attendance.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1122)

    (b) Aid and attendance; need. Need for aid and attendance means 
helplessness or being so nearly helpless as to require the regular aid 
and attendance of

[[Page 262]]

another person. The criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section 
will be applied in determining whether such need exists.
    (c) Aid and attendance; criteria. The veteran, spouse, surviving 
spouse or parent will be considered in need of regular aid and 
attendance if he or she:
    (1) Is blind or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity 
of 5/200 or less, in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual 
field to 5 degrees or less; or
    (2) Is a patient in a nursing home because of mental or physical 
incapacity; or
    (3) Establishes a factual need for aid and attendance under the 
criteria set forth in Sec. 3.352(a).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1502(b))

    (d) Housebound, or permanent and total plus 60 percent; disability 
pension. The rate of pension payable to a veteran who is entitled to 
pension under 38 U.S.C. 1521 and who is not in need of regular aid and 
attendance shall be as prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521(e) if, in addition 
to having a single permanent disability rated 100 percent disabling 
under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (not including ratings based 
upon unemployability under Sec. 4.17 of this chapter) the veteran:
    (1) Has additional disability or disabilities independently ratable 
at 60 percent or more, separate and distinct from the permanent 
disability rated as 100 percent disabling and involving different 
anatomical segments or bodily systems, or
    (2) Is ``permanently housebound'' by reason of disability or 
disabilities. This requirement is met when the veteran is substantially 
confined to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if 
institutionalized, to the ward or clinical area, and it is reasonably 
certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement 
will continue throughout his or her lifetime.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1502(c), 1521(e))

    (e) Housebound; dependency and indemnity compensation. The monthly 
rate of dependency and indemnity compensation payable to a surviving 
spouse who does not qualify for increased dependency and indemnity 
compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1311(c) based on need for regular aid and 
attendance shall be increased by the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 
1311(d) if the surviving spouse is permanently housebound by reason of 
disability. The ``permanently housebound'' requirement is met when the 
surviving spouse is substantially confined to his or her home (ward or 
clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises by reason of 
disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain 
throughout the surviving spouse's lifetime.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1311(d))

    (f) Housebound; improved pension; death. The annual rate of death 
pension payable to a surviving spouse who does not qualify for an annual 
rate of death pension payable under Sec. 3.23(a)(6) based on need for 
aid and attendance shall be as set forth in Sec. 3.23(a)(7) if the 
surviving spouse is permanently housebound by reason of disability. The 
``permanently housebound'' requirement is met when the surviving spouse 
is substantially confined to his or her home (ward or clinical areas, if 
institutionalized) or immediate premises by reason of disability or 
disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout the 
surviving spouse's lifetime.

<R05>
Sec. 3.352  Criteria for determining need for aid and attendance and ``permanently bedridden.''

    (a) Basic criteria for regular aid and attendance and permanently 
bedridden. The following will be accorded consideration in determining 
the need for regular aid and attendance (Sec. 3.351(c)(3): inability of 
claimant to dress or undress himself (herself), or to keep himself 
(herself) ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment 
of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of 
the particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not 
include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be 
unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the 
back, etc.); inability of claimant

[[Page 263]]

to feed himself (herself) through loss of coordination of upper 
extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the 
wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care 
or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or 
dangers incident to his or her daily environment. ``Bedridden'' will be 
a proper basis for the determination. For the purpose of this paragraph 
``bedridden'' will be that condition which, through its essential 
character, actually requires that the claimant remain in bed. The fact 
that claimant has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has 
prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to 
promote convalescence or cure will not suffice. It is not required that 
all of the disabling conditions enumerated in this paragraph be found to 
exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal 
functions which the veteran is unable to perform should be considered in 
connection with his or her condition as a whole. It is only necessary 
that the evidence establish that the veteran is so helpless as to need 
regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need. 
Determinations that the veteran is so helpless, as to be in need of 
regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that 
the claimant's condition is such as would require him or her to be in 
bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance 
from others.
    (b) Basic criteria for the higher level aid and attendance 
allowance. (1) A veteran is entitled to the higher level aid and 
attendance allowance authorized by Sec. 3.350(h) in lieu of the regular 
aid and attendance allowance when all of the following conditions are 
met:
    (i) The veteran is entitled to the compensation authorized under 38 
U.S.C. 1114(o), or the maximum rate of compensation authorized under 38 
U.S.C. 1114(p).
    (ii) The veteran meets the requirements for entitlement to the 
regular aid and attendance allowance in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (iii) The veteran needs a ``higher level of care'' (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section) than is required to establish 
entitlement to the regular aid and attendance allowance, and in the 
absence of the provision of such higher level of care the veteran would 
require hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential 
institutional care.
    (2) Need for a higher level of care shall be considered to be need 
for personal health-care services provided on a daily basis in the 
veteran's home by a person who is licensed to provide such services or 
who provides such services under the regular supervision of a licensed 
health-care professional. Personal health-care services include (but are 
not limited to) such services as physical therapy, administration of 
injections, placement of indwelling catheters, and the changing of 
sterile dressings, or like functions which require professional health-
care training or the regular supervision of a trained health-care 
professional to perform. A licensed health-care professional includes 
(but is not limited to) a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a registered 
nurse, a licensed practical nurse, or a physical therapist licensed to 
practice by a State or political subdivision thereof.
    (3) The term ``under the regular supervision of a licensed health-
care professional'', as used in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, means 
that an unlicensed person performing personal health-care services is 
following a regimen of personal health-care services prescribed by a 
health-care professional, and that the health-care professional consults 
with the unlicensed person providing the health-care services at least 
once each month to monitor the prescribed regimen. The consultation need 
not be in person; a telephone call will suffice.
    (4) A person performing personal health-care services who is a 
relative or other member of the veteran's household is not exempted from 
the requirement that he or she be a licensed health-care professional or 
be providing such care under the regular supervision of a licensed 
health-care professional.
    (5) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are to be 
strictly construed. The higher level aid-and-attendance allowance is to 
be granted only when the veteran's need is clearly

[[Page 264]]

established and the amount of services required by the veteran on a 
daily basis is substantial.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 1114(r)(2))

    (c) Attendance by relative. The performance of the necessary aid and 
attendance service by a relative of the beneficiary or other member of 
his or her household will not prevent the granting of the additional 
allowance.

Sec. 3.353  Determinations of incompetency and competency.

    (a) Definition of mental incompetency. A mentally incompetent person 
is one who because of injury or disease lacks the mental capacity to 
contract or to manage his or her own affairs, including disbursement of 
funds without limitation.
    (b) Authority. (1) Rating agencies have sole authority to make 
official determinations of competency and incompetency for purposes of: 
insurance (38 U.S.C. 1922), and, subject to Sec. 13.56 of this chapter, 
disbursement of benefits. Such determinations are final and binding on 
field stations for these purposes.
    (2) Where the beneficiary is rated incompetent, the Veterans Service 
Center Manager will develop information as to the beneficiary's social, 
economic and industrial adjustment; appoint (or recommend appointment 
of) a fiduciary as provided in Sec. 13.55 of this chapter; select a 
method of disbursing payment as provided in Sec. 13.56 of this chapter, 
or in the case of a married beneficiary, appoint the beneficiary's 
spouse to receive payments as provided in Sec. 13.57 of this chapter; 
and authorize disbursement of the benefit.
    (3) If in the course of fulfilling the responsibilities assigned in 
paragraph (b)(2) the Veterans Service Center Manager develops evidence 
indicating that the beneficiary may be capable of administering the 
funds payable without limitation, he or she will refer that evidence to 
the rating agency with a statement as to his or her findings. The rating 
agency will consider this evidence, together with all other evidence of 
record, to determine whether its prior determination of incompetency 
should remain in effect. Reexamination may be requested as provided in 
Sec. 3.327(a) if necessary to properly evaluate the beneficiary's 
mental capacity to contract or manage his or her own affairs.
    (c) Medical opinion. Unless the medical evidence is clear, 
convincing and leaves no doubt as to the person's incompetency, the 
rating agency will make no determination of incompetency without a 
definite expression regarding the question by the responsible medical 
authorities. Considerations of medical opinions will be in accordance 
with the principles in paragraph (a) of this section. Determinations 
relative to incompetency should be based upon all evidence of record and 
there should be a consistent relationship between the percentage of 
disability, facts relating to commitment or hospitalization and the 
holding of incompetency.
    (d) Presumption in favor of competency. Where reasonable doubt 
arises regarding a beneficiary's mental capacity to contract or to 
manage his or her own affairs, including the disbursement of funds 
without limitation, such doubt will be resolved in favor of competency 
(see Sec. 3.102 on reasonable doubt).
    (e) Due process. Whenever it is proposed to make an incompetency 
determination, the beneficiary will be notified of the proposed action 
and of the right to a hearing as provided in Sec. 3.103. Such notice is 
not necessary if the beneficiary has been declared incompetent by a 
court of competent jurisdiction or if a guardian has been appointed for 
the beneficiary based upon a court finding of incompetency. If a hearing 
is requested it must be held prior to a rating decision of incompetency. 
Failure or refusal of the beneficiary after proper notice to request or 
cooperate in such a hearing will not preclude a rating decision based on 
the evidence of record.

Sec. 3.354  Determinations of insanity.

    (a) Definition of insanity. An insane person is one who, while not 
mentally defective or constitutionally psychopathic, except when a 
psychosis has been engrafted upon such basic condition, exhibits, due to 
disease, a more or less prolonged deviation from his normal method of 
behavior; or who interferes with the peace of society; or who has so 
departed (become antisocial) from the accepted standards of the 
community to which by birth and education he belongs as to lack the 
adaptability to make further adjustment to the social customs of the 
community in which he resides.
    (b) Insanity causing discharge. When a rating agency is concerned 
with determining whether a veteran was insane at the time he committed 
an offense leading to his court-martial, discharge or resignation (38 
U.S.C. 5303(b)), it will base its decision on all the evidence 
procurable relating to the period involved, and apply the definition in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 3.355  Testamentary capacity for insurance purposes.

    When cases are referred to a rating agency involving the 
testamentary capacity of the insured to execute designations or changes 
of beneficiary, or designations or changes of option, the following 
considerations will apply:
    (a) Testamentary capacity is that degree of mental capacity 
necessary to enable a person to perform a testamentary act. This, in 
general, requires that the testator reasonably comprehend the nature and 
significance of his act, that is, the subject and extent of his 
disposition, recognition of the object of his bounty, and appreciation 
of the consequence of his act, uninfluenced by any material delusion as 
to the property or persons involved.
    (b) Due consideration should be given to all facts of record, with 
emphasis being placed on those facts bearing upon the mental condition 
of the testator (insured) at the time or nearest the time he executed 
the designation or change. In this connection, consideration should be 
given to lay as well as medical evidence.
    (c) Lack of testamentary capacity should not be confused with 
insanity or mental incompetence. An insane person might have a lucid 
interval during which he would possess testamentary capacity. On the 
other hand, a sane person might suffer a temporary mental aberration 
during which he would not possess testamentary capacity. There is a 
general but rebuttable presumption that every testator possesses 
testamentary capacity. Therefore, reasonable doubts should be resolved 
in favor of testamentary capacity.

<R05>
Sec. 3.356  Conditions which determine permanent incapacity for self-support.

    (a) Basic determinations. A child must be shown to be permanently 
incapable of self-support by reason of mental or physical defect at the 
date of attaining the age of 18 years.
    (b) Rating criteria. Rating determinations will be made solely on 
the basis of whether the child is permanently incapable of self-support 
through his own efforts by reason of physical or mental defects. The 
question of permanent incapacity for self-support is one of fact for 
determination by the rating agency on competent evidence of record in 
the individual case. Rating criteria applicable to disabled veterans are 
not controlling. Principal factors for consideration are:
    (1) The fact that a claimant is earning his or her own support is 
prima facie evidence that he or she is not incapable of self-support. 
Incapacity for self-support will not be considered to exist when the 
child by his or her own efforts is provided with sufficient income for 
his or her reasonable support.
    (2) A child shown by proper evidence to have been permanently 
incapable of self-support prior to the date of attaining the age of 18 
years, may be so held at a later date even though there may have been a 
short intervening period or periods when his or her condition was such 
that he or she was employed, provided the cause of incapacity is the 
same as that upon which the original determination was made and there 
were no intervening diseases or injuries

[[Page 266]]

that could be considered as major factors. Employment which was only 
casual, intermittent, tryout, unsuccessful, or terminated after a short 
period by reason of disability, should not be considered as rebutting 
permanent incapability of self-support otherwise established.
    (3) It should be borne in mind that employment of a child prior or 
subsequent to the delimiting age may or may not be a normal situation, 
depending on the educational progress of the child, the economic 
situation of the family, indulgent attitude of parents, and the like. In 
those cases where the extent and nature of disability raises some doubt 
as to whether they would render the average person incapable of self-
support, factors other than employment are for consideration. In such 
cases there should be considered whether the daily activities of the 
child in the home and community are equivalent to the activities of 
employment of any nature within the physical or mental capacity of the 
child which would provide sufficient income for reasonable support. Lack 
of employment of the child either prior to the delimiting age or 
thereafter should not be considered as a major factor in the 
determination to be made, unless it is shown that it was due to physical 
or mental defect and not to mere disinclination to work or indulgence of 
relatives or friends.
    (4) The capacity of a child for self-support is not determinable 
upon employment afforded solely upon sympathetic or charitable 
considerations and which involved no actual or substantial rendition of 
services.

    Cross Reference: Basic pension and eligibility determinations. See 
Sec. 3.314.

Sec. 3.357  Civil service preference ratings.

    For the purpose of certifying civil service disability preference 
only, a service-connected disability may be assigned an evaluation of 
``less than ten percent.'' Any directly or presumptively service-
connected disease or injury which exhibits some extent of actual 
impairment may be held to exist at the level of less than ten percent. 
For disabilities incurred in combat, however, no actual impairment is 
required.

Sec. 3.358  Compensation for disability or death from hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, examinations or vocational rehabilitation training (Sec. 
          3.800).

    (a) General. This section applies to claims received by VA before 
October 1, 1997. If it is determined that there is additional disability 
resulting from a disease or injury or aggravation of an existing disease 
or injury suffered as a result of hospitalization, medical or surgical 
treatment, examination, or vocational rehabilitation training, 
compensation will be payable for such additional disability. For claims 
received by VA on or after October 1, 1997, see Sec. 3.361.
    (b) Additional disability. In determining that additional disability 
exists, the following considerations will govern:
    (1) The veteran's physical condition immediately prior to the 
disease or injury on which the claim for compensation is based will be 
compared with the subsequent physical condition resulting from the 
disease or injury, each body part involved being considered separately.
    (i) As applied to examinations, the physical condition prior to the 
disease or injury will be the condition at time of beginning the 
physical examination as a result of which the disease or injury was 
sustained.
    (ii) As applied to medical or surgical treatment, the physical 
condition prior to the disease or injury will be the condition which the 
specific medical or surgical treatment was designed to relieve.
    (2) Compensation will not be payable under this section for the 
continuance or natural progress of a disease or injury for which the 
hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, or examination was 
furnished, unless VA's failure to exercise reasonable skill and care in 
the diagnosis or treatment of the disease or injury caused additional 
disability or death that probably would have been prevented by proper 
diagnosis or treatment. Compensation will

[[Page 267]]

not be payable under this section for the continuance or natural 
progress of a disease or injury for which vocational rehabilitation 
training was provided.
    (c) Cause. In determining whether such additional disability 
resulted from a disease or an injury or an aggravation of an existing 
disease or injury suffered as a result of training, hospitalization, 
medical or surgical treatment, or examination, the following 
considerations will govern:
    (1) It will be necessary to show that the additional disability is 
actually the result of such disease or injury or an aggravation of an 
existing disease or injury and not merely coincidental therewith.
    (2) The mere fact that aggravation occurred will not suffice to make 
the additional disability compensable in the absence of proof that it 
resulted from disease or injury or an aggravation of an existing disease 
or injury suffered as the result of training, hospitalization, medical 
or surgical treatment, or examination.
    (3) Compensation is not payable for the necessary consequences of 
medical or surgical treatment or examination properly administered with 
the express or implied consent of the veteran, or, in appropriate cases, 
the veteran's representative. ``Necessary consequences'' are those which 
are certain to result from, or were intended to result from, the 
examination or medical or surgical treatment administered. Consequences 
otherwise certain or intended to result from a treatment will not be 
considered uncertain or unintended solely because it had not been 
determined at the time consent was given whether that treatment would in 
fact be administered.
    (4) When the proximate cause of the injury suffered was the 
veteran's willful misconduct or failure to follow instructions, it will 
bar him (or her) from receipt of compensation hereunder except in the 
case of incompetent veterans.
    (5) Compensation for disability resulting from the pursuit of 
vocational rehabilitation is not payable unless there is established a 
direct (proximate) causal connection between the injury or aggravation 
of an existing injury and some essential activity or function which is 
within the scope of the vocational rehabilitation course, not 
necessarily limited to activities or functions specifically designated 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs in the individual case, since 
ordinarily it is not to be expected that each and every different 
function and act of a veteran pursuant to his or her course of training 
will be particularly specified in the outline of the course or training 
program. For example, a disability resulting from the use of an item of 
mechanical or other equipment is within the purview of the statute if 
training in its use is implicit within the prescribed program or course 
outlined or if its use is implicit in the performance of some task or 
operation the trainee must learn to perform, although such use may not 
be especially mentioned in the training program. In determining whether 
the element of direct or proximate causation is present, it remains 
necessary for a distinction to be made between an injury arising out of 
an act performed in pursuance of the course of training, that is, a 
required ``learning activity'', and one arising out of an activity which 
is incident to, related to, or coexistent with the pursuit of the 
program of training. For a case to fall within the statute there must 
have been sustained an injury which, but for the performance of a 
``learning activity'' in the prescribed course of training, would not 
have been sustained. A meticulous examination into all the circumstances 
is required, including a consideration of the time and place of the 
incident producing the injury.
    (6) Nursing home care furnished under section 1720 of title 38, 
United States Code is not hospitalization within the meaning of this 
section. Such a nursing home is an independent contractor and, 
accordingly, its agents and employees are not to be deemed agents and 
employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs. If additional 
disability results from medical or surgical treatment or examination 
through negligence or other wrongful acts or omissions on the part of 
such a nursing home, its employees, or its agents, entitlement does not 
exist under this section unless there was an

[[Page 268]]

act or omission on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
independently giving rise to such entitlement and such acts on the part 
of both proximately caused the additional disability.

treatment is claimed by former members of the Armed Forces of 
Czechoslovakia or Poland under 38 U.S.C. 109(c) is service connected. 
This determination will be made using the same criteria that applies to 
determinations of service connection based on service in the Armed 
Forces of the United States.

Sec. 3.360  Service-connected health-care eligibility of certain persons administratively discharged under other than honorable condition.

    (a) General. The health-care and related benefits authorized by 
chapter 17 of title 38 U.S.C. shall be provided to certain former 
service persons with administrative discharges under other than 
honorable conditions for any disability incurred or aggravated during 
active military, naval, or air service in line of duty.
    (b) Discharge categorization. With certain exceptions such benefits 
shall be furnished for any disability incurred or aggravated during a 
period of service terminated by a discharge under other than honorable 
conditions. Specifically, they may not be furnished for any disability 
incurred or aggravated during a period of service terminated by a bad 
conduct discharge or when one of the bars listed in Sec. 3.12(c) 
applies.
    (c) Eligibility criteria. In making determinations of health-care 
eligibility the same criteria will be used as is now applicable to 
determinations of service incurrence and in line of duty when there is 
no character of discharge bar.

Sec. 3.361  Benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151(a) for additional disability or death due to hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and 
          rehabilitation services, or compensated work therapy program.

    (a) Claims subject to this section--(1) General. Except as provided 
in paragraph (2), this section applies to claims received by VA on or 
after October 1, 1997. This includes original claims and claims to 
reopen or otherwise readjudicate a previous claim for benefits under 38 
U.S.C. 1151 or its predecessors. The effective date of benefits is 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 3.400(i). For claims received by VA 
before October 1, 1997, see Sec. 3.358.
    (2) Compensated Work Therapy. With respect to claims alleging 
disability or death due to compensated work therapy, this section 
applies to claims that were pending before VA on November 1, 2000, or 
that were received by VA after that date. The effective date of benefits 
is subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 3.114(a) and 3.400(i), and 
shall not be earlier than November 1, 2000.
    (b) Determining whether a veteran has an additional disability. To 
determine whether a veteran has an additional disability, VA compares 
the veteran's condition immediately before the beginning of the hospital 
care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and 
rehabilitation services, or compensated work therapy (CWT) program upon 
which the claim is based to the veteran's condition after such care, 
treatment, examination, services, or program has stopped. VA considers 
each involved body part or system separately.
    (c) Establishing the cause of additional disability or death. Claims 
based on additional disability or death due to hospital care, medical or 
surgical treatment, or examination must meet the causation requirements 
of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. Claims 
based on additional disability or death due to training and 
rehabilitation services or compensated work therapy program must

[[Page 269]]

meet the causation requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (1) Actual causation required. To establish causation, the evidence 
must show that the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or 
examination resulted in the veteran's additional disability or death. 
Merely showing that a veteran received care, treatment, or examination 
and that the veteran has an additional disability or died does not 
establish cause.
    (2) Continuance or natural progress of a disease or injury. Hospital 
care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination cannot cause the 
continuance or natural progress of a disease or injury for which the 
care, treatment, or examination was furnished unless VA's failure to 
timely diagnose and properly treat the disease or injury proximately 
caused the continuance or natural progress. The provision of training 
and rehabilitation services or CWT program cannot cause the continuance 
or natural progress of a disease or injury for which the services were 
provided.
    (3) Veteran's failure to follow medical instructions. Additional 
disability or death caused by a veteran's failure to follow properly 
given medical instructions is not caused by hospital care, medical or 
surgical treatment, or examination.
    (d) Establishing the proximate cause of additional disability or 
death. The proximate cause of disability or death is the action or event 
that directly caused the disability or death, as distinguished from a 
remote contributing cause.
    (1) Care, treatment, or examination. To establish that carelessness, 
negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance 
of fault on VA's part in furnishing hospital care, medical or surgical 
treatment, or examination proximately caused a veteran's additional 
disability or death, it must be shown that the hospital care, medical or 
surgical treatment, or examination caused the veteran's additional 
disability or death (as explained in paragraph (c) of this section); and
    (i) VA failed to exercise the degree of care that would be expected 
of a reasonable health care provider; or
    (ii) VA furnished the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, 
or examination without the veteran's or, in appropriate cases, the 
veteran's representative's informed consent. To determine whether there 
was informed consent, VA will consider whether the health care providers 
substantially complied with the requirements of Sec. 17.32 of this 
chapter. Minor deviations from the requirements of Sec. 17.32 of this 
chapter that are immaterial under the circumstances of a case will not 
defeat a finding of informed consent. Consent may be express (i.e., 
given orally or in writing) or implied under the circumstances specified 
in Sec. 17.32(b) of this chapter, as in emergency situations.
    (2) Events not reasonably foreseeable. Whether the proximate cause 
of a veteran's additional disability or death was an event not 
reasonably foreseeable is in each claim to be determined based on what a 
reasonable health care provider would have foreseen. The event need not 
be completely unforeseeable or unimaginable but must be one that a 
reasonable health care provider would not have considered to be an 
ordinary risk of the treatment provided. In determining whether an event 
was reasonably foreseeable, VA will consider whether the risk of that 
event was the type of risk that a reasonable health care provider would 
have disclosed in connection with the informed consent procedures of 
Sec. 17.32 of this chapter.
    (3) Training and rehabilitation services or compensated work therapy 
program. To establish that the provision of training and rehabilitation 
services or a CWT program proximately caused a veteran's additional 
disability or death, it must be shown that the veteran's participation 
in an essential activity or function of the training, services, or CWT 
program provided or authorized by VA proximately caused the disability 
or death. The veteran must have been participating in such training, 
services, or CWT program provided or authorized by VA as part of an 
approved rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 or as part of 
a CWT program under 38 U.S.C. 1718. It need not be shown that VA 
approved that specific activity or function, as long as the activity or 
function is generally accepted as being a necessary component

[[Page 270]]

of the training, services, or CWT program that VA provided or 
authorized.
    (e) Department employees and facilities. (1) A Department employee 
is an individual--
    (i) Who is appointed by the Department in the civil service under 
title 38, United States Code, or title 5, United States Code, as an 
employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105;
    (ii) Who is engaged in furnishing hospital care, medical or surgical 
treatment, or examinations under authority of law; and
    (iii) Whose day-to-day activities are subject to supervision by the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
    (2) A Department facility is a facility over which the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs has direct jurisdiction.
    (f) Activities that are not hospital care, medical or surgical 
treatment, or examination furnished by a Department employee or in a 
Department facility. The following are not hospital care, medical or 
surgical treatment, or examination furnished by a Department employee or 
in a Department facility within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. 1151(a):
    (1) Hospital care or medical services furnished under a contract 
made under 38 U.S.C. 1703.
    (2) Nursing home care furnished under 38 U.S.C. 1720.
    (3) Hospital care or medical services, including examination, 
provided under 38 U.S.C. 8153 in a facility over which the Secretary 
does not have direct jurisdiction.
    (g) Benefits payable under 38 U.S.C. 1151 for a veteran's death. (1) 
Death before January 1, 1957. The benefit payable under 38 U.S.C. 
1151(a) to an eligible survivor for a veteran's death occurring before 
January 1, 1957, is death compensation. See Sec. Sec. 3.5(b)(2) and 
3.702 for the right to elect dependency and indemnity compensation.
    (2) Death after December 31, 1956. The benefit payable under 38 
U.S.C. 1151(a) to an eligible survivor for a veteran's death occurring 
after December 31, 1956, is dependency and indemnity compensation.

Sec. 3.362  Offsets under 38 U.S.C. 1151(b) of benefits awarded under 38 U.S.C. 1151(a).

    (a) Claims subject to this section. This section applies to claims 
received by VA on or after October 1, 1997. This includes original 
claims and claims to reopen or otherwise readjudicate a previous claim 
for benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151 or its predecessors.
    (b) Offset of veterans' awards of compensation. If a veteran's 
disability is the basis of a judgment under 28 U.S.C. 1346(b) awarded, 
or a settlement or compromise under 28 U.S.C. 2672 or 2677 entered, on 
or after December 1, 1962, the amount to be offset under 38 U.S.C. 
1151(b) from any compensation awarded under 38 U.S.C. 1151(a) is the 
entire amount of the veteran's share of the judgment, settlement, or 
compromise, including the veteran's proportional share of attorney fees.
    (c) Offset of survivors' awards of dependency and indemnity 
compensation. If a veteran's death is the basis of a judgment under 28 
U.S.C. 1346(b) awarded, or a settlement or compromise under 28 U.S.C. 
2672 or 2677 entered, on or after December 1, 1962, the amount to be 
offset under 38 U.S.C. 1151(b) from any dependency and indemnity 
compensation awarded under 38 U.S.C. 1151(a) to a survivor is only the 
amount of the judgment, settlement, or compromise representing damages 
for the veteran's death the survivor receives in an individual capacity 
or as distribution from the decedent veteran's estate of sums included 
in the judgment, settlement, or compromise to compensate for harm 
suffered by the survivor, plus the survivor's proportional share of 
attorney fees.
    (d) Offset of structured settlements. This paragraph applies if a 
veteran's disability or death is the basis of a structured settlement or 
structured compromise under 28 U.S.C. 2672 or 2677 entered on or after 
December 1, 1962.
    (1) The amount to be offset. The amount to be offset under 38 U.S.C. 
1151(b) from benefits awarded under 38 U.S.C. 1151(a) is the veteran's 
or survivor's proportional share of the cost to the United States of the 
settlement or compromise, including the veteran's or survivor's 
proportional share of attorney fees.

[[Page 271]]

    (2) When the offset begins. The offset of benefits awarded under 38 
U.S.C. 1151(a) begins the first month after the structured settlement or 
structured compromise has become final that such benefits would 
otherwise be paid.
    (e) Offset of award of benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 39. (1) If a 
judgment, settlement, or compromise covered in paragraphs (b) through 
(d) of this section becomes final on or after December 10, 2004, and 
includes an amount that is specifically designated for a purpose for 
which benefits are provided under 38 U.S.C. chapter 39 (38 CFR 3.808), 
and if VA awards chapter 39 benefits after the date on which the 
judgment, settlement, or compromise becomes final, the amount of the 
award will be reduced by the amount received under the judgment, 
settlement, or compromise for the same purpose.
    (2) If the amount described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is 
greater than the amount of an award under 38 U.S.C. chapter 39, the 
excess amount received under the judgment, settlement, or compromise 
will be offset against benefits otherwise payable under 38 U.S.C. 
chapter 11.

claims and claims to reopen or otherwise readjudicate a previous claim 
for benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151 or its predecessors.
    (b) Administrative award, compromises, or settlements, or judgments 
that bar benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151. If a veteran's disability or 
death was the basis of an administrative award under 28 U.S.C. 1346(b) 
made, or a settlement or compromise under 28 U.S.C. 2672 or 2677 
finalized, before December 1, 1962, VA may not award benefits under 38 
U.S.C. 1151 for any period after such award, settlement, or compromise 
was made or became final. If a veteran's disability or death was the 
basis of a judgment that became final before December 1, 1962, VA may 
award benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151 for the disability or death unless 
the terms of the judgment provide otherwise.

           Rating Considerations Relative to Specific Diseases


<R05>
Sec. 3.370  Pulmonary tuberculosis shown by X-ray in active service.

    (a) Active disease. X-ray evidence alone may be adequate for grant 
of direct service connection for pulmonary tuberculosis. When under 
consideration, all available service department films and subsequent 
films will be secured and read by specialists at designated stations who 
should have a current examination report and X-ray. Resulting 
interpretations of service films will be accorded the same consideration 
for service-connection purposes as if clinically established, however, a 
compensable rating will not be assigned prior to establishment of an 
active condition by approved methods.
    (b) Inactive disease. Where the veteran was examined at time of 
entrance into active service but X-ray was not made, or if made, is not 
available and there was no notation or other evidence of active or 
inactive reinfection type pulmonary tuberculosis existing prior to such 
entrance, it will be assumed that the condition occurred during service 
and direct service connection will be in order for inactive pulmonary 
tuberculosis shown by X-ray evidence during service in the manner 
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, unless lesions are first 
shown so soon after entry on active service as to compel the conclusion, 
on the basis of sound medical principles, that they existed prior to 
entry on active service.
    (c) Primary lesions. Healed primary type tuberculosis shown at the 
time of entrance into active service will not be taken as evidence to 
rebut direct or presumptive service connection for active reinfection 
type pulmonary tuberculosis.

<R05>
Sec. 3.371  Presumptive service connection for tuberculous disease; wartime and service on or after January 1, 1947.

    (a) Pulmonary tuberculosis. (1) Evidence of activity on comparative 
study of X-ray films showing pulmonary tuberculosis within the 3-year 
presumptive period provided by Sec. 3.307(a)(3) will be taken as 
establishing service connection for active pulmonary tuberculosis 
subsequently diagnosed by approved methods but service connection and 
evaluation may be assigned only from the date of such diagnosis or other 
evidence of clinical activity.
    (2) A notation of inactive tuberculosis of the reinfection type at 
induction or enlistment definitely prevents the grant of service 
connection under Sec. 3.307 for active tuberculosis, regardless of the 
fact that it was shown within the appropriate presumptive period.
    (b) Pleurisy with effusion without obvious cause. Pleurisy with 
effusion with evidence of diagnostic studies ruling out obvious 
nontuberculous causes will qualify as active tuberculosis. The 
requirements for presumptive service connection will be the same as 
those for tuberculous pleurisy.
    (c) Tuberculous pleurisy and endobronchial tuberculosis. Tuberculous 
pleurisy and endobronchial tuberculosis fall within the category of 
pulmonary tuberculosis for the purpose of service connection on a 
presumptive basis. Either will be held incurred in service when 
initially manifested within 36 months after the veteran's separation 
from service as determined under Sec. 3.307(a)(2).
    (d) Miliary tuberculosis. Service connection for miliary 
tuberculosis involving the lungs is to be determined in the same manner 
as for other active pulmonary tuberculosis.

<R05>
Sec. 3.372  Initial grant following inactivity of tuberculosis.

    When service connection is granted initially on an original or 
reopened claim for pulmonary or nonpulmonary tuberculosis and there is 
satisfactory evidence that the condition was active previously but is 
now inactive (arrested), it will be presumed that the disease continued 
to be active for 1 year after the last date of established activity, 
provided there is no evidence to establish activity or inactivity in the 
intervening period. For a veteran entitled to receive compensation on 
August 19, 1968, the beginning date of graduated ratings will commence 
at the end of the 1-year period. For a veteran who was not receiving or 
entitled to receive compensation on August 19, 1968, ratings will be 
assigned in accordance with the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (part 4 
of this chapter). This section is not applicable to running award cases.

Sec. 3.374  Effect of diagnosis of active tuberculosis.

    (a) Service diagnosis. Service department diagnosis of active 
pulmonary tuberculosis will be accepted unless a board of medical 
examiners, Clinic Director or Chief, Outpatient Service certifies, after 
considering all the evidence, including the favoring or opposing 
tuberculosis and activity, that such diagnosis was incorrect. Doubtful 
cases may be referred to the Chief Medical Director in Central Office.
    (b) Department of Veterans Affairs diagnosis. Diagnosis of active 
pulmonary tuberculosis by the medical authorities of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs as the result of examination, observation, or treatment 
will be accepted for rating purposes. Reference to the Clinic Director 
or Chief, Outpatient Service, will be in order in questionable cases 
and, if necessary, to the Chief Medical Director in Central Office.
    (c) Private physician's diagnosis. Diagnosis of active pulmonary 
tuberculosis by private physicians on the basis of their examination, 
observation or treatment will not be accepted to show the disease was 
initially manifested after discharge from active service unless 
confirmed by acceptable clinical, X-ray or laboratory studies, or by 
findings of active tuberculosis based upon

[[Page 273]]

acceptable hospital observation or treatment.

Sec. 3.375  Determination of inactivity (complete arrest) in tuberculosis.

    (a) Pulmonary tuberculosis. A veteran shown to have had pulmonary 
tuberculosis will be held to have reached a condition of ``complete 
arrest'' when a diagnosis of inactive is made.
    (b) Nonpulmonary disease. Determination of complete arrest of 
nonpulmonary tuberculosis requires absence of evidence of activity for 6 
months. If there are two or more foci of such tuberculosis, one of which 
is active, the condition will not be considered to be inactive until the 
tuberculous process has reached arrest in its entirety.
    (c) Arrest following surgery. Where there has been surgical excision 
of the lesion or organ, the date of complete arrest will be the date of 
discharge from the hospital, or 6 months from the date of excision, 
whichever is later.

<R05>
Sec. 3.378  Changes from activity in pulmonary tuberculosis pension cases.

    A permanent and total disability rating in effect during 
hospitalization will not be discontinued before hospital discharge on 
the basis of a change in classification from active. At hospital 
discharge, the permanent and total rating will be discontinued unless 
(a) the medical evidence does not support a finding of complete arrest 
(Sec. 3.375), or (b) where complete arrest is shown but the medical 
authorities recommend that employment not be resumed or be resumed only 
for short hours (not more than 4 hours a day for a 5-day week). If 
either of the two aforementioned conditions is met, discontinuance will 
be deferred pending examination in 6 months. Although complete arrest 
may be established upon that examination, the permanent and total rating 
may be extended for a further period of 6 months provided the veteran's 
employment is limited to short hours as recommended by the medical 
authorities (not more than 4 hours a day for a 5-day week). Similar 
extensions may be granted under the same conditions at the end of 12 and 
18 months periods. At the expiration of 24 months after hospitalization, 
the case will be considered under Sec. 3.321(b) if continued short 
hours of employment is recommended or if other evidence warrants 
submission.

Sec. 3.379  Anterior poliomyelitis.

    If the first manifestations of acute anterior poliomyelitis present 
themselves in a veteran within 35 days of termination of active military 
service, it is probable that the infection occurred during service. If 
they first appear after this period, it is probable that the infection 
was incurred after service.

Sec. 3.380  Diseases of allergic etiology.

    Diseases of allergic etiology, including bronchial asthma and 
urticaria, may not be disposed of routinely for compensation purposes as 
constitutional or developmental abnormalities. Service connection must 
be determined on the evidence as to existence prior to enlistment and, 
if so existent, a comparative study must be made of its severity at 
enlistment and subsequently. Increase in the degree of disability during 
service may not be disposed of routinely as natural progress nor as due 
to the inherent nature of the disease. Seasonal and other acute allergic 
manifestations subsiding on the absence of or removal of the allergen 
are generally to be regarded as acute diseases, healing without 
residuals. The determination as to service incurrence or aggravation 
must be on the whole evidentiary showing.

Sec. 3.381  Service connection of dental conditions for treatment purposes.

    (a) Treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or 
alveolar abscesses, and periodontal disease will be considered service-
connected solely for the purpose of establishing eligibility for 
outpatient dental treatment as provided in Sec. 17.161 of this chapter.

[[Page 274]]

    (b) The rating activity will consider each defective or missing 
tooth and each disease of the teeth and periodontal tissues separately 
to determine whether the condition was incurred or aggravated in line of 
duty during active service. When applicable, the rating activity will 
determine whether the condition is due to combat or other in-service 
trauma, or whether the veteran was interned as a prisoner of war.
    (c) In determining service connection, the condition of teeth and 
periodontal tissues at the time of entry into active duty will be 
considered. Treatment during service, including filling or extraction of 
a tooth, or placement of a prosthesis, will not be considered evidence 
of aggravation of a condition that was noted at entry, unless additional 
pathology developed after 180 days or more of active service.
    (d) The following principles apply to dental conditions noted at 
entry and treated during service:
    (1) Teeth noted as normal at entry will be service-connected if they 
were filled or extracted after 180 days or more of active service.
    (2) Teeth noted as filled at entry will be service-connected if they 
were extracted, or if the existing filling was replaced, after 180 days 
or more of active service.
    (3) Teeth noted as carious but restorable at entry will not be 
service-connected on the basis that they were filled during service. 
However, new caries that developed 180 days or more after such a tooth 
was filled will be service-connected.
    (4) Teeth noted as carious but restorable at entry, whether or not 
filled, will be service-connected if extraction was required after 180 
days or more of active service.
    (5) Teeth noted at entry as non-restorable will not be service-
connected, regardless of treatment during service.
    (6) Teeth noted as missing at entry will not be service connected, 
regardless of treatment during service.
    (e) The following will not be considered service-connected for 
treatment purposes:
    (1) Calculus;
    (2) Acute periodontal disease;
    (3) Third molars, unless disease or pathology of the tooth developed 
after 180 days or more of active service, or was due to combat or in-
service trauma; and
    (4) Impacted or malposed teeth, and other developmental defects, 
unless disease or pathology of these teeth developed after 180 days or 
more of active service.
    (f) Teeth extracted because of chronic periodontal disease will be 
service-connected only if they were extracted after 180 days or more of 
active service.

                             Effective Dates


<R05>
Sec. 3.400  General.

    Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation 
and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity 
compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final 
disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of

[[Page 276]]

receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the 
later.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5110(a))

    (a) Unless specifically provided. On basis of facts found.
    (b) Disability benefits--(1) Disability pension (Sec. 3.3). An 
award of disability pension may not be effective prior to the date 
entitlement arose.
    (i) Claims received prior to October 1, 1984. Date of receipt of 
claim or date on which the veteran became permanently and totally 
disabled, if claim is filed within one year from such date, whichever is 
to the advantage of the veteran.
    (ii) Claims received on or after October 1, 1984. (A) Except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, date of receipt of 
claim.
    (B) If, within one year from the date on which the veteran became 
permanently and totally disabled, the veteran files a claim for a 
retroactive award and establishes that a physical or mental disability, 
which was not the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct, was so 
incapacitating that it prevented him or her from filing a disability 
pension claim for at least the first 30 days immediately following the 
date on which the veteran became permanently and totally disabled, the 
disability pension award may be effective from the date of receipt of 
claim or the date on which the veteran became permanently and totally 
disabled, whichever is to the advantage of the veteran. While rating 
board judgment must be applied to the facts and circumstances of each 
case, extensive hospitalization will generally qualify as sufficiently 
incapacitating to have prevented the filing of a claim. For the purposes 
of this subparagraph, the presumptive provisions of Sec. 3.342(a) do 
not apply.
    (2) Disability compensation--(i) Direct service connection (Sec. 
3.4(b)). Day following separation from active service or date 
entitlement arose if claim is received within 1 year after separation 
from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement 
arose, whichever is later. Separation from service means separation 
under conditions other than dishonorable from continuous active service 
which extended from the date the disability was incurred or aggravated.
    (ii) Presumptive service connection (Sec. Sec. 3.307, 3.308, 
3.309). Date entitlement arose, if claim is received within 1 year after 
separation from active duty; otherwise date of receipt of claim, or date 
entitlement arose, whichever is later. Where the requirements for 
service connection are met during service, the effective date will be 
the day following separation from service if there was continuous active 
service following the period of service on which the presumption is 
based and a claim is received within 1 year after separation from active 
duty.
    (c) Death benefits--(1) Death in service (38 U.S.C. 5110(j), Pub. L. 
87-825) (Sec. Sec. 3.4(c), 3.5(b)). First day of the month fixed by the 
Secretary concerned as the date of actual or presumed death, if claim is 
received with 1 year after the date the initial report of actual death 
or finding of presumed death was made; however benefits based on a 
report of actual death are not payable for any period for which the 
claimant has received, or is entitled to receive an allowance, 
allotment, or service pay of the veteran.
    (2) Service-connected death after separation from service (38 U.S.C. 
5110(d), Pub. L. 87-825) (Sec. Sec. 3.4(c), 3.5(b)). First day of the 
month in which the veteran's death occurred if claim is received within 
1 year after the date of death; otherwise, date of receipt of claim.
    (3) Nonservice-connected death after separation from service. (i) 
For awards based on claims received prior to October 1, 1984, or on or 
after December 10, 2004, first day of the month in which the veteran's 
death occurred if claim is received within one year after the date of 
death; otherwise, date of receipt of claim.
    (ii) For awards based on claims received between October 1, 1984, 
and December 9, 2004, first day of the month in which the veteran's 
death occurred if claim is received within 45 days after the date of 
death; otherwise, date of receipt of claim.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5110(d))

    (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation--(i) Deaths prior to 
January 1, 1957 (Sec. 3.702). Date of receipt of election.

[[Page 277]]

    (ii) Child (38 U.S.C. 5110(e), Pub. L. 87-835). First day of the 
month in which entitlement arose if claim is received within 1 year 
after the date of entitlement; otherwise, date of receipt of claim.
    (iii) Deaths on or after May 1, 1957 (in-service waiver cases) 
(Sec. Sec. 3.5(b)(3) and 3.702). Date of receipt of election. (See 
Sec. 3.114(a)).
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Apportionment (Sec. Sec. 3.450 through 3.461, 3.551). On 
original claims, in accordance with the facts found. On other than 
original claims from the first day of the month following the month in 
which:
    (1) Claim is received for apportionment of a veteran's award, except 
that where payments to him (her) have been interrupted, apportionment 
will be effective the day following date of last payment if a claim for 
apportionment is received within 1 year after that date;
    (2) Notice is received that a child included in the surviving 
spouse's award is not in the surviving spouse's custody, except that 
where payments to the surviving spouse have been interrupted,

if such notice is received within 1 year after that date.
    (f) Federal employees' compensation cases (Sec. 3.708). Date 
authorized by applicable law, subject to any payments made by the Office 
of Workers' Compensation Programs under the Federal Employees' 
Compensation Act over the same period of time.
    (g) Correction of military records (38 U.S.C. 5110(i); Pub. L. 87-
825). Where entitlement is established because of the correction, change 
or modification of a military record, or of a discharge or dismissal, by 
a Board established under 10 U.S.C. 1552 or 1553, or because of other 
corrective action by competent military naval, or air authority, the 
award will be effective from the latest of these dates:
    (1) Date application for change, correction, or modification was 
filed with the service department, in either an original or a disallowed 
claim;
    (2) Date of receipt of claim if claim was disallowed; or
    (3) One year prior to date of reopening of disallowed claim.
    (h) Difference of opinion (Sec. 3.105). (1) As to decisions not 
final prior to receipt of an application for reconsideration or to 
reopen, or prior to reconsideration on Department of Veterans Affairs 
initiative, the date from which benefits would have been payable if the 
former decision had been favorable.
    (2) As to decisions which have become final (by appellate decision 
or failure to timely initiate and perfect an appeal) prior to receipt of 
an application for reconsideration or to reopen, the date of receipt of 
such application or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.
    (3) As to decisions which have become final (by appellate decision 
or failure to timely initiate and perfect an appeal) and reconsideration 
is undertaken solely on Department of Veterans Affairs initiative, the 
date of Central Office approval authorizing a favorable decision or the 
date of the favorable Board of Veterans Appeals decision.
    (4) Where the initial determination for the purpose of death 
benefits is favorable, the commencing date will be determined without 
regard to the fact that the action may reverse, on a difference of 
opinion, an unfavorable decision for disability purposes by an 
adjudicative agency other than the Board of Veterans Appeals, which was 
in effect at the date of the veteran's death.
    (i) Disability or death due to hospitalization, etc. (38 U.S.C. 
5110(c), (d); Public Law 87-825; Sec. Sec. 3.358, 3.361, and 3.800.)

domiciliary care at Department of Veterans Affairs expense, the 
effective date will be the date of departure therefrom.

Sec. 3.405  Filipino veterans and their survivors; benefits at the full-dollar rate.

    Public Laws 106-377 and 108-183, which provide disability 
compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation at full-dollar 
rates to certain Filipino veterans and their survivors, are considered 
liberalizing laws. As such, the provisions of 38 CFR 3.114(a) apply when 
determining the effective date of an award. If the requirements of Sec. 
3.114(a) are not satisfied, then the effective date of an award of 
benefits at the full-dollar rate under Sec. 3.42 will be determined as 
follows:

[[Page 282]]

    (a) Initial entitlement to full-dollar rate. The latest of the 
following:
    (1) Date entitlement arose;
    (2) Date on which the veteran or survivor first met the residency 
and citizenship or permanent resident alien status requirements in Sec. 
3.42, if VA receives evidence of this within one year of that date; or
    (3) Effective date of service connection, provided VA receives 
evidence that the veteran or survivor meets the residency and 
citizenship or permanent resident alien status requirements in Sec. 
3.42 within one year of the date of notification of the decision 
establishing service connection.
    (b) Resumption of full-dollar rate. (1) Date the veteran or survivor 
returned to the United States after an absence of more than 60 
consecutive days; or
    (2) First day of the calendar year following the year in which the 
veteran or survivor was absent from the United States for a total of 183 
days or more, or the first day after that date that the veteran or 
survivor returns to the United States.

                             Apportionments


<R05>
Sec. 3.450  General.

    (a)(1) All or any part of the pension, compensation, or emergency 
officers' retirement pay payable on account of any veteran may be 
apportioned.
    (i) On behalf of his or her spouse, children, or dependent parents 
if the veteran is incompetent and is being furnished hospital treatment, 
institutional, or domiciliary care by the United States, or any 
political subdivision thereof.
    (ii) If the veteran is not residing with his or her spouse, or if 
the veteran's children are not residing with the veteran and the veteran 
is not reasonably discharging his or her responsibility for the spouse's 
or children's support.
    (2) Where any of the children of a deceased veteran are not living 
with the veteran's surviving spouse, the pension, compensation, or 
dependency and indemnity compensation otherwise payable to the surviving 
spouse may be apportioned.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5307)

    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 3.458(e), no apportionment of 
disability or death benefits will be made or changed solely because a 
child has entered active duty with the air, military, or naval services 
of the United States.
    (c) No apportionment will be made where the veteran, the veteran's 
spouse (when paid ``as wife'' or ``as husband''), surviving spouse, or 
fiduciary is providing for dependents. The additional benefits for such 
dependents will be paid to the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or 
fiduciary.
    (d) Any amounts payable for children under Sec. Sec. 3.459, 3.460 
and 3.461 will be equally divided among the children.
    (e) The amount payable for a child in custody of and residing with 
the surviving spouse shall be paid to the surviving spouse. Amounts 
payable to a surviving spouse for a child in the surviving spouse's 
custody but residing with someone else may be apportioned if the 
surviving spouse is not reasonably contributing to the child's support.
    (f) Prior to release of any amounts the relationship of the claimant 
and the dependency of a parent will be fully developed, and the 
necessary evidence secured.
    (g) The provisions of Sec. 3.460 are applicable where the surviving 
spouse is entitled to a higher rate of pension under the circumstances 
described in that section.

<R05>
Sec. 3.451  Special apportionments.

    Without regard to any other provision regarding apportionment where 
hardship is shown to exist, pension, compensation, emergency officers' 
retirement pay, or dependency and indemnity compensation may be 
specially apportioned between the veteran and his or her dependents or 
the surviving spouse and children on the basis of the facts in the 
individual case as long as it does not cause undue hardship to the other 
persons in interest, except as to those cases covered by Sec. 3.458(b) 
and (c). In determining the basis for special apportionment, 
consideration will be given such factors as:

[[Page 283]]

Amount of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits payable; other 
resources and income of the veteran and those dependents in whose behalf 
apportionment is claimed; and special needs of the veteran, his or her 
dependents, and the apportionment claimants. The amount apportioned 
should generally be consistent with the total number of dependents 
involved. Ordinarily, apportionment of more than 50 percent of the 
veteran's benefits would constitute undue hardship on him or her while 
apportionment of less than 20 percent of his or her benefits would not 
provide a reasonable amount for any apportionee.

[44 FR 45940, Aug. 6, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 3.452  Situations when benefits may be apportioned.

    Veterans benefits may be apportioned:
    (a) If the veteran is not residing with his or her spouse or his or 
her children and a claim for apportionment is filed for or on behalf of 
the spouse or children.
    (b) Pending the appointment of a guardian or other fiduciary.
    (c)(1) Where an incompetent veteran without a fiduciary is receiving 
institutional care by the United States or a political subdivision, his 
or her benefit may be apportioned for a spouse or child, or, except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(2), for a dependent parent, unless such 
benefit is paid to a spouse (``as wife'' or ``as husband'') for the use 
of the veteran and his or her dependents.
    (2) Where a married veteran is receiving section 306 or improved 
pension and the amount payable is reduced under Sec. 3.551(c) because 
of hospitalization, an apportionment may be paid to the veteran's spouse 
as provided in Sec. 3.454(b).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a); 5307; 5503(a))

    (d) Where additional compensation is payable on behalf of a parent 
and the veteran or his or her guardian neglects or refuses to contribute 
such an amount to the support of the parent the additional compensation 
will be paid to the parent upon receipt of a claim.

    Apportionment of disability pension will be as follows:
    (a) Where a veteran with spouse, or child is incompetent and without 
legal fiduciary and is maintained in an institution by the United States 
or any political subdivision thereof, $25 monthly will be paid as an 
institutional award to the Director of a Department of Veterans Affairs 
medical center or chief officer of a non-Department of Veterans Affairs 
institution for the use of the veteran, and the balance will be paid to 
the dependent or dependents. If the veteran has no spouse, or child but 
has a dependent parent, apportionment will be in accordance with Sec. 
3.451.
    (b)(1) Where the amount of section 306 pension payable to a married 
veteran under 38 U.S.C. 1521(b), as in effect on December 31, 1978, is 
reduced to $50 monthly under Sec. 3.551(c), an apportionment may be 
made to such veteran's spouse upon an affirmative showing of hardship. 
The amount of the apportionment generally will be the difference between 
$50 and the total amount of pension payable on December 31, 1978.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(a))

    (2) Where the amount of improved pension payable to a married

3.551(e)(1) an apportionment may be made to such veteran's spouse upon 
an affirmative showing of hardship. The amount of the apportionment 
generally will be the difference between $90 and the rate payable if 
pension was being paid under 38 U.S.C. 1521(c) including the additional 
amount payable under 38 U.S.C. 1521(e) if the veteran is so entitled.

Sec. 3.458  Veteran's benefits not apportionable.

    Veteran's benefits will not be apportioned:

conjugal infidelity by a court having proper jurisdiction.
    (c) For purported or legal spouse of the veteran if it has been 
determined that he or she has lived with another person and held herself 
or himself out openly to the public to be the spouse of such other 
person, except where such relationship was entered into in good faith 
with a reasonable basis (for example trickery on the part of the 
veteran) for the spouse believing that the marriage to the veteran was 
legally terminated. No apportionment to the spouse will thereafter be 
made unless there has been a reconciliation and later estrangement.
    (d) Where the child of the disabled person has been legally adopted 
by another person, except the additional compensation payable for the 
child.
    (e) Where a child enters the active military, air, or naval service, 
any additional amount will be paid to the veteran unless such child is 
included in an existing apportionment to an estranged spouse. No 
adjustment in the apportioned award will be made based on the child's 
entry into service.
    (f)(1) For the spouse, child, father or mother of a disabled 
veteran, where forfeiture was declared prior to September 2, 1959, if 
the dependent is determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
have been guilty of mutiny, treason, sabotage, or rendering assistance 
to an enemy of the United States or its allies.
    (2) For any dependent of a disabled veteran, or surviving spouse 
where forfeiture of benefits by a person primarily entitled was declared 
after September 1, 1959, by reason of fraud, treasonable acts, or 
subversive activities.

Sec. 3.461  Dependency and indemnity compensation.

    (a) Conditions under which apportionment may be made. The surviving 
spouse's award of dependency and indemnity compensation will be 
apportioned where there is a child or children under 18 years of age and

of dependency and indemnity compensation will not be apportioned under 
this condition for a child over the age of 18 years.
    (b) Rates payable. (1) The share for each of the chidren under 18 
years of age, including those in the surviving spouse's custody as well 
as those who are not in such custody, will be at rates approved by the 
Under Secretary for Benefits except when the facts and circumstances in 
a case warrant special apportionment under Sec. 3.451. The share for 
the surviving spouse will be the difference between the children's share 
and the total amount payable. In the application of this rule, however, 
the surviving spouse's share will not be reduced to an amount less than 
50 percent of that to which the surviving spouse would otherwise be 
entitled.

section; or
    (ii) The share which would have been payable as death compensation 
but not in excess of the total dependency and indemnity compensation.

                       Hospitalization Adjustments


<R05>
Sec. 3.551  Reduction because of hospitalization.

    (a) General. Pension is subject to reduction as specified below when 
a veteran who has neither spouse, child nor dependent parent is 
hospitalized, unless the veteran is hospitalized for Hansen's disease. 
The provisions of this section apply to initial periods of 
hospitalization and to readmissions following discharge from a prior 
period of hospitalization. If the veteran is hospitalized for 
observation and examination, the date treatment began is considered the 
date of admission. Special rules governing discontinuance of aid and 
attendance allowance are contained in Sec. 3.552. Except as otherwise 
indicated the terms ``hospitalized'' and ``hospitalization'' in 
Sec. Sec. 3.551 through 3.556 mean:
    (1) Hospital treatment in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital 
or in any hospital at Department of Veterans Affairs expense.
    (2) Institutional, domiciliary or nursing home care in a Department 
of Veterans Affairs institution or domiciliary or at Department of 
Veterans Affairs expense.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(a))

    (b) Old-law pension. (1) Old law pension in excess of $30 monthly 
for a veteran who has neither spouse, child nor dependent parent shall 
continue at the full monthly rate until the end of the sixth calendar 
month following the month of admission for hospitalization. The rate 
payable will be reduced effective the first of the seventh calendar 
month to $30 monthly or 50 percent of the amount otherwise payable, 
whichever is greater. The reduced rate will be effective the first day 
of the seventh calendar month following admission. Payment of the amount 
withheld may be made on termination of hospitalization, as provided in 
Sec. 3.556. (Sec. 306(b))
    (2) Readmission following regular discharge. Where a veteran has 
been given an approved discharge or release, readmission the next day to 
the same or any other VA institution begins a new period of 
hospitalization, unless the veteran was released for purposes of 
admission to another VA institution.

[[Page 291]]

    (3) Readmission following irregular discharge. When a veteran whose 
award is subject to reduction under this paragraph has been discharged 
or released from a VA institution against medical advice or as a result 
of disciplinary action, reentry within 6 months from the date of 
previous admission constitutes a continuation of that period of 
hospitalization and the award will not be reduced prior to the first day 
of the seventh calendar month following the month of original admission, 
exclusive of authorized absences. Reentry 6 months or more after such 
discharge or release shall be considered a new admission.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(a))

    (c) Section 306 pension. (1) Where any veteran having neither spouse 
nor child, or any veteran who is married or has a child and is receiving 
pension as a veteran without dependents, is being furnished hospital, 
nursing home or domiciliary care by the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
no pension in excess of $50 monthly shall be paid to or for the veteran 
for any period after the end of the second full calendar month following 
the month of admission for such care.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(a))

    (2) No pension in excess of $50 monthly shall be paid to or for a 
veteran having neither spouse nor child, or to a veteran who is married 
or has a child and is receiving pension as a veteran without dependents, 
for any period after the month in which the veteran is readmitted within 
6 months of a period of care for which pension was reduced under 
paragraph (c) (1) of this section.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(a))

    (3) Where section 306 pension is being paid to a married veteran at 
a rate for a veteran without dependents all or any part of the monthly 
amount of pension withheld in excess of $50 may be apportioned for a 
spouse as provided in Sec. 3.454(b).
    (d) Improved pension prior to February 1, 1990. (1) Where any 
veteran having neither spouse nor child, or any veteran who is married

    (2) Where any veteran having neither spouse nor child, or any 
veteran who is married or has a child and is receiving pension as a 
veteran without dependents, is furnished hospital or nursing home care 
by VA, no pension in excess of $60 monthly shall be paid to or for the 
veteran for any period after the end of the third full calendar month 
following the month of admission for such care. (38 U.S.C. 5503(a))
    (3) No pension in excess of $60 monthly shall be paid to or for a 
veteran having neither spouse nor child, or to a veteran who is married 
or has a child and is receiving pension as a veteran without dependents, 
for any period after the month in which the veteran is readmitted within 
6 months of a period of care for which pension was reduced under 
paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. (38 U.S.C. 5503(a))
    (4) Where improved pension is being paid to a married veteran at the 
rate prescribed by 38 U.S.C. 1521(b) all or any part of the rate payable 
under 38 U.S.C. 1521(c) may be apportioned for a spouse as provided in 
Sec. 3.454(b). (38 U.S.C. 5503(a))
    (5) The provisions of paragraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this 
section are not applicable to any veteran who has a child, but is 
receiving pension as a veteran without a dependent because it is 
reasonable that some part of the child's estate be consumed for the 
child's maintenance under 38 U.S.C. 1522(b).
    (6) For the purpose of paragraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this 
section, if a veteran is furnished hospital or nursing home care by VA 
and then is transferred to VA-furnished domiciliary care, the period of 
hospital or nursing home care shall be considered as domiciliary care. 
Similarly, if a veteran is furnished domiciliary care by VA and then is 
transferred to VA-furnished hospital or nursing home care, the period of 
domiciliary care shall be considered hospital or nursing home care.

[[Page 292]]

    (e) Improved pension after January 31, 1990. (1) Where any veteran 
having neither spouse nor child, or any veteran who is married or has a 
child and is receiving pension as a veteran without dependents, is 
furnished domiciliary or nursing home care by VA, no pension in excess 
of $90 monthly shall be paid to or for the veteran for any period after 
the end of the third full calendar month following the month of 
admission for such care.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(a))

    (2) No pension in excess of $90 monthly shall be paid to a veteran 
having neither spouse nor child, or to a veteran who is married or has a 
child and is receiving pension as a veteran without dependents, for any 
period after the month in which the veteran is readmitted within six 
months of a period of domiciliary or nursing home care for which pension 
was reduced under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (3) Where improved pension is being paid to a married veteran at the 
rate prescribed by 38 U.S.C. 1521(b) all or any part of the rate payable 
under 38 U.S.C. 1521(c) may be apportioned for a spouse as provided in 
Sec. 3.454(b).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(a))

    (4) For the purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if a 
veteran is furnished hospital care by VA and then is transferred to VA-
furnished nursing home or domiciliary care, the period of hospital care 
shall not be considered as nursing home or domiciliary care. Transfers 
from VA-furnished nursing home or domiciliary care to VA-furnished 
hospital care then back to nursing home or domiciliary care shall be 
considered as continuous nursing home or domiciliary care provided the 
period of hospitalization does not exceed six months. Similarly, if a 
veteran is transferred from domiciliary or nursing home to a VA hospital 
and dies while so hospitalized, the entire period of VA care shall be 
considered as domiciliary or nursing home care. Nursing home or 
domiciliary care shall be considered as terminated effective the date of 
transfer to a VA hospital if the veteran is completely discharged from 
VA care following the period of hospitalization or if the period of 
hospitalization exceeds six months.
    (5) Effective February 1, 1990, reductions of improved pension based 
on admissions or readmissions to VA hospitals or any hospital at VA 
expense shall no longer be made except when required under the 
provisions of 38 CFR 3.552.
    (6) The provisions of paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section are 
not applicable to any veteran who has a child, but is receiving pension 
as a veteran without a dependent because it is reasonable that some part 
of the child's estate be consumed for the child's maintenance under 38 
U.S.C. 1522(b).
    (f) Computation of period. For purposes of computing periods of 
hospitalization in paragraph (c) of this section, authorized absences of 
96 hours or less will be included as periods of hospitalization, and 
those of over 96 hours excluded. Also, for purposes of that paragraph, 
periods of treatment or care of 60 total days will be considered two 
calendar months of hospitalization and periods of 90 total days 
considered three calendar months, exclusive of authorized absences in 
excess of 96 hours.
    (g) Proof of dependents. The veteran will be considered to have 
neither spouse, child nor dependent parent in the absence of 
satisfactory proof. Statements contained in the claims folder concerning 
the existence of such dependents will be considered a prima facie 
showing. If the necessary evidence is not received: (1) Within 60 days 
after the date of request where the award is subject to reduction under 
paragraph (b) of this section, or (2) prior to the effective date of 
reduction under paragraph (c) of this section, the veteran's award will 
be reduced on the basis of no dependents. The full rate may be 
authorized from the date of reduction if the necessary evidence is 
received within 1 year after the date of request.
    (h) Hospitalization--(1) General. The reduction required by 
paragraphs (d) and (e), except as they refer to domiciliary care, shall 
not be made for up to three additional calendar months after the last 
day of the third month referred to in paragraphs (d)(2) or (e)(1) of 
this section, or after the last day of the month referred to in 
paragraphs (d)(3)

[[Page 293]]

or (e)(2) of this section, under the following conditions:
    (i) The Chief Medical Director, or designee, certifies that the 
primary purpose for furnishing hospital or nursing home care during the 
additional period is to provide the veteran with a prescribed program of 
rehabilitation under chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, 
designed to restore the veteran's ability to function within the 
veteran's family and community; and
    (ii) The veteran is admitted to a Department of Veterans Affairs 
hospital or nursing home after October 16, 1981.
    (2) Continued hospitalization for rehabilitation. The reduction 
required by paragraph (d) or (e) of this section shall not be made for 
periods after the expiration of the additional period provided by 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section under the following conditions:
    (i) The veteran remains hospitalized or in a nursing home after the 
expiration of the additional period provided by paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section; and
    (ii) The Chief Medical Director, or designee, certifies that the 
primary purpose for furnishing continued hospital or nursing home care 
after the additional period provided by paragraph (h)(1) of this section 
is to provide the veteran with a program of rehabilitation under chapter 
17 of title 38, United States Code, designed to restore the veteran's 
ability to function within the veteran's family and community.
    (3) Termination of hospitalization for rehabilitation. Pension in 
excess of $60 monthly or $90, if reduction is under paragraph (e)(1) 
payable to a veteran under this paragraph shall be reduced the end of 
the calendar month in which the primary purpose of hospitalization or 
nursing home care is no longer to provide the veteran with a program of 
rehabilitation under chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code designed 
to restore the veteran's ability to function within the veteran's family 
and community.

    (i) Certain veterans and surviving spouses receiving Medicaid-
covered nursing home care. Effective November 5, 1990, and terminating 
on September 30, 2011, if a veteran having neither spouse nor child, or 
a surviving spouse having no child, is receiving Medicaid-covered 
nursing home care, no pension or death pension in excess of $90 per 
month shall be paid to or for the veteran or the surviving spouse for 
any period after the month in which the Medicaid payments begin. A 
veteran or surviving spouse is not liable for any pension paid in excess 
of the $90 per month by reason of the Secretary's inability or failure 
to reduce payments, unless that inability or failure is the result of 
willful concealment by the veteran or surviving spouse of information 
necessary to make that reduction.

Sec. 3.552  Adjustment of allowance for aid and attendance.

    (a)(1) When a veteran who is already entitled to the aid and 
attendance allowance is hospitalized, the additional compensation or 
increased pension for aid and attendance shall be discontinued as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section except as to disabilities 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (See paragraph (k) of 
this section for rules applicable to a veteran who establishes 
entitlement to the aid and attendance allowance on or after date of 
admission to hospitalization).
    (2) The allowance for aid and attendance will be continued during 
hospitalization where the disability is paraplegia involving paralysis 
of both lower extremities together with loss of anal and bladder 
sphincter control, or Hansen's disease, except where discontinuance is 
required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, in pension 
cases only, the aid and attendance allowance will be continued where the 
pensionable disability is blindness (visual acuity \5/200\ or less) or 
concentric

[[Page 294]]

contraction of visual field to 5 degrees or less. Awards are, however, 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 3.551 (except where the disabling 
condition is Hansen's disease) .
    (3) Additional compensation for dependents under Sec. 3.4(b)(2) is 
payable during hospitalization in addition to the rates authorized by 
this section. The rates specified will also be increased by amounts 
authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) based on independently ratable 
disability, subject to the statutory ceiling on the total amount of 
compensation payable as set forth in Sec. 3.350(a).
    (b)(1) Where a veteran is admitted for hospitalization on or after 
October 1, 1964, the additional compensation or increased pension for 
aid and attendance will be discontinued effective the last day of the 
month following the month in which the veteran is admitted for 
hospitalization at the expense of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (2) When a veteran is hospitalized at the expense of the United 
States Government, the additional aid and attendance allowance 
authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1114(r) (1) or (2) will be discontinued 
effective the last day of the month following the month in which the 
veteran is admitted for hospitalization.
    (3) Where a veteran affected by the provisions of paragraph (b) (1) 
and (2) or paragraph (k) of this section is discharged or released from 
the hospital against medical advice or as the result of disciplinary 
action, and is readmitted to such hospitalization within 6 months after 
that date, the allowance, additional compensation, or increased pension 
will be discontinued effective the day preceding the date of 
readmission. A readmission 6 months or more after such discharge or 
release will be considered as a new admission.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(e))

    (c) Reduction will not be made where the same monthly rate of 
compensation would be payable without consideration of need for regular 
aid and attendance. This can only be determined after careful review of 
the current maximum entitlement without regard to any amount for aid and 
attendance.
    (d) Where entitlement by reason of need for regular aid and 
attendance is the basis of the monthly rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(1) the 
award will be reduced to the rate payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(s).
    (e) Where a veteran is in receipt of section 306 pension, the aid 
and attendance allowance shall be reduced to the housebound rate of $61 
monthly (or $76.25 if the veteran was age 78 or older on December 31, 
1978). Where a veteran is in receipt of old-law pension, the total 
amount payable shall be reduced to $100 monthly. Where a veteran is in 
receipt of improved pension, the applicable aid and attendance rate 
shall be reduced to the otherwise applicable rate under 38 U.S.C. 
1521(e). No reduction shall be made, however, for any case involving the 
disabilities specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (f) Where entitlement to the rate in 38 U.S.C. 1114(o) is based in 
part on need for regular aid and attendance reduction because of being 
hospitalized will be to the rate payable for the other conditions shown.
    (g) Where a veteran entitled to one of the rates under 38 U.S.C. 
1114 (l), (m), or (n) by reason of anatomical losses or losses of use of 
extremities, blindness (visual acuity 5/200 or less or light perception 
only), or anatomical loss of both eyes is being paid compensation at the 
rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(o) because of entitlement to another rate 
under section 1114(l) on account of need for aid and attendance, the 
compensation will be reduced while hospitalized to the following:
    (1) If entitlement is under section 1114(l) and in addition there is 
need for regular aid and attendance for another disability, the award 
during hospitalization will be at the rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(m) since 
the disability requiring aid and attendance is 100 percent disabling.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1114(p))

    (2) If entitlement is under section 1114(m), at the rate under 38 
U.S.C. 1114(n).
    (3) If entitlement is under section 1114(n), the rate under 38 
U.S.C. 1114(o) would be continued, since the disability previously 
causing the need for regular aid and attendance would then

[[Page 295]]

be totally disabling entitling the veteran to the maximum rate under 38 
U.S.C. 1114(p).
    (h) If, because of blindness, a veteran requires regular aid and 
attendance, but has better vision than ``light perception only'' the 
award under 38 U.S.C. 1114(m) will be reduced while hospitalized to the 
rate payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(1).
    (i) If the disability meets the aid and attendance requirements of 
38 U.S.C. 1114(l) and the intermediate or next higher rate was assigned 
for disability independently ratable at 50 percent or 100 percent, the 
award based on such entitlement will be reduced because of 
hospitalization to the amount payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(s).
    (j) The section 306 pension aid and attendance allowance authorized 
by Sec. 3.252(f) is subject to reduction for hospitalization under the 
provisions of this section in the same manner as the regular section 306 
pension aid and attendance allowance. The amount payable shall not be 
reduced to less than the housebound rate of $61 monthly (or $76.25 
monthly if the veteran was age 78 or older on December 31, 1978).
    (k)(1) This paragraph is applicable to hospitalized veterans who 
were not entitled to the aid and attendance allowance prior to hospital 
admission but who establish entitlement to it on or after the date of 
hospital admission.
    (2) If the effective date of entitlement to the aid and attendance 
allowance is on or after the date of admission to hospitalization, the 
aid and attendance allowance shall not be paid until the date of 
discharge or release from hospitalization, unless the aid and attendance 
allowance is based on a disability specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. If the aid and attendance allowance is based on a disability 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the aid and attendance 
allowance shall be paid during hospitalization.
    (3) If the aid and attendance allowance is not payable to a veteran 
under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the veteran shall receive the 
appropriate reduced rate under paragraphs (d) through (j) of this 
section while hospitalized.

Sec. Sec. 3.553-3.555  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 3.556  Adjustment on discharge or release.

    (a) Temporary Absence--30 days. (1) Where a competent veteran whose 
award was reduced under Sec. 3.551(b) is placed on non-bed care status 
or other authorized absence of 30 days or more the full monthly rate, 
excluding any allowance for regular aid and attendance, will be restored 
effective the date of reduction. The full monthly rate for an 
incompetent veteran, or for a competent veteran whose pension was 
reduced under Sec. 3.551(c), will be restored effective the date of 
departure from the hospital unless it is determined that apportionment 
for a spouse should be continued. In all instances, any allowance for 
regular aid and attendance will be restored effective the date of 
departure from the hospital.
    (2) Upon the veteran's return to the hospital, an award which is 
subject to reduction under Sec. 3.551 (b) or (c) will again be reduced 
effective the date of the veteran's return to the hospital. In all 
instances, any allowance for regular aid and attendance will be 
discontinued, if in order, effective the date of the veteran's return to 
the hospital.
    (b) Temporary absence--less than 30 days. A temporary absence of 
less than 30 days, including the day of departure, will not require 
adjustment of the award. This applies to any approved absence. Any 
allowance for regular aid and attendance for such periods will be 
authorized after the veteran has been discharged from the hospital.
    (c) Adjustment based on need. Where an award of pension was reduced 
under Sec. 3.551(c), the full rate covering absences of less than 30 
days may be restored, subject to prior payments, prior to discharge from 
hospitalization at the request of the Director of the hospital, center 
or domiciliary, where this

[[Page 296]]

action is necessary to meet the veteran's financial needs, if the 
veteran has been hospitalized for more than 6 months and the periods of 
absence exceed a total of 30 days.
    (d) Irregular discharge. When a competent veteran is given an 
irregular discharge, the full rate will be restored effective the date 
of release from the hospital. Payment of any amount withheld under Sec. 
3.551(b) will not be authorized until the expiration of 6 months after 
termination of hospitalization unless the prior release is changed to a 
regular release. However, amounts not paid under paragraph (c) of this 
section covering absence of less than 30 days where the award was 
reduced under Sec. 3.551(c) will be authorized immediately.
    (e) Regular discharge. When a veteran, either competent or 
incompetent, is given a regular discharge or release, the full rate, 
including any allowance for regular aid and attendance will be restored 
effective the date of release from the hospital, subject to prior 
payments. The award will be based on the most recent rating and, where 
the award was reduced under Sec. 3.551(b), will include, in the case of 
a competent veteran, any amounts withheld because of hospitalization. 
The amount withheld for an incompetent veteran will not be authorized 
until the expiration of 6 months following a rating of competency by VA. 
Any institutional award will be discontinued effective date of last 
payment, as provided in Sec. 3.501(j). Where an apportionment made 
under Sec. 3.551(c) is not continued, the apportionment will be 
discontinued effective the day preceding the date of the veteran's 
release from the hospital, or, if adjusted, effective the date of the 
veteran's release from the hospital, unless an overpayment would result. 
In the excepted cases, the awards to the veteran and apportionee will be 
adjusted as of date of last payment.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503)

    (f) Types of discharges. A discharge is considered regular if it is 
granted because of having received maximum hospital benefits. A 
discharge for disciplinary reasons or because of the patient's refusal 
to accept, neglect of or obstruction of treatment; refusal to accept 
transfer, or failure to return from authorized absence, is considered 
irregular.

    (a) Payments for the veteran will be resumed and apportionment 
awards discontinued under the applicable provisions of Sec. 3.556(a), 
(d), and (e) upon authorized absence from the hospital for 30 days or 
more or a regular or irregular discharge or release. Care and 
maintenance payments to an institution will not be made for any period 
the veteran is not receiving such care and maintenance.
    (b) Any amount not paid because of the provisions of former Sec. 
3.557(b) (as in effect prior to December 27, 2001), and any amount of 
compensation or retirement pay withheld pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 3.551(b) (and/or predecessor regulatory provisions) as it was 
constituted prior to August 1, 1972, and not previously paid because of 
the provisions of former Sec. 3.557(b) (as in effect prior to December 
27, 2001), will be awarded to the veteran if he or she is subsequently 
rated competent by VA for a period of not less than six months.

                       Adjustments and Resumptions


<R05>
Sec. 3.650  Rate for additional dependent.

    (a) Running awards. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section where a claim is filed by an additional

[[Page 297]]

dependent who has apparent entitlement which, if established, would 
require reduction of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity 
compensation being paid to another dependent, payments to the person or 
persons on the rolls will be reduced as follows:
    (1) Where benefits would be payable from a date prior to the date of 
filing claim, the reduction will be effective from the date of potential 
entitlement of the additional dependent.
    (2) Where benefits would be payable from the date of filing claim, 
the reduction will be effective the date of receipt of the claim by the 
additional dependent, or date of last payment, whichever is later.

If entitlement of the additional dependent is not established, benefits 
previously being paid will be resumed, if otherwise in order, commencing 
the day following the effective date of reduction.
    (b) New awards. If the additional dependent is found to be entitled, 
the full rate payable will be authorized effective the date of 
entitlement.
    (c) Retroactive DIC award to a school child--(1) General. If DIC 
(dependency and indemnity compensation) is being currently paid to a 
veteran's child or children under 38 U.S.C. 1313(a), and DIC is 
retroactively awarded to an additional child of the veteran based on 
school attendance, the full rate payable to the additional child shall 
be awarded the first of the month following the month in which the award 
to the additional child is approved. The rate payable under the current 
award shall be reduced effective the date the full rate is awarded to 
the additional child. The rate payable to the additional child for 
periods prior to the date the full rate is awarded shall be the 
difference between the rate payable for all the children and the rate 
that was payable before the additional child established entitlement.
    (2) Applicability. The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section are applicable only when the following conditions are met:
    (i) The additional child was receiving DIC under 38 U.S.C. 1313(a) 
prior to attaining age 18; and
    (ii) DIC for the additional child was discontinued on or after 
attainment of age 18; and
    (iii) After DIC has been discontinued, the additional child 
reestablishes entitlement to DIC under 38 U.S.C. 1313(a) based on 
attendance at an approved school and the effective date of entitlement 
is prior to the date the Department of Veterans Affairs receives the 
additional child's claim to reestablish entitlement.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1313(b))

    (3) Effective date. This paragraph is applicable to DIC paid after 
September 30, 1981. If DIC is retroactively awarded for a period prior 
to October 1, 1981, payment for the period prior to October 1, 1981 
shall be made under paragraph (a) of this section and payment for the 
period after September 30, 1981, shall be made under this paragraph.

    Except as otherwise provided:
    (a) A payee who becomes entitled to pension, compensation, or 
dependency and indemnity compensation or to a greater rate because 
payment of that benefit to another payee has been reduced or 
discontinued will be awarded the benefit or increased benefit without 
the filing of a new claim.
    (b) The commencement or adjustment will be effective the day 
following the reduction or discontinuance of the award to the other 
payee if the necessary evidence is received in the Department of 
Veterans Affairs within 1 year from the date of request therefor; 
otherwise from the date of receipt of a new claim.
    (c) The rate for the persons entitled will be the rate that would 
have been payable if they had been the only original persons entitled.

Sec. 3.652  Periodic certification of continued eligibility.

    Except as otherwise provided:
    (a) Individuals to whom benefits are being paid are required to 
certify, when

[[Page 298]]

requested, that any or all of the eligibility factors which established 
entitlement to the benefit being paid continue to exist. The beneficiary 
will be advised at the time of the request that the certification must 
be furnished within 60 days from the date of the request therefor and 
that failure to do so will result in the reduction or termination of 
benefits.
    (1) If the certification is not received within 60 days from the 
date of the request, the eligibility factor(s) for which certification 
was requested will be considered to have ceased to exist as of the end 
of the month in which it was last shown by the evidence of record to 
have existed. For purposes of this paragraph, the effective date of 
reduction or termination of benefits will be in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 3.500 through 3.504 as in effect on the date the eligibility 
factor(s) is considered to have ceased to exist. The claimant will be 
advised of the proposed reduction or termination of benefits and the 
date the proposed action will be effective. An additional 60 days from 
the date of notice of the proposed action will be provided for the 
claimant to respond.
    (2) If the certification is not received within the additional 60 
day period, the proposed reduction or termination of benefits will be 
put into effect.
    (b) When the required certification is received, benefits will be 
adjusted, if necessary, in accordance with the facts found.

    (a) General. Pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity 
compensation is not payable to an alien who is located in the territory 
of or under the control of an enemy of the United States or of its 
allies. The benefit may, however, be paid to the dependents of such 
alien, but not in excess of the amount which would be payable to the 
dependent if the alien were dead.

section, together with any amounts placed to the alien's credit in the 
special deposit account in the Treasury or covered into the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts under 31 U.S.C. 123-128 will be paid to him or 
her on the filing of a new claim. Such claim should be supported with 
evidence that the alien has not been guilty of mutiny, treason, sabotage 
or rendering assistance to an enemy, as provided in Sec. 3.902(a).

for benefits for aliens residing in countries identified on the list 
established by the Secretary of the Treasury as countries to which 
checks could not be delivered with reasonable assurance that the payee 
would actually receive and be able to negotiate a check for full value.
    (1) Evidence requests. Requests for evidence to establish either 
basic or continued entitlement will not be made where such evidence 
would be obtained from a country on the Treasury Department list unless 
the claimant requests that checks be sent to him or her in care of a 
U.S. Foreign Service post in a country which is not on the list.
    (2) Awards. Payments for a claimant residing in a country included 
in the Treasury Department list will not be authorized unless the 
claimant requests that checks be sent to him or her in care of a U.S. 
Foreign Service post in a country which is not on the list.
    (3) Retroactive payments. Where award action is authorized under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or a new claim has been filed after a 
country has been removed from the Treasury Department list, all benefits 
to which the payee is otherwise entitled will be paid as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section. There is no time limit for filing claim.

Sec. 3.654  Active service pay.

    (a) General. Pension, compensation, or retirement pay will be 
discontinued under the circumstances stated in Sec. 3.700(a)(1) for any 
period for which the veteran received active service pay. For the 
purposes of this section, active service pay means pay received for 
active duty, active duty for training or inactive duty training.
    (b) Active duty. (1) Where the veteran returns to active duty 
status, the award will be discontinued effective the day preceding 
reentrance into active duty status. If the exact date is not known, 
payments will be discontinued effective date of last payment and as of 
the correct date when the date of reentrance has been ascertained from 
the service department.
    (2) Payments, if otherwise in order, will be resumed effective the 
day following release from active duty if claim for recommencement of 
payments is received within 1 year from the date of such release: 
otherwise payments will be resumed effective 1 year prior to the date of 
receipt of a new claim. Prior determinations of service connection will 
not be disturbed except as provided in Sec. 3.105. Compensation will be 
authorized based on the degree of disability found to exist at the time 
the award is resumed. Disability will be evaluated on the basis of all 
facts, including records from the service department relating to the 
most recent period of active service. If a disability is incurred or 
aggravated in the second period of service, compensation for that 
disability cannot be paid unless a claim therefor is filed.
    (c) Training duty. Prospective adjustment of awards may be made 
where the veteran waives his or her Department of Veterans Affairs 
benefit covering anticipated receipt of active service pay because of 
expected periods of active duty for training or inactive duty training. 
Where readjustment is in order because service pay was not received for 
expected training duty, retroactive payments may be authorized if a 
claim for readjustment is received within 1 year after the end of the 
fiscal year for which payments were waived.

Sec. 3.655  Failure to report for Department of Veterans Affairs examination.

    (a) General. When entitlement or continued entitlement to a benefit 
cannot be established or confirmed without a current VA examination or 
reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for 
such examination, or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance 
with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section as appropriate. Examples of 
good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or 
hospitalization of the claimant, death of an immediate family member, 
etc. For purposes of this section, the terms examination and 
reexamination include periods of hospital observation when required by 
VA.
    (b) Original or reopened claim, or claim for increase. When a 
claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction 
with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on 
the evidence of record. When the examination was scheduled in 
conjunction with any other original claim, a reopened claim for a 
benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase, the 
claim shall be denied.
    (c) Running award. (1) When a claimant fails to report for a 
reexamination and the issue is continuing entitlement, VA shall issue a 
pretermination notice advising the payee that payment for the disability 
or disabilities for which the reexamination was scheduled will be 
discontinued or, if a minimum evaluation is established in part 4 of 
this title or there is an evaluation protected under Sec. 3.951(b) of 
this part, reduced to the lower evaluation. Such notice shall also 
include the prospective date of discontinuance or reduction, the reason 
therefor and a statement of the claimant's procedural and appellate 
rights. The claimant shall be allowed 60 days to indicate his or her

[[Page 300]]

willingness to report for a reexamination or to present evidence that 
payment for the disability or disabilities for which the reexamination 
was scheduled should not be discontinued or reduced.
    (2) If there is no response within 60 days, or if the evidence 
submitted does not establish continued entitlement, payment for such 
disability or disabilities shall be discontinued or reduced as of the 
date indicated in the pretermination notice or the date of last payment, 
whichever is later.
    (3) If notice is received that the claimant is willing to report for 
a reexamination before payment has been discontinued or reduced, action 
to adjust payment shall be deferred. The reexamination shall be 
rescheduled and the claimant notified that failure to report for the 
rescheduled examination shall be cause for immediate discontinuance or 
reduction of payment. When a claimant fails to report for such 
rescheduled examination, payment shall be reduced or discontinued as of 
the date of last payment and shall not be further adjusted until a VA 
examination has been conducted and the report reviewed.
    (4) If within 30 days of a pretermination notice issued under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section the claimant requests a hearing, action 
to adjust payment shall be deferred as set forth in Sec. 3.105(h)(1) of 
this part. If a hearing is requested more than 30 days after such 
pretermination notice but before the proposed date of discontinuance or 
reduction, a hearing shall be scheduled, but payment shall nevertheless 
be discontinued or reduced as of the date proposed in the pretermination 
notice or date of last payment, whichever is later, unless information 
is presented which warrants a different determination. When the claimant 
has also expressed willingness to report for an examination, however, 
the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply.

Sec. 3.656  Disappearance of veteran.

    (a) When any veteran has disappeared for 90 days or more and his or 
her whereabouts remain unknown to the members of his or her family and 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, disability compensation which he or 
she was receiving or entitled to receive may be paid to or for his or 
her spouse, children and parents, effective the day following the date 
of last payment to the veteran if a claim is received within 1 year

total amount payable will be the lesser of these amounts:
    (1) Dependency and indemnity compensation.
    (2) Amount of compensation payable to the veteran at the time of 
disappearance, subject to authorized insurance deductions.
    (b) Where a veteran's whereabouts become known to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs after an award to dependents has been made as provided 
in this section, the award to the dependents will be discontinued 
effective date of last payment, and appropriate action will be taken to 
adjust the veteran's award in accordance with the facts found.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1158)

    (c) Awards to dependents will not be continued under this section in 
any case where the facts are such as to bring into effect the 
presumption of death under Sec. 3.212.
    (d) When any veteran has disappeared for 90 days or more and the 
veteran's whereabouts remain unknown to members of the veteran's family 
and the Department of Veterans Affairs, any improved pension, section 
306 or service pension which the veteran was receiving or entitled to 
receive may be paid to or for the spouse or children. The status of the 
veteran at the time of disappearance, with respect to permanent and 
total disability, income and net worth will be presumed to continue 
unchanged. Payment for the spouse or

[[Page 301]]

children will be effective the day following the date of last payment to 
the veteran if a claim is received within 1 year after that date; 
otherwise from date of receipt of a claim. The total amount payable will 
be the lesser of these amounts:
    (1) The service death pension rate if the veteran was receiving 
service pension or the improved death pension rate if the veteran was 
receiving section 306 or improved pension.
    (2) The amount of pension payable to the veteran at the time of 
disappearance.

Sec. 3.657  Surviving spouse becomes entitled, or entitlement terminates.

    Where a surviving spouse establishes entitlement to pension, 
compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation, an award to 
another person as surviving spouse, or for a child or children as if 
there were no surviving spouse will be discontinued or adjusted as 
provided in this section.
    (a) Surviving spouse's awards. For periods on or after December 1, 
1962, where a legal surviving spouse establishes entitlement after 
payments have been made to another person as surviving spouse, the full 
rate payable to the legal surviving spouse will be authorized effective 
the date of entitlement. Payments to the former payee will be 
discontinued as follows:
    (1) Where benefits are payable to the legal surviving spouse from a 
date prior to the date of filing claim, the award to the former payee 
will be terminated the day preceding the effective date of the award to 
the legal surviving spouse.
    (2) Where benefits are payable to the legal surviving spouse from 
the date of filing claim, the award to the former payee will be 
terminated effective the date of receipt of the claim or date of last 
payment, whichever is later.
    (b) Children's awards. (1) Where a surviving spouse establishes 
entitlement and:
    (i) Payments were being made for a child or children at a lower 
monthly rate than that provided where there is a surviving spouse, the 
award to the surviving spouse will be effective the date provided by the 
applicable law, and will be the difference between the rate paid for the 
children and the rate payable for the surviving spouse and children. The 
full rate will be payable for the surviving spouse effective the day 
following the date of last payment for the children;
    (ii) Payments were being made for a child or children at the same or 
higher monthly rate than that provided where there is a surviving 
spouse, the award to the surviving spouse will be effective the day 
following the date of last payment on the awards on behalf of the 
children.
    (2) Where a surviving spouse has received benefits after entitlement 
was terminated and,
    (i) The child or children were entitled to a lower monthly rate, the 
award to the surviving spouse will be amended to authorize payment at 
the rate provided for the children as if there were no surviving spouse, 
covering the period from the date the surviving spouse's entitlement 
terminated to the date of last payment. The award for the child or 
children will be made effective the following day.
    (ii) The child or children were entitled to a higher monthly rate, 
the award to the surviving spouse will be discontinued effective date of 
last payment. The award to the children will be effective the day 
following the date the surviving spouse's entitlement terminated and 
will be the difference between the rate payable for the children and the 
rate paid on the surviving spouse's award. The full rate will be payable 
for the children effective the day following the date of last payment to 
the surviving spouse.

such benefits to or on account of a child will be made subject to any 
payments of these benefits made to or on account of that child over the 
same period of time based on the service of another parent in the same 
parental line.
    (b) Any reduction or discontinuance of an award to the child or to a 
surviving spouse will be effective the day preceding the commencing date 
of death pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation 
or, under the circumstances described in Sec. 3.707, the commencing 
date of dependents' educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 35, to or 
on account of the child based on the service of another parent in the 
same parental line. Any increase to a surviving spouse or another child

<R05>
Sec. 3.660  Dependency, income and estate.

    (a) Reduction or discontinuance--(1) General. A veteran, surviving 
spouse or child who is receiving pension, or a parent who is receiving 
compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation must notify the 
Department of Veterans Affairs of any material change or expected change 
in his or her income or other circumstances which would affect his or 
her entitlement to receive, or the rate of, the benefit being paid. Such 
notice must be furnished when the recipient acquires knowledge that he 
or she will begin to receive additional income or when his or her 
marital or dependency status changes. In pension claims subject to Sec. 
3.252(b) or Sec. 3.274 and in compensation claims subject to Sec. 
3.250(a)(2), notice must be furnished of any material increase in corpus 
of the estate or net worth.
    (2) Effective dates. Where reduction or discontinuance of a running 
award of section 306 pension or old-law pension is required because 
dependency of another person ceased due to marriage, annulment, divorce 
or death, or because of an increase in income, which increase could not 
reasonably have been anticipated based on the amount actually received 
from that source the year before, the reduction or discontinuance shall 
be made effective the end of the year in which the increase occurred. 
Where reduction or discontinuance of a running award of improved pension 
or dependency and indemnity compensation is required because of an 
increase in income, the reduction or discontinuance shall be made 
effective the end of the month in which the increase occurred. Where 
reduction or discontinuance of a running award of any benefit is 
required because of an increase in net worth or corpus of estate, 
because dependency of a parent ceased, or because dependency

[[Page 303]]

of another person ceased prior to October 1, 1982, due to marriage, 
annulment, divorce, or death, the award shall be reduced or discontinued 
effective the last day of the calendar year in which the increase 
occurred or dependency ceased. Except as noted in this subparagraph for 
section 306 or old-law pension, where the dependency of another person 
ceased on or after October 1, 1982, due to marriage, annulment, divorce 
or death, the reduction or discontinuance shall be effective the last 
day of the month in which dependency ceased.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5112(b))

    (3) Overpayments. Overpayments created by retroactive discontinuance 
of benefits will be subject to recovery if not waived. Where dependency 
and indemnity compensation was being paid to two parents living 
together, an overpayment will be established on the award to each 
parent.
    (b) Award or increase; income. Where pension or dependency and 
indemnity compensation was not paid for a particular 12-month 
annualization period because the claim was disallowed, an award was 
deferred under Sec. 3.260(b) or Sec. 3.271(f), payments were 
discontinued or made at a lower rate based on anticipated or actual 
income, benefits otherwise payable may be authorized commencing the 
first of a 12-month annualization period as provided in this paragraph. 
In all other cases, benefits may not be authorized for any period prior 
to the date of receipt of a new claim.
    (1) Anticipated income. Where payments were not made or were made at 
a lower rate because of anticipated income, pension or dependency and 
indemnity compensation may be awarded or increased in accordance with 
the facts found but not earlier than the beginning of the appropriate 
12-month annualization period if satisfactory evidence is received 
within the same or the next calendar year.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5110(h))

    (2) Actual income. Where the claimant's actual income did not permit 
payment, or payment was made at a lower rate, for a given 12-month 
annualization period, pension or dependency and indemnity compensation 
may be awarded or increased, effective the beginning of the next 12-
month annualization period, if satisfactory evidence is received within 
that period.
    (c) Increases; change in status. Where there is change in the 
payee's marital status or status of dependents which would permit 
payment at a higher rate and the change in status is by reason of the 
claimant's marriage or birth or adoption of a child, the effective date 
of the increase will be the date of the event if the required evidence 
is received within 1 year of the event. Where there is a change in 
dependency status for any reason other than marriage, or the birth or 
adoption of a child, which would permit payment at a higher rate, the 
increased rate will be effective the date of receipt of notice 
constituting an informal claim if the required evidence is received 
within 1 year of Department of Veterans Affairs request. The rate 
payable for each period will be determined, as provided in Sec. Sec. 
3.260(f) or 3.273(c). (See Sec. 3.651 as to increase due to termination 
of payments to another payee. Also see Sec. 3.667 as to increase based 
on school attendance.)
    (d) Corpus of estate; net worth. Where a claim has been finally 
disallowed or terminated because of the corpus of estate and net worth 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 3.263 or 3.274 and entitlement is established 
on the basis of a reduction in estate or net worth, or a change in 
circumstances such as health, acquisition of a dependent, or increased 
rate of depletion of the estate, benefits or increased benefits will not 
be paid for any period prior to the date of receipt of a new claim.

    (a) Determination and entitlement. (1) Where the report shows a

change in circumstances affecting the application of the net worth 
provisions, the award will be adjusted in accordance with Sec. 
3.660(a)(2).
    (2) Where there is doubt as to the extent of anticipated income 
payment of pension or dependency and indemnity

[[Page 304]]

compensation will be authorized at the lowest appropriate rate or will 
be withheld, as provided in Sec. 3.260(b) or Sec. 3.271 (f).
    (b) Failure to return report--(1) Section 306 and old-law pension--
(i) Discontinuance. Discontinuance of old-law or section 306 pension 
shall be effective the last day of the calendar year for which income 
(and net worth in a section 306 pension case) was to be reported.
    (ii) Resumption of benefits. Payment of old-law or section 306 
pension may be resumed, if otherwise in order, from the date of last 
payment if evidence of entitlement is received within the calendar year 
following the calendar year for which income (and net worth in a section 
306 pension case) was to be reported; otherwise pension may not be paid 
for any period prior to the date of receipt of a new claim.
    (2) Improved pension and dependency and indemnity compensation--(i) 
Discontinuance. Discontinuance of dependency and indemnity compensation 
(DIC) or improved pension shall be effective the first day of the 12-
month annualization period for which income (and net worth in an 
improved pension case) was to be reported or the effective date of the 
award, whichever is the later date.
    (ii) Adjustment of overpayment. If evidence of entitlement to 
improved pension or DIC for any period for which payment of improved 
pension or DIC was discontinued for failure to file an Eligibility 
Verification Report is received at any time, payment of improved pension 
or DIC shall be awarded for the period of entitlement for which benefits 
were discontinued for failure to file an Eligibility Verification 
Report.
    (iii) Resumption of benefits. Payment of improved pension and DIC 
may be resumed, if otherwise in order, from the date of last payment if 
evidence of entitlement is received within the 12-month annualization 
period following the 12-month annualization period for which income (and 
net worth in an improved pension case) was to be reported; otherwise 
pension or DIC may not be paid for any period prior to receipt of a new 
claim.

Sec. 3.665  Incarcerated beneficiaries and fugitive felons--compensation.

    (a) General. Any person specified in paragraph (c) of this section 
who is incarcerated in a Federal, State or local penal institution in 
excess of 60 days for conviction of a felony will not be paid 
compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) in excess of 
the amount specified in paragraph (d) of this section beginning on the 
61st day of incarceration. VA will inform a person whose benefits are 
subject to this reduction of the rights of the person's dependents to an 
apportionment while the person is incarcerated, and the conditions under 
which payments to the person may be resumed upon release from 
incarceration. In addition, VA will also notify the person's dependents 
of their right to an apportionment if the VA is aware of their existence 
and can obtain their addresses. However, no apportionment will be made 
if the veteran or the dependent is a fugitive felon as defined in 
paragraph (n) of this section.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section the term 
compensation includes disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1151. The 
term dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) includes death 
compensation payable under 38 U.S.C. 1121 or 1141, death compensation 
and DIC payable under 38 U.S.C. 1151, and any benefit payable under 
chapter 13 of title 38, United States Code. The term release from 
incarceration includes participation in a work release or halfway house 
program, parole, and completion of sentence. For purposes of this 
section, a felony is any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for 
a term exceeding 1 year, unless specifically categorized as a 
misdemeanor under the law of the prosecuting jurisdiction.
    (c) Applicability. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 
are applicable to the following persons:

[[Page 305]]

    (1) A person serving a period of incarceration for conviction of a 
felony committed after October 7, 1980.
    (2) A person serving a period of incarceration after September 30, 
1980 (regardless of when the felony was committed) when the following 
conditions are met:
    (i) The person was incarcerated on October 1, 1980; and
    (ii) An award of compensation or DIC is approved after September 30, 
1980.
    (3) A veteran who, on October 7, 1980, was incarcerated in a 
Federal, State, or local penal institution for a felony committed before 
that date, and who remains so incarcerated for a conviction of that 
felony as of December 27, 2001.
    (d) Amount payable during incarceration--(1) Veteran rated 20 
percent or more. A veteran to whom the provisions of paragraphs (a) and 
(c) of this section apply with a service-connected disability evaluation 
of 20 percent or more shall receive the rate of compensation payable 
under 38 U.S.C. 1114(a).
    (2) Veteran rated less than 20 percent. A veteran to whom the 
provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section apply with a 
service-connected disability evaluation of less than 20 percent (even 
though the rate for 38 U.S.C. 1114 (k) or (q) is paid) shall receive 
one-half the rate of compensation payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(a).
    (3) Surviving spouse, parent or child. A surviving spouse, parent, 
or child, beneficiary to whom the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c) 
of this section apply shall receive one-half the rate of compensation 
payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(a).
    (e) Apportionment--(1) Compensation. All or part of the compensation 
not paid to an incarcerated veteran may be apportioned to the veteran's 
spouse, child or children and dependent parents on the basis of 
individual need. In determining individual need consideration shall be 
given to such factors as the apportionee claimant's income and living 
expenses, the amount of compensation available to be apportioned, the 
needs and living expenses of other apportionee claimants as well as any 
special needs, if any, of all apportionee claimants.
    (2) DIC. All or part of the DIC not paid to an incarcerated 
surviving spouse or other children not in the surviving spouse's custody 
may be apportioned to another child or children. All or part of the DIC 
not paid to an incarcerated child may be apportioned to the surviving 
spouse or other children. These apportionments shall be made on the 
basis of individual need giving consideration to the factors set forth 
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Effective dates. An apportionment under this section shall be 
effective the date of reduction of payments made to the incarcerated 
person, subject to payments to the incarcerated person over the same 
period, if an informal claim is received within 1 year after notice to 
the incarcerated person as required by paragraph (a) of this section, 
and any necessary evidence is received within 1 year from the date of 
request by the Department of Veterans Affairs; otherwise, payments may 
not be made for any period prior to the date of receipt of a new 
informal claim.
    (g) Incarcerated dependent. No apportionment may be made to or on 
behalf of any person who is incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local 
penal institution for conviction of a felony.
    (h) Notice to dependent for whom apportionment granted. A dependent 
for whom an apportionment is granted under this section shall be 
informed that the apportionment is subject to immediate discontinuance 
upon the incarcerated person's release or participation in a work 
release or halfway house program. A dependent shall also be informed 
that if the dependent and the incarcerated person do not live together 
when the incarcerated person is released (or participates in a work 
release or halfway house program) the dependent may submit a new claim 
for apportionment.
    (i) Resumption upon release--(1) No apportionment or family 
reunited. If there was no apportionment at the time of release from 
incarceration, or if the released person is reunited with all dependents 
for whom an apportionment was granted, the released person's award shall 
be resumed the date of release from incarceration if the Department of 
Veterans Affairs receives notice of release within 1 year following

release; otherwise the award shall be resumed the date of receipt of 
notice of release. If there was an apportionment award during 
incarceration, it shall be discontinued date of last payment to the 
apportionee upon receipt of notice of release of the incarcerated 
person. Payment to the released person shall then be resumed at the full 
rate from date of last payment to the apportionee. Payment to the 
released person from date of release to date of last payment to the 
apportionee shall be made at the rate which is the difference between 
the released person's full rate and the sum of (i) the rate that was 
payable to the apportionee and (ii) the rate payable during 
incarceration.
    (2) Apportionment granted and family not reunited. If there was an 
apportionment granted during incarceration and the released person is 
not reunited with all dependents for whom an apportionment was granted, 
the released person's award shall be resumed as stated in paragraph 
(i)(1) of this section except that when the released person's award is 
resumed it shall not include any additional amount payable by reason of 
a dependent(s) not reunited with the released person. The award to this 
dependent(s) will then be reduced to the additional amount payable for 
the dependent(s).
    (3) Apportionment to a dependent parent. An apportionment made to a 
dependent parent under this section cannot be continued beyond the 
veteran's release from incarceration unless the veteran is incompetent 
and the provisions of Sec. 3.452(c) (1) and (2) are for application. 
When a competent veteran is released from incarceration an apportionment 
made to a dependent parent shall be discontinued and the veteran's award 
resumed as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
    (j) Increased compensation during incarceration--(1) General. The 
amount of any increased compensation awarded to an incarcerated veteran 
that results from other than a statutory rate increase may be subject to 
reduction due to incarceration. This applies to a veteran whose 
compensation is subject to reduction under paragraphs (a) and (c) of 
this section prior to approval of an award of increased compensation as 
well as to veteran whose compensation is not subject to reduction under 
paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section prior to approval of an award of 
increased compensation.
    (2) Veteran subject to reduction under paragraphs (a) and (c) of 
this section. If prior to approval of an award of increased compensation 
the veteran's compensation was reduced under the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, the amount of the increase shall 
be reduced as follows if the veteran remains incarcerated:
    (i) If the veteran's schedular evaluation is increased from 10 
percent to 20 percent or greater, the amount payable to the veteran 
shall be increased from one-half the rate payable under 38 U.S.C. 
1114(a) to the rate payable under section 1114(a).
    (ii) If the veteran's schedular evaluation was 20 percent or more, 
none of the increased compensation shall be paid to the veteran while 
the veteran remains incarcerated.
    (3) Veteran's compensation not subject to reduction under paragraphs 
(a) and (c) of this section prior to award of increased compensation. If 
prior to the approval of an award of increased compensation the veteran 
is incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local penal institution for 
conviction of a felony and the veteran's compensation was not reduced 
under the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, none of 
the increased compensation shall be paid to the veteran for periods 
after October 7, 1980, subject to the following conditions:
    (i) The veteran remains incarcerated after October 7, 1980 in a 
Federal, State, or local penal institution for conviction of a felony; 
and
    (ii) The award of increased compensation is approved after October 
7, 1980. If the effective date of the increase is prior to October 8, 
1980, the amount payable for periods prior to October 8, 1980, shall not 
be reduced.
    (4) Apportionments. The amount of any increased compensation reduced 
under this paragraph may be apportioned as provided in paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (k) Retroactive awards. Whenever compensation or DIC is awarded to 
an incarcerated person any amounts due

[[Page 307]]

for periods prior to date of reduction under this section shall be paid 
to the incarcerated person.
    (l) DIC parents. If two parents are both entitled to DIC and were 
living together prior to the time of the DIC payable to one parent was 
reduced due to incarceration, they shall be considered as two parents 
not living together for the purpose of determining entitlement to DIC.
    (m) Conviction overturned on appeal. If a conviction is overturned 
on appeal, any compensation or DIC withheld under this section as a 
result of incarceration for such conviction (less the amount of any 
apportionment) shall be restored to the beneficiary.
    (n) Fugitive felons. (1) Compensation is not payable on behalf of a 
veteran for any period during which he or she is a fugitive felon. 
Compensation or DIC is not payable on behalf of a dependent of a veteran 
for any period during which the veteran or the dependent is a fugitive 
felon.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the term fugitive felon means a 
person who is a fugitive by reason of:
    (i) Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after 
conviction, for an offense, or an attempt to commit an offense, which is 
a felony under the laws of the place from which the person flees; or
    (ii) Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed for 
commission of a felony under Federal or State law.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (n) of this section, the term felony 
includes a high misdemeanor under the laws of a State which 
characterizes as high misdemeanors offenses that would be felony 
offenses under Federal law.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (n) of this section, the term 
dependent means a spouse, surviving spouse, child, or dependent parent 
of a veteran.

Sec. 3.666  Incarcerated beneficiaries and fugitive felons--pension.

    If any individual to or for whom pension is being paid under a 
public or private law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
is imprisoned in a Federal, State or local penal institution as the 
result of conviction of a felony or misdemeanor, such pension payments 
will be discontinued effective on the 61st day of imprisonment following 
conviction. The payee will be informed of his or her rights and the 
rights of dependents to payments while he or she is imprisoned as well 
as the conditions under which payments to him or to her may be resumed 
on his or her release from imprisonment. However, no apportionment will 
be made if the veteran or the dependent is a fugitive felon as defined 
in paragraph (e) of this section. Payments of pension authorized under 
this section will continue until notice is received by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs that the imprisonment has terminated.
    (a) Disability pension. Payment may be made to the spouse, child or 
children of a veteran disqualified under this section:
    (1) If the veteran continues to be eligible except for the 
provisions of this section, and
    (2) If the annual income of the spouse or child is such that death 
pension would be payable.
    (3) At the rate payable under the death pension law or the rate 
which the veteran was receiving at the time of imprisonment, whichever 
is less.
    (4) From the day following the date of discontinuance of payments to 
the veteran, subject to payments made to the veteran over the same 
period, if an informal claim is received within 1 year after notice to 
the veteran as required by this section and any necessary evidence is 
received within 1 year from the date of request; otherwise payments may 
not be made for any period prior to the date of receipt of a new 
informal claim.
    (b) Death pension. Payment may be made to a child or children where 
a surviving spouse or child is disqualified under this section:
    (1) If surviving spouse is disqualified to child or children at the 
rate of death pension payable if there were no such surviving spouse; or
    (2) If a child is disqualified, to a surviving spouse or other child 
or children at the rate of death pension payable if there were no such 
child, and

[[Page 308]]

    (3) From the day following the date of discontinuance of payments to 
the disqualified person, subject to payments made to that person over 
the same period if evidence of income is received within 1 year after 
date of request; otherwise payments may not be made for any period prior 
to the date of receipt of an informal claim.
    (4) The income limitation applicable to eligible persons will be 
that which would apply if the imprisoned person did not exist.
    (c) Resumption of pension upon release from incarceration. Pension 
will be resumed as of the day of release if notice (which constitutes an 
informal claim) is received within 1 year following release; otherwise 
resumption will be effective the date of receipt of such notice. Where 
an award or increased award was made to any other payee based upon the 
disqualification of the veteran, surviving spouse, or child while in 
prison, such award will be reduced or discontinued as of date of last 
payment and pension will be resumed to the released prisoner at a rate 
which will be the difference, if any, between the total pension payable 
and the amount which was paid to the other person or persons through the 
date of last payment and thereafter the full rate.
    (d) Veteran entitled to compensation. If an imprisoned veteran is 
entitled to a lesser rate of disability compensation, it shall be 
awarded as of the 61st day of imprisonment in lieu of the pension the 
veteran was receiving if the veteran has neither spouse nor child. If 
the veteran has a spouse or a child, compensation will be awarded only 
after the veteran has been furnished an explanation of the effect of 
electing compensation on the amount available for apportionment. If the 
veteran then requests compensation, it shall be awarded from the date 
veteran requests the Department of Veterans Affairs to take such action.
    (e) Fugitive felons. (1) Pension is not payable on behalf of a 
veteran for any period during which he or she is a fugitive felon. 
Pension or death pension is not payable on behalf of a dependent of a 
veteran for any period during which the veteran or the dependent is a 
fugitive felon.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the term fugitive felon means a 
person who is a fugitive by reason of:
    (i) Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after 
conviction for an offense, or an attempt to commit an offense, which is 
a felony under the laws of the place from which the person flees; or
    (ii) Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed for 
commission of a felony under Federal or State law.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, the term felony 
includes a high misdemeanor under the laws of a State which 
characterizes as high misdemeanors offenses that would be felony 
offenses under Federal law.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, the term 
dependent means a spouse, surviving spouse, child, or dependent parent 
of a veteran.

Sec. 3.667  School attendance.

    (a) General. (1) Pension or compensation may be paid from a child's 
18th birthday based upon school attendance if the child was at that time 
pursing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution 
and a claim for such benefits is filed within 1 year from the child's 
18th birthday.
    (2) Pension or compensation based upon a course of instruction at an 
approved educational institution which was begun after a child's 18th 
birthday may be paid from the commencement of the course if a claim is 
filed within 1 year from that date.
    (3) An initial award of DIC (dependency and indemnity compensation) 
to a child in the child's own right is payable from the first day of the 
month in which the child attains age 18 if the child was pursuing a 
course of instruction at an approved educational institution on the 
child's 18th birthday, and if a claim for benefits is filed within 1 
year from the child's 18th birthday. In the case of a child who attains 
age 18 after September 30, 1981, if the child was, immediately before 
attaining age 18, counted under 38 U.S.C. 1311(b) for

[[Page 309]]

the purpose of determining the amount of DIC payable to the surviving 
spouse, the effective date of an award of DIC to the child shall be the 
date the child attains age 18 if a claim for DIC is filed within 1 year 
from that date.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5110(e))

    (4) An initial award of dependency and indemnity compensation to a 
child in its own right based upon a course of instruction at an approved 
educational institution which was begun after the child's 18th birthday 
may be paid from the first day of the month in which the course 
commenced if a claim is filed within 1 year from that date.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5110(e))

    (5) Where a child was receiving dependency and indemnity 
compensation in its own right prior to age 18, payments may be continued 
from the 18th birthday if the child was then attending an approved 
educational institution and evidence of such school attendance is 
received within 1 year from the 18th birthday. Where the child was 
receiving dependency and indemnity compensation in its own right prior 
to age 18 and was not attending an approved educational institution on 
the 18th birthday but commences attendance at an approved educational 
institution after the 18th birthday, payments may be resumed from the 
commencing date of the course if evidence of such school attendance is 
filed within 1 year from that date.
    (b) Vacation periods. A child is considered to be in school during a 
vacation or other holiday period if he or she was attending an approved 
educational institution at the end of the preceding school term and 
resumes attendance, either in the same or a different approved 
educational institution, at the beginning of the next term. If an award 
has been made covering a vacation period, and the child fails to 
commence or resume school attendance, benefits will be terminated the 
date of last payment or the last day of the month preceding the date of 
failure to pursue the course, whichever is the earlier.
    (c) Ending dates. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, benefits may be authorized through the last day of the month in 
which a course was or will be completed.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5112(b)(7))

    (d) Transfers to other schools. When benefits have been authorized 
based upon school attendance and it is shown that during a part or all 
of that period the child was pursuing a different course in the same 
approved educational institution or a course in a different approved 
educational institution, payments previously made will not be disturbed.
    (e) Accrued benefits only. When a claim for accrued benefits is 
filed by or on behalf of a veteran's child over 18 but under 23 years of 
age, who was pursuing a course of instruction at the time of the payee's 
death and payment of accrued benefits only is involved, evidence of 
school attendance need not be confirmed by the school. When the payee's 
death occurred during a school vacation period, the requirements will be 
considered to have been met if the child was carried on the school rolls 
on the last day of the regular school term immediately preceding the 
date of the payee's death.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5112(b)(7))

    (f) Nonduplication. Pension, compensation or dependency and 
indemnity compensation may not be authorized:
    (1) After a child has elected to receive educational assistance 
under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 (see Sec. 3.707 and Sec. 21.3023 of this 
chapter); or
    (2) Based on an educational program in a school where the child is 
wholly supported at the expense of the Federal Government, such as a 
service academy.

under the jurisdiction of the Manila Regional Office, the Veterans 
Service Center Manager) that a case is being formally submitted for 
consideration of forfeiture of a payee's rights under Sec. 3.905 of 
this part or that the payee has been indicted for subversive activities,

    (b) Fraud or treasonable act--(1) Fraud. If forfeiture of rights is 
not declared, payments shall be resumed from date of last payment, if 
otherwise in order. If it is determined that rights have been forfeited,

award or the day preceding the commission of the act resulting in the 
forfeiture, whichever is later.

payments will be resumed from date of last payment, if otherwise in 
order. If the payee is convicted, benefits will be discontinued 
effective the commencing date of the award or the day preceding the 
commission of the act resulting in the forfeiture, whichever is later.

President of the United States, the award will be resumed, if otherwise 
in order, effective the date of the pardon if claim is filed within 1 
year from that date; otherwise benefits may not be authorized for any 
period prior to the date of filing claim. The award will be subject to 
any existing overpayment.
    (2) Payments to a dependent of the person whose benefits were 
declared forfeited before September 2, 1959, will be discontinued 
effective the day preceding the date of the pardon.

to any person based on his or her own service except as provided in 
Sec. 3.803 relating to naval pension and Sec. 3.750(c) relating to 
waiver of retirement pay. Not more than one award of pension, 
compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation may be made 
concurrently to a dependent on account of more than one period of 
service of a veteran.

    (a) Veterans--(1) Active service pay. (i) Pension, compensation, or 
retirement pay on account of his or her own service will not be paid to

drills. A waiver may include prospective periods and contain a right of 
recoupment for the days for which the reservists did not receive payment 
for duty by reason of failure to report for duty.
    (2) Lump-sum readjustment pay. (i) Where entitlement to disability 
compensation was established prior to September 15, 1981, a veteran who 
has received a lump-sum readjustment payment under former 10 U.S.C. 687 
(as in effect on September 14, 1981) may receive disability compensation 
for disability incurred in or aggravated by service prior to the date of 
receipt of lump-sum readjustment payment subject to deduction of an 
amount equal to 75 percent of the amount received as readjustment 
payment.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (ii) Readjustment pay authorized under former 10 U.S.C. 3814(a) is 
not

[[Page 311]]

subject to recoupment through withholding of disability compensation, 
entitlement to which was established prior to September 15, 1981.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (iii) Where entitlement to disability compensation was established 
on or after September 15, 1981, a veteran who has received a lump-sum 
readjustment payment may receive disability compensation for disability 
incurred in or aggravated by service prior to the date of receipt of the 
lump-sum readjustment payment, subject to recoupment of the readjustment 
payment. Where payment of readjustment pay was made on or before 
September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation an 
amount equal to the total amount of readjustment pay. Where payment of 
readjustment pay was made after September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from

such pay.


(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 1174(h)(2) and 1212(c))

    (iv) The receipt of readjustment pay does not affect the payment of 
disability compensation based on a subsequent period of service. 
Compensation payable for service-connected disability incurred or 
aggravated in a subsequent period of service will not be reduced for the 
purpose of offsetting readjustment pay based on a prior period of 
service.

    (3) Severance pay. Where the disability or disabilities found to be 
service-connected are the same as those upon which disability severance 
pay is granted, or where entitlement to disability compensation was 
established on or after September 15, 1981, an award of compensation 
will be made subject to recoupment of the disability severance pay. 
Prior to the initial determination of the degree of disability 
recoupment will be at the full monthly compensation rate payable for the 
disability or disabilities for which severance pay was granted. 
Following initial determination of the degree of disability recoupment 
shall not be at a monthly rate in excess of the monthly compensation 
payable for that degree of disability. For this purpose the term 
``initial determination of the degree of disability'' means the first 
regular schedular compensable rating in accordance with the provisions 
of subpart B, part 4 of this chapter and does not mean a rating based in 
whole or in part on a need for hospitalization or a period of 
convalescense. Where entitlement to disability compensation was 
established prior to September 15, 1981, compensation payable for 
service-connected disability other than the disability for which 
disability severance pay was granted will not be reduced for the purpose 
of recouping disability severance pay. Where entitlement to disability 
compensation was established on or after September 15, 1981, a veteran 
may receive disability compensation for disability incurred or 
aggravated by service prior to the date of receipt of the severance pay, 
but VA must recoup from that disability compensation an amount equal to 
the severance pay. Where payment of severance pay was made on or before 
September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation an 
amount equal to the total amount of the severance pay. Where payment of 
severance pay was made after September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from 
disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of the 
severance pay less the amount of Federal income tax withheld from such 
pay.

    (4) Improved pension. If a veteran is entitled to improved pension 
on the basis of the veteran's own service and is also entitled to 
pension under any pension program currently or previously in effect on 
the basis of any other person's service, the Department of Veterans 
Affairs shall pay the veteran only the greater benefit.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1521(i))

    (5) Separation pay and special separation benefits. (i) Where 
entitlement to disability compensation was established on or after 
September 15, 1981, a veteran who has received separation

[[Page 312]]

pay may receive disability compensation for disability incurred in or 
aggravated by service prior to the date of receipt of separation pay 
subject to recoupment of the separation pay. Where payment of separation 
pay or special separation benefits under section 1174a was made on or 
before September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation 
an amount equal to the total amount of separation pay or special 
separation benefits. Where payment of separation pay or special 
separation benefits under section 1174a was made after September 30, 
1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation an amount equal to the 
total amount of separation pay or special separation benefits less the 
amount of Federal income tax withheld from such pay.

    (b) Dependents--(1) Surviving spouse. Subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the receipt of pension, compensation, 
or dependency and indemnity compensation by a surviving spouse because 
of the death of any veteran, or receipt of pension or compensation 
because of his or her own service, shall not bar the payment to the 
surviving spouse of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity 
compensation because of the death or disability of any other veteran; 
however, other than insurance, concurrent benefits under laws 
administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs may not be authorized 
to a surviving spouse by reason of the death of more than one veteran to 
whom the surviving spouse has been married. The surviving spouse may 
elect to receive benefits based on the death of one such spouse and the 
election places the right to benefits based on the deaths of other 
spouses in suspense. The suspension may be lifted at any time by another 
election based on the death of another spouse. Benefits payable in the 
elected case will be subject to prior payments for the same period based 
on the death of the other spouse where, under the provisions of Sec. 
3.400(c), there is entitlement in the elected case prior to date of 
receipt of the election.

    (2) Children. Except as provided in Sec. 3.703 and paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section, the receipt of pension, compensation, or dependency and 
indemnity compensation by a child on account of the death of a veteran 
or the receipt by the child of pension or compensation on account of his 
or her own service will not bar the payment of pension, compensation, or 
dependency and indemnity compensation on account of the death or 
disability of any other veteran.
    (3) Parents. The receipt of compensation or dependency and indemnity 
compensation by a parent on account of the death of a veteran or receipt 
by him or her of pension or compensation on account of his or her own 
service, will not bar the payment of pension, compensation, or 
dependency and indemnity compensation on account of the death or 
disability of any other person.

Sec. 3.701  Elections of pension or compensation.

    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided, a person entitled to 
receive pension or compensation under more than one law or section of a 
law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs may elect to 
receive whichever benefit, regardless of whether it is the greater or 
lesser benefit, even though the election reduces the benefits payable to 
his or her dependents. Such person may at any time elect or reelect

[[Page 313]]

the other benefit. An election by a veteran controls the rights of all 
dependents in that case. An election by a surviving spouse controls the 
claims of all children including children over 18 and children not in 
the custody of the surviving spouse. The election of improved pension by 
a surviving spouse, however, shall not prejudice the rights of any child 
receiving an apportionment on December 31, 1978. Termination of a 
marriage or marital relationship which had been the reason for 
terminating an award of section 306 or old-law pension does not restore 
to the surviving spouse the right to receive section 306 or old-law 
pension. The claimant's entitlement, if otherwise established, is under 
the current provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1541.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (b) Form of election. A statement which meets the requirements of an 
informal claim may be accepted as an election.
    (c) Change from one law to another. Except as otherwise provided, 
where payments of pension or compensation are being made to a person 
under one law, the right to receive benefits under another law being in 
suspension, and a higher rate of pension or compensation becomes payable 
under the other law, benefits at the higher rate will not be paid for 
any date prior to the date of receipt of an election.

<R05>
Sec. 3.702  Dependency and indemnity compensation.

    (a) Right to elect. A person who is eligible for death compensation 
and who has entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation 
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 3.5(b)(2) or (3) may receive 
dependency and indemnity compensation upon the filing of a claim. The 
claim of such a person for service-connected death benefits shall be 
considered a claim for dependency and indemnity compensation subject to 
confirmation by the claimant. The effective date of payment is 
controlled by the provisions of Sec. 3.400(c)(4).
    (b) Effect on child's entitlement. Where a surviving spouse is 
entitled to death compensation, the amount of which is based in part on 
the existence of a child who has attained the age of 18 years, and 
elects to receive dependency and indemnity compensation, the independent 
award of dependency and indemnity compensation to which the child is 
entitled will be awarded to or for the child without separate election 
by or for the child. Should such a surviving spouse not elect to receive 
dependency and indemnity compensation, the independent dependency and 
indemnity compensation to which a child who has attained 18 years of age 
is entitled, may be awarded upon application by or for the child. The 
effective date of award in these situations will be in accordance with 
Sec. 3.400(c)(4)(ii).
    (c) Limitation. A claim for dependency and indemnity compensation 
may not be filed or withdrawn after the death of the surviving spouse, 
child, or parent.
    (d) Finality of election.(1) Except as noted in paragraph (d)(2), an 
election to receive dependency and indemnity compensation is final and 
the claimant may not thereafter reelect death pension or compensation in 
that case. An election is final when the payee (or the payee's 
fiduciary) has negotiated one check for this benefit or when the payee 
dies after filing an election but prior to negotiation of a check.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1), effective 
November 2, 1994, a surviving spouse who is receiving dependency and 
indemnity compensation may elect to receive death pension instead of 
such compensation.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1317)

    (e) Surviving spouse becomes entitled. A surviving spouse who 
becomes eligible to receive death compensation by reason of liberalizing 
provisions of any law may receive death compensation or elect dependency 
and indemnity compensation even though dependency and indemnity 
compensation has been paid to a child or children of the veteran.
    (f) Death pension rate. (1) Effective October 1, 1961, where the 
monthly rate of dependency and indemnity compensation payable to a 
surviving spouse who has children is less than the monthly rate of death 
pension which would be payable to such surviving spouse if the veteran's 
death had

[[Page 314]]

not been service connected, dependency and indemnity compensation shall 
be paid to such surviving spouse in an amount equal to the pension rate 
for any month (or part thereof) in which this rate is greater.
    (2) Effective June 22, 1966, where the monthly rate of dependency 
and indemnity compensation payable to a surviving spouse who has 
children is less than the monthly rate of death pension which would be 
payable for the children if the veteran's death had not been service 
connected and the surviving spouse were not entitled to such pension, 
dependency and indemnity compensation shall be payable to the surviving 
spouse in an amount equal to the monthly rate of death pension which 
would be payable to the children for any month (or part thereof) in 
which this rate is greater.

<R05>
Sec. 3.703  Two parents in same parental line.

    (a) General. Death compensation or dependency and indemnity 
compensation is not payable for a child if dependency and indemnity 
compensation is paid to or for a child or to the surviving spouse on 
account of the child by reason of the death of another parent in the 
same parental line where both parents died before June 9, 1960. Where 
the death of one such parent occurred on or after June 9, 1960, 
gratuitous benefits may not be paid or furnished to or on account of any 
child by reason of the death of more than one parent in the same 
parental line.
    (b) Election. The child or his or her fiduciary may elect to receive 
benefits based on the service of either veteran. An election of pension, 
compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on the death 
of one parent places the right to such benefits based on the death of 
another parent in suspension. The suspension may be lifted at any time 
by making another election.
    (c) Other payees. Where a child has elected to receive pension, 
compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation or dependents' 
educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 35 based on the death of a 
veteran, he (or she) will be excluded from consideration in determining 
the eligibility or rate payable to a surviving spouse or another child 
or children in the case of another deceased veteran in the same parental 
line. See Sec. 3.659(b).

<R05>
Sec. 3.704  Elections within class of dependents.

    (a) Children. Where children are eligible to receive monthly 
benefits under more than one law in the same case, the election of 
benefits under one law by or on behalf of one child will not serve to 
increase the rate allowable for any other child under another law in 
that case. The rate payable for each child will not exceed the amount 
which would be paid if all children were receiving benefits under the 
same law. Where a child is no longer eligible to receive pension, 
compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation because of having 
elected dependents' educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35, 
the child will be excluded from consideration in determining the rate 
payable for another child or children.
    (b) Parents. If there are two parents eligible for dependency and 
indemnity compensation and only one parent files claim for this benefit, 
the rate of dependency and indemnity compensation for that parent will 
not exceed the amount which would be paid to him or her if both parents 
had filed claim for dependency and indemnity compensation. The rate of 
death compensation for the other parent will not exceed the amount which 
would be paid if both parents were receiving this benefit.

    (a) Child. The conditions applicable to the bar to payment of

chapter 35 are set forth in Sec. 21.3023 of this chapter.

Sec. 3.708  Federal Employees' Compensation.

    (a) Military service--(1) Initial election. Where a person is 
entitled to compensation from the Office of Workers' Compensation 
Programs, under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) based 
upon disability or death due to service in the Armed Forces and is also 
entitled based upon service in the Armed Forces to pension, compensation 
or dependency and indemnity compensation under the laws administered by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, the claimant will elect which 
benefit he or she will receive. Pension compensation, or dependency and 
indemnity compensation may not be paid in such instances by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs concurrently with compensation from the 
Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. Benefits are not payable by 
the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs for disability or death 
incurred on or after January 1, 1957, based on military service.
    (2) Right of reelection. Persons receiving compensation from the 
Office of Workers' Compensation Programs based on death due to military 
service may elect to receive dependency and indemnity compensation at 
any time. Once payment of dependency and indemnity compensation has been 
granted, all further right to FECA benefits is extinguished and only 
dependency and indemnity compensation is payable thereafter.
    (3) Rights of children. Where primary title is vested in the 
surviving spouse, the claimant's election controls the rights of any of 
the veteran's children, regardless of whether they are in the claimant's 
custody and regardless of the fact that such children may not be 
eligible to receive benefits under laws administered by the Office of 
Workers' Compensation Programs. A child who is eligible for dependency 
and indemnity compensation or other benefits independent of the 
surviving spouse's entitlement may receive such benefits concurrently 
with payment of FECA benefits to the surviving spouse.
    (4) Entitlement based on 38 U.S.C. 1151. The provisions of this 
paragraph are applicable also in those cases in which disability or 
death occurs as a result of having submitted to an examination, medical 
or surgical treatment, hospitalization or hospital care, training, or 
compensated work therapy program. See Sec. Sec. 3.358 and 3.361.
    (b) Civilian employment--(1) Same disability or death. Where a 
person is entitled to compensation from the Office of Workers' 
Compensation Programs based upon civilian employment and is also 
entitled to compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation under 
laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs for the same 
disability or death, the claimant will elect which benefit he or she 
will receive. On or after September 13, 1960, an award cannot be 
approved for payment of compensation or dependency and indemnity 
compensation concurrently with compensation from the Office of Workers' 
Compensation Programs in such instances and an election to receive 
benefits from either agency is final. See Sec. 3.958. There is no right 
of reelection. (5 U.S.C. 8116(b)) A child who is eligible for dependency 
and indemnity compensation or other benefits independent of the 
surviving spouse's entitlement may receive such benefits concurrently 
with payment of FECA benefits to the surviving spouse.
    (2) Not the same disability or death. There is no prohibition 
against payment of benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation 
Act concurrently with other benefits administered

[[Page 316]]

by the Department of Veterans Affairs when such benefits are not based 
on the same disability or death.

provided by Sec. 3.714, an election of improved pension is final when 
the payee (or the payee's fiduciary) negotiates one check for this 
benefit and there is no right to reelection. Any veteran eligible to 
make an election under this section who is married to a veteran who is 
also eligible to make such an election may not receive improved pension 
unless the veteran's spouse also elects to receive improved pension.

Sec. 3.712  Improved pension elections; surviving spouses of Spanish-American War veterans.

    (a) General. A surviving spouse of a Spanish-American War veteran 
eligible for pension under 38 U.S.C. 1536 may elect to receive improved 
pension under 38 U.S.C. 1541. Except as provided by Sec. 3.714, an 
election of improved pension is final when the payee (or the payee's 
fiduciary) negotiates one check for this benefit and there is no right 
of reelection.
    (b) Aid and attendance. A surviving spouse of a Spanish-American War 
veteran who is receiving or entitled to receive pension based on need 
for regular aid and attendance shall be paid whichever is the greater: 
The monthly rate authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1536 (a) and (b) and 1544 or 
the monthly rate authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1541 and 544, as 38 U.S.C. 1541 
and 1544 were in effect on December 31, 1978, based on the surviving 
spouse's current income and net worth. Pension under 38 U.S.C. 1541 and 
1544, as in effect on December 31, 1978, is not payable if the current 
size of the surviving spouse's net worth is a bar to payment under Sec. 
3.252(b) or if the surviving spouse's income exceeds the applicable 
limitation as in effect on December 31, 1978. Elections are not required 
for this purpose. The change in rate shall be effective the first day of 
the month in which the facts warrant such change.

306 pension on December 31, 1978, shall be January 1, 1979, or if to the 
beneficiary's advantage, at any date after January 1, 1979, and before

Sec. 3.714  Improved pension elections--public assistance beneficiaries.

    (a) Definitions. The following definitions are applicable to this 
section.
    (1) Pensioner. This means a person who was entitled to section 306 
or old-law pension, or a dependent of such a person for the purposes of 
chapter 15 of title 38, United States Code as in effect on December 31, 
1978.

[[Page 317]]

    (2) Public assistance. This means payments under the following 
titles of the Social Security Act:
    (i) Title I (Grants to States for Old Age Assistance and Medical 
Assistance to the Aged).
    (ii) Title X (Grants to States for Aid to the Blind).
    (iii) Title XIV (Grants to States for Aid to the Permanently and 
Totally Disabled).
    (iv) Part A of title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children).
    (v) Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind and 
Disabled).
    (3) Medicaid. This means a State plan for medical assistance under 
title XIX of the Social Security Act.
    (4) Informed election. The term ``informed election'' means an 
election of improved pension (or a reaffirmation of a previous election 
of improved pension) after the Department of Veterans Affairs has 
complied with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) General. In some States only a person in receipt of public 
assistance is eligible for medicaid. When this is the case the following 
applies effective January 1, 1979:
    (1) A pensioner may not be required to elect improved pension to 
receive, or to continue to receive, public assistance; or
    (2) A pensioner may not be denied (or suffer a reduction in the 
amount of) public assistance by reason of failure or refusal to elect 
improved pension.
    (c) Public assistance deemed to continue. Public assistance (or a 
supplementary payment under Pub. L. 93-233, sec. 13(c)) payable to a 
pensioner may have been terminated because the pensioner's income 
increased as a result of electing improved pension. In this instance 
public assistance (or a supplementary payment under Pub. L. 93-233, sec. 
13(c)) shall be deemed to have remained payable to a pensioner for each 
month after December 1978 when the following conditons are met:
    (1) The pensioner was in receipt of pension for the month of 
December 1978; and
    (2) The pensioner was in receipt of public assistance (or a 
supplementary payment under Pub. L. 93-233, sec. 13(c)) prior to June 
17, 1980, and for the month of December 1978, and
    (3) The pensioner's public assistance payments (or a supplementary 
payment under Pub. L. 93-233, sec. 13(c)) were discontinued because of 
an increase in income resulting from an election of improved pension.
    (d) End of the deemed period of entitlement to public assistance. 
The deemed period of entitlement to public assistance (or a 
supplementary payment under Pub. L. 93-233, sec. 13(c)) ends the first 
calendar month that begins more than 10 days after a pensioner makes an 
informed election of improved pension. (If the pensioner is unable to 
make an informed election the informed election may be made by a member 
of the pensioner's family.) A pensioner who fails to disaffirm a 
previously made election of improved pension within the time limits set 
forth in paragraph (e) of this section shall be deemed to have 
reaffirmed the previous election. This will also end the deemed period 
of entitlement to public assistance.
    (e) Notice of right to make informed election or disaffirm election 
previously made. The Department of Veterans Affairs shall send a written 
notice to each pensioner to whom paragraph (b) of this section applies 
and who is eligible to elect or who has elected improved pension. The 
notice shall be in clear and understandable language. It shall include 
the following:
    (1) A description of the consequences to the pensioner (and the 
pensioner's family if applicable) of losing medicaid eligibility because 
of an increase in income resulting from electing improved pension; and
    (2) A description of the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section; and
    (3) In the case of a pensioner who has previously elected improved 
pension, a form for the purpose of enabling the pensioner to disaffirm 
the previous election of improved pensions; and
    (4) The following provisons of Pub. L. 96-272, sec. 310(b)(2)(B):
    (i) That a pensioner has 90 days from the date the notice is mailed 
to the pensioner to disaffirm a previous election by completing the 
disaffirmation form and mailing it to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.

[[Page 318]]

    (ii) That a pensioner who disaffirms a previous election shall 
receive, beginning the calendar month after the calendar month in which 
the Department of Veterans Affairs receives the disaffirmation, the 
amount of pension payable if improved pension had not been elected.
    (iii) That a pensioner who disaffirms a previous election may again 
elect improved pension but without a right to disaffirm the subsequent 
election.
    (iv) That a pensioner who disaffirms an election of improved pension 
shall not be indebted to the United States for the period in which the 
pensioner received improved pension.


(Authority: Pub. L. 96-272, sec. 310; 94 Stat. 500)

    (f) Notification to the Social Security Administration. The 
Department of Veterans Affairs shall promptly furnish the Social 
Security Administration the following information:
    (1) The name and identifying information of each pensioner who 
disaffirms his or her election of improved pension.
    (2) The name and identifying information of each pensioner who fails 
to disaffirm and election of improved pension within the 90-day period 
described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.
    (3) The name and identifying information of each pensioner who after 
disaffirming his or her election of improved pension, subsequently 
reelected improved pension.

caused by a disease that is attributable to exposure to radiation for 
which the veteran has received a payment under RECA.
    (b) Dependency and indemnity compensation. A person who receives a 
payment under RECA based upon a veteran's death will not be denied 
dependency and indemnity compensation to which the person is entitled 
under 38 CFR 3.5 and 3.22 for months beginning after March 26, 2002.
    (c) Offset of RECA payment against VA benefits. Notwithstanding 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the amount of a RECA payment will 
be deducted from the amount of compensation payable pursuant to Sec. 
3.309(d) or the amount of dependency and indemnity compensation payable.

<R05>
Sec. 3.750  Entitlement to concurrent receipt of military retired pay and disability compensation.

    (a) Definition of military retired pay. For the purposes of this 
part, military retired pay is payment received by a veteran that is 
classified as retired pay by the Service Department, including retainer 
pay, based on the recipient's service as a member of the Armed Forces or 
as a commissioned officer of the Public Health Service, the Coast and 
Geodetic Survey, the Environmental Science Services Administration, or 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    (b) Payment of both military retired pay and disability compensation 
or improved pension--(1) Compensation. Subject to paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section, a veteran who is entitled to military retired 
pay and disability compensation for a service-connected disability rated 
50 percent or more, or a combination of service-connected disabilities 
rated at 50 percent or more, under the schedule for rating disabilities 
(38 CFR part 4, subpart B), or based on a determination of individual 
unemployability under 38 CFR 4.16, is

[[Page 319]]

entitled to receive both payments subject to the phase-in period 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Chapter 61 disability retirees retiring with 20 or more years of 
service. Disability retired pay payable under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 61 to a 
veteran with 20 or more years of creditable service may be paid 
concurrently with disability compensation to a qualifying veteran 
subject to the following:
    (i) Any waiver required during the phase-in period under paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section; and
    (ii) If the veteran's disability retired pay exceeds the amount of 
retired pay the veteran would have received had the veteran retired 
based on length of service, the veteran must waive that excess amount of 
disability retired pay in order to receive VA disability compensation.
    (3) Chapter 61 disability retirees retiring with less than 20 years 
of service. Veterans who receive disability retired pay under 10 U.S.C. 
Chapter 61 with less than 20 years of creditable service are not 
eligible for concurrent receipt.
    (4) Improved Pension. A veteran may receive improved pension and 
military retired pay at the same time without having to waive military 
retired pay. However, in determining entitlement to improved pension, VA 
will treat military retired pay in the same manner as countable income 
from other sources.
    (c) Waiver--(1) When a waiver is necessary. (i) A waiver of military 
retired pay is necessary in order to receive disability compensation 
when a veteran is eligible for both military retired pay and disability 
compensation but is not eligible under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of 
this section to receive both benefits at the same time.
    (ii) All veterans who are eligible to receive both military retired 
pay and disability compensation at the same time under paragraphs (b)(1) 
or (b)(2) of this section, except those receiving compensation for a 
disability rated 100 percent, must file a waiver in order to receive the 
maximum allowable amount of disability compensation during the phase-in 
period. For veterans receiving disability compensation based on a VA 
determination of individual unemployability, the phase-in period ends on 
December 30, 2009. For all other veterans, the phase-in period ends on 
December 31, 2013. After the phase-in period, veterans retired under 10 
U.S.C. chapter 61 who are eligible for concurrent receipt must still 
file a waiver under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section.


(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 1414, 38 U.S.C. 5304, 5305)

    (2) How to file a waiver of military retired pay. A veteran may 
request a waiver of military retired pay in any written, signed 
statement, including a VA form, which reflects a desire to waive all or 
some military retired pay. The statement must be submitted to VA or to 
the Federal agency that pays the veteran's military retired pay. VA will 
treat as a waiver an application for VA compensation filed by a veteran 
who is entitled to military retired pay.
    (d) Elections and the right to reelect either benefit. (1) A veteran 
who has filed a waiver of military retired pay under this section has 
elected to receive disability compensation. A veteran may reelect 
between benefits covered by this section at any time by submitting a 
written, signed statement to VA or to the Federal agency that pays the 
veteran's military retired pay.
    (2) An election filed within 1 year from the date of notification of 
Department of Veterans Affairs entitlement will be considered as 
``timely filed'' for effective date purposes. See Sec. 3.401(e)(1). If 
the veteran is incompetent, the 1-year period will begin on the date 
that notification is sent to the next friend or fiduciary. In initial 
determinations, elections may be applied retroactively if the claimant 
was not advised of his or her right of election and its effect.

<R05>
Sec. 3.800  Disability or death due to hospitalization, etc.

    This section applies to claims received by VA before October 1, 
1997. For claims received by VA on or after October 1, 1997, see 
Sec. Sec. 3.362 and 3.363.
    (a) Where disease, injury, death or the aggravation of an existing 
disease or injury occurs as a result of having submitted to an 
examination, medical or surgical treatment, hospitalization or the 
pursuit of a course of vocational rehabilitation under any law 
administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and not the result of 
his (or her) own willful misconduct, disability or death compensation, 
or dependency and indemnity compensation will be awarded for such 
disease, injury, aggravation, or death as if such condition were service 
connected. The commencing date of benefits is subject to the provisions 
of Sec. 3.400(i).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1151)

    (1) Benefits under paragraph (a) of this section will be in lieu of 
any benefits the veteran may be entitled to receive under the Federal 
Employees' Compensation Act inasmuch as concurrent payments are 
prohibited. (See Sec. 3.708.)
    (2) Where any person is awarded a judgment on or after December 1, 
1962, against the United States in a civil action brought pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. 1346(b), or enters into a settlement or compromise on or after 
December 1, 1962, under 28 U.S.C. 2672 or 2677, by reason of a 
disability, aggravation or death within the purview of this section, no 
compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to 
such person for any month beginning after the date such judgment, 
settlement, or compromise on account of such disability, aggravation, or 
death becomes final until the total amount of benefits which would be 
paid except for this provision equals the total amount included in such 
judgment, settlement, or compromise. The provisions of this paragraph do 
not apply, however, to any portion of such compensation or dependency 
and indemnity compensation payable for any period preceding the end of 
the month

[[Page 321]]

in which such judgment, settlement or compromise becomes final.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (3) If an administrative award was made or a settlement or 
compromise became final before December 1, 1962, compensation or 
dependency and indemnity compensation may not be authorized for any 
period after such award settlement, or compromise whether before or 
after December 1, 1962. There is no bar to payment of compensation or 
dependency and indemnity compensation and no set-off because of a 
judgment which became final before December 1, 1962, unless specified in 
the terms of the judgment.
    (4) Offset of award of benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 39. (i) If a 
judgment, settlement, or compromise covered by paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section becomes final on or after December 10, 2004, and includes an 
amount that is specifically designated for automobile assistance 
benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 39 (38 CFR 3.808), and if VA awards 
chapter 39 benefits after the date on which the judgment, settlement, or 
compromise becomes final, the amount of the award will be reduced by the 
amount received under the judgment, settlement, or compromise for the 
same purpose.
    (ii) If the amount described in paragraph (4)(i) of this section is 
greater than the amount of an award under 38 U.S.C. chapter 39, the 
excess amount received under the judgment, settlement, or compromise 
will be offset against benefits otherwise payable under 38 U.S.C. 
chapter 11.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1151(b)(2))

    (b)(1) If death occurred prior to January 1, 1957, the benefit 
payable will be death compensation. See Sec. Sec. 3.5(b)(2) and 3.702

Sec. 3.801  Special acts.

    (a) General. A special act is one authorizing the payment of 
benefits to a particular person or persons. If a beneficiary in a 
special act has no claim before the Department of Veterans Affairs, a 
formal application must be filed before benefits may be awarded.
    (b) Limitations. Where the rate, commencement, and duration are 
fixed by a special act, they are not subject to be varied by the 
provisions and limitations of the public laws, but where not fixed, the 
rate and continuance of the benefit is subject to variance in accordance 
with the public laws.
    (c) Provisions of act. (1) When pension or compensation is granted 
by a special act, which fixes the rate and commencement, the rate 
thereunder cannot be increased nor can any other pension or compensation 
be paid in the absence of the payee's election, unless the special act 
expressly states that the benefit granted thereby is in addition to the 
benefit which the person is entitled to receive under any public law.
    (2) If a special act corrects the nature of separation from military 
service and does not grant pension or compensation directly, the 
claimant acquries a status so that he or she may apply for and be 
allowed benefits. The claimant, then, is placed in the same position he 
or she would have been if originally released under conditions other 
than dishonorable.
    (d) Service. A special act of Congress, reciting that a person is 
considered to have been mustered into the service on a named date and 
honorably discharged on a subsequently named date, is sufficient 
regardless of whether the service department has any record of such 
service.

    (a) The Secretary of the Department of the Army, the Department of

Transportation will determine the eligibility of applicants to be 
entered on the Medal of Honor Roll and will deliver to the Secretary of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs a certified copy of each certificate 
issued in which the right of the person named in the certificate to the 
special pension is set forth. The special pension will be authorized on 
the basis of such certification.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1560, 1561)

    (b) An award of special pension at the monthly rate specified in 38 
U.S.C. 1562 will be made as of the date of filing of the application 
with the Secretary concerned. The special pension will be paid in 
addition to all other payments under laws of the United States. However, 
a person awarded more than one Medal of Honor may not receive more than 
one special pension.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1562)

    (c) VA will pay to each person who is receiving or who in the future 
receives Medal of Honor pension a retroactive lump sum payment equal to 
the total amount of Medal of Honor pension that person would have 
received during the period beginning the first day of the month after 
the date of the event for which the veteran earned the Medal of Honor 
and ending on the last day of the month preceding the month in which 
pension was awarded under paragraph (b) of this section. VA will 
calculate the lump sum payment using the monthly Medal of Honor pension 
rates in effect from the first day of the month after the date of the 
event for which the veteran earned the Medal of Honor, to the last day 
of the month preceding the month in which the individual was initially 
awarded the Medal of Honor pension. VA will not make a retroactive lump 
sum payment under this section before October 1, 2003.

Scouts under section 14, Pub. L. 190, 79th Congress.
    (c) A claim for dependency and indemnity compensation on a form 
prescribed will be accepted as a claim for the special allowance where 
it is determined that this benefit is payable or where a specific 
inquiry concerning entitlement to the special allowance is received.
    (d) Payment of this allowance will be authorized on the basis of a 
certification from the Social Security Administration. Award actions 
subsequent to the original award, including adjustment and 
discontinuance, will be made in accordance with new certifications from 
the Social Security Administration.
    (e)(1) The special allowance will be payable only if the death 
occurred: (i) While on active duty, active duty for training, or

conveyance in a manner consistent with safety and to satisfy the 
applicable standards of licensure of the proper licensing authorities. 
Simultaneously with the certification provided pursuant to the 
introductory text of this section, a claimant for financial assistance 
in the purchase of an automobile will be furnished a certificate of 
eligibility for financial assistance in the purchase of such adaptive 
equipment as may be appropriate to the claimant's losses unless the need 
for such equipment is contraindicated by a physical or legal inability 
to operate the vehicle. There is no time limitation in which to apply. 
An application by a claimant on active duty will be deemed to have been 
filed with VA on the date it is shown to have been placed in the hands 
of military authority for transmittal.
    (d) Additional eligibility criteria for adaptive equipment. 
Claimants for adaptive equipment must also satisfy the additional 
eligibility criteria of Sec. Sec. 17.156, 17.157, and 17.158 of this 
chapter.
    (e) Definition. The term adaptive equipment, means generally, that 
equipment which must be part of or added to a conveyance manufactured 
for sale to the general public to make it safe for use by the claimant 
and to assist him or her in meeting the applicable standards of 
licensure of the proper licensing authority.
    (1) With regard to automobiles and similar vehicles the term 
includes a basic automatic transmission as to a claimant who has lost or 
lost the use of a limb. In addition, the term includes, but is not 
limited to, power steering, power brakes, power window lifts and power 
seats. The term also includes air-conditioning equipment when such 
equipment is necessary to the health and safety of the veteran and to 
the safety of others, and special equipment necessary to assist the 
eligible person into or out of the automobile or other conveyance, 
regardless of whether the automobile or other conveyance is to be 
operated by the eligible person or is to be operated for such person by 
another person; and any modification of the interior space of the 
automobile or other conveyance if needed because of the physical 
condition of such person in order for such person to enter or operate 
the vehicle.
    (2) With regard to automobiles and similar vehicles the term 
includes such items of equipment as the Chief Medical Director may, by 
directive, specify

[[Page 326]]

as ordinarily necessary for any of the classes of losses specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section and for any combination of such losses. 
Such specifications of equipment may include a limit on the financial 
assistance to be provided based on judgment and experience.
    (3) The term also includes other equipment which the Chief Medical 
Director or designee may deem necessary in an individual case.

Sec. 3.810  Clothing allowance.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section a veteran 
who has a service-connected disability, or a disability compensable 
under 38 U.S.C. 1151 as if it were service-connected, is entitled, upon 
application therefor, to an annual clothing allowance as specified in 38 
U.S.C. 1162. The annual clothing allowance is payable in a lump sum, and 
the following eligibility criteria must also be satisfied:
    (1) A VA examination or hospital or examination report from a 
facility specified in Sec. 3.326(c) discloses that the veteran wears or 
uses certain prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which tend to wear or 
tear clothing (including a wheelchair) because of such disability and 
such disability is the loss or loss of use of a hand or foot compensable 
at a rate specified in Sec. 3.350(a), (b), (c), (d), of (f); or
    (2) The Chief Medical Director or designee certifies that because of 
such disability a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance is worn or used 
which tends to ware or tear the veteran's clothing, or that because of 
the use of a physician-prescribed medication for a skin condition which 
is due to the service-connected disability irreparable damage is done to 
the veteran's outergarments. For the purposes of this paragraph 
``appliance'' includes a wheelchair.
    (b) Effective August 1, 1972, the initial lump sum clothing 
allowance is due and payable for veterans meeting the eligibility 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as of that date. 
Subsequent annual payments for those meeting the eligibility 
requirements of paragraphs (a) of this section will become due on the 
anniversary date thereafter, both as to initial claims and recurring 
payments under previously established entitlement.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the 
application for clothing allowance must be filed within 1 year of the 
anniversary date (August 1) for which entitlement is initially 
established, otherwise, the application will be acceptable only to 
effect payment of the clothing allowance becoming due on any succeeding 
anniversary date for which entitlement is established, provided the 
application is filed within 1 year of such date. The 1-year period for 
filing application will include the anniversary date and terminate on 
July 31 of the following year.
    (2) Where the initial determination of service connection for the 
qualifying disability is made subsequent to an anniversary date for 
which entitlement is established, the application for clothing allowance 
may be filed within 1 year from the date of notification to the veteran 
of such determination.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1162)

    (d) If a veteran is incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local penal 
institution for a period of more than 60 days and is furnished clothing 
without charge by the institution, VA shall reduce the amount of the 
annual clothing allowance by 1/365th of the amount otherwise payable for 
each day the veteran was incarcerated during the 12-month period 
preceding the anniversary date for which entitlement is established. No 
reduction shall be made for the first 60 days of incarceration.

Sec. 3.811  Minimum income annuity and gratuitous annuity.

    (a) Eligibility for minimum income annuity. The minimum income 
annuity authorized by Public Law 92-425 as amended is payable to a 
person:
    (1) Whom the Department of Defense or the Department of 
Transportation has determined meets the eligibility criteria of section 
4(a) of Pub. L. 92-425 as amended other than section 4(a)(1) and (2); 
and
    (2) Who is eligible for pension under subchapter III of chapter 15 
of title 38, United States Code, or section 306 of the Veterans' and 
Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978; and

[[Page 328]]

    (3) Whose annual income, as determined in establishing pension 
eligibility, is less than the maximum annual rate of pension in effect 
under 38 U.S.C. 1541(b).
    (b) Computation of the minimum income annuity payment--(1) Annual 
income. VA will determine a beneficiary's annual income for minimum 
income annuity purposes under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 3.271 and 
3.272 of this part for beneficiaries receiving improved pension, or 
under Sec. Sec. 3.260 through 3.262 of this part for beneficiaries 
receiving old law or section 306 pensions, except that the amount of the 
minimum income annuity will be excluded from the calculation.
    (2) VA will determine the minimum income annuity payment for 
beneficiaries entitled to improved pension by subtracting the annual 
income for minimum income annuity purposes from the maximum annual 
pension rate under 38 U.S.C. 1541(b).
    (3) VA will determine the minimum income annuity payment for 
beneficiaries receiving old law and section 306 pensions by reducing the 
maximum annual pension rate under 38 U.S.C. 1541(b) by the amount of the 
Retired Servicemen's Family Protection Plan benefit, if any, that the 
beneficiary receives and subtracting from that amount the annual income 
for minimum income annuity purposes.
    (4) VA will recompute the monthly minimum income annuity payment 
whenever there is a change to the maximum annual rate of pension in 
effect under 38 U.S.C. 1541(b), and whenever there is a change in the 
beneficiary's income.
    (c) An individual otherwise eligible for pension under subchapter 
III of chapter 15 of title 38, United States Code, or section 306 of the 
Veterans' and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978 shall be 
considered eligible for pension for purposes of determining eligibility 
for the minimum income annuity even though as a result of adding the 
amount of the minimum income annuity authorized under Public Law 92-425 
as amended to any other countable income, no amount of pension is due.
    (d) If the Department of Defense or the Department of Transportation 
determines that a minimum income annuitant also is entitled to the 
gratuitous annuity authorized by Pub. L. 100-456 as amended, which is 
payable to certain surviving spouses of servicemembers who died before 
November 1, 1953, and were entitled to retired or retainer pay on the 
date of death, VA will combine the payment of the gratuitous annuity 
with the minimum income annuity payment.
    (e) Termination. Other than as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, if a beneficiary receiving the minimum income annuity becomes 
ineligible for pension, VA will terminate the minimum income annuity 
effective the same date.

Sec. 3.812  Special allowance payable under section 156 of Pub. L. 97-377.

    The provisions of this section apply to the payment of a special 
allowance to certain surviving spouses and children of individuals who 
died on active duty prior to August 13, 1981, or who died as a result of 
a service-connected disability which was incurred or aggravated prior to 
August 13, 1981. This special allowance is a replacement for certain 
social security benefits which were either reduced or terminated by 
provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981.
    (a) Eligibility requirements. (1) A determination must first be made 
that the person on whose earnings record the claim is based either died 
on active duty prior to August 13, 1981, or died as a result of a 
service-connected disability which was incurred or aggravated prior to 
August 13, 1981. For purposes of this determination, character of 
discharge is not a factor for consideration, and death on active duty 
subsequent to August 12, 1981, is qualifying provided that the death 
resulted from a service-connected disability which was incurred or 
aggravated prior to August 13, 1981.
    (2) Once a favorable determination has been made under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, determinations as to the age, relationship and 
school attendance requirements contained in

[[Page 329]]

paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of section 156 of Pub. L. 97-377 will be 
made. In making these eligibility determinations VA shall apply the 
provisions of the Social Security Act, and any regulations promulgated 
pursuant thereto, as in effect during the claimant's period of 
eligibility. Unless otherwise provided in this section, when issues are 
raised concerning eligibility or entitlement to this special allowance 
which cannot be appropriately resolved under the provisions of the 
Social Security Act, or the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, 
the provisions of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, are for 
application.
    (b) Computation of payment rate--(1) Basic entitlement rate. A basic 
entitlement rate will be computed for each eligible claimant in 
accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of 
section 156 of Pub. L. 97-377 using data to be provided by the Social 
Security Administration. This basic entitlement rate will then be used 
to compute the monthly payment rate as described in paragraphs (b)(2) to 
(b)(6) of this section.
    (2) Original or reopened awards to surviving spouses. The monthly 
payment rate shall be equal to the basic entitlement rate increased by 
the overall average percentage (rounded to the nearest tenth of a 
percent) of each legislative increase in dependency and indemnity 
compensation rates under 38 U.S.C. 1311 which became effective 
concurrently with or subsequent to the effective date of the earliest 
adjustment under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act that was 
disregarded in computing the basic entitlement rate.
    (3) Original and reopened awards to children. The monthly payment 
rate shall be equal to the basic entitlement rate increased by the 
overall average percentage (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent) 
of each legislative increase in the rates of educational assistance 
allowance under 38 U.S.C. 3531(b) which became effective concurrently 
with or subsequent to the effective date of the earliest adjustment 
under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act that was disregarded in 
computing the basic entitlement rate.
    (4) Subsequent legislative increases in rates. The monthly rate of 
special allowance payable to a surviving spouse shall be increased by 
the same overall average percentage increase (rounded to the nearest 
tenth of a percent) and on the same effective date as any legislative 
increase in the rates payable under 38 U.S.C. 1311. The monthly rate of 
special allowance payable to a child shall be increased by the same 
overall average percentage increase (rounded to the nearest tenth of a 
percent) and on the same effective date as any legislative increase in 
the rates payable under 38 U.S.C. 3531(b).
    (5) Amendment of awards. Prompt action shall be taken to amend any 
award of this special allowance to conform with evidence indicating a 
change in basic eligibility, any basic entitlement rate, or any 
effective date previously determined. It is the claimant's 
responsibility to promptly notify VA of any change in their status or 
employment which affects eligibility or entitlement.
    (6) Rounding of monthly rates. Any monthly rate computed under the 
provisions of this paragraph, if not a multiple of $1, shall be rounded 
to the next lower multiple of $1.
    (c) Claimants not entitled to this special allowance. The following 
are not entitled to this special allowance for the reasons indicated.
    (1) Claimants eligible for death benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151. The 
deaths in such cases are not service-connected.
    (2) Claimants eligible for death benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1318. The 
deaths in such cases are not service connected.
    (3) Claimants whose claims are based on an individual's service in:
    (i) The Commonwealth Army of the Philippines while such forces were 
in the service of the Armed Forces pursuant to the military order of the 
President dated July 26, 1941, including recognized guerrilla forces 
(see 38 U.S.C. 107).
    (ii) The Philippine Scouts under section 14, Pub. L. 190, 79th 
Congress (see 38 U.S.C. 107).
    (iii) The commissioned corps of the Public Health Service 
(specifically excluded by section 156 of Pub. L. 97-377), or
    (iv) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(specifically excluded by section 156 of Pub. L. 97-377).

[[Page 330]]

    (d) Appellate jurisdiction. VA shall have appellate jurisdiction of 
all determinations made in connection with this special allowance.
    (e) Claims--formal and informal. Formal claims for this special 
allowance must be filed on a form prescribed by the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs. When informal claims or inquiries as to eligibility 
are received, the appropriate application form shall be provided. In 
such cases, the date of receipt of the informal claim or inquiry will be 
accepted as the date of claim for this special allowance if a formal 
claim on the prescribed form is received within one year from that date.
    (f) Retroactivity and effective dates. There is no time limit for 
filing a claim for this special allowance. Upon the filing of a claim, 
benefits shall be payable for all periods of eligibility beginning on or 
after the first day of the month in which the claimant first became 
eligible for this special allowance, except that no payment may be made 
for any period prior to January 1, 1983.

Sec. 3.813  Interim benefits for disability or death due to chloracne or porphyria cutanea tarda.

    (a) Disability benefits. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, a veteran who served in the active military, naval or air 
service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era, and who 
suffers from chloracne or porphyria cutanea tarda which became manifest 
within one year after the date of the veteran's most recent departure 
from the Republic of Vietnam during such service, shall be paid interim 
disability benefits under this section in the same manner and to the 
same extent that compensation would be payable if such disabilities were 
service-connected.
    (b) Death benefits. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, if a veteran described in paragraph (a) of this section dies as 
a result of chloracne or porphyria cutanea tarda, the veteran's 
survivors shall be paid interim death benefits under this section based 
upon the same elgibility requirements and at the same rates that 
dependency and indemnity compensation would be payable if the death were 
service-connected.
    (c) Exceptions. Benefits under this section are not payable for any 
month for which compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation is 
payable for the same disability or death, nor are benefits payable under 
this section (1) when there is affirmative evidence that the disease was 
not incurred by the veteran during service in the Republic of Vietnam 
during the Vietnam era, (2) when there is affirmative evidence to 
establish that an intercurrent injury or disease, which is a recognized 
cause of the disease for which benefits are being claimed, was suffered 
by the veteran between the date of the veteran's most recent departure 
from the Republic of Vietnam during active military, naval or air 
service and the onset of the claimed disease, or (3) if it is 
determined, based on evidence in the veteran's service records and other 
records provided by the Secretary of Defense, that the veteran was not 
exposed to dioxin during active military, naval or air service in the 
Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era.
    (d) Similarity to service-connected benefits. For purposes of all 
laws administered by VA (except chapters 11 and 13 of title 38 U.S.C.), 
a disease establishing eligibility for disability or death benefits 
under this section shall be treated as if it were service-connected, and 
the receipt of disability or death benefits shall be treated as if such 
benefits were compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation, 
respectively.
    (e) Effective dates. Benefits under this section may not be paid for 
any period prior to October 1, 1984, nor for any period after September 
30, 1986.

Sec. 3.814  Monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 for an individual suffering from spina bifida whose biological father or mother is or was a Vietnam 
          veteran.

    (a) Monthly monetary allowance. VA will pay a monthly monetary 
allowance under subchapter I of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18, based upon the 
level of disability determined under the provisions of paragraph (d) of 
this section, to or for a person who VA has determined is an individual 
suffering from spina bifida whose biological mother or father is or was 
a Vietnam veteran. Receipt of this allowance will not affect the right 
of the individual or any related person to receive any other benefit to 
which he or she may be entitled under any law administered by VA. An 
individual suffering from spina bifida is entitled to only one monthly 
allowance under this section, even if the individual's biological father 
and mother are or were both Vietnam veterans.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Definitions--(1) Vietnam veteran. For the purposes of this 
section, the term ``Vietnam veteran'' means a person who performed 
active military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam during 
the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, 
without regard to the characterization of the person's service. Service 
in the Republic of Vietnam includes service in the waters offshore and 
service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or 
visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.
    (2) Individual. For the purposes of this section, the term 
``individual'' means a person, regardless of age or marital status, 
whose biological father or mother is or was a Vietnam veteran and who 
was conceived after the date on which the veteran first served in the 
Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of Sec. 3.204(a)(1), VA will require the types of evidence 
specified in Sec. Sec. 3.209 and 3.210 sufficient to establish in the 
judgment of the Secretary that a person is the biological son or 
daughter of a Vietnam veteran.
    (3) Spina bifida. For the purposes of this section, the term ``spina 
bifida'' means any form and manifestation of spina bifida except spina 
bifida occulta.
    (d) Disability evaluations. (1) Except as otherwise specified in 
this paragraph, VA will determine the level of payment as follows:
    (i) Level I. The individual walks without braces or other external 
support as his or her primary means of mobility in the community, has no 
sensory or motor impairment of the upper extremities, has an IQ of 90 or 
higher, and is continent of urine and feces without the use of 
medication or other means to control incontinence.
    (ii) Level II. Provided that none of the disabilities is severe 
enough to warrant payment at Level III, and the individual: walks with 
braces or other external support as his or her primary means of mobility 
in the community; or, has sensory or motor impairment of the upper 
extremities, but is able to grasp pen, feed self, and perform self care; 
or, has an IQ of at least 70 but less than 90; or, requires medication 
or other means to control the effects of urinary bladder impairment and 
no more than two times per week is unable to remain dry for at least 
three hours at a time during waking hours; or, requires bowel management 
techniques or other treatment to control the effects of bowel impairment 
but does not have fecal leakage severe or frequent enough to require 
wearing of absorbent materials at least four days a week; or, has a 
colostomy that does not require wearing a bag.
    (iii) Level III. The individual uses a wheelchair as his or her 
primary means of mobility in the community; or, has sensory or motor 
impairment of the upper extremities severe enough to prevent grasping a 
pen, feeding self, and performing self care; or, has an IQ of 69 or 
less; or, despite the use of medication or other means to control the 
effects of urinary bladder impairment, at least three times per week is 
unable to remain dry for three hours at a time during waking hours; or, 
despite bowel management techniques or other treatment to control the 
effects of bowel impairment, has fecal leakage severe or frequent enough 
to require wearing of absorbent materials at least four days a week; or, 
regularly requires manual evacuation or digital stimulation to empty the 
bowel; or, has a colostomy that requires wearing a bag.

[[Page 332]]

    (2) If an individual who would otherwise be paid at Level I or II 
has one or more disabilities, such as blindness, uncontrolled seizures, 
or renal failure that result either from spina bifida, or from treatment 
procedures for spina bifida, the Director of the Compensation and 
Pension Service may increase the monthly payment to the level that, in 
his or her judgment, best represents the extent to which the 
disabilities resulting from spina bifida limit the individual's ability 
to engage in ordinary day-to-day activities, including activities 
outside the home. A Level II or Level III payment will be awarded 
depending on whether the effects of a disability are of equivalent 
severity to the effects specified under Level II or Level III.
    (3) VA may accept statements from private physicians, or examination 
reports from government or private institutions, for the purpose of 
rating spina bifida claims without further examination, provided the 
statements or reports are adequate for assessing the level of disability 
due to spina bifida under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section. In the absence of adequate medical information, VA will 
schedule an examination for the purpose of assessing the level of 
disability.
    (4) VA will pay an individual eligible for a monetary allowance due 
to spina bifida at Level I unless or until it receives medical evidence 
supporting a higher payment. When required to reassess the level of 
disability under paragraph (d)(5) or (d)(6) of this section, VA will pay 
an individual eligible for this monetary allowance at Level I in the 
absence of evidence adequate to support a higher level of disability or 
if the individual fails to report, without good cause, for a scheduled 
examination. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the 
illness or hospitalization of the claimant, death of an immediate family 
member, etc.
    (5) VA will pay individuals under the age of one year at Level I 
unless a pediatric neurologist or a pediatric neurosurgeon certifies 
that, in his or her medical judgment, there is a neurological deficit 
that will prevent the individual from ambulating, grasping a pen, 
feeding himself or herself, performing self care, or from achieving 
urinary or fecal continence. If any of those deficits are present, VA 
will pay the individual at Level III. In either case, VA will reassess 
the level of disability when the individual reaches the age of one year.
    (6) VA will reassess the level of payment whenever it receives 
medical evidence indicating that a change is warranted. For individuals 
between the ages of one and twenty-one, however, it must reassess the 
level of payment at least every five years.
    (e) Effective dates. Except as otherwise provided, VA will award the 
monetary allowance for an individual suffering from spina bifida based 
on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a 
claim for increase as of the date VA received the claim or the date 
entitlement arose, whichever is later.
    (1) VA will increase benefits as of the earliest date the evidence 
establishes that the level of severity increased, but only if the 
beneficiary applies for an increase within one year of that date.
    (2) If a claimant reopens a previously disallowed claim based on 
corrected military records, VA will award the benefit from the latest of 
the following dates: the date the veteran or beneficiary applied for a 
correction of the military records; the date the disallowed claim was 
filed; or, the date one year before the date of receipt of the reopened 
claim.
    (f) Reductions and discontinuances. VA will generally reduce or 
discontinue awards according to the facts found except as provided in 
Sec. Sec. 3.105 and 3.114(b).
    (1) If benefits were paid erroneously because of beneficiary error, 
VA will reduce or discontinue benefits as of the effective date of the 
erroneous award.
    (2) If benefits were paid erroneously because of administrative 
error, VA will reduce or discontinue benefits as of the date of last 
payment.

Sec. 3.815  Monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 for an individual with disability from covered birth defects whose biological mother is or was a 
          Vietnam veteran; identification of covered birth defects.

    (a) Monthly monetary allowance--(1) General. VA will pay a monthly 
monetary allowance under subchapter II of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 to or for 
an individual whose biological mother is or was a Vietnam veteran and 
who VA has determined to have disability resulting from one or more 
covered birth defects. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the amount of the monetary allowance paid will be based upon 
the level of such disability suffered by the individual, as determined 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Affirmative evidence of cause other than mother's service during 
Vietnam era. No monetary allowance will be provided under this section 
based on a particular birth defect of an individual in any case where 
affirmative evidence establishes that the birth defect results from a 
cause other than the active military, naval, or air service of the 
individual's mother during the Vietnam era and, in determining the level 
of disability for an individual with more than one birth defect, the 
particular defect resulting from other causes will be excluded from 
consideration. This will not prevent VA from paying a monetary allowance 
under this section for other birth defects.
    (3) Nonduplication; spina bifida. In the case of an individual whose 
only covered birth defect is spina bifida, a monetary allowance will be 
paid under Sec. 3.814, and not under this section, nor will the 
individual be evaluated for disability under this section. In the case 
of an individual who has spina bifida and one or more additional covered 
birth defects, a monetary allowance will be paid under this section and 
the amount of the monetary allowance will be not less than the amount 
the individual would receive if his or her only covered birth defect 
were spina bifida. If, but for the individual's one or more additional 
covered birth defects, the monetary allowance payable to or for the 
individual would be based on an evaluation at Level I, II, or III, 
respectively, under Sec. 3.814(d), the evaluation of the individual's 
level of disability under paragraph (e) of this section will be not less 
than Level II, III, or IV, respectively.
    (b) No effect on other VA benefits. Receipt of a monetary allowance 
under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 will not affect the right of the individual, 
or the right of any person based on the individual's relationship to 
that person, to receive any other benefit to which the individual, or 
that person, may be entitled under any law administered by VA.
    (c) Definitions--(1) Vietnam veteran. For the purposes of this 
section, the term Vietnam veteran means a person who performed active 
military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam during the 
period beginning on February 28, 1961, and ending on May 7, 1975, 
without regard to the characterization of the person's service. Service 
in the Republic of Vietnam includes service in the waters offshore and 
service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or 
visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.
    (2) Individual. For the purposes of this section, the term 
individual means a person, regardless of age or marital status, whose 
biological mother is or was a Vietnam veteran and who was conceived

Vietnam during the period beginning on February 28, 1961, and ending on 
May 7, 1975. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 3.204(a)(1), VA 
will require the types of evidence specified in Sec. Sec. 3.209 and 
3.210 sufficient to establish that a person is the biological son or 
daughter of a Vietnam veteran.
    (3) Covered birth defect. For the purposes of this section, the term 
covered birth defect means any birth defect identified by VA as a birth 
defect that is associated with the service of women Vietnam veterans in

residual of corrective surgery for birth defects.
    (e) Disability evaluations. Whenever VA determines, upon receipt of 
competent medical evidence, that an individual has one or more covered 
birth defects, VA will determine the level of disability currently 
resulting, in combination, from the covered birth defects and associated 
disabilities. No monetary allowance will be payable under this section 
if VA determines under this paragraph that an individual has no current 
disability resulting from the covered birth defects, unless VA 
determines that the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section are 
for application. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, VA will determine the level of disability as follows:
    (1) Levels of disability.
    (i) Level 0. The individual has no current disability resulting from 
covered birth defects.
    (ii) Level I. The individual meets one or more of the following 
criteria:
    (A) The individual has residual physical or mental effects that only 
occasionally or intermittently limit or prevent some daily activities; 
or
    (B) The individual has disfigurement or scarring of the head, face, 
or neck without gross distortion or gross asymmetry of any facial 
feature (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears 
(auricles), cheeks, or lips).
    (iii) Level II. The individual meets one or more of the following 
criteria:
    (A) The individual has residual physical or mental effects that 
frequently or constantly limit or prevent some daily activities, but the 
individual is able to work or attend school, carry out most household 
chores, travel, and provide age-appropriate self-care, such as eating, 
dressing, grooming, and carrying out personal hygiene, and 
communication, behavior, social interaction, and intellectual 
functioning are appropriate for age; or
    (B) The individual has disfigurement or scarring of the head, face, 
or neck with either gross distortion or gross asymmetry of one facial 
feature or one paired set of facial features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes 
(including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, or lips).
    (iv) Level III. The individual meets one or more of the following 
criteria:
    (A) The individual has residual physical or mental effects that 
frequently or constantly limit or prevent most daily activities, but the 
individual is able to provide age-appropriate self-care, such as eating, 
dressing, grooming, and carrying out personal hygiene;
    (B) The individual is unable to work or attend school, travel, or 
carry out household chores, or does so intermittently and with 
difficulty;
    (C) The individual's communication, behavior, social interaction, 
and intellectual functioning are not entirely appropriate for age; or
    (D) The individual has disfigurement or scarring of the head, face, 
or neck with either gross distortion or gross asymmetry of two facial 
features or two paired sets of facial features (nose, chin, forehead, 
eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, or lips).
    (v) Level IV. The individual meets one or more of the following 
criteria:
    (A) The individual has residual physical or mental effects that 
prevent age-appropriate self-care, such as eating, dressing, grooming, 
and carrying out personal hygiene;
    (B) The individual's communication, behavior, social interaction, 
and intellectual functioning are grossly inappropriate for age; or
    (C) The individual has disfigurement or scarring of the head, face, 
or neck with either gross distortion or gross

[[Page 336]]

asymmetry of three facial features or three paired sets of facial 
features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears 
(auricles), cheeks, or lips).
    (2) Assessing limitation of daily activities. Physical or mental 
effects on the following functions are to be considered in assessing 
limitation of daily activities:
    (i) Mobility (ability to stand and walk, including balance and 
coordination);
    (ii) Manual dexterity;
    (iii) Stamina;
    (iv) Speech;
    (v) Hearing;
    (vi) Vision (other than correctable refraction errors);
    (vii) Memory;
    (viii) Ability to concentrate;
    (ix) Appropriateness of behavior; and
    (x) Urinary and fecal continence.
    (f) Information for determining whether individuals have covered 
birth defects and rating disability levels. (1) VA may accept statements 
from private physicians, or examination reports from government or 
private institutions, for the purposes of determining whether an 
individual has a covered birth defect and for rating claims for covered 
birth defects. If they are adequate for such purposes, VA may make the 
determination and rating without further examination. In the absence of 
adequate information, VA may schedule examinations for the purpose of 
determining whether an individual has a covered birth defect and/or 
assessing the level of disability.
    (2) Except in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, VA 
will not pay a monthly monetary allowance unless or until VA is able to 
obtain medical evidence adequate to determine that an individual has a 
covered birth defect and adequate to assess the level of disability due 
to covered birth defects.
    (g) Redeterminations. VA will reassess a determination under this 
section whenever it receives evidence indicating that a change is 
warranted.
    (h) Referrals. If a regional office is unclear in any case as to 
whether a condition is a covered birth defect, it may refer the issue to 
the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service for determination.
    (i) Effective dates. Except as provided in Sec. 3.114(a) or 
paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section, VA will award the monetary 
allowance under subchapter II of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18, for an individual 
with disability resulting from one or more covered birth defects, based 
on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a 
claim for increase, as of the date VA received the claim (or the date of 
birth if the claim is received within one year of that date), the date 
entitlement arose, or December 1, 2001, whichever is latest. Subject to 
the condition that no benefits may be paid for any period prior to 
December 1, 2001:
    (1) VA will increase benefits as of the earliest date the evidence 
establishes that the level of severity increased, but only if the 
beneficiary applies for an increase within one year of that date.
    (2) If a claimant reopens a previously disallowed claim based on 
corrected military records, VA will award the benefit from the latest of 
the following dates: the date the veteran or beneficiary applied for a 
correction of the military records; the date the disallowed claim was 
filed; or, the date one year before the date of receipt of the reopened 
claim.
    (j) Reductions and discontinuances. VA will generally reduce or 
discontinue awards under subchapter II of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 according 
to the facts found except as provided in Sec. Sec. 3.105 and 3.114(b).
    (1) If benefits were paid erroneously because of beneficiary error, 
VA will reduce or discontinue benefits as of the effective date of the 
erroneous award.
    (2) If benefits were paid erroneously because of administrative 
error, VA will reduce or discontinue benefits as of the date of last 
payment.

Sec. 3.816  Awards under the Nehmer Court Orders for disability or death caused by a condition presumptively associated with herbicide exposure.

    (a) Purpose. This section states effective-date rules required by 
orders of a United States district court in the class-action case of 
Nehmer v. United States Department of Veterans Affairs, No. CV-86-6160 
TEH (N.D. Cal.).
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Nehmer class member means:
    (i) A Vietnam veteran who has a covered herbicide disease; or
    (ii) A surviving spouse, child, or parent of a deceased Vietnam 
veteran who died from a covered herbicide disease.
    (2) Covered herbicide disease means a disease for which the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs has established a presumption of service 
connection before October 1, 2002 pursuant to the Agent Orange Act of 
1991, Public Law 102-4, other than chloracne. Those diseases are:
    (i) Type 2 Diabetes (Also known as type II diabetes mellitus or 
adult-onset diabetes).
    (ii) Hodgkin's disease.
    (iii) Multiple myeloma.
    (iv) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    (v) Acute and Subacute peripheral neuropathy.
    (vi) Porphyria cutanea tarda.
    (vii) Prostate cancer.
    (viii) Respiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or 
trachea).
    (ix) Soft-tissue sarcoma (as defined in Sec. 3.309(e)).
    (c) Effective date of disability compensation. If a Nehmer class 
member is entitled to disability compensation for a covered herbicide 
disease, the effective date of the award will be as follows:
    (1) If VA denied compensation for the same covered herbicide disease 
in a decision issued between September 25, 1985 and May 3, 1989, the 
effective date of the award will be the later of the date VA received 
the claim on which the prior denial was based or the date the disability 
arose, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. 
A prior decision will be construed as having denied compensation for the 
same disease if the prior decision denied compensation for a disease 
that reasonably may be construed as the same covered herbicide disease 
for which compensation has been awarded. Minor differences in the 
terminology used in the prior decision will not preclude a finding, 
based on the record at the time of the prior decision, that the prior 
decision denied compensation for the same covered herbicide disease.
    (2) If the class member's claim for disability compensation for the 
covered herbicide disease was either pending before VA on May 3, 1989, 
or was received by VA between that date and the effective date of the 
statute or regulation establishing a presumption of service connection 
for the covered disease, the effective date of the award will be the 
later of the date such claim was received by VA or the date the 
disability arose, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. A claim will be considered a claim for compensation for a 
particular covered herbicide disease if:
    (i) The claimant's application and other supporting statements and 
submissions may reasonably be viewed, under the standards ordinarily 
governing compensation claims, as indicating an intent to apply for 
compensation for the covered herbicide disability; or
    (ii) VA issued a decision on the claim, between May 3, 1989 and the 
effective date of the statute or regulation establishing a presumption 
of service connection for the covered disease, in which VA denied 
compensation for a disease that reasonably may be construed as the same 
covered herbicide disease for which compensation has been awarded.
    (3) If the class member's claim referred to in paragraph (c)(1) or 
(c)(2) of this section was received within one year from the date of the 
class member's separation from service, the effective date of the award 
shall be the day following the date of the class member's separation 
from active service.
    (4) If the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this 
section are not met, the effective date of the award shall be determined 
in accordance with Sec. Sec. 3.114 and 3.400.
    (d) Effective date of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC). 
If a

[[Page 338]]

Nehmer class member is entitled to DIC for a death due to a covered 
herbicide disease, the effective date of the award will be as follows:
    (1) If VA denied DIC for the death in a decision issued between 
September 25, 1985 and May 3, 1989, the effective date of the award will 
be the later of the date VA received the claim on which such prior 
denial was based or the date the death occurred, except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (2) If the class member's claim for DIC for the death was either 
pending before VA on May 3, 1989, or was received by VA between that 
date and the effective date of the statute or regulation establishing a 
presumption of service connection for the covered herbicide disease that 
caused the death, the effective date of the award will be the later of 
the date such claim was received by VA or the date the death occurred, 
except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. In 
accordance with Sec. 3.152(b)(1), a claim by a surviving spouse or 
child for death pension will be considered a claim for DIC. In all other 
cases, a claim will be considered a claim for DIC if the claimant's 
application and other supporting statements and submissions may 
reasonably be viewed, under the standards ordinarily governing DIC 
claims, as indicating an intent to apply for DIC.
    (3) If the class member's claim referred to in paragraph (d)(1) or 
(d)(2) of this section was received within one year from the date of the 
veteran's death, the effective date of the award shall be the first day 
of the month in which the death occurred.
    (4) If the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this 
section are not met, the effective date of the award shall be determined 
in accordance with Sec. Sec. 3.114 and 3.400.
    (e) Effect of other provisions affecting retroactive entitlement--
(1) General. If the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) or 
(c)(2) or (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section are satisfied, the effective 
date shall be assigned as specified in those paragraphs, without regard 
to the provisions in 38 U.S.C. 5110(g) or Sec. 3.114 prohibiting 
payment for periods prior to the effective date of the statute or 
regulation establishing a presumption of service connection for a 
covered herbicide disease. However, the provisions of this section will 
not apply if payment to a Nehmer class member based on a claim described 
in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section is otherwise prohibited by 
statute or regulation, as, for example, where a class member did not 
qualify as a surviving spouse at the time of the prior claim or denial.
    (2) Claims Based on Service in the Republic of Vietnam Prior to 
August 5, 1964. If a claim referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section was denied by VA prior to January 1, 1997, and the veteran's 
service in the Republic of Vietnam ended before August 5, 1964, the 
effective-date rules of this regulation do not apply. The effective date 
of benefits in such cases shall be determined in accordance with 38 
U.S.C. 5110. If a claim referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section was pending before VA on January 1, 1997, or was received by VA 
after that date, and the veteran's service in the Republic of Vietnam 
ended before August 5, 1964, the effective date shall be the later of 
the date provided by paragraph (c) or (d) of this section or January 1, 
1997.

(Authority: Public Law 104-275, sec. 505)

    (f) Payment of Benefits to Survivors or Estates of Deceased 
Beneficiaries--(1) General. If a Nehmer class member entitled to 
retroactive benefits pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) or 
(d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section dies prior to receiving payment of 
any such benefits, VA shall pay such unpaid retroactive benefits to the 
first individual or entity listed below that is in existence at the time 
of payment:
    (i) The class member's spouse, regardless of current marital status.

    Note to paragraph (f)(1)(i): For purposes of this paragraph, a 
spouse is the person who was legally married to the class member at the 
time of the class member's death.

    (ii) The class member's child(ren), regardless of age or marital 
status (if more than one child exists, payment will be made in equal 
shares, accompanied by an explanation of the division).

    Note to paragraph (f)(1)(ii): For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``child'' includes

[[Page 339]]

natural and adopted children, and also includes any stepchildren who 
were members of the class member's household at the time of the class 
member's death.

    (iii) The class member's parent(s), regardless of dependency (if 
both parents are alive, payment will be made in equal shares, 
accompanied by an explanation of the division).

    Note to paragraph (f)(1)(iii): For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``parent'' includes natural and adoptive parents, but in the event 
of successive parents, the persons who last stood as parents in relation 
to the class member will be considered the parents.

    (iv) The class member's estate.
    (2) Inapplicability of certain accrued benefit requirements. The 
provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5121(a) and Sec. 3.1000(a) limiting payment of 
accrued benefits to amounts due and unpaid for a period not to exceed 2 
years do not apply to payments under this section. The provisions of 38 
U.S.C. 5121(c) and Sec. 3.1000(c) requiring survivors to file claims 
for accrued benefits also do not apply to payments under this section. 
When a Nehmer class member dies prior to receiving retroactive payments 
under this section, VA will pay the amount to an identified payee in 
accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section without requiring an 
application from the payee. Prior to releasing such payment, however, VA 
may ask the payee to provide further information as specified in 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (3) Identifying payees. VA shall make reasonable efforts to identify 
the appropriate payee(s) under paragraph (f)(1) of this section based on 
information in the veteran's claims file. If further information is 
needed to determine whether any appropriate payee exists or whether 
there are any persons having equal or higher precedence than a known 
prospective payee, VA will request such information from a survivor or 
authorized representative if the claims file provides sufficient contact 
information. Before releasing payment to an identified payee, VA will 
ask the payee to state whether there are any other survivors of the 
class member who may have equal or greater entitlement to payment under 
this section, unless the circumstances clearly indicate that such a 
request is unnecessary. If, following such efforts, VA releases the full 
amount of unpaid benefits to a payee, VA may not thereafter pay any 
portion of such benefits to any other individual, unless VA is able to 
recover the payment previously released.
    (4) Bar to accrued benefit claims. Payment of benefits pursuant to 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall bar a later claim by any 
individual for payment of all or any part of such benefits as accrued 
benefits under 38 U.S.C. 5121 and Sec. 3.1000.
    (g) Awards covered by this section. This section applies only to 
awards of disability compensation or DIC for disability or death caused 
by a disease listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    Marriage is not a bar to the payment of pension or compensation to a 
helpless child under an award approved prior to April 1, 1944. The 
presumption, arising from the fact of marriage, that helplessness has 
ceased may be overcome by positive proof of continuing helplessness. As

may not be paid to a helpless child who has married.

to be evaluated has actually improved.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1155)

evaluation of disability for 20 or more years for compensation purposes 
under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs will not 
be reduced to less than such evaluation except upon a showing that such 
rating was based on fraud. Likewise, a rating of permanent total 
disability for pension purposes which has been in force for 20 or more

Sec. 3.952  Protected ratings.

    Ratings under the Schedule of Disability Ratings, 1925, which were 
the basis of compensation on April 1, 1946, are subject to modification 
only when a change in physical or mental condition would have required a 
reduction under the 1925 schedule, or an increased evaluation has been 
assigned under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, 1945 (looseleaf 
edition), after which time all evaluations will be under the 1945 
schedule (loose-leaf edition) only. Such increased evaluations must be 
of an other than temporary nature (due to hospitalization, surgery, 
etc.). When a temporary evaluation is involved, the 1925 schedule 
evaluation will be restored after the period of increase has elapsed 
unless the permanent residuals would have required reduction under that 
schedule, or unless an increased evalation would be assignable under a 
1945 schedule (looseleaf edition) rating. In any instance where the 
changed condition represents an increased degree of disability under 
either rating schedule but the evaluation provided by the 1945 schedule 
(looseleaf edition) is less than the evaluation in effect under the 1925 
schedule on April 1, 1946, the 1925 schedule evaluation and award are 
protected.

so service connected may be evaluated under the Schedule for Rating 
Disabilities, 1945 (looseleaf edition) and benefits awarded on the basis 
thereof, as well as special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114, 
provided such action results in compensation payable at a rate equal to

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, any person eligible to elect improved pension under Sec. 3.711 
or 3.712 who is in receipt of section 306 or old-law pension on December 
31, 1978, shall in the absence of an election to receive improved 
pension, continue to receive such pension at the monthly rate payable on 
December 31, 1978.
    (b) Termination. Pension payable under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be terminated for any one of the following reasons:
    (1) A veteran pensioner ceases to be permanently and totally 
disabled.
    (2) A surviving spouse pensioner ceases to meet the definition of 
surviving spouse in 38 U.S.C. 101(3).
    (3) A child pensioner ceases to meet the definition of child in 38 
U.S.C. 101(4).
    (4) A section 306 pensioner's countable annual income, determined 
under Sec. Sec. 3.250 to 3.270, exceeds the applicable amount stated in 
Sec. 3.26(a).

reasonable that some part of it be consumed for the pensioner's 
maintenance. Evaluation of net worth shall be made under Sec. 3.263.
    (c) Reduction. The pension rate payable under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be reduced by the amount of any additional pension payable 
by reason of a dependent upon the loss of such dependent. A veteran or 
surviving spouse who no longer has any dependents shall not continue to 
receive either section 306 pension or old-law pension if countable 
annual income exceeds the appropriate rate in Sec. 3.26(a), (b), or 
(c).

Sec. 3.1000  Entitlement under 38 U.S.C. 5121 to benefits due and unpaid upon death of a beneficiary.

    (a) Basic entitlement. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 3.1001 and 
3.1008, where death occurred on or after December 1, 1962, periodic 
monetary benefits (other than insurance and servicemembers' indemnity) 
authorized under laws administered by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, to which a payee was entitled at his or her death under 
existing ratings or decisions or those based on evidence in the file at 
date of death, and due and unpaid will, upon the death of such person, 
be paid as follows:


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5121(a)

    (1) Upon the death of a veteran to the living person first listed as 
follows:
    (i) His or her spouse;
    (ii) His or her children (in equal shares);
    (iii) His or her dependent parents (in equal shares) or the 
surviving parent.
    (2) Upon the death of a surviving spouse or remarried surviving 
spouse, to the veteran's children.
    (3) Upon the death of a child, to the surviving children of the 
veteran entitled to death pension, compensation, or dependency and 
indemnity compensation.
    (4) Upon the death of a child claiming benefits under chapter 18 of 
this title, to the surviving parents.
    (5) In all other cases, only so much of the accrued benefit may be 
paid as may be necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of 
last sickness or burial. (See Sec. 3.1002.)
    (b) Apportionments. (1) Upon the death of a person receiving an 
apportioned share of benefits payable to a veteran, all or any part of 
such unpaid amount is payable to the veteran or to any other dependent 
or dependents of the veteran.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5121(a)(1))

    (2) Where at the date of death of the veteran an apportioned share 
is being paid to or has been withheld on behalf of another person, the 
apportioned amount remaining unpaid for periods prior to the last day of 
the month before the veteran's death is payable to the apportionee.
    (3) Where the accrued death pension, compensation or dependency and 
indemnity compensation was payable for a child as an apportioned share 
of the surviving spouse's benefit, payment will be made under the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, on the expenses of such 
deceased child's last sickness or burial.
    (c) Claims and evidence. Application for accrued benefits must be 
filed within 1 year after the date of death. A claim for death pension, 
compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation, by an 
apportionee, surviving spouse, child or parent is deemed to include 
claim for any accrued benefits. (See Sec. 3.152(b)).
    (1) If an application for accrued benefits is incomplete because the 
claimant has not furnished information necessary to establish that he or 
she is within the category of eligible persons under the provisions of 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) or paragraph (b) of this section and 
that circumstances exist which make the claimant the specific person 
entitled to payment of all or part of any benefits which may have 
accrued, VA shall notify the claimant:
    (i) Of the type of information required to complete the application;
    (ii) That VA will take no further action on the claim unless VA 
receives the required information; and
    (iii) That if VA does not receive the required information within 1 
year of the date of the original VA notification of information 
required, no benefits will be awarded on the basis of that application.
    (2) Failure to file timely claim, or a waiver of rights, by a 
preferred dependent will not serve to vest title in a person in a lower 
class or a claimant for reimbursement; neither will such failure or 
waiver by a person or persons in a joint class serve to increase the

[[Page 349]]

amount payable to another or others in the class.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5121(c); 5112(b))

    (d) Definitions. (1) Spouse means the surviving spouse of the 
veteran, whose marriage meets the requirements of Sec. 3.1(j) or Sec. 
3.52. Where the marriage meets the requirements of Sec. 3.1(j) date of

    (2) Child is as defined in Sec. 3.57 and includes an unmarried 
child who became permanently incapable of self-support prior to 
attaining 18 years of age as well as an unmarried child over the age of 
18 but not over 23 years of age, who was pursuing a course of 
instruction within the meaning of Sec. 3.57 at the time of the payee's 
death. However, upon the death of a child in receipt of death pension, 
compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation, any accrued will 
be payable to the surviving child or children of the veteran entitled to 
death pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation. 
Upon the death of a child, another child who has elected dependents' 
educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 may receive accrued 
death pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation, 
payable on behalf of the deceased child for periods prior to the 
commencement of benefits under that chapter.
    (3) Dependent parent is as defined in Sec. 3.59: Provided, That the 
mother or father was dependent within the meaning of Sec. 3.250 at the 
date of the veteran's death.
    (4) Evidence in the file at date of death means evidence in VA's 
possession on or before the date of the beneficiary's death, even if 
such evidence was not physically located in the VA claims folder on or 
before the date of death, in support of a claim for VA benefits pending 
on the date of death.
    (5) Claim for VA benefits pending on the date of death means a claim 
filed with VA that had not been finally adjudicated by VA on or before 
the date of death. Such a claim includes a deceased beneficiary's claim 
to reopen a finally disallowed claim based upon new and material 
evidence or a deceased beneficiary's claim of clear and unmistakable 
error in a prior rating or decision. Any new and material evidence must 
have been in VA's possession on or before the date of the beneficiary's 
death.
    (e) Subsistence allowance. Subsistence allowance under the 
provisions of 38 U.S.C. ch. 31 remaining due and unpaid at the date of 
the veteran's death, is payable under the provisions of this section.
    (f) Dependents' educational assistance. Educational assistance 
allowance or special restorative training allowance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 
35, remaining due and unpaid at the date of death of an eligible 
surviving spouse or eligible child is payable to a child or children of 
the veteran (see paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (d)(2) of this section), 
or on the expenses of last sickness and burial (see paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section.) Benefits due and unpaid at the date of death of an 
eligible spouse are payable only on the expenses of last sickness and 
burial (see paragraph (a)(4) of this section).
    (g) Veterans educational assistance. Educational assistance 
allowance under 38 U.S.C chapters 30, 32, or 34, and 10 U.S.C. chapter 
1606 remaining due and unpaid at the date of the veteran's death is 
payable under the provisions of this section.

include compensation or pension benefits for any period for which the 
veteran received active service pay.

Sec. 3.1001  Hospitalized competent veterans.

    The provisions of this section apply only to the payment of amounts 
actually withheld on a running award under Sec. 3.551(b) which are 
payable in a lump sum after the veteran's death.
    (a) Basic entitlement. Where an award of disability pension for a 
competent veteran without dependents was reduced because of hospital 
treatment or institutional or domiciliary care by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and the veteran dies while receiving such treatment or 
care or before payment of amounts withheld, the lump sum is payable to 
the living person first listed as follows:
    (1) The veteran's spouse, as defined in Sec. 3.1000(d)(1);
    (2) The veteran's children (in equal shares), as defined in Sec. 
3.57 but without regard to their age or marital status;
    (3) The veteran's dependent parents (in equal shares), or the 
surviving dependent parent, as defined in Sec. 3.1000(d)(3);
    (4) In all other cases, only so much of the lump sum may be paid as 
may be necessary to reimburse a person who bore the expenses of last 
sickness or burial. (See Sec. 3.1002.)
    (b) Claim. Applications must be filed with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs within 5 years after the death of the veteran. If, 
however, any person otherwise entitled is under legal disability at the 
time of the veteran's death, the 5-year period will run from the date of 
termination or removal of the legal disability.
    (1) There is no time limit on the retroactive period of an award or 
for furnishing evidence.
    (2) Failure to file timely claim, or a waiver of rights, by a 
preferred dependent will not serve to vest title in a person in a lower 
class or a claimant for reimbursement; neither will such failure or 
waiver by a person or persons in a joint class serve to increase the 
amount payable to another or others in the class.
    (c) Lump sum withheld after discharge from institution. The 
provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will apply in the 
event of the death of any veteran prior to receiving a lump sum which 
was withheld because treatment or care was terminated against medical 
advice or as the result of disciplinary action.

Sec. 3.1008  Accrued benefits payable to foreign beneficiaries.

    In case of death of the payee of any check in payment of periodic 
monetary benefits (other than insurance and servicemembers' indemnity) 
accruing under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
while the amount thereof remains in the special deposit account 
established by Pub. L. 828, 76th Congress, such amount will be payable 
under section 3 of that act. (31 U.S.C. 125) However, the accrued amount 
will be payable only if the person on whose behalf checks were issued 
and the person claiming the accrued amount have not been guilty of 
mutiny, treason, sabotage, or rendering assistance to an enemy of the 
United States or of its allies.

Sec. 3.1009  Personal funds of patients.

    The provisions of this section are applicable to gratuitous benefits 
deposited by the Department of Veterans Affairs either before, on, or 
after December 1, 1959, in a personal funds of patients account for an 
incompetent veteran who was incompetent at the date of death. Where the 
veteran died after November 30, 1959:
    (a) Eligible persons. Gratuitous benefits shall be paid to the 
living person first listed as follows:
    (1) His or her spouse, as defined in Sec. 3.1000(d)(1);
    (2) His or her children (in equal shares), as defined in Sec. 3.57 
but without regard to their age or marital status;
    (3) His or her dependent parents (in equal shares) as defined in 
Sec. 3.59 or the surviving parent, provided that the parent was 
dependent within the meaning of Sec. 3.250 at the date of the veteran's 
death.
    (4) In all other cases, only so much may be paid as may be necessary 
to reimburse a person who bore the expense of last sickness or burial. 
(See Sec. 3.1002.)


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5502(d))

    (b) Claim. Application must be filed with the Department of Veterans 
Affairs within 5 years after the death of the veteran. If, however, any 
person otherwise entitled is under legal disability at the time of the 
veteran's death, the 5-year period will run from the date of termination 
or removal of the legal disability.
    (1) There is no time limit for the submission of evidence.

[[Page 352]]

    (2) Failure to file timely claim, or a waiver of rights, by a 
preferred dependent will not serve to vest title in a person in a lower 
class or a claimant for reimbursement; neither will such failure or 
waiver by a person or persons in a joint class serve to increase the 
amount payable to another or others in the class.

    Authority: 105 Stat. 386, 38 U.S.C. 501(a), 2302-2308, unless 
otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3.1600  Payment of burial expenses of deceased veterans.

    For the purpose of payment of burial expenses the term veteran 
includes a person who died during a period deemed to be active military, 
naval or air service under Sec. 3.6(b)(6). The period of active service 
upon which the claim is based must have been terminated by discharge or 
release from active service under conditions other than dishonorable.
    (a) Service-connected death and burial allowance. If a veteran dies 
as a result of a service-connected disability or disabilities, an amount 
not to exceed the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 2307 (or if entitlement 
is under Sec. 3.40(b), (c), or (d), an amount computed in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 3.40(b) or (c)) may be paid toward the 
veteran's funeral and burial expenses including the cost of transporting 
the body to the place of burial. Entitlement to this benefit is subject 
to the applicable further provisions of this section and Sec. Sec. 
3.1601 through 3.1610. Except as provided in Sec. 3.1604(d)(5), payment 
of the service-connected death burial allowance is in lieu of payment of 
any benefit authorized under paragraph (b), (c) or (f) of this section.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2307)

    (b) Nonservice-connected death burial allowance. If a veteran's 
death is not service-connected, an amount not to exceed the amount 
specified in 38 U.S.C. 2302 (or if entitlement is under Sec. 3.40(b), 
(c), or (d), an amount computed in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 3.40(b) or (c)) may be paid toward the veteran's funeral and 
burial expenses including the cost of transporting the body to the place 
of burial. Entitlement is subject to the following conditions:
    (1) At the time of death the veteran was in receipt of pension or 
compensation (or but for the receipt of military retirement pay would 
have been in receipt of compensation); or
    (2) The veteran has an original or reopened claim for either benefit 
pending at the time of the veteran's death, and
    (i) In the case of an original claim there is sufficient evidence of 
record on the date of the veteran's death to have supported an award of 
compensation or pension effective prior to the date of the veteran's 
death, or
    (ii) In the case of a reopened claim, there is sufficient prima 
facie evidence of record on the date of the veteran's death to indicate 
that the deceased would have been entitled to compensation or pension 
prior to date of death. If the Department of Veterans Affairs determines 
that additional evidence is needed to confirm that the deceased would 
have been entitled prior to death, it shall be submitted within 1 year 
from date of request to the burial allowance claimant for submission of 
the confirming evidence. If the confirming evidence is not received by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs within 1 year from date of request, 
the burial allowance claim shall be disallowed; or
    (3) The deceased was a veteran of any war or was discharged or 
released from active military, naval, or air service for a disability 
incurred or aggravated in line of duty, and the body of the deceased is 
being held by a State (or a political subdivision of a State), and the 
Secretary determines,
    (i) That there is no next of kin or other person claiming the body 
of the deceased veteran, and
    (ii) That there are not available sufficient resources in the 
veteran's estate to cover burial and funeral expenses; and


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2302(a))


[[Page 353]]


    (4) The applicable further provisions of this section and Sec. Sec. 
3.1601 through 3.1610.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 2302)

    (c) Death while properly hospitalized. If a person dies from non-
service-connected causes while properly hospitalized by VA, there is 
payable an allowance not to exceed the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 
2303(a) for the actual cost of the person's funeral and burial, and an 
additional amount for transportation of the body to the place of burial. 
For burial allowance purposes, the term hospitalized by VA means 
admission to a VA facility (as described in 38 U.S.C. 1701(3)) for 
hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care under the authority of 38 
U.S.C. 1710 or 1711(a); admission (transfer) to a non-VA facility (as 
described in 38 U.S.C. 1701(4)) for hospital care under the authority of 
38 U.S.C. 1703; admission (transfer) to a nursing home under the 
authority of 38 U.S.C. 1720 for nursing home care at the expense of the 
United States; or admission (transfer) to a State nursing home for 
nursing home care with respect to which payment is authorized under the 
authority of 38 U.S.C. 1741. (If the hospitalized person's death is 
service-connected, entitlement to the burial allowance and 
transportation expenses fall under paragraphs (a) and (g) of this 
section instead of this paragraph.)


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2303(a))

    (d) Determinations. Where a claim for burial allowance would be or 
has been disallowed because the service department holds that the 
disability was not incurred in line of duty and evidence is submitted 
which permits a different finding, the decision of the service 
department is not binding and the Department of Veterans Affairs will 
determine line of duty. The burden of proof will rest upon the claimant.
    (e) Persons not included. Except as provided in Sec. 3.1605(c) 
burial allowance is not payable in the following cases:
    (1) A discharged or rejected draftee or selectee.
    (2) A member of the National Guard who reported to camp in answer to 
the President's call for World War I or World War II service, but who, 
when medically examined was not finally accepted for active military 
service.
    (3) An alien who does not come within the purview of Sec. 3.7(b).
    (4) Philippine Scouts enlisted on or after October 6, 1945, under 
section 14, Pub. L. 190, 79th Congress.
    (5) Temporary members of the Coast Guard Reserve.
    (f) Plot or interment allowance. A plot or interment allowance is 
payable to the person or entity who incurred the expenses in an amount 
not to exceed the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 2303(b) (or if the 
entitlement is under Sec. 3.40 (c) or (d), an amount computed in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3.40(c)) if the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) For claims filed on or after December 16, 2003:
    (i) The deceased veteran is eligible for burial in a national 
cemetery;
    (ii) The veteran is not buried in a national cemetery or other 
cemetery under the jurisdiction of the United States;
    (iii) The applicable further provisions of this section and 
Sec. Sec. 3.1601 through 3.1610.
    (2) For claims filed before December 16, 2003:
    (i) The deceased veteran is eligible for the burial allowance under 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section; or
    (ii) The veteran served during a period of war and the conditions 
set forth in Sec. 3.1604(d)(1)(ii)-(v) (relating to burial in a state 
veterans' cemetery) are met; or


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2303(b)(2))

    (iii) The veteran was discharged from the active military, naval, or 
air service for a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty (or 
at time of discharge has such a disability, shown by official service 
records, which in medical judgment would have justified a discharge for 
disability; the official service department record showing that the 
veteran was discharged or released from service for disability incurred 
in line of duty will be accepted for determining entitlement to the plot

[[Page 354]]

or interment allowance notwithstanding that the Department of Veterans 
Affairs has determined, in connection with a claim for monetary 
benefits, that the disability was not incurred in line of duty); and
    (iv) The veteran is not buried in a national cemetery or other 
cemetery under the jurisdiction of the United States; and
    (v) The applicable further provisions of this section and Sec. Sec. 
3.1601 through 3.1610.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2303(b))

    (g) Transportation expenses for burial in national cemetery. Where a 
veteran dies as the result of a service-connected disability, or at the 
time of death was in receipt of disability compensation (or but for the 
receipt of military retired pay or nonservice-connected disability 
pension would have been entitled to disability compensation at time of 
death), there is payable, in addition to the burial allowance (either 
the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 2302 or the amount specified in 38 
U.S.C. 2307 if the cause of death was service connected), an additional 
amount for payment of the cost of transporting the body to the national 
cemetery for burial. This amount may not exceed the cost of transporting 
the body from the veteran's place of death to the national cemetery 
nearest the veteran's last place of residence in which burial space is 
available. The amounts payable under this paragraph are subject to the 
limitations set forth in Sec. Sec. 3.1604 and 3.1606.

Sec. 3.1601  Claims and evidence.

    (a) Claims. Claims for reimbursement or direct payment of burial and 
funeral expenses under Sec. 3.1600(b) and plot or interment allowance 
under Sec. 3.1600(f) must be received by VA within 2 years after the 
permanent burial or cremation of the body. Where the burial allowance 
was not payable at the death of the veteran because of the nature of his 
(or her) discharge from service, but after his (or her) death the 
discharge has been corrected by competent authority so as to reflect a 
discharge under conditions other than dishonorable, claim may be filed 
within 2 years from date of correction of the discharge. This time limit 
does not apply to claims for service-connected burial allowance under 
Sec. 3.1600(a) or for the cost of transporting a veteran's body to the 
place of burial under Sec. 3.1600(c) or Sec. 3.1600(g).


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 904)

    (1) Claims for burial allowance may be executed by:
    (i) The funeral director, if entire bill or any balance is unpaid 
(if unpaid bill or the unpaid balance is less than the applicable 
statutory burial allowance, only the unpaid amount may be claimed by the 
funeral director); or
    (ii) The individual whose personal funds were used to pay burial, 
funeral, and transportation expenses; or
    (iii) The executor or administrator of the estate of the veteran or 
the estate of the person who paid the expenses of the veteran's burial 
or provided such services. If no executor or administrator has been 
appointed then by some person acting for such estate who will make 
distribution of the burial allowance to the person or persons entitled 
under the laws governing the distribution of interstate estates in the 
State of the decedent's personal domicile.
    (2) Claims for the plot or interment allowance (except for claims 
filed by a State or an agency or political subdivision thereof, under 
Sec. 3.1604(d)) may be executed by:
    (i) The funeral director, if he or she provided the plot or 
interment services, or advanced funds to pay for them, and if the entire 
bill for such or any balance thereof is unpaid (if the unpaid bill or 
the unpaid balance is less than the statutory plot or interment 
allowance, only the unpaid amount may be claimed by the funeral 
director); or
    (ii) The person(s) whose personal funds were used to defray the cost 
of the plot or interment expenses; or

[[Page 355]]

    (iii) The person or entity from whom the plot was purchased or who 
provided interment services if the bill for such is unpaid in whole or 
in part. An unpaid bill for a plot will take precedence in payment of 
the plot or interment allowance over an unpaid bill for other interment 
expenses or a claim for reimbursement for such expenses. Any remaining 
balance of the plot or interment allowance may then be applied to 
interment expenses; or
    (iv) The executor or administrator of the estate of the veteran or 
the estate of the person who bore the expense of the plot or interment 
expenses. If no executor or administrator has been appointed, claim for 
the plot or interment allowance may be filed as provided in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section for the burial allowance.
    (3) For the purposes of the plot and interment allowance plot or 
burial plot means the final disposal site of the remains, whether it is 
a grave, mausoleum vault, columbarium niche, or other similar place. 
Interment expenses are those costs associated with the final disposition 
of the remains and are not confined to the acts done within the burial 
grounds but may include the removal of bodies for burial or interment.
    (b) Supporting evidence. Evidence required to complete a claim for 
the burial allowance and the plot or interment allowance, when payable, 
(including a reopened claim filed within the 2-year period) must be 
submitted within 1 year from date of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
request for such evidence. In addition to the proper claim form the 
claimant (other than a Sec. 3.1604(d) claimant) is required to submit:
    (1) Statement of account. Preferably on funeral director's or 
cemetery owner's billhead showing name of the deceased veteran, the plot 
or interment costs, and the nature and cost of services rendered, and 
unpaid balance.
    (2) Receipted bills. Must show by whom payment was made and show 
receipt by a person acting for the funeral director or cemetery owner.
    (3) Proof of death. In accordance with Sec. 3.211.
    (4) Waivers from all other distributees. Where expenses of a 
veteran's burial, funeral, plot, interment and transportation were paid 
from funds of the veteran's estate or some other deceased person's 
estate and the identity and right of all persons to share in that estate 
have been established, payment may be made to one heir upon 
unconditional written consent of all other heirs.
    (5) Entitlement under Sec. 3.1600(b)(3). In addition to the other 
evidentiary requirements of this subparagraph, there must be written 
certification over the signature of a responsible official of the State 
(or political subdivision of the State) where the body was held that--
    (i) There is no next of kin or other person claiming the body of the 
deceased veteran, and
    (ii) There are not available sufficient resources in the veteran's 
estate to cover burial and funeral expenses.

<R05>
Sec. 3.1602  Special conditions governing payments.

    (a) Two or more persons expended funds. If two or more persons have 
paid from their personal funds toward the burial, funeral, plot, 
interment and transportation expenses, the burial and plot or interment 
allowance will be divided among such persons in accordance with the 
proportionate share paid by each, unless waiver is executed in favor of 
one of such persons by the other person or persons involved. The person 
in whose favor payment is waived will not be allowed a sum greater than 
that which was paid by such person. (See Sec. 3.1601(a)(3).)
    (b) Person who performed services. A person who performed burial, 
funeral, and transportation services or furnished the burial plot will 
have priority over claims of persons whose personal funds were expended.
    (c) Partial payment. Where partial payment of the expenses of the 
burial, funeral and transportation of the body are made from funds of 
the veteran's estate and the balance from the personal funds of another 
person, the claim of the other person has priority.

[[Page 356]]

    (d) Escheat. No payment of burial allowance or plot or interment 
allowance will be made where it would escheat.

[26 FR 1621, Feb. 24, 1961, as amended at 38 FR 30107, Nov. 1, 1973; 41

<R05>
Sec. 3.1603  Authority for burial of certain unclaimed bodies.

    If the body of a deceased veteran is unclaimed, there being no 
relatives or friends to claim the body, and there is burial allowance 
entitlement which is not based on Sec. 3.1600(b)(3), the amount 
provided for burial and plot or interment allowance will be available 
for the burial upon receipt of a claim accompanied by a statement 
showing what efforts were made to locate relatives or friends. The 
question of escheat of any part of such deceased veteran's estate is not 
a factor in such a claim. Burial allowance may be authorized for cost of 
disinterment and reburial of unclaimed remains originally accorded 
pauper burial but not for initial expenses of a burial in a potter's 
field. Burial in a prison cemetery is not considered a pauper burial.

[48 FR 41162, Sept. 14, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 3.1604  Payments from non-Department of Veterans Affairs sources.

    (a) Contributions or payments by public or private organizations. 
When contributions or payments on the burial expenses have been made by 
a state, any agency or political subdivision of the United States or of 
a State or the employer of the deceased veteran only the difference 
between the entire burial expenses and the amount paid thereon by any of 
these agencies or organizations, not to exceed the applicable statutory 
burial allowance, will be authorized. Contributions or payments by any 
other public or private organization such as a lodge, union, fraternal 
or beneficial organization, society, burial association or insurance 
company, will bar payment of the burial allowance if such allowance 
would revert to the funds of such organization or would discharge such 
organization's obligation without payment.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2302; 2307)

    (1) A contract or policy which provides for payment at death of a 
specified amount to a designated beneficiary other than the person 
rendering burial and funeral services will not bar payment of the burial 
allowance to the beneficiary even though the organization issuing the 
contract or policy retains an option to make payment direct to the 
person rendering burial and funeral services.
    (2) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to contributions 
or payments on the burial and funeral expenses which are made for 
humanitarian reasons if the organization making the contribution or 
payment is under no legal obligation to do so.
    (b) Payment by Federal agency. (1) Where a veteran dies while in 
employment covered by the United States Employees' Compensation Act, as 
amended, or other similar laws specifically providing for payment of the 
expenses of funeral, transportation, and interment out of Federal funds, 
burial allowance will not be authorized by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.
    (2) A provision in any Federal law or regulation permitting the 
application of funds due or accrued to the credit of the deceased toward 
the expenses of funeral, transportation and interment (such as Social 
Security benefits), as distinguished from a provision specifically 
prescribing a definite allowance for such purpose, will not bar payment 
of the burial allowance. In such cases only the difference between the 
total burial expense and the amount paid thereon under such provision, 
not to exceed the amount specified in 38 U.S.C. 2302, will be 
authorized.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2302(b))

    (3) Burial allowance is not payable for deaths in active service, or 
during the duty periods set forth in Sec. 3.6, or for other deaths 
where the cost of burial and transportation is paid by the service 
department.
    (c) Payment of plot or interment allowance by public or private 
organization except as provided for by Sec. 3.1604(d). Where any part 
of the plot or interment expenses has been paid or assumed by a state, 
any agency or political subdivision of a State, or the employer of the 
deceased veteran, only the difference

[[Page 357]]

between the total amount of such expenses and the amount paid or assumed 
by any of these agencies or organizations, not to exceed the statutory 
plot or interment allowance, will be authorized.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2303(b)(1))

    (d) Payment of the plot or interment allowance to a State or 
political subdivision thereof--(1) Conditions warranting payment. All of 
the following conditions must be met:
    (i) The plot or interment allowance is payable based on the deceased 
veteran's eligibility for burial in a national cemetery (or, in claims 
filed prior to December 16, 2003, the deceased veteran's service). See 
Sec. 38.620 of this chapter.
    (ii) The deceased veteran is buried in a cemetery or a section 
thereof which is used solely for the interment of persons who are 
eligible for burial in a national cemetery or who, with respect to 
persons dying on or after November 1, 2000, were at the time of death 
members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces not otherwise 
eligible for such burial or were former members of such a reserve 
component not otherwise eligible for such burial who were discharged or 
released from service under conditions other than dishonorable.
    (iii) The cemetery or the section thereof where the veteran is 
buried is owned by the State, or an agency or political subdivision of 
the State claiming the plot or interment allowance.
    (iv) No charge is made by the State, or an agency or political 
subdivision of the State for the cost of the plot or interment.
    (v) The veteran was buried on or after October 1, 1978.
    (2) Claims. A claim for payment under this paragraph shall be 
executed by a State, or an agency or political subdivision of a state on 
a claim form prescribed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Such 
claim must be received by the Department of Veterans Affairs within 2 
years after the permanent burial or cremation of the body. Where the 
burial allowance was not payable at the death of the veteran because of 
the nature of the veteran's discharge from service, but after the 
veteran's death the veteran's discharge was corrected by competent 
authority so as to reflect a discharge under conditions other than 
dishonorable, claim may be filed within 2 years from the date of 
correction of the discharge.
    (3) Amount of the allowance. A State or an agency or political 
subdivision of a state entitled to payment under this paragraph shall be 
paid the maximum statutory amount as a plot or interment allowance 
without regard to the acutal cost of the plot or interment.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2303(b))

    (4) Priority of payment. A claim filed under this paragraph shall 
take precedence in payment of the plot or interment allowance over any 
claim filed for the plot or interment allowance under Sec. 
3.1601(a)(2).

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2303(b))
    (5) A plot or interment allowance may be paid to a state in addition 
to a burial allowance under Sec. 3.1600(a) for claims filed on or after 
December 16, 2003.

who dies while in a hospital, domiciliary, or nursing home to which he 
or she was properly admitted under authority of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. (See Sec. 3.1600(c)). In addition, the cost of 
transporting the body to the place of burial may be authorized. The 
amount payable under this section is subject to the limitations set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and Sec. Sec. 3.1604 and

expenses will be allowed as though death occurred while properly 
hospitalized by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Hospitalization in 
the Philippines under 38 U.S.C. 631, 632, and 633 does not meet the 
requirements of this section.
    (b) Transportation. Except for retired persons hospitalized under 
section 5 of Executive Order 10122 (15 FR 2173; 3 CFR 1950 Supp.) issued

Veterans Affairs beneficiaries, the cost of transportation of the body 
to the place of burial in addition to the burial and plot or interment 
allowance will be provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs where 
death occurs:
    (1) Within a State or the Canal Zone (38 U.S.C. 101 (20)) while the 
veteran is hospitalized by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the 
body is buried in a State or the Canal Zone; or
    (2) While hospitalized within but burial is to be outside of a State 
or the Canal Zone, except that cost of transportation of the body will 
be authorized only from place of death to port of embarkation, or to 
border limits of United States where burial is in Canada or Mexico.
    (c) Extended entitlement. Entitlement extends to the following 
persons who die while properly hospitalized by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs:
    (1) Discharged or rejected draftees; or
    (2) Members of the National Guard who reported to camp in answer to 
the President's call for World War I, World War II, or Korean service, 
but who when medically examined were not finally accepted for active 
military service; or
    (3) A veteran discharged under conditions other than dishonorable 
from a period of service other than a war period.
    (d) Persons properly hospitalized. A person properly hospitalized 
who dies:
    (1) While on authorized absence which has not exceeded 96 hours at 
time of death;
    (2) While in a status of unauthorized absence for a period not in 
excess of 24 hours; or
    (3) While absent from the hospital for a period totaling 24 hours of 
combined authorized and unauthorized absence (all other cases in which 
such absence arises at the expiration of an authorized absence are not 
included);

is considered as having died while hospitalized.
    (e) Persons not properly hospitalized. Where a deceased person was 
not properly hospitalized, benefits will not be authorized under this

period of service commencing prior to the date of commission of the 
offense where either the veteran or claimant has forfeited the right to

<R05>
Sec. 3.1612  Monetary allowance in lieu of a Government-furnished headstone or marker.

    (a) Purpose. This section provides for the payment of a monetary 
allowance in lieu of furnishing a headstone or marker at Government 
expense under the provisions of Sec. 1.631(a)(2) and (b) of this 
chapter to the person entitled to request such a headstone or marker.
    (b) Eligibility for the allowance. All of the following conditions 
shall be met:
    (1) The deceased veteran was eligible for burial in a National 
cemetery (See Sec. 1.620 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this chapter); or 
died under circumstances precluding the recovery or identification of 
the veteran's remains or the veteran's remains were buried at sea.
    (2) The veteran was buried on or after October 18, 1978.
    (3) The headstone or marker was purchased to mark the otherwise 
unmarked grave of the deceased veteran or, if death occurred prior to 
December 18, 1989, the veteran's identifying information was added to an 
existing headstone or marker.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2306(d))

    (4) The headstone or marker is for placement in a cemetery other 
than a National cemetery or the headstone or marker upon which the 
veteran's identifying information was added is situated in a cemetery 
other than a National cemetery.
    (c) Person entitled to request a Government-furnished headstone or 
marker. For purposes of this monetary allowance, the term ``person 
entitled to request a headstone or marker'' includes, but is not limited 
to, the person who purchased the headstone or marker (or if death 
occurred prior to December 18, 1989, the person who paid for adding the 
veteran's identifying information to an existing headstone or marker), 
or the executor, administrator or person representing the deceased's 
estate.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2306(d))

    (d) Receipted bill. A receipted bill describing the headstone or 
marker (or the services rendered in adding the veteran's identifying 
information to an existing headstone or marker) date of purchase, 
purchase price, the amount of payment and the name of the person who 
made such payment, shall accompany a claim for this monetary allowance.
    (e) Payment and amount of the allowance. (1) The monetary allowance 
is payable as reimbursement to the person entitled to request a 
Government-furnished headstone or marker. If funds of the deceased's 
estate were used to purchase the headstone or marker or, if death 
occurred prior to December 18, 1989, to have the deceased's identifying 
information added to an existing headstone or marker, and no executor or 
administrator has been appointed, payment may be made to a person who 
will make a distribution of this monetary allowance to the person or 
persons entitled under the laws governing the distribution of intestate 
estates in the State of the decedent's personal domicile.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2306(d))

    (2) The amount of the allowance payable is the lesser of the 
following:
    (i) Actual cost of acquiring a non-Government headstone or marker 
or, if death occurred prior to December 18, 1989, the actual cost of 
adding the veteran's identifying information to an existing headstone or 
marker; or


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2306(d))

    (ii) The average actual cost, as determined by VA, of headstones and 
markers furnished at Government expense for the fiscal year preceding 
the fiscal year in which the non-Government marker was purchased or the 
services for adding the veteran's identifying information on an existing 
headstone or marker were purchased.
    (3) The average actual cost of Government-furnished headstones and 
markers during any fiscal year is determined by dividing the sum of VA's 
costs during that fiscal year for procurement, transportation, Office of 
Memorial Programs and miscellaneous administration, inspection and 
support staff by the total number of headstones and markers procured by 
VA during that fiscal year and rounding to the

[[Page 361]]

nearest whole dollar amount. The resulting average actual cost is 
published at the end of each fiscal year in the ``Notices'' section of 
the Federal Register.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2306(d))

    (4) The following applies to joint or multiple headstones or 
markers:
    (i) When a joint or multiple non-Government headstone or marker is 
purchased subsequent to the veteran's death, the amount set forth in 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section shall be available as reimbursement 
for the cost of the veteran's portion of the joint or multiple headstone 
or marker.
    (ii) When a joint or multiple non-Government headstone or marker is 
existent at the time of the veteran's death, the allowance payable as 
reimbursement under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be determined 
based on the cost of the services for adding the veteran's identifying 
information.
    (f) Payment of allowance prohibited. This monetary allowance shall 
not be paid when a Government headstone or marker has been requested or 
issued under the provisions of Sec. 1.631 (a)(2) and (b) of this 
chapter.
    (g) Claims. There is no time limit for filing claims for monetary 
allowance in lieu of a Government-furnished headstone or marker.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2306(d))

    (h) The monetary allowance in lieu of a Government-furnished 
headstone or marker is not payable if death occurred on or after 
November 1, 1990.

<R05>
Sec. 3.2600  Review of benefit claims decisions.

    (a) A claimant who has filed a timely Notice of Disagreement with a 
decision of an agency of original jurisdiction on a benefit claim has a 
right to a review of that decision under this section. The review will 
be conducted by a Veterans Service Center Manager or Decision Review 
Officer, at VA's discretion. An individual who did not participate in 
the decision being reviewed will conduct this review. Only a decision 
that has not yet become final (by appellate decision or failure to 
timely appeal) may be reviewed. Review under this section will encompass 
only decisions with which the claimant has expressed

[[Page 362]]

disagreement in the Notice of Disagreement. The reviewer will consider 
all evidence of record and applicable law, and will give no deference to 
the decision being reviewed.
    (b) Unless the claimant has requested review under this section with 
his or her Notice of Disagreement, VA will, upon receipt of the Notice 
of Disagreement, notify the claimant in writing of his or her right to a 
review under this section. To obtain such a review, the claimant must 
request it not later than 60 days after the date VA mails the notice. 
This 60-day time limit may not be extended. If the claimant fails to 
request review under this section not later than 60 days after the date 
VA mails the notice, VA will proceed with the traditional appellate 
process by issuing a Statement of the Case. A claimant may not have more 
than one review under this section of the same decision.
    (c) The reviewer may conduct whatever development he or she 
considers necessary to resolve any disagreements in the Notice of 
Disagreement, consistent with applicable law. This may include an 
attempt to obtain additional evidence or the holding of an informal 
conference with the claimant. Upon the request of the claimant, the 
reviewer will conduct a hearing under Sec. 3.103(c).
    (d) The reviewer may grant a benefit sought in the claim 
notwithstanding Sec. 3.105(b), but, except as provided in paragraph (e) 
of this section, may not revise the decision in a manner that is less 
advantageous to the claimant than the decision under review. A review 
decision made under this section will include a summary of the evidence, 
a citation to pertinent laws, a discussion of how those laws affect the 
decision, and a summary of the reasons for the decision.
    (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the 
reviewer may reverse or revise (even if disadvantageous to the claimant) 
prior decisions of an agency of original jurisdiction (including the 
decision being reviewed or any prior decision that has become final due 
to failure to timely appeal) on the grounds of clear and unmistakable 
error (see Sec. 3.105(a)).
    (f) Review under this section does not limit the appeal rights of a 
claimant. Unless a claimant withdraws his or her Notice of Disagreement 
as a result of this review process, VA will proceed with the traditional 
appellate process by issuing a Statement of the Case.
    (g) This section applies to all claims in which a Notice of 
Disagreement is filed on or after June 1, 2001.

as a result of or incident to military service. The percentage ratings 
represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment 
in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their 
residual conditions in civil occupations. Generally, the degrees of 
disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for 
considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses 
proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. For 
the application of this schedule, accurate and fully descriptive medical 
examinations are required, with emphasis upon the limitation of activity 
imposed by the disabling condition. Over a period of many years, a 
veteran's disability claim may require reratings in accordance with 
changes in laws, medical knowledge and his or her physical or mental 
condition. It is thus essential, both in the examination and in the 
evaluation of disability, that each disability be viewed in relation to 
its history.

<R05>
Sec. 4.2  Interpretation of examination reports.

    Different examiners, at different times, will not describe the same 
disability in the same language. Features of the disability which must 
have persisted unchanged may be overlooked or a change for the better or 
worse may not be accurately appreciated or described. It is the 
responsibility of the rating specialist to interpret reports of 
examination in the light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the 
various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may 
accurately reflect the elements of disability present. Each disability 
must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or 
seeking work. If a diagnosis is not supported by the findings on the 
examination report or if the report does not contain sufficient detail, 
it is incumbent upon the rating board to return the report as inadequate 
for evaluation purposes.

[41 FR 11292, Mar. 18, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 4.3  Resolution of reasonable doubt.

    It is the defined and consistently applied policy of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs to administer the law under a broad interpretation, 
consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case. When after 
careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable 
doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be 
resolved in favor of the claimant. See Sec. 3.102 of this chapter.

[40 FR 42535, Sept. 15, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 4.6  Evaluation of evidence.

    The element of the weight to be accorded the character of the 
veteran's service is but one factor entering into the considerations of 
the rating boards in arriving at determinations of the evaluation of 
disability. Every element in any way affecting the probative value to be 
assigned to the evidence in each individual claim must be thoroughly and 
conscientiously studied by each member of the rating board in the light 
of the established policies of the Department of Veterans Affairs to the 
end that decisions will be equitable and just as contemplated by the 
requirements of the law.


<R05>
Sec. 4.7  Higher of two evaluations.

    Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be 
applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if

[[Page 365]]

the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required 
for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.


<R05>
Sec. 4.9  Congenital or developmental defects.

    Mere congenital or developmental defects, absent, displaced or 
supernumerary parts, refractive error of the eye, personality disorder 
and mental deficiency are not diseases or injuries in the meaning of 
applicable legislation for disability compensation purposes.

[41 FR 11292, Mar. 18, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 4.10  Functional impairment.

    The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a 
whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function 
under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 
Whether the upper or lower extremities, the back or abdominal wall, the 
eyes or ears, or the cardiovascular, digestive, or other system, or 
psyche are affected, evaluations are based upon lack of usefulness, of 
these parts or systems, especially in self-support. This imposes upon 
the medical examiner the responsibility of furnishing, in addition to 
the etiological, anatomical, pathological, laboratory and prognostic 
data required for ordinary medical classification, full description of 
the effects of disability upon the person's ordinary activity. In this 
connection, it will be remembered that a person may be too disabled to 
engage in employment although he or she is up and about and fairly 
comfortable at home or upon limited activity.

[41 FR 11292, Mar. 18, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 4.13  Effect of change of diagnosis.

    The repercussion upon a current rating of service connection when 
change is made of a previously assigned diagnosis or etiology must be 
kept in mind. The aim should be the reconciliation and continuance of 
the diagnosis or etiology upon which service connection for the 
disability had been granted. The relevant principle enunciated in Sec. 
4.125, entitled ``Diagnosis of mental disorders,'' should have careful 
attention in this connection. When any change in evaluation is to be 
made, the rating agency should assure itself that there has been an 
actual change in the conditions, for better or worse, and not merely a 
difference in thoroughness of the examination or in use of descriptive 
terms. This will not, of course, preclude the correction of erroneous 
ratings, nor will it preclude assignment of a rating in conformity with 
Sec. 4.7.

[29 FR 6718, May 22, 1964, as amended at 61 FR 52700, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 4.14  Avoidance of pyramiding.

    The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to 
be avoided. Disability from injuries to the muscles, nerves, and joints 
of an extremity may overlap to a great extent, so that special rules are 
included in the appropriate bodily system for their evaluation. Dyspnea, 
tachycardia, nervousness, fatigability, etc., may result from many 
causes; some may be service connected, others, not. Both the use of 
manifestations not resulting from service-connected disease or injury in 
establishing the service-connected evaluation, and the evaluation of the 
same manifestation under different diagnoses are to be avoided.


<R05>
Sec. 4.15  Total disability ratings.

    The ability to overcome the handicap of disability varies widely 
among individuals. The rating, however, is based primarily upon the 
average impairment in earning capacity, that is, upon the economic or 
industrial handicap which must be overcome and not from individual 
success in overcoming it. However, full consideration must be given to 
unusual physical or mental effects in individual cases, to peculiar 
effects of occupational activities, to defects in physical or mental 
endowment preventing the usual amount of success in overcoming the 
handicap of disability and to the effect of combinations of disability. 
Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any 
impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible 
for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation; 
Provided, That permanent total disability shall be taken to exist when 
the impairment is reasonably certain

[[Page 366]]

to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. The following 
will be considered to be permanent total disability: the permanent loss 
of the use of both hands, or of both feet, or of one hand and one foot, 
or of the sight of both eyes, or becoming permanently helpless or 
permanently bedridden. Other total disability ratings are scheduled in 
the various bodily systems of this schedule.


<R05>
Sec. 4.16  Total disability ratings for compensation based on unemployability of the individual.

    (a) Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where 
the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in 
the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a 
substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected 
disabilities: Provided That, if there is only one such disability, this 
disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and that, if there 
are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability 
ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to 
bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. For the above purpose 
of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in 
combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) 
Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, or of one or both lower 
extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable, (2) 
disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident, (3) 
disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g. orthopedic, digestive, 
respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric, (4) multiple 
injuries incurred in action, or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a 
prisoner of war. It is provided further that the existence or degree of 
nonservice-connected disabilities or previous unemployability status 
will be disregarded where the percentages referred to in this paragraph 
for the service-connected disability or disabilities are met and in the 
judgment of the rating agency such service-connected disabilities render 
the veteran unemployable. Marginal employment shall not be considered 
substantially gainful employment. For purposes of this section, marginal 
employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned 
annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold 
for one person. Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a 
facts found basis (includes but is not limited to employment in a 
protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), 
when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Consideration 
shall be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the 
reason for termination.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

    (b) It is the established policy of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a 
substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected 
disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. Therefore, rating boards 
should submit to the Director, Compensation and Pension Service, for 
extra-schedular consideration all cases of veterans who are unemployable 
by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the 
percentage standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
rating board will include a full statement as to the veteran's service-
connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational 
attainment and all other factors having a bearing on the issue.

<R05>
Sec. 4.17  Total disability ratings for pension based on unemployability and age of the individual.

    All veterans who are basically eligible and who are unable to secure 
and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of disabilities 
which are likely to be permanent shall be rated as permanently and 
totally disabled. For the purpose of pension, the permanence of the 
percentage requirements of Sec. 4.16 is a requisite. When the 
percentage requirements are met, and the disabilities involved are of a 
permanent nature, a rating of permanent and total disability will be 
assigned if the

[[Page 367]]

veteran is found to be unable to secure and follow substantially gainful 
employment by reason of such disability. Prior employment or 
unemployment status is immaterial if in the judgment of the rating board 
the veteran's disabilities render him or her unemployable. In making 
such determinations, the following guidelines will be used:
    (a) Marginal employment, for example, as a self-employed farmer or 
other person, while employed in his or her own business, or at odd jobs 
or while employed at less than half the usual remuneration will not be 
considered incompatible with a determination of unemployability, if the 
restriction, as to securing or retaining better employment, is due to 
disability.
    (b) Claims of all veterans who fail to meet the percentage standards 
but who meet the basic entitlement criteria and are unemployable, will 
be referred by the rating board to the Veterans Service Center Manager 
under Sec. 3.321(b)(2) of this chapter.

Sec. 4.17a  Misconduct etiology.

    A permanent and total disability rating under the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 4.15, 4.16 and 4.17 will not be precluded by reason of the 
coexistence of misconduct disability when:
    (a) A veteran, regardless of employment status, also has innocently 
acquired 100 percent disability, or
    (b) Where unemployable, the veteran has other disabilities 
innocently acquired which meet the percentage requirements of Sec. Sec. 
4.16 and 4.17 and would render, in the judgment of the rating agency, 
the average person unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful 
occupation.

<R05>
Sec. 4.18  Unemployability.

    A veteran may be considered as unemployable upon termination of 
employment which was provided on account of disability, or in which 
special consideration was given on account of the same, when it is 
satisfactorily shown that he or she is unable to secure further 
employment. With amputations, sequelae of fractures and other residuals 
of traumatism shown to be of static character, a showing of continuous 
unemployability from date of incurrence, or the date the condition 
reached the stabilized level, is a general requirement in order to 
establish the fact that present unemployability is the result of the 
disability. However, consideration is to be given to the circumstances 
of employment in individual claims, and, if the employment was only 
occasional, intermittent, tryout or unsuccessful, or eventually 
terminated on account of the disability, present unemployability may be 
attributed to the static disability. Where unemployability for pension 
previously has been established on the basis of combined service-
connected and nonservice-connected disabilities and the service-
connected disability or disabilities have increased in severity, Sec. 
4.16 is for consideration.

[40 FR 42536, Sept. 15, 1975, as amended at 43 FR 45349, Oct. 2, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 4.19  Age in service-connected claims.

    Age may not be considered as a factor in evaluating service-
connected disability; and unemployability, in service-connected claims, 
associated with advancing age or intercurrent disability, may not be 
used as a basis for a total disability rating. Age, as such, is a factor 
only in evaluations of disability not resulting from service, i.e., for 
the purposes of pension.

[29 FR 6718, May 22, 1964, as amended at 43 FR 45349, Oct. 2, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 4.20  Analogous ratings.

    When an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to 
rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the 
functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology 
are closely analogous. Conjectural analogies will be avoided, as will 
the use of analogous ratings for conditions of doubtful diagnosis, or 
for those not fully supported by clinical and laboratory findings. Nor 
will ratings assigned to organic diseases and injuries be assigned by 
analogy to conditions of functional origin.

[[Page 368]]


<R05>
Sec. 4.21  Application of rating schedule.

    In view of the number of atypical instances it is not expected, 
especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that 
all cases will show all the findings specified. Findings sufficiently 
characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom, and 
above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will, 
however, be expected in all instances.

[41 FR 11293, Mar. 18, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 4.22  Rating of disabilities aggravated by active service.

    In cases involving aggravation by active service, the rating will 
reflect only the degree of disability over and above the degree existing 
at the time of entrance into the active service, whether the particular 
condition was noted at the time of entrance into the active service, or 
it is determined upon the evidence of record to have existed at that 
time. It is necessary therefore, in all cases of this character to 
deduct from the present degree of disability the degree, if 
ascertainable, of the disability existing at the time of entrance into 
active service, in terms of the rating schedule, except that if the 
disability is total (100 percent) no deduction will be made. The 
resulting difference will be recorded on the rating sheet. If the degree 
of disability at the time of entrance into the service is not 
ascertainable in terms of the schedule, no deduction will be made.


<R05>
Sec. 4.23  Attitude of rating officers.

    It is to be remembered that the majority of applicants are disabled 
persons who are seeking benefits of law to which they believe themselves 
entitled. In the exercise of his or her functions, rating officers must 
not allow their personal feelings to intrude; an antagonistic, critical, 
or even abusive attitude on the part of a claimant should not in any 
instance influence the officers in the handling of the case. Fairness 
and courtesy must at all times be shown to applicants by all employees 
whose duties bring them in contact, directly or indirectly, with the 
Department's claimants.

<R05>
Sec. 4.24  Correspondence.

    All correspondence relative to the interpretation of the schedule 
for rating disabilities, requests for advisory opinions, questions 
regarding lack of clarity or application to individual cases involving 
unusual difficulties, will be addressed to the Director, Compensation 
and Pension Service. A clear statement will be made of the point or 
points upon which information is desired, and the complete case file 
will be simultaneously forwarded to Central Office. Rating agencies will 
assure themselves that the recent report of physical examination 
presents an adequate picture of the claimant's condition. Claims in 
regard to which the schedule evaluations are considered inadequate or 
excessive, and errors in the schedule will be similarly brought to 
attention.

<R05>
Sec. 4.25  Combined ratings table.

    Table I, Combined Ratings Table, results from the consideration of 
the efficiency of the individual as affected first by the most disabling 
condition, then by the less disabling condition, then by other less 
disabling conditions, if any, in the order of severity. Thus, a person 
having a 60 percent disability is considered 40 percent efficient. 
Proceeding from this 40 percent efficiency, the effect of a further 30 
percent disability is to leave only 70 percent of the efficiency 
remaining after consideration of the first disability, or 28 percent 
efficiency altogether. The individual is thus 72 percent disabled, as 
shown in table I opposite 60 percent and under 30 percent.
    (a) To use table I, the disabilities will first be arranged in the 
exact order of their severity, beginning with the greatest disability 
and then combined with use of table I as hereinafter indicated. For 
example, if there are two disabilities, the degree of one disability 
will be read in the left column and the degree of the other in the top 
row, whichever is appropriate. The figures appearing in the space where 
the column and row intersect will represent the combined value of the 
two. This combined value will then be converted to the nearest number 
divisible by 10,

[[Page 369]]

and combined values ending in 5 will be adjusted upward. Thus, with a 50 
percent disability and a 30 percent disability, the combined value will 
be found to be 65 percent, but the 65 percent must be converted to 70 
percent to represent the final degree of disability. Similarly, with a 
disability of 40 percent, and another disability of 20 percent, the 
combined value is found to be 52 percent, but the 52 percent must be 
converted to the nearest degree divisible by 10, which is 50 percent. If 
there are more than two disabilities, the disabilities will also be 
arranged in the exact order of their severity and the combined value for 
the first two will be found as previously described for two 
disabilities. The combined value, exactly as found in table I, will be 
combined with the degree of the third disability (in order of severity). 
The combined value for the three disabilities will be found in the space 
where the column and row intersect, and if there are only three 
disabilities will be converted to the nearest degree divisible by 10, 
adjusting final 5's upward. Thus, if there are three disabilities 
ratable at 60 percent, 40 percent, and 20 percent, respectively, the 
combined value for the first two will be found opposite 60 and under 40 
and is 76 percent. This 76 will be combined with 20 and the combined 
value for the three is 81 percent. This combined value will be converted 
to the nearest degree divisible by 10 which is 80 percent. The same 
procedure will be employed when there are four or more disabilities. 
(See table I).
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this schedule, the disabilities 
arising from a single disease entity, e.g., arthritis, multiple 
sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident, etc., are to be rated separately as 
are all other disabiling conditions, if any. All disabilities are then 
to be combined as described in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
conversion to the nearest degree divisible by 10 will be done only once 
per rating decision, will follow the combining of all disabilities, and 
will be the last procedure in determining the combined degree of 
disability.

Sec. 4.26  Bilateral factor.

    When a partial disability results from disease or injury of both 
arms, or of both legs, or of paired skeletal muscles, the ratings for 
the disabilities of the right and left sides will be combined as usual, 
and 10 percent of this value will be added (i.e., not combined) before 
proceeding with further combinations, or converting to degree of 
disability. The bilateral factor will be applied to such bilateral 
disabilities before other combinations are carried out and the rating 
for such disabilities including the bilateral factor in this section 
will be treated as 1 disability for the purpose of arranging in order of 
severity and for all further combinations. For example, with 
disabilities evaluated at 60 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent and 10 
percent (the two 10's representing bilateral disabilities), the order of 
severity would be 60, 21 and 20. The 60 and 21 combine to 68 percent and 
the 68 and 20 to 74 percent, converted to 70 percent as the final degree 
of disability.
    (a) The use of the terms ``arms'' and ``legs'' is not intended to 
distinguish between the arm, forearm and hand, or the thigh, leg, and 
foot, but relates to

[[Page 371]]

the upper extremities and lower extremities as a whole. Thus with a 
compensable disability of the right thigh, for example, amputation, and 
one of the left foot, for example, pes planus, the bilateral factor 
applies, and similarly whenever there are compensable disabilities 
affecting use of paired extremities regardless of location or specified 
type of impairment.
    (b) The correct procedure when applying the bilateral factor to 
disabilities affecting both upper extremities and both lower extremities 
is to combine the ratings of the disabilities affecting the 4 
extremities in the order of their individual severity and apply the 
bilateral factor by adding, not combining, 10 percent of the combined 
value thus attained.
    (c) The bilateral factor is not applicable unless there is partial 
disability of compensable degree in each of 2 paired extremities, or 
paired skeletal muscles.


<R05>
Sec. 4.27  Use of diagnostic code numbers.

    The diagnostic code numbers appearing opposite the listed ratable 
disabilities are arbitrary numbers for the purpose of showing the basis 
of the evaluation assigned and for statistical analysis in the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, and as will be observed, extend from 
5000 to a possible 9999. Great care will be exercised in the selection 
of the applicable code number and in its citation on the rating sheet. 
No other numbers than these listed or hereafter furnished are to be 
employed for rating purposes, with an exception as described in this 
section, as to unlisted conditions. When an unlisted disease, injury, or 
residual condition is encountered, requiring rating by analogy, the 
diagnostic code number will be ``built-up'' as follows: The first 2 
digits will be selected from that part of the schedule most closely 
identifying the part, or system, of the body involved; the last 2 digits 
will be ``99'' for all unlisted conditions. This procedure will 
facilitate a close check of new and unlisted conditions, rated by 
analogy. In the selection of code numbers, injuries will generally be 
represented by the number assigned to the residual condition on the 
basis of which the rating is determined. With diseases, preference is to 
be given to the number assigned to the disease itself; if the rating is 
determined on the basis of residual conditions, the number appropriate 
to the residual condition will be added, preceded by a hyphen. Thus, 
rheumatoid (atrophic) arthritis rated as ankylosis of the lumbar spine 
should be coded ``5002-5240.'' In this way, the exact source of each 
rating can be easily identified. In the citation of disabilities on 
rating sheets, the diagnostic terminology will be that of the medical 
examiner, with no attempt to translate the terms into schedule 
nomenclature. Residuals of diseases or therapeutic procedures will not 
be cited without reference to the basic disease.

Sec. 4.28  Prestabilization rating from date of discharge from service.

    The following ratings may be assigned, in lieu of ratings prescribed 
elsewhere, under the conditions stated for disability from any disease 
or injury. The prestabilization rating is not to be assigned in any case 
in which a total rating is immediately assignable under the regular 
provisions of the schedule or on the basis of individual 
unemployability. The prestabilization 50-percent rating is not to be 
used in any case in which a rating of 50 percent or more is immediately 
assignable under the regular provisions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Rating

   advisable................................................
Unhealed or incompletely healed wounds or injuries--
  Material impairment of employability likely...............          50
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note (1): Department of Veterans Affairs examination is not required 
prior to assignment of prestabilization ratings; however, the fact that 
examination was accomplished will not preclude assignment of these 
benefits. Prestabilization ratings are for assignment in the immediate 
postdischarge period. They will continue for a 12-month period following 
discharge from service. However, prestabilization ratings may be changed 
to a regular schedular total rating or one authorizing a greater benefit 
at any time. In each prestabilization rating an examination will be 
requested to be accomplished not earlier than 6 months nor more than 12 
months following discharge. In those prestabilization

[[Page 372]]

ratings in which following examination reduction in evaluation is found 
to be warranted, the higher evaluation will be continued to the end of 
the 12th month following discharge or to the end of the period provided 
under Sec. 3.105(e) of this chapter, whichever is later. Special 
monthly compensation should be assigned concurrently in these cases 
whenever records are adequate to establish entitlement.
    Note (2): Diagnosis of disease, injury, or residuals will be cited, 
with diagnostic code number assigned from this rating schedule for 
conditions listed therein.

Sec. 4.29  Ratings for service-connected disabilities requiring hospital treatment or observation.

    A total disability rating (100 percent) will be assigned without 
regard to other provisions of the rating schedule when it is established 
that a service-connected disability has required hospital treatment in a 
Department of Veterans Affairs or an approved hospital for a period in 
excess of 21 days or hospital observation at Department of Veterans 
Affairs expense for a service-connected disability for a period in 
excess of 21 days.
    (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of 
this section this increased rating will be effective the first day of 
continuous hospitalization and will be terminated effective the last day 
of the month of hospital discharge (regular discharge or release to non-
bed care) or effective the last day of the month of termination of 
treatment or observation for the service-connected disability. A 
temporary release which is approved by an attending Department of 
Veterans Affairs physician as part of the treatment plan will not be 
considered an absence.
    (1) An authorized absence in excess of 4 days which begins during 
the first 21 days of hospitalization will be regarded as the equivalent 
of hospital discharge effective the first day of such authorized 
absence. An authorized absence of 4 days or less which results in a 
total of more than 8 days of authorized absence during the first 21 days 
of hospitalization will be regarded as the equivalent of hospital 
discharge effective the ninth day of authorized absence.
    (2) Following a period of hospitalization in excess of 21 days, an 
authorized absence in excess of 14 days or a third consecutive 
authorized absence of 14 days will be regarded as the equivalent of 
hospital discharge and will interrupt hospitalization effective on the 
last day of the month in which either the authorized absence in excess 
of 14 days or the third 14 day period begins, except where there is a 
finding that convalescence is required as provided by paragraph (e) or 
(f) of this section. The termination of these total ratings will not be 
subject to Sec. 3.105(e) of this chapter.
    (b) Notwithstanding that hospital admission was for disability not 
connected with service, if during such hospitalization, hospital 
treatment for a service-connected disability is instituted and continued 
for a period in excess of 21 days, the increase to a total rating will 
be granted from the first day of such treatment. If service connection 
for the disability under treatment is granted after hospital admission, 
the rating will be from the first day of hospitalization if otherwise in 
order.
    (c) The assignment of a total disability rating on the basis of 
hospital treatment or observation will not preclude the assignment of a 
total disability rating otherwise in order under other provisions of the 
rating schedule, and consideration will be given to the propriety of 
such a rating in all instances and to the propriety of its continuance 
after discharge. Particular attention, with a view to proper rating 
under the rating schedule, is to be given to the claims of veterans 
discharged from hospital, regardless of length of hospitalization, with 
indications on the final summary of expected confinement to bed or 
house, or to inability to work with requirement of frequent care of 
physician or nurse at home.
    (d) On these total ratings Department of Veterans Affairs 
regulations governing effective dates for increased benefits will 
control.
    (e) The total hospital rating if convalescence is required may be 
continued for periods of 1, 2, or 3 months in addition to the period 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) Extension of periods of 1, 2 or 3 months beyond the initial 3 
months

[[Page 373]]

may be made upon approval of the Veterans Service Center Manager.
    (g) Meritorious claims of veterans who are discharged from the 
hospital with less than the required number of days but need post-
hospital care and a prolonged period of convalescence will be referred 
to the Director, Compensation and Pension Service, under Sec. 
3.321(b)(1) of this chapter.

Sec. 4.30  Convalescent ratings.

    A total disability rating (100 percent) will be assigned without 
regard to other provisions of the rating schedule when it is established 
by report at hospital discharge (regular discharge or release to non-bed 
care) or outpatient release that entitlement is warranted under 
paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section effective the date of 
hospital admission or outpatient treatment and continuing for a period 
of 1, 2, or 3 months from the first day of the month following such 
hospital discharge or outpatient release. The termination of these total 
ratings will not be subject to Sec. 3.105(e) of this chapter. Such 
total rating will be followed by appropriate schedular evaluations. When 
the evidence is inadequate to assign a schedular evaluation, a physical 
examination will be scheduled and considered prior to the termination of 
a total rating under this section.
    (a) Total ratings will be assigned under this section if treatment 
of a service-connected disability resulted in:
    (1) Surgery necessitating at least one month of convalescence 
(Effective as to outpatient surgery March 1, 1989.)
    (2) Surgery with severe postoperative residuals such as incompletely 
healed surgical wounds, stumps of recent amputations, therapeutic 
immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, 
or the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued 
use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight-bearing prohibited). 
(Effective as to outpatient surgery March 1, 1989.)
    (3) Immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or 
more. (Effective as to outpatient treatment March 10, 1976.)

A reduction in the total rating will not be subject to Sec. 3.105(e) of 
this chapter. The total rating will be followed by an open rating 
reflecting the appropriate schedular evaluation; where the evidence is 
inadequate to assign the schedular evaluation, a physcial examination 
will be scheduled prior to the end of the total rating period.
    (b) A total rating under this section will require full 
justification on the rating sheet and may be extended as follows:
    (1) Extensions of 1, 2 or 3 months beyond the initial 3 months may 
be made under paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section.
    (2) Extensions of 1 or more months up to 6 months beyond the initial 
6 months period may be made under paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this 
section upon approval of the Veterans Service Center Manager.

assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met.

                      Subpart B_Disability Ratings

                       The Musculoskeletal System


<R05>
Sec. 4.40  Functional loss.

    Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, 
due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal 
working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, 
coordination and endurance. It is essential that the examination on 
which ratings are based adequately portray the anatomical damage, and 
the functional loss, with respect to all these elements. The functional 
loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones,

[[Page 374]]

joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, 
adhesions, defective innervation, or other pathology, or it may be due 
to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible 
behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion. Weakness is as 
important as limitation of motion, and a part which becomes painful on 
use must be regarded as seriously disabled. A little used part of the 
musculoskeletal system may be expected to show evidence of disuse, 
either through atrophy, the condition of the skin, absence of normal 
callosity or the like.


<R05>
Sec. 4.41  History of injury.

    In considering the residuals of injury, it is essential to trace the 
medical-industrial history of the disabled person from the original 
injury, considering the nature of the injury and the attendant 
circumstances, and the requirements for, and the effect of, treatment 
over past periods, and the course of the recovery to date. The duration 
of the initial, and any subsequent, period of total incapacity, 
especially periods reflecting delayed union, inflammation, swelling, 
drainage, or operative intervention, should be given close attention. 
This consideration, or the absence of clear cut evidence of injury, may 
result in classifying the disability as not of traumatic origin, either 
reflecting congenital or developmental etiology, or the effects of 
healed disease.


<R05>
Sec. 4.42  Complete medical examination of injury cases.

    The importance of complete medical examination of injury cases at 
the time of first medical examination by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs cannot be overemphasized. When possible, this should include 
complete neurological and psychiatric examination, and other special 
examinations indicated by the physical condition, in addition to the 
required general and orthopedic or surgical examinations. When complete 
examinations are not conducted covering all systems of the body affected 
by disease or injury, it is impossible to visualize the nature and 
extent of the service connected disability. Incomplete examination is a 
common cause of incorrect diagnosis, especially in the neurological and 
psychiatric fields, and frequently leaves the Department of Veterans 
Affairs in doubt as to the presence or absence of disabling conditions 
at the time of the examination.


<R05>
Sec. 4.43  Osteomyelitis.

    Chronic, or recurring, suppurative osteomyelitis, once clinically 
identified, including chronic inflammation of bone marrow, cortex, or 
periosteum, should be considered as a continuously disabling process, 
whether or not an actively discharging sinus or other obvious evidence 
of infection is manifest from time to time, and unless the focus is 
entirely removed by amputation will entitle to a permanent rating to be 
combined with other ratings for residual conditions, however, not 
exceeding amputation ratings at the site of election.


<R05>
Sec. 4.44  The bones.

    The osseous abnormalities incident to trauma or disease, such as 
malunion with deformity throwing abnormal stress upon, and causing 
malalignment of joint surfaces, should be depicted from study and 
observation of all available data, beginning with inception of injury or 
disease, its nature, degree of prostration, treatment and duration of 
convalescence, and progress of recovery with development of permanent 
residuals. With shortening of a long bone, some degree of angulation is 
to be expected; the extent and direction should be brought out by X-ray 
and observation. The direction of angulation and extent of deformity 
should be carefully related to strain on the neighboring joints, 
especially those connected with weight-bearing.


<R05>
Sec. 4.45  The joints.

    As regards the joints the factors of disability reside in reductions 
of their normal excursion of movements in different planes. Inquiry will 
be directed to these considerations:
    (a) Less movement than normal (due to ankylosis, limitation or 
blocking, adhesions, tendon-tie-up, contracted scars, etc.).
    (b) More movement than normal (from flail joint, resections, 
nonunion

[[Page 375]]

of fracture, relaxation of ligaments, etc.).
    (c) Weakened movement (due to muscle injury, disease or injury of 
peripheral nerves, divided or lengthened tendons, etc.).
    (d) Excess fatigability.
    (e) Incoordination, impaired ability to execute skilled movements 
smoothly.
    (f) Pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse. 
Instability of station, disturbance of locomotion, interference with 
sitting, standing and weight-bearing are related considerations. For the 
purpose of rating disability from arthritis, the shoulder, elbow, wrist, 
hip, knee, and ankle are considered major joints; multiple involvements 
of the interphalangeal, metacarpal and carpal joints of the upper 
extremities, the interphalangeal, metatarsal and tarsal joints of the 
lower extremities, the cervical vertebrae, the dorsal vertebrae, and the 
lumbar vertebrae, are considered groups of minor joints, ratable on a 
parity with major joints. The lumbosacral articulation and both 
sacroiliac joints are considered to be a group of minor joints, ratable 
on disturbance of lumbar spine functions.


<R05>
Sec. 4.46  Accurate measurement.

    Accurate measurement of the length of stumps, excursion of joints, 
dimensions and location of scars with respect to landmarks, should be 
insisted on. The use of a goniometer in the measurement of limitation of 
motion is indispensable in examinations conducted within the Department 
of Veterans Affairs. Muscle atrophy must also be accurately measured and 
reported.

<R05>
Sec. 4.55  Principles of combined ratings for muscle injuries.

    (a) A muscle injury rating will not be combined with a peripheral 
nerve paralysis rating of the same body part, unless the injuries affect 
entirely different functions.
    (b) For rating purposes, the skeletal muscles of the body are 
divided into 23 muscle groups in 5 anatomical regions: 6 muscle groups 
for the shoulder girdle and arm (diagnostic codes 5301 through 5306); 3 
muscle groups for the forearm and hand (diagnostic codes 5307 through 
5309); 3 muscle groups for the foot and leg (diagnostic codes 5310 
through 5312); 6 muscle groups for the pelvic girdle and thigh 
(diagnostic codes 5313 through 5318); and 5 muscle groups for the torso 
and neck (diagnostic codes 5319 through 5323).
    (c) There will be no rating assigned for muscle groups which act 
upon an ankylosed joint, with the following exceptions:
    (1) In the case of an ankylosed knee, if muscle group XIII is 
disabled, it will be rated, but at the next lower level than that which 
would otherwise be assigned.
    (2) In the case of an ankylosed shoulder, if muscle groups I and II 
are severely disabled, the evaluation of the shoulder joint under 
diagnostic code 5200 will be elevated to the level for unfavorable 
ankylosis, if not already assigned, but the muscle groups themselves 
will not be rated.
    (d) The combined evaluation of muscle groups acting upon a single 
unankylosed joint must be lower than the evaluation for unfavorable 
ankylosis of that joint, except in the case of muscle groups I and II 
acting upon the shoulder.
    (e) For compensable muscle group injuries which are in the same 
anatomical region but do not act on the same joint, the evaluation for 
the most severely injured muscle group will be increased by one level 
and used as the combined evaluation for the affected muscle groups.
    (f) For muscle group injuries in different anatomical regions which 
do not act upon ankylosed joints, each muscle group injury shall be 
separately rated and the ratings combined under the provisions of Sec. 
4.25.

<R05>
Sec. 4.56  Evaluation of muscle disabilities.

    (a) An open comminuted fracture with muscle or tendon damage will be 
rated as a severe injury of the muscle group involved unless, for 
locations such as in the wrist or over the tibia,

[[Page 376]]

evidence establishes that the muscle damage is minimal.
    (b) A through-and-through injury with muscle damage shall be 
evaluated as no less than a moderate injury for each group of muscles 
damaged.
    (c) For VA rating purposes, the cardinal signs and symptoms of 
muscle disability are loss of power, weakness, lowered threshold of 
fatigue, fatigue-pain, impairment of coordination and uncertainty of 
movement.
    (d) Under diagnostic codes 5301 through 5323, disabilities resulting 
from muscle injuries shall be classified as slight, moderate, moderately 
severe or severe as follows:
    (1) Slight disability of muscles--(i) Type of injury. Simple wound 
of muscle without debridement or infection.
    (ii) History and complaint. Service department record of superficial 
wound with brief treatment and return to duty. Healing with good 
functional results. No cardinal signs or symptoms of muscle disability 
as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (iii) Objective findings. Minimal scar. No evidence of fascial 
defect, atrophy, or impaired tonus. No impairment of function or 
metallic fragments retained in muscle tissue.
    (2) Moderate disability of muscles--(i) Type of injury. Through and 
through or deep penetrating wound of short track from a single bullet, 
small shell or shrapnel fragment, without explosive effect of high 
velocity missile, residuals of debridement, or prolonged infection.
    (ii) History and complaint. Service department record or other 
evidence of in-service treatment for the wound. Record of consistent 
complaint of one or more of the cardinal signs and symptoms of muscle 
disability as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, particularly 
lowered threshold of fatigue after average use, affecting the particular 
functions controlled by the injured muscles.
    (iii) Objective findings. Entrance and (if present) exit scars, 
small or linear, indicating short track of missile through muscle 
tissue. Some loss of deep fascia or muscle substance or impairment of 
muscle tonus and loss of power or lowered threshold of fatigue when 
compared to the sound side.
    (3) Moderately severe disability of muscles--(i) Type of injury. 
Through and through or deep penetrating wound by small high velocity 
missile or large low-velocity missile, with debridement, prolonged 
infection, or sloughing of soft parts, and intermuscular scarring.
    (ii) History and complaint. Service department record or other 
evidence showing hospitalization for a prolonged period for treatment of 
wound. Record of consistent complaint of cardinal signs and symptoms of 
muscle disability as defined in paragraph (c) of this section and, if 
present, evidence of inability to keep up with work requirements.
    (iii) Objective findings. Entrance and (if present) exit scars 
indicating track of missile through one or more muscle groups. 
Indications on palpation of loss of deep fascia, muscle substance, or 
normal firm resistance of muscles compared with sound side. Tests of 
strength and endurance compared with sound side demonstrate positive 
evidence of impairment.
    (4) Severe disability of muscles--(i) Type of injury. Through and 
through or deep penetrating wound due to high-velocity missile, or large 
or multiple low velocity missiles, or with shattering bone fracture or 
open comminuted fracture with extensive debridement, prolonged 
infection, or sloughing of soft parts, intermuscular binding and 
scarring.
    (ii) History and complaint. Service department record or other 
evidence showing hospitalization for a prolonged period for treatment of 
wound. Record of consistent complaint of cardinal signs and symptoms of 
muscle disability as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, worse 
than those shown for moderately severe muscle injuries, and, if present, 
evidence of inability to keep up with work requirements.
    (iii) Objective findings. Ragged, depressed and adherent scars 
indicating wide damage to muscle groups in missile track. Palpation 
shows loss of deep fascia or muscle substance, or soft flabby muscles in 
wound area. Muscles swell and harden abnormally in contraction. Tests of 
strength, endurance, or coordinated movements compared with the 
corresponding muscles of the

[[Page 377]]

uninjured side indicate severe impairment of function. If present, the 
following are also signs of severe muscle disability:
    (A) X-ray evidence of minute multiple scattered foreign bodies 
indicating intermuscular trauma and explosive effect of the missile.
    (B) Adhesion of scar to one of the long bones, scapula, pelvic 
bones, sacrum or vertebrae, with epithelial sealing over the bone rather 
than true skin covering in an area where bone is normally protected by 
muscle.
    (C) Diminished muscle excitability to pulsed electrical current in 
electrodiagnostic tests.
    (D) Visible or measurable atrophy.
    (E) Adaptive contraction of an opposing group of muscles.
    (F) Atrophy of muscle groups not in the track of the missile, 
particularly of the trapezius and serratus in wounds of the shoulder 
girdle.
    (G) Induration or atrophy of an entire muscle following simple 
piercing by a projectile.

<R05>
Sec. 4.57  Static foot deformities.

    It is essential to make an initial distinction between bilateral 
flatfoot as a congenital or as an acquired condition. The congenital 
condition, with depression of the arch, but no evidence of abnormal 
callosities, areas of pressure, strain or demonstrable tenderness, is a 
congenital abnormality which is not compensable or pensionable. In the 
acquired condition, it is to be remembered that depression of the 
longitudinal arch, or the degree of depression, is not the essential 
feature. The attention should be given to anatomical changes, as 
compared to normal, in the relationship of the foot and leg, 
particularly to the inward rotation of the superior portion of the os 
calcis, medial deviation of the insertion of the Achilles tendon, the 
medial tilting of the upper border of the astragalus. This is an 
unfavorable mechanical relationship of the parts. A plumb line dropped 
from the middle of the patella falls inside of the normal point. The 
forepart of the foot is abducted, and the foot everted. The plantar 
surface of the foot is painful and shows demonstrable tenderness, and 
manipulation of the foot produces spasm of the Achilles tendon, peroneal 
spasm due to adhesion about the peroneal sheaths, and other evidence of 
pain and limited motion. The symptoms should be apparent without regard 
to exercise. In severe cases there is gaping of bones on the inner 
border of the foot, and rigid valgus position with loss of the power of 
inversion and adduction. Exercise with undeveloped or unbalanced 
musculature, producing chronic irritation, can be an aggravating factor. 
In the absence of trauma or other definite evidence of aggravation, 
service connection is not in order for pes cavus which is a typically 
congenital or juvenile disease.


<R05>
Sec. 4.58  Arthritis due to strain.

    With service incurred lower extremity amputation or shortening, a 
disabling arthritis, developing in the same extremity, or in both lower 
extremities, with indications of earlier, or more severe, arthritis in 
the injured extremity, including also arthritis of the lumbosacral 
joints and lumbar spine, if associated with the leg amputation or 
shortening, will be considered as service incurred, provided, however, 
that arthritis affecting joints not directly subject to strain as a 
result of the service incurred amputation will not be granted service 
connection. This will generally require separate evaluation of the 
arthritis in the joints directly subject to strain. Amputation, or 
injury to an upper extremity, is not considered as a causative factor 
with subsequently developing arthritis, except in joints subject to 
direct strain or actually injured.


<R05>
Sec. 4.59  Painful motion.

    With any form of arthritis, painful motion is an important factor of 
disability, the facial expression, wincing, etc., on pressure or 
manipulation, should be carefully noted and definitely related to 
affected joints. Muscle spasm will greatly assist the identification. 
Sciatic neuritis is not uncommonly caused by arthritis of the spine. The 
intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or 
periarticular pathology as productive

[[Page 378]]

of disability. It is the intention to recognize actually painful, 
unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at 
least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. Crepitation either 
in the soft tissues such as the tendons or ligaments, or crepitation 
within the joint structures should be noted carefully as points of 
contact which are diseased. Flexion elicits such manifestations. The 
joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive 
motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing and, if possible, with 
the range of the opposite undamaged joint.

Sec. 4.60  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 4.61  Examination.

    With any form of arthritis (except traumatic arthritis) it is 
essential that the examination for rating purposes cover all major 
joints, with especial reference to Heberden's or Haygarth's nodes.


<R05>
Sec. 4.62  Circulatory disturbances.

    The circulatory disturbances, especially of the lower extremity 
following injury in the popliteal space, must not be overlooked, and 
require rating generally as phlebitis.


<R05>
Sec. 4.63  Loss of use of hand or foot.

    Loss of use of a hand or a foot, for the purpose of special monthly 
compensation, will be held to exist when no effective function remains 
other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation 
stump at the site of election below elbow or knee with use of a suitable 
prosthetic appliance. The determination will be made on the basis of the 
actual remaining function of the hand or foot, whether the acts of 
grasping, manipulation, etc., in the case of the hand, or of balance and 
propulsion, etc., in the case of the foot, could be accomplished equally 
well by an amputation stump with prosthesis.
    (a) Extremely unfavorable complete ankylosis of the knee, or 
complete ankylosis of 2 major joints of an extremity, or shortening of 
the lower extremity of 3\1/2\ inches (8.9 cms.) or more, will be taken 
as loss of use of the hand or foot involved.
    (b) Complete paralysis of the external popliteal nerve (common 
peroneal) and consequent, footdrop, accompanied by characteristic 
organic changes including trophic and circulatory disturbances and other 
concomitants confirmatory of complete paralysis of this nerve, will be 
taken as loss of use of the foot.

<R05>
Sec. 4.64  Loss of use of both buttocks.

    Loss of use of both buttocks shall be deemed to exist when there is 
severe damage to muscle Group XVII, bilateral (diagnostic code number 
5317) and additional disability rendering it impossible for the disabled 
person, without assistance, to rise from a seated position and from a 
stooped position (fingers to toes position) and to maintain postural 
stability (the pelvis upon head of femur). The assistance may be 
rendered by the person's own hands or arms, and, in the matter of 
postural stability, by a special appliance.


<R05>
Sec. 4.65  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 4.66  Sacroiliac joint.

    The common cause of disability in this region is arthritis, to be 
identified in the usual manner. The lumbosacral and sacroiliac joints 
should be considered as one anatomical segment for rating purposes. X-
ray changes from arthritis in this location are decrease or obliteration 
of the joint space, with the appearance of increased bone density of the 
sacrum and ilium and sharpening of the margins of the joint. Disability 
is manifest from erector spinae spasm (not accounted for by other 
pathology), tenderness on deep palpation and percussion over these 
joints, loss of normal quickness of motion and resiliency, and postural 
defects often accompanied by limitation of flexion and extension of the 
hip. Traumatism is a rare cause of disability in this connection, except 
when superimposed upon congenital defect or upon an existent arthritis; 
to permit assumption of pure traumatic origin, objective evidence of 
damage to the joint, and history of trauma sufficiently severe to injure 
this extremely strong and practically immovable joint is required. There

[[Page 379]]

should be careful consideration of lumbosacral sprain, and the various 
symptoms of pain and paralysis attributable to disease affecting the 
lumbar vertebrae and the intervertebral disc.


<R05>
Sec. 4.67  Pelvic bones.

    The variability of residuals following these fractures necessitates 
rating on specific residuals, faulty posture, limitation of motion, 
muscle injury, painful motion of the lumbar spine, manifest by muscle 
spasm, mild to moderate sciatic neuritis, peripheral nerve injury, or 
limitation of hip motion.


<R05>
Sec. 4.68  Amputation rule.

    The combined rating for disabilities of an extremity shall not 
exceed the rating for the amputation at the elective level, were 
amputation to be performed. For example, the combined evaluations for 
disabilities below the knee shall not exceed the 40 percent evaluation, 
diagnostic code 5165. This 40 percent rating may be further combined 
with evaluation for disabilities above the knee but not to exceed the 
above the knee amputation elective level. Painful neuroma of a stump 
after amputation shall be assigned the evaluation for the elective site 
of reamputation.


<R05>
Sec. 4.69  Dominant hand.

    Handedness for the purpose of a dominant rating will be determined 
by the evidence of record, or by testing on VA examination. Only one 
hand shall be considered dominant. The injured hand, or the most 
severely injured hand, of an ambidextrous individual will be considered 
the dominant hand for rating purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 4.70  Inadequate examinations.

    If the report of examination is inadequate as a basis for the 
required consideration of service connection and evaluation, the rating 
agency may request a supplementary report from the examiner giving 
further details as to the limitations of the disabled person's ordinary 
activity imposed by the disease, injury, or residual condition, the 
prognosis for return to, or continuance of, useful work. When the best 
interests of the service will be advanced by personal conference with 
the examiner, such conference may be arranged through channels.


<R05>
Sec. 4.71  Measurement of ankylosis and joint motion.

    Plates I and II provide a standardized description of ankylosis and 
joint motion measurement. The anatomical position is considered as 
0[deg], with two major exceptions: (a) Shoulder rotation--arm abducted 
to 90[deg], elbow flexed to 90[deg] with the position of the forearm 
reflecting the midpoint 0[deg] between internal and external rotation of 
the shoulder; and (b) supination and pronation--the arm next to the 
body, elbow flexed to 90[deg], and the forearm in midposition 0[deg] 
between supination and pronation. Motion of the thumb and fingers should 
be described by appropriate reference to the joints (See Plate III) 
whose movement is limited, with a statement as to how near, in 
centimeters, the tip of the thumb can approximate the fingers, or how 
near the tips of the fingers can approximate the proximal transverse 
crease of palm.

5000 Osteomyelitis, acute, subacute, or chronic:
  Of the pelvis, vertebrae, or extending into major joints, or       100
   with multiple localization or with long history of
   intractability and debility, anemia, amyloid liver changes,
   or other continuous constitutional symptoms..................
  Frequent episodes, with constitutional symptoms...............      60

   within the past 5 years......................................
  Inactive, following repeated episodes, without evidence of          10
   active infection in past 5 years.............................
  Note (1): A rating of 10 percent, as an exception to the
   amputation rule, is to be assigned in any case of active
   osteomyelitis where the amputation rating for the affected
   part is no percent. This 10 percent rating and the other
   partial ratings of 30 percent or less are to be combined with
   ratings for ankylosis, limited motion, nonunion or malunion,
   shortening, etc., subject, of course, to the amputation rule.
   The 60 percent rating, as it is based on constitutional
   symptoms, is not subject to the amputation rule. A rating for
   osteomyelitis will not be applied following cure by removal
   or radical resection of the affected bone.

[[Page 382]]

 
  Note (2): The 20 percent rating on the basis of activity
   within the past 5 years is not assignable following the
   initial infection of active osteomyelitis with no subsequent
   reactivation. The prerequisite for this historical rating is
   an established recurrent osteomyelitis. To qualify for the 10
   percent rating, 2 or more episodes following the initial
   infection are required. This 20 percent rating or the 10
   percent rating, when applicable, will be assigned once only
   to cover disability at all sites of previously active
   infection with a future ending date in the case of the 20
   percent rating.

  Active........................................................     100
  Inactive: See Sec. Sec.  4.88b and 4.89.....................  ......
5002 Arthritis rheumatoid (atrophic) As an active process:
  With constitutional manifestations associated with active          100
   joint involvement, totally incapacitating....................
  Less than criteria for 100% but with weight loss and anemia         60

   or a lesser number over prolonged periods....................
  Symptom combinations productive of definite impairment of           40
   health objectively supported by examination findings or
   incapacitating exacerbations occurring 3 or more times a year
  One or two exacerbations a year in a well-established               20
   diagnosis....................................................
For chronic residuals:
  For residuals such as limitation of motion or ankylosis,
   favorable or unfavorable, rate under the appropriate
   diagnostic codes for the specific joints involved. Where,
   however, the limitation of motion of the specific joint or
   joints involved is noncompensable under the codes a rating of
   10 percent is for application for each such major joint or
   group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to be
   combined, not added under diagnostic code 5002. Limitation of
   motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as
   swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful
   motion.
  Note: The ratings for the active process will not be combined
   with the residual ratings for limitation of motion or
   ankylosis. Assign the higher evaluation.
5003 Arthritis, degenerative (hypertrophic or osteoarthritis):
  Degenerative arthritis established by X-ray findings will be
   rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the
   appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints
   involved (DC 5200 etc.). When however, the limitation of
   motion of the specific joint or joints involved is
   noncompensable under the appropriate diagnostic codes, a
   rating of 10 pct is for application for each such major joint
   or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to
   be combined, not added under diagnostic code 5003. Limitation
   of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as
   swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful
   motion. In the absence of limitation of motion, rate as
   below:
    With X-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints      20
     or 2 or more minor joint groups, with occasional
     incapacitating exacerbations...............................
    With X-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints      10
     or 2 or more minor joint groups............................
  Note (1): The 20 pct and 10 pct ratings based on X-ray
   findings, above, will not be combined with ratings based on
   limitation of motion.
  Note (2): The 20 pct and 10 pct ratings based on X-ray
   findings, above, will not be utilized in rating conditions
   listed under diagnostic codes 5013 to 5024, inclusive.
5004 Arthritis, gonorrheal.
5005 Arthritis, pneumococcic.
5006 Arthritis, typhoid.
5007 Arthritis, syphilitic.
5008 Arthritis, streptococcic.
5009 Arthritis, other types (specify).
  With the types of arthritis, diagnostic codes 5004 through
   5009, rate the disability as rheumatoid arthritis.
5010 Arthritis, due to trauma, substantiated by X-ray findings:
 Rate as arthritis, degenerative.
5011 Bones, caisson disease of: Rate as arthritis, cord
 involvement, or deafness, depending on the severity of
 disabling manifestations.
5012 Bones, new growths of, malignant                                100
  Note: The 100 percent rating will be continued for 1 year
   following the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic
   chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure. At this point,
   if there has been no local recurrence or metastases, the
   rating will be made on residuals.
5013 Osteoporosis, with joint manifestations.
5014 Osteomalacia.
5015 Bones, new growths of, benign.
5016 Osteitis deformans.
5017 Gout.
5018 Hydrarthrosis, intermittent.

5021 Myositis.
5022 Periostitis.
5023 Myositis ossificans.
5024 Tenosynovitis.
  The diseases under diagnostic codes 5013 through 5024 will be
   rated on limitation of motion of affected parts, as
   arthritis, degenerative, except gout which will be rated
   under diagnostic code 5002.
5025 Fibromyalgia (fibrositis, primary fibromyalgia syndrome)
  With widespread musculoskeletal pain and tender points, with
   or without associated fatigue, sleep disturbance, stiffness,
   paresthesias, headache, irritable bowel symptoms, depression,
   anxiety, or Raynaud's-like symptoms:
    That are constant, or nearly so, and refractory to therapy..      40
    That are episodic, with exacerbations often precipitated by       20
     environmental or emotional stress or by overexertion, but
     that are present more than one-third of the time...........
    That require continuous medication for control..............      10

  Note: Widespread pain means pain in both the left and right
   sides of the body, that is both above and below the waist,
   and that affects both the axial skeleton (i.e., cervical
   spine, anterior chest, thoracic spine, or low back) and the
   extremities.

(1) For the index, long, ring, and little fingers         ......  ......
 (digits II, III, IV, and V), zero degrees of flexion
 represents the fingers fully extended, making a
 straight line with the rest of the hand. The position
 of function of the hand is with the wrist dorsiflexed
 20 to 30 degrees, the metacarpophalangeal and proximal
 interphalangeal joints flexed to 30 degrees, and the
 thumb (digit I) abducted and rotated so that the thumb
 pad faces the finger pads. Only joints in these
 positions are considered to be in favorable position.
 For digits II through V, the metacarpophalangeal joint
 has a range of zero to 90 degrees of flexion, the
 proximal interphalangeal joint has a range of zero to
 100 degrees of flexion, and the distal (terminal)
 interphalangeal joint has a range of zero to 70 or 80
 degrees of flexion.....................................

     evaluate as unfavorable ankylosis, even if each
     joint is individually fixed in a favorable position
    (iii) If only the metacarpophalangeal or proximal     ......  ......
     interphalangeal joint is ankylosed, and there is a
     gap of more than two inches (5.1 cm.) between the

         60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, forward
         flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees

         in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or,
         vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more
         of the height..........................................
Note (1): Evaluate any associated objective neurologic
 abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder
 impairment, separately, under an appropriate diagnostic code.
Note (2): (See also Plate V.) For VA compensation purposes,
 normal forward flexion of the cervical spine is zero to 45
 degrees, extension is zero to 45 degrees, left and right
 lateral flexion are zero to 45 degrees, and left and right
 lateral rotation are zero to 80 degrees. Normal forward flexion
 of the thoracolumbar spine is zero to 90 degrees, extension is
 zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to
 30 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 30
 degrees. The combined range of motion refers to the sum of the
 range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral
 flexion, and left and right rotation. The normal combined range
 of motion of the cervical spine is 340 degrees and of the
 thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees. The normal ranges of motion
 for each component of spinal motion provided in this note are
 the maximum that can be used for calculation of the combined
 range of motion.
Note (3): In exceptional cases, an examiner may state that
 because of age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other
 factors not the result of disease or injury of the spine, the
 range of motion of the spine in a particular individual should
 be considered normal for that individual, even though it does
 not conform to the normal range of motion stated in Note (2).
 Provided that the examiner supplies an explanation, the
 examiner's assessment that the range of motion is normal for
 that individual will be accepted.
Note (4): Round each range of motion measurement to the nearest
 five degrees.
Note (5): For VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is
 a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire
 thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or
 extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the
 following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of
 vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing
 limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms
 due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or
 dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation;
 or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. Fixation
 of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always
 represents favorable ankylosis.
Note (6): Separately evaluate disability of the thoracolumbar
 and cervical spine segments, except when there is unfavorable
 ankylosis of both segments, which will be rated as a single
 disability.

 Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating
 Episodes, whichever method results in the higher evaluation
 when all disabilities are combined under Sec.  4.25.
 

[[Page 393]]

 
    Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on
                     Incapacitating Episodes
 
With incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least      60
 6 weeks during the past 12 months..............................
With incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least      40
 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months........
With incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least      20
 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months........
With incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least      10
 one week but less than 2 weeks during the past 12 months.......
Note (1): For purposes of evaluations under diagnostic code
 5243, an incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs and
 symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires bed
 rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.
Note (2): If intervertebral disc syndrome is present in more
 than one spinal segment, provided that the effects in each
 spinal segment are clearly distinct, evaluate each segment on
 the basis of incapacitating episodes or under the General
 Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine,
 whichever method results in a higher evaluation for that
 segment.

Sec. 4.75  Examination of visual acuity.

    Ratings on account of visual impairments considered for service 
connection are, when practicable, to be based only on examination by 
specialists. Such special examinations should include uncorrected and 
corrected central visual acuity for distance and near, with record of 
the refraction. Snellen's test type or its equivalent will be used. 
Mydriatics should be routine, except when contraindicated. Funduscopic 
and ophthalmological findings must be recorded. The best distant vision 
obtainable after best correction by glasses will be the basis of rating, 
except in cases of keratoconus in which contact lenses are medically 
required. Also, if there exists a difference of more than 4 diopters of 
spherical correction between the two eyes, the best possible visual 
acuity of the poorer eye without glasses, or with a lens of not more 
than 4 diopters difference from that used with the better eye will be 
taken as the visual acuity of the poorer eye. When such a difference 
exists, close attention will be given to the likelihood of congenital 
origin in mere refractive error.

Sec. 4.76  Examination of field vision.

    Measurement of the visual field will be made when there is disease 
of the optic nerve or when otherwise indicated. The usual perimetric 
methods will be employed, using a standard perimeter and 3 mm. white 
test object. At least 16 meridians 22\1/2\ degrees apart will be charted 
for each eye. (See Figure 1. For the 8 principal meridians, see table 
III.) The charts will be made a part of the report of examination. Not 
less than 2 recordings, and when possible, 3 will be made. The minimum 
limit for this function is established as a concentric central 
contraction of the visual field to 5[deg]. This type of contraction of 
the visual field reduces the visual efficiency to zero. Where available 
the examination for form field should be supplemented, when indicated, 
by the use of tangent screen or campimeter. This last test is especially 
valuable in detection of scotoma.

Sec. 4.76a  Computation of average concentric contraction of visual fields.

    The extent of contraction of visual field in each eye is determined 
by recording the extent of the remaining visual fields in each of the 
eight 45 degree principal meridians. The number

[[Page 400]]

of degrees lost is determined at each meridian by subtracting the 
remaining degrees from the normal visual fields given in table III. The 
degrees lost are then added together to determine total degrees lost. 
This is subtracted from 500. The difference represents the total 
remaining degrees of visual field. The difference divided by eight 
represents the average contraction for rating purposes.

Sec. 4.77  Examination of muscle function.

    The measurement of muscle function will be undertaken only when the 
history and findings reflect disease or injury of the extrinsic muscles 
of the eye, or of the motor nerves supplying these muscles. The 
measurement will be performed using a Goldmann Perimeter Chart as in 
Figure 2 below. The chart identifies four major quadrants, (upward, 
downward, and two lateral) plus a central field (20[deg] or less). The 
examiner will chart the areas in which diplopia exists, and such plotted 
chart will be made a part of the examination report. Muscle function is 
considered normal (20/40) when diplopia does not exist within 40[deg] in 
the lateral or downward quadrants, or within 30[deg] in the upward 
quadrant. Impairment of muscle function is to be supported in each 
instance by record of actual appropriate pathology. Diplopia which is 
only occasional or correctable is not considered a disability.

Sec. 4.78  Computing aggravation.

    In determining the effect of aggravation of visual disability, even 
though the visual impairment of only one eye is service connected, 
evaluate the vision of both eyes, before and after suffering the 
aggravation, and subtract the former evaluation from the latter except 
when the bilateral vision amounts to total disability. In the event of 
subsequent increase in the disability of either eye, due to intercurrent 
disease or injury not associated with the service, the condition of the 
eyes before suffering the subsequent increase will be taken as the basis 
of compensation subject to the provisions of Sec. 3.383(a) of this 
chapter.

Sec. 4.79  Loss of use of one eye, having only light perception.

    Loss of use or blindness of one eye, having only light perception, 
will be held to exist when there is inability to recognize test letters 
at 1 foot (.30m.) and when further examination of the eyes reveals that 
perception of objects, hand movements or counting fingers cannot be 
accomplished at 3 feet (.91m.), lesser extents of visions, particularly 
perception of objects, hand movements, or counting fingers at distances 
less than 3 feet (.91 m.), being considered of negligible utility. With 
visual acuity 5/200 (1.5/60) or less or the visual field reduced to 
5[deg] concentric contraction, in either event in both eyes, the 
question of entitlement on account of regular aid and attendance will be 
determined on the facts in the individual case.

rated as reading at this latter step or distance. That is, a person who

rated as seeing at 20/100 (6/30).

example, if one eye has a Snellen index of 5/200 (1.5/60) and the other

  Note (1): Correct diagnosis reflecting disease or injury
   should be cited..............................................
  Note (2): Demonstrable pathology commensurate with the
   functional loss will be required. The concentric contraction
   ratings require contraction within the stated degrees,
   temporally; the nasal contraction may be less. The
   alternative ratings are to be employed when there is ratable
   defect of visual acuity, or a different impairment of the
   visual field in the other eye. Concentric contraction
   resulting from demonstrable pathology to 5 degrees or less
   will be considered on a parity with reduction of central
   visual acuity to 5/200 (1.5/60) or less for all purposes
   including entitlement under Sec.  3.350(b)(2) of this
   chapter; not however, for the purpose of Sec.  3.350(a) of
   this chapter. Entitlement on account of blindness requiring
   regular aid and attendance, Sec.  3.350(c) of this chapter,

                      Impairment of Auditory Acuity


<R05>
Sec. 4.85  Evaluation of hearing impairment.

    (a) An examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be 
conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled 
speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometry 
test. Examinations will be conducted without the use of hearing aids.
    (b) Table VI, ``Numeric Designation of Hearing Impairment Based on 
Puretone Threshold Average and Speech Discrimination,'' is used to 
determine a Roman numeral designation (I through XI) for hearing 
impairment based on a combination of the percent of speech 
discrimination (horizontal rows) and the puretone threshold average 
(vertical columns). The Roman numeral designation is located at the 
point where the percentage of speech discrimination and puretone 
threshold average intersect.
    (c) Table VIa, ``Numeric Designation of Hearing Impairment Based 
Only on Puretone Threshold Average,'' is used to determine a Roman 
numeral designation (I through XI) for hearing impairment based only on 
the puretone threshold average. Table VIa will be used when the examiner 
certifies that use of the speech discrimination test is not appropriate 
because of language difficulties, inconsistent speech discrimination 
scores, etc., or when indicated under the provisions of Sec. 4.86.
    (d) ``Puretone threshold average,'' as used in Tables VI and VIa, is 
the sum of the puretone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hertz, 
divided by four. This average is used in all cases (including those in 
Sec. 4.86) to determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing 
impairment from Table VI or VIa.
    (e) Table VII, ``Percentage Evaluations for Hearing Impairment,'' is 
used to determine the percentage evaluation by combining the Roman 
numeral designations for hearing impairment of each ear. The horizontal 
rows represent the ear having the better hearing and the vertical 
columns the ear having the poorer hearing. The percentage evaluation is 
located at the point where the row and column intersect.
    (f) If impaired hearing is service-connected in only one ear, in 
order to determine the percentage evaluation from Table VII, the non-
service-connected ear will be assigned a Roman Numeral designation for 
hearing impairment of I, subject to the provisions of Sec. 3.383 of 
this chapter.
    (g) When evaluating any claim for impaired hearing, refer to Sec. 
3.350 of this chapter to determine whether the veteran may be entitled 
to special monthly compensation due either to deafness, or to deafness 
in combination with other specified disabilities.
    (h) Numeric tables VI, VIA*, and VII.

Sec. 4.86  Exceptional patterns of hearing impairment.

    (a) When the puretone threshold at each of the four specified 
frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more, 
the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for 
hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results 
in the higher numeral. Each ear will be evaluated separately.
    (b) When the puretone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 
Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will 
determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from 
either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral. 
That numeral will then be elevated to the next higher

    Public Law 90-493 repealed section 356 of title 38, United States 
Code which provided graduated ratings for inactive tuberculosis. The 
repealed section, however, still applies to the case of any veteran who 
on August 19, 1968, was receiving or entitled to receive compensation 
for tuberculosis. The use of the protective provisions of Pub. L. 90-493

Following the total rating for the 2-year period after date of
 inactivity, the schedular evaluation for residuals of
 nonpulmonary tuberculosis, i.e., ankylosis, surgical removal of
 a part, etc., if in excess of 50 percent or 30 percent will be
 assigned under the appropriate diagnostic code for the specific
 residual preceded by the diagnostic code for tuberculosis of
 the body part affected. For example, tuberculosis of the
 hipjoint with residual ankylosis would be coded 5001-5250.
The graduated ratings for nonpulmonary tuberculosis will not be
 combined with residuals of nonpulmonary tuberculosis unless the
 graduated rating and the rating for residual disability cover
 separate functional losses, e.g., graduated ratings for
 tuberculosis of the kidney and residuals of tuberculosis of the
 spine. Where there are existing pulmonary and nonpulmonary
 conditions, the graduated evaluation for the pulmonary, or for
 the nonpulmonary, condition will be utilized, combined with
 evaluations for residuals of the condition not covered by the
 graduated evaluation utilized, so as to provide the higher
 evaluation over such period.
The ending dates of all graduated ratings of nonpulmonary
 tuberculosis will be controlled by the date of attainment of
 inactivity.
These ratings are applicable only to veterans with nonpulmonary
 tuberculosis active on or after October 10, 1949.

Sec. 4.96  Special provisions regarding evaluation of respiratory conditions.

    (a) Rating coexisting respiratory conditions. Ratings under 
diagnostic codes 6600 through 6817 and 6822 through 6847 will not be 
combined with each other. Where there is lung or pleural involvement, 
ratings under diagnostic codes 6819 and 6820 will not be combined with 
each other or with diagnostic codes 6600 through 6817 or 6822 through 
6847. A single rating will be assigned under the diagnostic code which 
reflects the predominant disability with elevation to the next higher 
evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such 
elevation. However, in cases protected by the provisions of Pub. L. 90-
493, the graduated ratings of 50 and 30 percent for inactive 
tuberculosis will not be elevated.
    (b) Rating ``protected'' tuberculosis cases. Public Law 90-493 
repealed section 356 of title 38, United States Code which had provided 
graduated ratings for inactive tuberculosis. The repealed

[[Page 415]]

section, however, still applies to the case of any veteran who on August 
19, 1968, was receiving or entitled to receive compensation for 
tuberculosis. The use of the protective provisions of Pub. L. 90-493 
should be mentioned in the discussion portion of all ratings in which 
these provisions are applied. For application in rating cases in which 
the protective provisions of Pub. L. 90-493 apply the former evaluations 
pertaining to pulmonary tuberculosis are retained in Sec. 4.97.
    (c) Special monthly compensation. When evaluating any claim 
involving complete organic aphonia, refer to Sec. 3.350 of this chapter 
to determine whether the veteran may be entitled to special monthly 
compensation. Footnotes in the schedule indicate conditions which 
potentially establish entitlement to special monthly compensation; 
however, there are other conditions in this section which under certain 
circumstances also establish entitlement to special monthly 
compensation.
    (d) Special provisions for the application of evaluation criteria 
for diagnostic codes 6600, 6603, 6604, 6825-6833, and 6840-6845.
    (1) Pulmonary function tests (PFT's) are required to evaluate these 
conditions except:
    (i) When the results of a maximum exercise capacity test are of 
record and are 20 ml/kg/min or less. If a maximum exercise capacity test 
is not of record, evaluate based on alternative criteria.
    (ii) When pulmonary hypertension (documented by an echocardiogram or 
cardiac catheterization), cor pulmonale, or right ventricular 
hypertrophy has been diagnosed.
    (iii) When there have been one or more episodes of acute respiratory 
failure.
    (iv) When outpatient oxygen therapy is required.
    (2) If the DLCO (SB) (Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon 
Monoxide by the Single Breath Method) test is not of record, evaluate 
based on alternative criteria as long as the examiner states why the 
test would not be useful or valid in a particular case.
    (3) When the PFT's are not consistent with clinical findings, 
evaluate based on the PFT's unless the examiner states why they are not 
a valid indication of respiratory functional impairment in a particular 
case.
    (4) Post-bronchodilator studies are required when PFT's are done for 
disability evaluation purposes except when the results of pre-
bronchodilator pulmonary function tests are normal or when the examiner 
determines that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done and 
states why.
    (5) When evaluating based on PFT's, use post-bronchodilator results 
in applying the evaluation criteria in the rating schedule unless the 
post-bronchodilator results were poorer than the pre-bronchodilator 
results. In those cases, use the pre-bronchodilator values for rating 
purposes.
    (6) When there is a disparity between the results of different PFT's 
(FEV-1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second), FVC (Forced Vital 
Capacity), etc.), so that the level of evaluation would differ depending 
on which test result is used, use the test result that the examiner 
states most accurately reflects the level of disability.
    (7) If the FEV-1 and the FVC are both greater than 100 percent, do 
not assign a compensable evaluation based on a decreased FEV-1/FVC 
ratio.

Note (1): The 100-percent rating under codes 6701 through 6724
 is not subject to a requirement of precedent hospital
 treatment. It will be reduced to 50 percent for failure to
 submit to examination or to follow prescribed treatment upon
 report to that effect from the medical authorities. When a
 veteran is placed on the 100-percent rating for inactive
 tuberculosis, the medical authorities will be appropriately
 notified of the fact, and of the necessity, as given in
 footnote 1 to 38 U.S.C. 1156 (and formerly in 38 U.S.C. 356,
 which has been repealed by Public Law 90-493), to notify the
 Veterans Service Center in the event of failure to submit to
 examination or to follow treatment.
Note (2): The graduated 50-percent and 30-percent ratings and
 the permanent 30 percent and 20 percent ratings for inactive
 pulmonary tuberculosis are not to be combined with ratings for
 other respiratory disabilities. Following thoracoplasty the
 rating will be for removal of ribs combined with the rating
 for collapsed lung. Resection of the ribs incident to
 thoracoplasty will be rated as removal.

    Note: Evaluate other residuals following pulmonary embolism
     under the most appropriate diagnostic code, such as
     chronic bronchitis (DC 6600) or chronic pleural effusion
     or fibrosis (DC 6844), but do not combine that evaluation
     with any of the above evaluations.
 
    6819 Neoplasms, malignant, any specified part of                 100
     respiratory system exclusive of skin growths..............
 
    Note: A rating of 100 percent shall continue beyond the
     cessation of any surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic
     chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure. Six months
     after discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate
     disability rating shall be determined by mandatory VA
     examination. Any change in evaluation based upon that or
     any subsequent examination shall be subject to the
     provisions of Sec.  3.105(e) of this chapter. If there
     has been no local recurrence or metastasis, rate on
     residuals.

    Note: Coccidioidomycosis has an incubation period up to 21
     days, and the disseminated phase is ordinarily manifest
     within six months of the primary phase. However, there are
     instances of dissemination delayed up to many years after
     the initial infection which may have been unrecognized.
     Accordingly, when service connection is under
     consideration in the absence of record or other evidence
     of the disease in service, service in southwestern United
     States where the disease is endemic and absence of
     prolonged residence in this locality before or after
     service will be the deciding factor.

<R05>
Sec. 4.100  Application of the evaluation criteria for diagnostic codes 7000-7007, 7011, and 7015-7020.

    (a) Whether or not cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation (documented by 
electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray) is present and whether or 
not there is a need for continuous medication must be ascertained in all 
cases.
    (b) Even if the requirement for a 10% (based on the need for 
continuous medication) or 30% (based on the presence of cardiac 
hypertrophy or dilatation) evaluation is met, METs testing is required 
in all cases except:
    (1) When there is a medical contraindication.
    (2) When the left ventricular ejection fraction has been measured 
and is 50% or less.
    (3) When chronic congestive heart failure is present or there has 
been more than one episode of congestive heart failure within the past 
year.
    (4) When a 100% evaluation can be assigned on another basis.
    (c) If left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) testing is not of 
record, evaluate based on the alternative criteria unless the examiner 
states that the LVEF test is needed in a particular case because the 
available medical information does not sufficiently reflect the severity 
of the veteran's cardiovascular disability.

Note (1): Evaluate cor pulmonale, which is a form of secondary
 heart disease, as part of the pulmonary condition that causes
 it.
Note (2): One MET (metabolic equivalent) is the energy cost of
 standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5
 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. When the
 level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or
 syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory
 determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for
 medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the
 level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific
 examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that
 results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may
 be used.

 of less than 90mm.
Note (2): Evaluate hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or
 hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type,
 as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate
 evaluation.
Note (3): Evaluate hypertension separately from hypertensive
 heart disease and other types of heart disease.

<R05>
Sec. 4.110  Ulcers.

    Experience has shown that the term ``peptic ulcer'' is not 
sufficiently specific for rating purposes. Manifest differences in 
ulcers of the stomach or duodenum in comparison with those at an 
anastomotic stoma are sufficiently recognized as to warrant two separate 
graduated descriptions. In evaluating the ulcer, care should be taken 
that the findings adequately identify the particular location.


<R05>
Sec. 4.111  Postgastrectomy syndromes.

    There are various postgastrectomy symptoms which may occur following 
anastomotic operations of the stomach. When present, those occurring 
during or immediately after eating and known as the ``dumping syndrome'' 
are characterized by gastrointestinal complaints and generalized 
symptoms simulating hypoglycemia; those occurring from 1 to 3 hours 
after eating usually present definite manifestations of hypoglycemia.


<R05>
Sec. 4.112  Weight loss.

    For purposes of evaluating conditions in Sec. 4.114, the term 
``substantial weight loss'' means a loss of greater than 20 percent of 
the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer; 
and the term ``minor weight loss'' means a weight loss of 10 to 20 
percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months 
or longer. The term ``inability to gain weight'' means that there has 
been substantial weight loss with inability to regain it despite 
appropriate therapy. ``Baseline weight'' means the average weight for 
the two-year-period preceding onset of the disease.

Sec. 4.113  Coexisting abdominal conditions.

    There are diseases of the digestive system, particularly within the 
abdomen, which, while differing in the site of pathology, produce a 
common disability picture characterized in the main by varying degrees 
of abdominal

[[Page 427]]

distress or pain, anemia and disturbances in nutrition. Consequently, 
certain coexisting diseases in this area, as indicated in the 
instruction under the title ``Diseases of the Digestive System,'' do not 
lend themselves to distinct and separate disability evaluations without 
violating the fundamental principle relating to pyramiding as outlined 
in Sec. 4.14.


<R05>
Sec. 4.114  Schedule of ratings--digestive system.

    Ratings under diagnostic codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, 
and 7345 to 7348 inclusive will not be combined with each other. A 
single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which 
reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next 
higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants 
such elevation.

Sec. 4.115  Nephritis.

    Albuminuria alone is not nephritis, nor will the presence of 
transient albumin and casts following acute febrile illness be taken as 
nephritis. The glomerular type of nephritis is usually preceded by or 
associated with severe infectious disease; the onset is sudden, and the 
course marked by red blood cells, salt retention, and edema; it may 
clear up entirely or progress to a chronic condition. The 
nephrosclerotic type, originating in hypertension or arteriosclerosis, 
develops slowly, with minimum laboratory findings, and is associated 
with natural progress. Separate ratings are not to be assigned for 
disability from disease of the heart and any form of nephritis, on 
account of the close interrelationships of cardiovascular disabilities. 
If, however, absence of a kidney is the sole renal disability, even if 
removal was required because of nephritis, the absent kidney and any 
hypertension or heart disease will be separately rated. Also, in the 
event that chronic renal disease has progressed to the point where 
regular dialysis is required, any coexisting hypertension or heart 
disease will be separately rated.

Sec. 4.115a  Ratings of the genitourinary system--dysfunctions.

    Diseases of the genitourinary system generally result in 
disabilities related

[[Page 431]]

to renal or voiding dysfunctions, infections, or a combination of these. 
The following section provides descriptions of various levels of 
disability in each of these symptom areas. Where diagnostic codes refer 
the decisionmaker to these specific areas dysfunction, only the 
predominant area of dysfunction shall be considered for rating purposes. 
Since the areas of dysfunction described below do not cover all symptoms 
resulting from genitourinary diseases, specific diagnoses may include a 
description of symptoms assigned to that diagnosis.

  One or two crises during the past year, or; two to four             20
   episodes during the past year, or; weakness and fatigability,
   or; corticosteroid therapy required for control..............
  Note (1): An Addisonian ``crisis'' consists of the rapid onset
   of peripheral vascular collapse (with acute hypotension and
   shock), with findings that may include: anorexia; nausea;
   vomiting; dehydration; profound weakness; pain in abdomen,
   legs, and back; fever; apathy, and depressed mentation with
   possible progression to coma, renal shutdown, and death.
  Note (2): An Addisonian ``episode,'' for VA purposes, is a
   less acute and less severe event than an Addisonian crisis
   and may consist of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
   dehydration, weakness, malaise, orthostatic hypotension, or
   hypoglycemia, but no peripheral vascular collapse.
  Note (3): Tuberculous Addison's disease will be evaluated as
   active or inactive tuberculosis. If inactive, these
   evaluations are not to be combined with the graduated ratings
   of 50 percent or 30 percent for non-pulmonary tuberculosis
   specified under Sec.  4.88b. Assign the higher rating.
7912 Pluriglandular syndrome
  Evaluate according to major manifestations.
7913 Diabetes mellitus
  Requiring more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted     100
   diet, and regulation of activities (avoidance of strenuous
   occupational and recreational activities) with episodes of

   activities...................................................
  Requiring insulin and restricted diet, or; oral hypoglycemic        20
   agent and restricted diet....................................
  Manageable by restricted diet only............................      10
  Note (1): Evaluate compensable complications of diabetes
   separately unless they are part of the criteria used to
   support a 100 percent evaluation. Noncompensable
   complications are considered part of the diabetic process
   under diagnostic code 7913.
  Note (2): When diabetes mellitus has been conclusively
   diagnosed, do not request a glucose tolerance test solely for
   rating purposes.
7914 Neoplasm, malignant, any specified part of the endocrine        100
 system.........................................................
  Note: A rating of 100 percent shall continue beyond the
   cessation of any surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy
   or other therapeutic procedure. Six months after
   discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate disability
   rating shall be determined by mandatory VA examination. Any
   change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent
   examination shall be subject to the provisions of Sec.
   3.105(e) of this chapter. If there has been no local
   recurrence or metastasis, rate on residuals.

            Neurological Conditions and Convulsive Disorders


<R05>
Sec. 4.120  Evaluations by comparison.

    Disability in this field is ordinarily to be rated in proportion to 
the impairment of motor, sensory or mental function. Consider especially 
psychotic manifestations, complete or partial loss of use of one or more 
extremities, speech disturbances, impairment of vision, disturbances of 
gait, tremors, visceral manifestations, injury to the skull, etc. In 
rating disability from the conditions in the preceding sentence refer to 
the appropriate schedule. In rating peripheral nerve injuries and their 
residuals, attention should be

[[Page 442]]

given to the site and character of the injury, the relative impairment 
in motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbances.


<R05>
Sec. 4.121  Identification of epilepsy.

    When there is doubt as to the true nature of epileptiform attacks, 
neurological observation in a hospital adequate to make such a study is 
necessary. To warrant a rating for epilepsy, the seizures must be 
witnessed or verified at some time by a physician. As to frequency, 
competent, consistent lay testimony emphasizing convulsive and immediate 
post-convulsive characteristics may be accepted. The frequency of 
seizures should be ascertained under the ordinary conditions of life 
(while not hospitalized).


<R05>
Sec. 4.122  Psychomotor epilepsy.

    The term psychomotor epilepsy refers to a condition that is 
characterized by seizures and not uncommonly by a chronic psychiatric 
disturbance as well.
    (a) Psychomotor seizures consist of episodic alterations in 
conscious control that may be associated with automatic states, 
generalized convulsions, random motor movements (chewing, lip smacking, 
fumbling), hallucinatory phenomena (involving taste, smell, sound, 
vision), perceptual illusions (deja vu, feelings of loneliness, 
strangeness, macropsia, micropsia, dreamy states), alterations in 
thinking (not open to reason), alterations in memory, abnormalities of 
mood or affect (fear, alarm, terror, anger, dread, well-being), and 
autonomic disturbances (sweating, pallor, flushing of the face, visceral 
phenomena such as nausea, vomiting, defecation, a rising feeling of 
warmth in the abdomen). Automatic states or automatisms are 
characterized by episodes of irrational, irrelevant, disjointed, 
unconventional, asocial, purposeless though seemingly coordinated and 
purposeful, confused or inappropriate activity of one to several minutes 
(or, infrequently, hours) duration with subsequent amnesia for the 
seizure. Examples: A person of high social standing remained seated, 
muttered angrily, and rubbed the arms of his chair while the National 
Anthem was being played; an apparently normal person suddenly disrobed 
in public; a man traded an expensive automobile for an antiquated 
automobile in poor mechanical condition and after regaining conscious 
control, discovered that he had signed an agreement to pay an additional 
sum of money in the trade. The seizure manifestations of psychomotor 
epilepsy vary from patient to patient and in the same patient from 
seizure to seizure.
    (b) A chronic mental disorder is not uncommon as an interseizure 
manifestation of psychomotor epilepsy and may include psychiatric 
disturbances extending from minimal anxiety to severe personality 
disorder (as distinguished from developmental) or almost complete 
personality disintegration (psychosis). The manifestations of a chronic 
mental disorder associated with psychomotor epilepsy, like those of the 
seizures, are protean in character.


<R05>
Sec. 4.123  Neuritis, cranial or peripheral.

    Neuritis, cranial or peripheral, characterized by loss of reflexes, 
muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times 
excruciating, is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the 
nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe, incomplete, paralysis. 
See nerve involved for diagnostic code number and rating. The maximum 
rating which may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic 
changes referred to in this section will be that for moderate, or with 
sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe, incomplete paralysis.


<R05>
Sec. 4.124  Neuralgia, cranial or peripheral.

    Neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, characterized usually by a dull 
and intermittent pain, of typical distribution so as to identify the 
nerve, is to be rated on the same scale, with a maximum equal to 
moderate incomplete paralysis. See nerve involved for diagnostic code 
number and rating. Tic douloureux, or trifacial neuralgia, may be rated 
up to complete paralysis of the affected nerve.

[[Page 443]]


<R05>
Sec. 4.124a  Schedule of ratings--neurological conditions and convulsive disorders.

[With the exceptions noted, disability from the following diseases and 
their residuals may be rated from 10 percent to 100 percent in 
proportion to the impairment of motor, sensory, or mental function. 
Consider especially psychotic manifestations, complete or partial loss 
of use of one or more extremities, speech disturbances, impairment of 
vision, disturbances of gait, tremors, visceral manifestations, etc., 
referring to the appropriate bodily system of the schedule. With partial 
loss of use of one or more extremities from neurological lesions, rate 
by comparison with the mild, moderate, severe, or complete paralysis of 
peripheral nerves]

8025 Myasthenia gravis:
  Minimum rating................................................      30
  Note: It is required for the minimum ratings for residuals
   under diagnostic codes 8000-8025, that there be ascertainable
   residuals. Determinations as to the presence of residuals not
   capable of objective verification, i.e., headaches,
   dizziness, fatigability, must be approached on the basis of
   the diagnosis recorded; subjective residuals will be accepted
   when consistent with the disease and not more likely
   attributable to other disease or no disease. It is of
   exceptional importance that when ratings in excess of the
   prescribed minimum ratings are assigned, the diagnostic codes
   utilized as bases of evaluation be cited, in addition to the
   codes identifying the diagnoses.
8045 Brain disease due to trauma:
  Purely neurological disabilities, such as hemiplegia,
   epileptiform seizures, facial nerve paralysis, etc.,
   following trauma to the brain, will be rated under the
   diagnostic codes specifically dealing with such disabilities,
   with citation of a hyphenated diagnostic code (e.g., 8045-
   8207).
  Purely subjective complaints such as headache, dizziness,
   insomnia, etc., recognized as symptomatic of brain trauma,
   will be rated 10 percent and no more under diagnostic code
   9304. This 10 percent rating will not be combined with any
   other rating for a disability due to brain trauma. Ratings in
   excess of 10 percent for brain disease due to trauma under
   diagnostic code 9304 are not assignable in the absence of a
   diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia associated with brain
   trauma.
8046 Cerebral arteriosclerosis:

[[Page 444]]

 
  Purely neurological disabilities, such as hemiplegia, cranial
   nerve paralysis, etc., due to cerebral arteriosclerosis will
   be rated under the diagnostic codes dealing with such
   specific disabilities, with citation of a hyphenated
   diagnostic code (e.g., 8046-8207).
  Purely subjective complaints such as headache, dizziness,
   tinnitus, insomnia and irritability, recognized as
   symptomatic of a properly diagnosed cerebral
   arteriosclerosis, will be rated 10 percent and no more under
   diagnostic code 9305. This 10 percent rating will not be
   combined with any other rating for a disability due to
   cerebral or generalized arteriosclerosis. Ratings in excess
   of 10 percent for cerebral arteriosclerosis under diagnostic
   code 9305 are not assignable in the absence of a diagnosis of
   multi-infarct dementia with cerebral arteriosclerosis.
  Note: The ratings under code 8046 apply only when the
   diagnosis of cerebral arteriosclerosis is substantiated by
   the entire clinical picture and not solely on findings of
   retinal arteriosclerosis.

The term ``incomplete paralysis,'' with this and other
 peripheral nerve injuries, indicates a degree of lost
 or impaired function substantially less than the type
 picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve,
 whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to
 partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly
 sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at
 most, the moderate degree. The ratings for the
 peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement;
 when bilateral, combine with application of the
 bilateral factor.

                             The Epilepsies
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Rating
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A thorough study of all material in Sec. Sec.  4.121 and
   4.122 of the preface and under the ratings for epilepsy is
   necessary prior to any rating action.
8910 Epilepsy, grand mal.
  Rate under the general rating formula for major seizures.
8911 Epilepsy, petit mal.
  Rate under the general rating formula for minor seizures.
  Note (1): A major seizure is characterized by the generalized
   tonic-clonic convulsion with unconsciousness.
  Note (2): A minor seizure consists of a brief interruption in
   consciousness or conscious control associated with staring or
   rhythmic blinking of the eyes or nodding of the head
   (``pure'' petit mal), or sudden jerking movements of the
   arms, trunk, or head (myoclonic type) or sudden loss of
   postural control (akinetic type).
  General Rating Formula for Major and Minor Epileptic Seizures:
    Averaging at least 1 major seizure per month over the last       100
     year.......................................................
    Averaging at least 1 major seizure in 3 months over the last      80
     year; or more than 10 minor seizures weekly................
    Averaging at least 1 major seizure in 4 months over the last      60
     year; or 9-10 minor seizures per week......................
    At least 1 major seizure in the last 6 months or 2 in the         40
     last year; or averaging at least 5 to 8 minor seizures
     weekly.....................................................
    At least 1 major seizure in the last 2 years; or at least 2       20
     minor seizures in the last 6 months........................
    A confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy with a history of seizures      10
  Note (1): When continuous medication is shown necessary for
   the control of epilepsy, the minimum evaluation will be 10
   percent. This rating will not be combined with any other
   rating for epilepsy.
  Note (2): In the presence of major and minor seizures, rate
   the predominating type.
  Note (3): There will be no distinction between diurnal and
   nocturnal major seizures.
8912 Epilepsy, Jacksonian and focal motor or sensory.
8913 Epilepsy, diencephalic.
  Rate as minor seizures, except in the presence of major and
   minor seizures, rate the predominating type.
8914 Epilepsy, psychomotor.
  Major seizures:
    Psychomotor seizures will be rated as major seizures under
     the general rating formula when characterized by automatic
     states and/or generalized convulsions with unconsciousness.
  Minor seizures:
    Psychomotor seizures will be rated as minor seizures under
     the general rating formula when characterized by brief
     transient episodes of random motor movements,
     hallucinations, perceptual illusions, abnormalities of
     thinking, memory or mood, or autonomic disturbances.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mental Disorders in Epilepsies: A nonpsychotic organic brain syndrome
  will be rated separately under the appropriate diagnostic code (e.g.,
  9304 or 9326). In the absence of a diagnosis of non-psychotic organic
  psychiatric disturbance (psychotic, psychoneurotic or personality
  disorder) if diagnosed and shown to be secondary to or directly
  associated with epilepsy will be rated separately. The psychotic or
  psychroneurotic disorder will be rated under the appropriate
  diagnostic code. The personality disorder will be rated as a dementia
  (e.g., diagnostic code 9304 or 9326).

[[Page 448]]

 
Epilepsy and Unemployability: (1) Rating specialists must bear in mind
  that the epileptic, although his or her seizures are controlled, may
  find employment and rehabilitation difficult of attainment due to
  employer reluctance to the hiring of the epileptic.
(2) Where a case is encountered with a definite history of unemployment,
  full and complete development should be undertaken to ascertain
  whether the epilepsy is the determining factor in his or her inability
  to obtain employment.
(3) The assent of the claimant should first be obtained for permission
  to conduct this economic and social survey. The purpose of this survey
  is to secure all the relevant facts and data necessary to permit of a
  true judgment as to the reason for his or her unemployment and should
  include information as to:
(a) Education;
(b) Occupations prior and subsequent to service;
(c) Places of employment and reasons for termination;
(d) Wages received;
(e) Number of seizures.
(4) Upon completion of this survey and current examination, the case
  should have rating board consideration. Where in the judgment of the
  rating board the veteran's unemployability is due to epilepsy and
  jurisdiction is not vested in that body by reason of schedular
  evaluations, the case should be submitted to the Director,
  Compensation and Pension Service.

Sec. 4.125  Diagnosis of mental disorders.

    (a) If the diagnosis of a mental disorder does not conform to DSM-IV 
or is not supported by the findings on the examination report, the 
rating agency shall return the report to the examiner to substantiate 
the diagnosis.
    (b) If the diagnosis of a mental disorder is changed, the rating 
agency shall determine whether the new diagnosis represents progression 
of the prior diagnosis, correction of an error in the prior diagnosis, 
or development of a new and separate condition. If it is not clear from 
the available records what the change of diagnosis represents, the 
rating agency shall return the report to the examiner for a 
determination.

<R05>
Sec. 4.126  Evaluation of disability from mental disorders.

    (a) When evaluating a mental disorder, the rating agency shall 
consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, 
the length of remissions, and the veteran's capacity for adjustment 
during periods of remission. The rating agency shall assign an 
evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on 
occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's 
assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination.
    (b) When evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, 
the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment, but 
shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment.
    (c) Delirium, dementia, and amnestic and other cognitive disorders 
shall be evaluated under the general rating formula for mental 
disorders; neurologic deficits or other impairments stemming from the 
same etiology (e.g., a head injury) shall be evaluated separately and 
combined with the evaluation for delirium, dementia, or amnestic or 
other cognitive disorder (see Sec. 4.25).
    (d) When a single disability has been diagnosed both as a physical 
condition and as a mental disorder, the rating agency shall evaluate it 
using a diagnostic code which represents the dominant (more disabling) 
aspect of the condition (see Sec. 4.14).

Sec. 4.127  Mental retardation and personality disorders.

    Mental retardation and personality disorders are not diseases or 
injuries for compensation purposes, and, except as provided in Sec. 
3.310(a) of this chapter, disability resulting from them may not be 
service-connected. However, disability resulting from a mental disorder 
that is superimposed upon mental retardation or a personality disorder 
may be service-connected.

Sec. 4.128  Convalescence ratings following extended hospitalization.

    If a mental disorder has been assigned a total evaluation due to a 
continuous period of hospitalization lasting six months or more, the 
rating agency shall continue the total evaluation indefinitely and 
schedule a mandatory examination six months after the veteran is 
discharged or released to

nonbed care. A change in evaluation based on that or any subsequent 
examination shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 3.105(e) of this 
chapter.

Sec. 4.129  Mental disorders due to traumatic stress.

    When a mental disorder that develops in service as a result of a 
highly stressful event is severe enough to bring about the veteran's 
release from active military service, the rating agency shall assign an 
evaluation of not less than 50 percent and schedule an examination 
within the six month period following the veteran's discharge to 
determine whether a change in evaluation is warranted.

<R05>
Sec. 6.1  Misstatement of age.

    If the age of the insured under a United States Government life 
insurance policy has been understated, the amount of the insurance 
payable under the policy shall be such exact amount as the premium paid 
would have purchased at the correct age; if overstated, the excess of 
premiums paid shall be refunded without interest. Guaranteed surrender 
and loan values will be modified accordingly. The age of the insured 
will be admitted by the Department of Veterans Affairs at any time upon 
satisfactory proof.

                                Premiums


<R05>
Sec. 6.2  Premium rate.

    Effective January 1, 1983, United States Government Life Insurance

<R05>
Sec. 6.3  Incontestability of United States Government life insurance.

    Discharge or release of an insured from military or naval service 
for the reason of fraudulent enlistment shall not invalidate United 
States Government life insurance issued on the basis of such service 
unless the Secretary determines that the insured was mentally or legally 
incapable of entering into a contract of enlistment. In such case the 
United States Government life insurance so issued will be canceled as of 
the effective date of such insurance.

         Beneficiary of United States Government Life Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 6.4  Proof of age, relationship and marriage.

    Whenever it is necessary for a claimant to prove age, relationship 
or marriage, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 103(c) and Part 3 this chapter 
will be followed.

[26 FR 1856, Mar. 3, 1961. Redesignated and amended at 61 FR 29024, 
29025, June 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 6.5  Conditional designation of beneficiary.

    If the insured by notice in writing to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs during his or her lifetime has provided that a designated 
beneficiary shall be entitled to the proceeds of United States 
Government life insurance only if such beneficiary shall survive him or 
her for such period (not more than 30 days), as specified by the 
insured, no right to the insurance shall vest as to such beneficiary 
during that period. In the event such beneficiary fails to survive the 
specified period, payment of the proceeds of United States Government 
life insurance will be made as if the beneficiary had predeceased the 
insured.

[14 FR 7175, Nov. 29, 1949, as amended at 46 FR 57043, Nov. 20, 1981. 
Redesignated at 61 FR 29024, June 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 6.6  Change of beneficiary.

    The insured under United States Government life insurance shall have 
the right at any time and from time to time and without the consent or 
knowledge of the beneficiary to change the beneficiary. A change of 
beneficiary must be made by written notice to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs over the signature of the insured and shall not be binding on 
the United States unless received by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
A change of beneficiary must be forwarded to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs by the insured or his or her agent and must contain sufficient 
information to identify the insured. Whenever practicable, such notices 
shall be given on forms prescribed by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs. Upon receipt by the Department of Veterans Affairs, a change of 
beneficiary shall be deemed effective

[[Page 485]]

as of the date the insured signed the written notice. The United States 
shall be protected in all payments made to the beneficiary last of 
record and before receipt of notice of a change of beneficiary, and no 
payments so made shall be paid again to the changed beneficiary. The 
insured may exercise any right or privilege given under the provisions 
of a United States Government life insurance policy without the consent 
of the beneficiary. An original designation of a beneficiary may be made 
by the last will and testament, but no change of beneficiary may be made 
by the last will and testament. The provisions of the ``beneficiary'' 
clause in United States Government life insurance policies are hereby 
amended accordingly.

<R05>
Sec. 6.7  Claims of creditors, taxation.

    (a) Effective January 1, 1958, payments of insurance to a 
beneficiary under a United States Government life insurance policy shall 
be subject to levy for taxes due the United States by such beneficiary.
    (b) The provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5301(b) which entitle the United 
States to collect by setoff out of benefits payable to any beneficiary 
under a United States Government life insurance policy do not apply to 
dividends being held to the credit of the insured for the payment of 
premiums under the provisions of section 1946 of title 38 U.S.C.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5301)

                           Optional Settlement


<R05>
Sec. 6.8  Selection, revocation and election.

    The insured under a United States Government Life Insurance policy 
may, upon written notice, select an optional settlement. Such optional 
settlement may be revoked by written notice. If the insured does not 
select one of the optional settlements, as set out under the provisions 
of the policy, the insurance shall be payable in 240 monthly 
installments unless the beneficiary elects in writing a different 
option.

[61 FR 29025, June 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 6.9  Election of optional settlement by beneficiary.

    If the insured has selected an optional settlement then at the death 
of the insured the designated beneficiary may elect to receive the 
proceeds of insurance in installments spread over a greater period of 
time than that selected by the insured and in accordance with the 
following provisions.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1952)

    (a) If the insured has selected Option 1, the beneficiary may elect 
to receive payment under Option 2, 3, or 4.
    (b) If the insured has selected Option 2 with monthly installments 
not in excess of 120, the beneficiary may elect to receive payment in a 
greater number of installments under Option 2, or may elect to receive 
payment under Option 3 or 4.
    (c) If the insured has selected Option 2 with monthly installments 
in excess of 120, the beneficiary may elect to receive payment in a 
greater number of installments under Option 2, or may elect to receive 
payment under Option 3.
    (d) If the insured has selected Option 3, and named no contingent 
beneficiary, the beneficiary may elect to receive payment under Option 
4.
    (e) If the insured has selected Option 4, the beneficiary may elect 
to receive payment under Option 3.

If the insured has selected settlement under Option 1, a beneficiary who 
has elected to receive payment under Option 2, 3, or 4 may elect to 
receive the commuted value of any remaining unpaid installments certain 
(240 less the number paid in case of Option 3, or 120 less the number 
paid in the case of Option 4): Provided, That where the commutation is 
elected under Option 3 or 4 after payment under such option has 
commenced, and the beneficiary survives the period certain, such 
beneficiary shall be entitled to the resumption of monthly installments 
payable for life in accordance with the monthly income option previously 
selected by

[[Page 486]]

such beneficiary. The entitlement to the resumption of monthly 
installments will be effective as of the monthly payment date next 
following the expiration of the period certain. Settlement under any one 
of the options or payment to the beneficiary of said commuted value 
under Option 2 or payment of said commuted value under Options 3 and 4 
to the beneficiary who does not survive the period certain shall be in 
full and complete discharge of all liability under the contract. Any 
other change in the mode of settlement may, within the limitations set 
forth in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, be made by a 
beneficiary after payment has commenced, provided the change is made 
within 1 year of the original election and in those instances where 
Option 3 is changed to Option 1 or 2; or Option 4 is changed to Option 
1, 2, or 3, satisfactory proof is submitted to establish that the 
beneficiary's state of health is the same as it was at time of original 
election. The effective date of the original election for this purpose 
will be the date it was delivered to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
If such election was forwarded by mail, properly addressed to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, the postmark date will be taken as the 
date of delivery. Such change will be made on the premise that the new 
election was made initially, and the account will be adjusted 
accordingly. A condition precedent to any such change will be the 
repayment of any amount received by the beneficiary in excess of that 
which would have been due had the new election been made initially.

                                Dividends


<R05>
Sec. 6.11  How dividends are paid.

    (a) Regular annual dividends becoming payable on or after December 
31, 1958, shall be payable on the date preceding the anniversary of the 
policy unless the Secretary shall declare them payable on some other 
date.
    (b) If the insured has a National Service Life Insurance policy or 
policies in force, dividends used to pay premiums in advance will be 
held to the credit of the insured, unless otherwise directed by the 
insured.
    (c) In the event premiums on more than one policy having the same 
premium due date are unpaid and the dividend credit of the insured for 
application to payment of premiums is not sufficient to keep all 
policies in force, in the absence of instructions to the contrary by the 
insured, such dividend credit will be applied to pay premiums in such 
manner as will provide the maximum amount of insurance protection.
    (d) Dividend credit of the insured held for payment of premiums as 
provided in section 1946 of title 38 U.S.C., may not be used to satisfy 
any indebtedness due the United States without the insured's consent. If 
the insured requests payment of such dividend credit, or any unused 
portion thereof, in cash, or requests that such credit be left to 
accumulate on deposit, then any indebtedness due the United States, such 
as described in Sec. 6.7 will be recovered therefrom.
    (e) Dividend credit of the insured held for payment of premiums or 
dividends left to accumulate on deposit may be applied to the payment of 
premiums in advance on any National Service Life Insurance policy upon 
written request of the insured made before default in payment of 
premium. Upon maturity of the policy, any unpaid dividend will be paid 
to the person(s) currently entitled to receive payments under the 
policy.

Life Insurance policy any amount which shall not exceed 94 percent of 
the cash value, and any indebtedness shall be deducted from the amount 
advanced on such loan. The loan shall bear interest at a rate not to 
exceed 5 percent per annum, payable annually, and the loan may be repaid 
in full or in amounts of $5 or more. Failure to pay either the amount of 
the loan or the interest thereon shall not void the policy unless the 
total indebtedness shall equal or exceed the cash value thereof. When 
the amount of the indebtedness equals or exceeds the cash value, the 
policy shall cease and become void.

Insurance other than the special endowment at age 96 plan policy; all 
values, reserves, and net single premiums being based on the American 
Experience Table of Mortality, with interest at the rate of 3\1/2\ 
percent per annum. The cash value shall be the reserve together with any 
dividend accumulations. For each month after the first policy year the 
reserve at the end of the preceding policy year shall be increased by 
one-twelfth of the increase in reserve for the current policy year. Upon 
written request therefor and upon complete surrender of the insurance 
with all claims thereunder made by the insured the United States will 
pay to the insured the cash value of the policy less any indebtedness. 
Unless otherwise requested by the insured, a surrender will be deemed 
completed as of the end of the month in which the application for cash 
surrender is delivered to the Department of Veterans Affairs, or as of 
the date of the check for the cash value, whichever is later. If the 
application is forwarded by mail, properly addressed, the postmark date

    Provisions for cash value shall become effective at the completion

prescribed by the Secretary and published in VA Pamphlet 90-2A. The cash 
value at the end of the first policy year and at the end of any policy 
year thereafter shall be the reserve as set forth in the policy together 
with any dividend accumulations. For each month after the first policy 
year the reserve at the end of the preceding policy year shall be 
increased by one-twelfth of the increase in reserve for the current 
policy year. Upon written request therefor and upon complete surrender 
of the insurance with all claims thereunder made by the insured, the 
United States will pay to the insured the cash value of the policy less 
any indebtedness, provided the policy has been in force for at least 1 
year. Unless otherwise requested by the insured, a surrender will be 
deemed completed as of the end of the month in which the application for 
cash surrender is delivered to the Department of Veterans Affairs, or as 
of the date of the check for the cash value, whichever is later. If the 
application is forwarded by mail, properly addressed, the postmark date

    Effective January 1, 1971, in lieu of payment of cash value in one 
sum, the insured may elect to receive payment in monthly installments 
under option 2 as set forth in the insurance contract or as a refund 
life income option. If the insured dies before the agreed number of 
monthly installments have been paid, the remaining unpaid monthly 
installments will be payable to the designated beneficiary in one sum, 
unless the insured or such beneficiary has elected to continue the 
installments under the option selected by the insured. If no designated 
beneficiary survives, the present value of any remaining unpaid 
installments shall be paid to the estate of the insured, provided such 
payment would not escheat.

<R05>
Sec. 6.17  Collection of any indebtedness.

    At the maturity of a United States Government life insurance policy 
by total permanent disability or death, any indebtedness, unless paid 
off in cash, shall be liquidated by reducing the amount of each monthly 
installment in the proportion which the indebtedness bears to the 
commuted value of monthly installments as may then be payable under the 
policy, excluding dividend accumulations. If the policy is payable in 
one sum at death, any indebtedness shall be deducted from the amount 
payable under the policy.

following also will be deemed to be total and permanent disabilities: 
Organic loss of speech; permanently helpless or permanently bedridden.
    (b) Organic loss of speech will mean the loss of the ability to 
express oneself, both by voice and whisper, through the normal organs of

use of an artificial appliance or other organs of the body will be 
disregarded.

death benefit in the nature of life insurance, may be included within 
the provisions of the Act if otherwise eligible. Group insurance will 
not be included unless an individual and separate contract of insurance 
is completely released to the insured and thereafter comes within the 
provisions of the Act as a policy.
    (c) The phrase Face amount of insurance as used in the regulations 
in this part will mean the amount of insurance payable as a death 
benefit; Provided, That any indebtedness, or any accruals (such as paid-
up additions, dividend accumulations, etc.) that may be added to or 
taken from the amount payable as the death benefits will not be used in 
calculating the face amount of a policy.

Sec. 7.4  The premium.

    The term premium as defined under 50 U.S.C. app. 540(b) shall 
include membership dues and assessments in an association.
    (a) The premium on a policy will be calculated on an annual basis, 
and if the annual premium is not stated on the policy, the insurer will 
make a calculation of the premiums for payment in advance and discounted 
at not less than 3\1/2\ percent, subject to approval by the Department 
of Veterans Affairs.
    (b) Premiums will not be guaranteed for benefits additional to the 
primary death benefit if, when combined with the amount of the primary 
death benefit, the total benefit would result in a payment in excess of 
$10,000 or if liability for such benefits is excluded or restricted by 
military service or any activity which the insured may be called upon to 
perform in connection with military service. In the event that premiums 
for the primary and additional benefits are not separable under the 
terms of the policy the entire policy will be guaranteed, if the policy 
is otherwise eligible for protection under the law.

Sec. 7.5  Application.

    (a) The benefits of the Act are not available except upon 
application. The insured may designate any person, firm, or corporation 
to submit an application on his or her behalf. The designation must be 
in writing, signed by the insured and attached to the application.
    (b) When an application for benefits is received by an insurer, a 
report thereof will be made within 30 days to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs Regional Office and Insurance Center at Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania. The insurer may submit with the report a statement setting 
forth any additional information deemed necessary to the adjudication of 
the application, and any facts and reasoning as to why the policy should 
or should not be protected under the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 7.6  Benefits.

    Any policy found to be entitled to protection under the provisions 
of the Act will not lapse or otherwise terminate or be forfeited for the 
nonpayment of a premium or the nonpayment of any indebtedness or 
interest during the period of military service of the insured and two 
years after the expiration of such service. If the insured reenters 
military service during the two-year period following separation from 
such service and the policy is under the protection of the Act on the 
date of reentry, such reentrance shall be deemed to be a continuation of 
the previous military service. In such case, in the absence of written 
instruction from the insured to the contrary, the protection under the 
Act will continue during the period of military service of the insured 
and two years after the expiration of such service, but the guarantee 
will not extend for more than two years after the date when the Act 
ceases to be in force.
    (a) For the period during which a policy is protected by the 
provisions of the Act, any dividends, return of premiums, or other such 
monetary benefits arising out of the contract or by reason thereof, will 
be held subject to disposal or to be applied as may be approved by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (b) A policy will not be removed from the protection of the Act by 
reason of a payment made to the insurer by or on behalf of the insured, 
but any tender of a premium (in whole or in part) shall be applied on 
the indebtedness established under authority of the Act against the 
policy: Provided, That nothing herein shall prevent an insured from 
continuing payment to the insurer of premiums to cover any additional 
benefits (such as double indemnity, waiver of premium, etc.) where such 
premiums may not be included in

[[Page 491]]

the amount guaranteed by the Government.

<R05>
Sec. 7.7  Maturity.

    (a) The phrase maturity of a policy as a death claim or otherwise 
(SSCRA, as amended) will not include a termination or maturity of a 
policy as a disability claim, and the policy will continue under the 
provisions of the Act as if there had been no maturity, but the 
Government shall not be liable for any premiums that the insured would 
have been relieved of paying under any provisions for payment of 
premiums in the policy.
    (b) Upon the expiration of the period of protection, the insurer 
will submit to the Department of Veterans Affairs a complete statement 
of the account on each policy, which will show the amount of 
indebtedness by reason of the premiums with interest and the credits, if 
any, then available and will be subject to audit and approval by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. The statement of account will include 
the rate of interest charged on all indebtedness, the date of debit and 
credit entries, and such other information as may be deemed necessary in 
making an audit of the account.

<R05>
Sec. 7.8  Beneficiary or assignee.

    The consent of a beneficiary, assignee, or any other person who may 
have a right or interest in the proceeds of the policy is not a 
prerequisite for placing a policy under the protection of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 8.0  Definitions of terms used in connection with title 38 CFR, part 8, National Service Life Insurance.

    (a) What does the term ``good health'' mean? The term good health 
means that the applicant is, from clinical or other evidence, free from 
any condition that would tend to:
    (1) Weaken normal physical or mental functions; or
    (2) Shorten life.

    Note to paragraph (a): Conditions that would affect ``good health'' 
are diseases or injuries or residuals of diseases or injuries. A 
``residual'' is a disability that remains following the original disease 
or injury.

    (b) What does the term ``good health criteria'' mean? The term good 
health criteria means the underwriting standards that determine whether 
a person is in good health. ``Good health criteria'' are based whenever 
possible, as far as practicable, on general insurance usage. 
``Underwriting'' is the process that sets the terms, conditions, and 
prices for an insurance policy, by rating an applicant's mortality risk.
    (c) What does the term ``organic loss of speech'' mean? The term 
organic loss of speech means the loss of the ability to express oneself, 
both by voice and whisper, through the normal organs of speech if the 
loss is caused by physical changes in such organs. The fact that some 
speech can be produced through the use of artificial appliance or other 
organs of the body will not impact this definition.
    (d) What does the term ``disease or injury traceable to the extra 
hazards of the military service'' mean? The term disease or injury 
traceable to the extra hazards of the military service means a disease 
or injury that was either caused by or can be traced back to the 
performance of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.
    (e) What does the term ``guardian'' mean? The term guardian means 
any representative certified by the appropriate Veterans Service Center 
Manager, under Sec. 13.55 of this chapter, to receive benefits in a 
fiduciary capacity on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary, or to 
take the actions listed in Sec. 8.32.

                             Effective Date


<R05>
Sec. 8.1  Effective date for an insurance policy issued under section 1922(a) of title 38 U.S.C. (Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance).

    (a) What is the effective date of the policy? The effective date is 
the date policy coverage begins. Benefits due under the policy are 
payable any time after the effective date.
    (b) How is the effective date established? The effective date is the 
date you deliver both of the following to VA:
    (1) A valid application.
    (2) A premium payment.

    Note 1 to paragraph (b): If your valid application and premium are 
mailed to VA, the postmark date will be the date of delivery.
    Note 2 to paragraph (b): If a postmark date is not available, the 
date of delivery

[[Page 493]]

will be the date your valid application and premium are received by VA.

    (c) Can you have a different effective date? Yes, if you would like 
an effective date other than the date of delivery as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section, you may choose one of the following three 
options as an effective date:
    (1) The first day of the month in which you deliver your valid 
application and premium payment to VA. For example, if VA receives your 
application and premium payment on August 15, you may request an 
effective date of August 1.
    (2) The first day of the month following the month in which you 
deliver your valid application and premium payment. For example, if VA 
receives your application and premium payment on August 15, you may 
request an effective date of September 1.
    (3) The first day of any month up to six months prior to the month 
in which you deliver your valid application and premium payment. For 
example, if VA receives your application and premium payment on August 
15, you may request an effective date of February 1 or the first day of 
any month following up to August 1. However, you must pay the following:
    (i) The insurance reserve amount for the time period for each month 
starting with the requested effective date up to the first day of the 
month prior to the month in which you delivered your application to VA; 
and
    (ii) The premium for the month in which you delivered your 
application to VA.

    Note to paragraph (c): For example, if your postmark date is August 
15 and you request an effective date of February 1, you must pay the 
insurance reserve amount for February 1 through July 31, and also pay 
the August premium.

                                Premiums


<R05>
Sec. 8.2  Payment of premiums.

    (a) What is a premium? A premium is a payment that a policyholder is 
required to make for an insurance policy.
    (b) How can policyholders pay premiums? Premiums can be paid by:
    (1) Cash, check, or money order directly to VA.
    (2) Allotment from service or retirement pay.
    (3) Automatic deduction from VA benefits (pension, compensation or 
insurance dividends (see Sec. 8.4)).
    (4) Pre-authorized debit from a checking account.
    (c) When should policyholders pay premiums? (1) Unless premiums are 
paid in advance, policyholders must pay premiums on the effective date 
shown on the policy and on the same date of each following month. This 
is called the ``due date.''
    (2) Policyholders may pay premiums quarterly, semi-annually, or 
annually in advance.
    (d) What happens if a policyholder does not pay a premium on time? 
(1) When a policyholder pays a premium within 31 days from the ``due 
date,'' the policy remains in force. This 31-day period is called a 
``grace period.'' If the insured dies within the 31-day grace period, VA 
deducts the unpaid premium from the amount of insurance payable.
    (2) If a policyholder pays a premium after the 31-day grace period, 
VA will not accept the payment and the policy lapses effective the date 
the premium was due; Except that VA will accept a premium paid after the 
31-day grace period as a timely payment if:
    (i) The policyholder pays the premium within 61 days of the due 
date; and
    (ii) The policyholder is alive at the time the payment is mailed.
    (3) When a policyholder pays the premium by mail, the postmark date 
is the date of payment.
    (4) When a policyholder pays a premium by check or money order which 
is not honored and it is shown by satisfactory evidence that:

<R05>
Sec. 8.3  Revival of insurance.

    (a) If the sole reason death or total disability benefits under a 
policy of National Service life insurance cannot be granted is that the 
policy had lapsed, the insurance will be considered in force under 
premium-paying conditions on the date of death or the date of 
commencement of total disability if,
    (1) On the date of lapse there were accrued dividends, not then 
payable, resulting from premiums paid since the last anniversary date of 
the policy and such dividends were equal to or greater in amount than 
the total of the monthly premiums which have become due from and 
including the date of lapse to the date of death or date of commencement 
of total disability, and/or
    (2) At the end of the grace period for the unpaid premium causing 
lapse there were due and payable to the policyholder unpaid dividends, 
refundable premiums, pure insurance risk credits, other refundable 
credits or total disability benefit payments arising from the 
policyholder's U.S. Government or National Service life insurance which 
are equal to or greater in amount than the total of the monthly premiums 
which have become due from and including the date of lapse to the date 
of death or date of commencement of total disability.
    (3) For purposes of this section amounts under paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(2) of this section may be combined. In that case, the amount, if any, 
of dividend accrued under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will first be 
determined and the amount available under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, if any, will be added thereto for the purpose of determining if 
the total amount thus available is equal to or greater than the total of 
monthly premiums which have become due.
    (4) In determining the amount of monthly premiums which have become 
due under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section a shortage of 10 
percent per monthly premium may be allowed for a period not to exceed 3 
months.
    (5) In determining the monthly premiums which have become due for 
adjustment purposes under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the 
premium for the monthly due date immediately preceding the date of death 
or date of commencement of total disability may be omitted because of 
the coverage provided by the allowable grace period (Sec. 8.2(d)) and 
if the conditions of paragraph (b) of this section are met, the premium 
for the second due date immediately preceding the date of death or date 
of commencement of total disability may be omitted.
    (6) When a policy is deemed in force under premium-paying conditions 
by operation of this section, the amount of any shortage included in the 
calculation and the premium for any monthly due date omitted in the 
calculation will become a lien against the policy.
    (7) The provisions of this section may be applied if, on the date of 
death, the insurance is in force under the extended term insurance 
provision (Sec. 8.14) and a policy loan was outstanding on the date of 
lapse or a dividend deposit balance was included in the cash value as 
determined at time of lapse.
    (8) If accrued dividends under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and/
or amounts due and payable under paragraph (a)(2) of this section exist 
in connection with more than one policy of the same veteran and one or 
more policies lapsed prior to the date of death or date of commencement 
of total disability, the amounts available will be related first to the 
policy or policies on which they arose if such policy or policies are 
lapsed. Any amount available under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this 
section which is not required to place in force the policy upon which it 
arose

[[Page 495]]

or which is insufficient to place in force the policy upon which it 
arose, may be combined with similar amounts available on any other 
policy whenever the total of such amounts is sufficient to place another 
policy in force.
    (9) Where more than one policy is involved and credits are not 
needed or are insufficient to revive the policy on which the credits 
arose, the credits will be used insofar as they are sufficient to revive 
the policy or policies under which the most insurance is payable.
    (10) No total disability income provision will be considered in 
force under this section unless it lapsed at the same time as the life 
insurance contract and both the life insurance and total disability 
income provision can be considered in force through the same date and 
benefits are payable under the total disability income provision. An 
exception will be a paid-in-full limited pay contract on which total 
disability income provision premiums are due and payable to age 65.
    (11) When a total disability income provision lapsed at the same 
time as the life insurance, the premium for the provision will be 
considered separately in determining if the amounts available are equal 
to or in excess of the monthly premiums which have become due. In such a 
case if the amounts available are sufficient, both the life insurance 
and the provision will be revived. If the amounts are insufficient for 
that purpose, they will be applied to revive the policy or policies with 
the greatest amount payable in death cases or the policy or policies 
providing the greatest life insurance and total disability benefit in 
total disability cases.
    (12) Accrued dividends and/or credits on any policy of National 
Service or U.S. Government life insurance held by the policyholder may 
be considered for the purpose of this section.
    (b) If the sole reason death or total disability benefits under a 
policy of National Service life insurance cannot be granted is that the 
policy had lapsed, the insurance will be considered in force on the date 
of death or date of commencement of total disability if,
    (1) The policyholder died or became totally disabled within 61 days 
of the due date of the unpaid premiums, and
    (2) The policy prior to the lapse had been in force for 5 years or 
more. In determining in-force status under this subparagraph if the 
original effective date of the insurance (when necessary, include 
predecessor contracts involving renewal, conversion or replacement/
reinstatement under 38 U.S.C. 1981) is 5 years or more earlier than the 
date of death or date of total disability and during the 5 years 
immediately preceding the date of lapse the insurance has not been 
lapsed at any one time in excess of 6 months, the requirement will be 
satisfied. When insurance is considered in force under this section the 
amount of the monthly premium due on the date of lapse and the following 
monthly premium(s) will become a lien against the policy.
    (3) The provisions of this section may be applied if, on the date of 
death, the insurance is in force under the extended term insurance 
provision (Sec. 8.14) and a policy loan was outstanding on the date of 
lapse or a dividend deposit balance was included in the cash value as 
determined at time of lapse.

Sec. 8.4  Deduction of insurance premiums from compensation, retirement pay, or pension.

    The insured under a National Service life insurance policy which is 
not lapsed may authorize the monthly deduction of premiums from 
disability compensation, death compensation, dependency and indemnity 
compensation, retirement pay, disability pension, or death pension that 
may be due and payable to him under any laws administered by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs in accordance with the following 
provisions.
    (a) The authorization may be made by an insured or the insured's 
legal representative. If the authorization is made by the insured's 
legal representative, it must be in writing over the signature of the 
representative and forwarded to the Department of Veterans Affairs along 
with a copy of the document which evidences the individual's authority 
to act on behalf of the insured. If an insured is incompetent and

[[Page 496]]

has no legal representative and has a spouse to whom benefits are being 
paid pursuant to Part 13 of this chapter, the spouse may authorize 
payment of insurance premiums through the deduction system. If an 
insured is incompetent and has no legal representative and an 
institutional award has been made in his or her behalf, the 
authorization may be executed by the Director of the field facility in 
which the insured is hospitalized or receiving domiciliary care, and in 
appropriate cases by the chief officers of State hospitals or other 
institutions to whom similar awards may have been approved.
    (b) The monthly disability compensation, death compensation, 
dependency and indemnity compensation, retirement pay, disability 
pension, or death pension so due and payable must be equal to, or in 
excess of, the amount of the insurance premium figured on a monthly 
basis.
    (c) The authorization may be cancelled by the insured at any time. 
Such cancellation will be effective on the first day of the month 
following the month in which it is received by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs.
    (d) If the benefits payable to the insured are apportioned under the 
regulations of the Department of Veterans Affairs now in effect or 
hereafter issued, the deduction authorized by the insured shall be from 
that portion awarded to the insured under such regulations.
    (e) The deduction authorized by a policyholder issued insurance 
under 38 U.S.C. 1925 will be automatically adjusted by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to take cognizance of any premium adjustment made by 
the Secretary on such insurance provided the benefit payments due and 
payable to the insured are of an amount sufficient to pay the monthly 
insurance premium.

Sec. 8.5  Authorization for deduction of premiums from compensation, retirement pay, or pension.

    Deductions from benefits for the payment of premiums shall be 
effective on the month the authorization for such deduction is received 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs or on any successive month 
specified by the insured. Such deduction shall be applied to the premium 
due in the succeeding calendar month and shall continue monthly so long 
as the benefit payments are due and payable to the insured and the 
amount is sufficient to pay the premium or until such authorization is 
revoked by the veteran or otherwise terminated. When premium deductions 
are authorized by the insured, the premium will be treated as paid for 
purposes of preventing lapse of the insurance, so long as there is due 
and payable to the insured a benefit amount sufficient to provide the 
premium payment. If authorization was executed by the Director of a VA 
hospital or domiciliary or chief officer of a State hospital or other 
institution to make deductions from an institutional award, the 
authorization will cease and terminate at the termination of the 
institutional award and the insurance shall lapse unless another 
authorization for deduction from monthly benefit payments is executed by 
the insured. The insured will be notified by letter directed to the last 
address of record of the termination of the authorization to deduct 
premiums, but failure to give such notice shall not prevent lapse.

                              Reinstatement


<R05>
Sec. 8.7  Reinstatement of National Service Life Insurance except insurance issued pursuant to section 1925 of title 38 U.S.C.

    (a) Any policy which lapses and which is not surrendered for a cash 
value or for paid-up insurance, may be reinstated upon written 
application signed by the applicant, payment of all premiums in arrears, 
and evidence of good health as required under Sec. 8.8 (a) or (b), 
whichever is applicable. If a policy is not reinstated within 6 months 
from the due date of the premium in default, interest must be paid in 
addition to premiums for all months in arrears from their respective due 
dates at the rate of 5 percent per annum, compounded annually. The 
payment or reinstatement of any indebtedness against a policy must be 
made upon application for reinstatement, and any excess of indebtedness 
and interest over the reserve of the policy must be paid at that time. A 
lapsed National Service Life Insurance policy which is in force under 
extended term insurance may be reinstated within 5 years from the date 
extended insurance would expire upon application and payment of all 
premiums in arrears with the required interest. In any case in which the 
extended insurance under an endowment policy provides protection to the 
end of the endowment period, the policy may be reinstated at any time 
before maturity upon application and payment of the premiums with the 
required interest. A policy on the level term premium plan may be 
reinstated within 5 years of the date of lapse upon written application 
signed by the insured, evidence of insurability and payment of two 
monthly premiums, one for the month of the lapse, the other for the 
month of reinstatement.
    (b) Reinstatement of insurance issued under section 1925, title 38 
U.S.C. Any policy of insurance issued under 38 U.S.C. 1925 which has 
been lapsed for not more than 5 years shall be reinstated under the same 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Effective date of reinstatements. Reinstatement is effected on 
the date an acceptable application and the required monetary payments 
are delivered to the Department of Veterans Affairs. If application for 
reinstatement is submitted by mail, properly addressed to the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, the postmark date shall be the date of delivery. 
The effective date of reinstatement of the insurance shall be the last 
monthly premium due date prior to the delivery or postmark date of the 
application for reinstatement, except where reinstatement is effected on 
the due date of a premium, then in such case that date shall be the 
reinstatement date.
    (d) Inquiry during the grace period. When the insured makes inquiry 
prior to the expiration of the grace period disclosing a clear intent to 
continue insurance protection, such as a request for information 
concerning premium rates or conversion privileges, etc., an additional 
reasonable period not exceeding 60 days may be granted for payment of 
premiums due; but the premiums in any such case must be paid during the 
lifetime of the insured.

Sec. 8.8  Health requirements.

    National Service life insurance on any plan may be reinstated if 
application and tender of premiums are made:
    (a) Within 6 premium months including the premium month for which 
the unpaid premium was due, provided the applicant be in as good health 
on the date of application and tender of premiums as he or she was on 
the last day of the grace period of the premium in default and furnishes 
satisfactory evidence thereof.
    (b) After expiration of the 6-month period mentioned in paragraph 
(a) of this section, provided applicant is in good health (Sec. 8.0) on 
the date of application and tender of premiums and furnishes 
satisfactory evidence. If the insurance to be reinstated was issued 
under 38 U.S.C. 1922(a), 1925(b), or 1925(c) and application is made 
within 1 year of the date of lapse, any service-

[[Page 498]]

connected disability existing at the time the insurance was issued will 
be waived for the purpose of reinstatement (including natural 
progression of the condition since time of issuance). If the insurance 
to be reinstated was issued under 38 U.S.C. 1925(a) and application is 
made within 1 year of the date of lapse, any nonservice-connected 
disability, or service-connected disability which combined with a non-
service-connected disability rendered the insured uninsurable as of 
October 13, 1964, will be waived for the purpose of reinstatement 
(including natural progression).

Sec. 8.9  Application and medical evidence.

    The applicant for reinstatement of National Service Life Insurance, 
during his or her lifetime, and within 5 years after the date of lapse 
if the insurance was issued under 38 U.S.C. 1925, must submit a written 
application signed by him or her and furnish satisfactory evidence of 
health as required in Sec. 8.8 at the time of application. Applicant's 
own statement of comparative health may be accepted as proof of 
insurability for the purpose of reinstatement under Sec. 8.8(a), but, 
whenever deemed necessary in any such case, report of physical 
examination may be required. Applications for reinstatement submitted 
after expiration of the applicable period mentioned in Sec. 8.8(a) must 
be accompanied by satisfactory evidence of good health. If the insurance 
becomes a claim after the tender of the amount necessary to meet 
reinstatement requirements but before full compliance with the 
requirements of this section, and the applicant was in a required state 
of health at the date that he or she made the tender of the amount 
necessary to meet reinstatement requirements, and that there is 
satisfactory reason for his or her noncompliance, the Assistant Director 
for Insurance, VA Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania may, if the 
applicant be dead, waive any or all requirements of this section (except 
payment of the necessary premiums) or, if the applicant be living, allow 
compliance with this section as of the date the required amount 
necessary to reinstate was received by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.

                                Dividends


<R05>
Sec. 8.10  How paid.

    (a) Except as hereinafter provided in this paragraph, a National 
Service Life Insurance policy shall participate in and receive such 
dividends from gains and savings as may be determined by the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs. Dividends becoming payable after January 1, 1952, 
shall be payable on the date preceding the anniversary of the policy 
unless the Secretary shall declare them payable on some other date. 
Dividends are not payable on insurance:
    (1) Issued or reinstated under the provisions of section 602(c)(2) 
of the National Service Life Insurance Act, as amended, where the 
requirements of good health were waived at the time of such issue or 
reinstatement;
    (2) Issued under sections 620 and 621 of the National Service Life 
Insurance Act, as amended;
    (3) Issued under sections 1904(c) and 1922(a) of title 38 U.S.C.;


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1923(b) and 725)

    (4) Issued on the ordinary life plan under section 1904(d) of title 
38 U.S.C., to replace the amount of insurance reduced under a modified 
life plan policy issued under 38 U.S.C. 1904(c); and
    (5) On which premiums are waived, in whole or in part, under the 
provisions of section 622 of the National Service Life Insurance Act, as 
amended, and 38 U.S.C. 1924 for the period during which such premium 
waiver is in effect.
    (b) Unless and until VA receives a written request from the insured 
that National Service Life Insurance dividends be paid in cash, or that 
they be used to pay an insurance indebtedness, or that they be placed on 
deposit or be used to pay premiums in advance, or that they be used to 
pay the premiums

[[Page 499]]

on a particular policy or policies, or that they be used to purchase 
paid-up additions, any such dividends shall be held to the credit of the 
insured to be applied to pay monthly premiums becoming due and unpaid 
after the date such dividends are payable on any National Service or 
United States Government Life Insurance policy or policies held by the 
insured: Provided, That such dividend credits will be applied as of the 
due date of any unpaid premium. Dividend credits will earn interest at 
such rate and in such manner as the Secretary may determine.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1907(a))

    (c) In the event premiums on more than one policy having the same 
premium due date are unpaid and the dividend credit of the insured for 
application to payment of premiums is not sufficient to keep all 
policies in force, in the absence of instructions to the contrary by the 
insured, such dividend credit will be applied to pay premiums in such 
manner as will provide the maximum amount of insurance protection.
    (d) At the expiration of any term period, dividend credit of the 
insured held for payment of premiums will be applied to pay the required 
premium for renewal of term insurance unless the insured requests 
otherwise in writing prior to the expiration of the term period.
    (e) A request for payment of dividends in cash or for other 
disposition will be effective as of the date the request is delivered to 
the Department of Veterans Affairs: If forwarded by mail, properly 
addressed, the postmark date will be taken as the date of delivery: If 
forwarded through military channels by the insured while in military 
service, the date the request is placed in military channels will be 
accepted as the date of delivery. Unless otherwise stipulated by the 
insured, such request will remain in force until revoked in writing 
signed by the insured and delivered to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.
    (f) Dividend credit of the insured held for payment of premiums may 
not be used to satisfy any indebtedness due the United States without 
the insured's consent. If the insured requests payment of such dividend 
credit, or any unused portion thereof, in cash, or requests that such 
credit be left to accumulate on deposit, as provided in paragraph (g) of 
this section, then any indebtedness due the United States, such as 
described in Sec. 5301 of title 38 U.S.C. will be recovered therefrom.
    (g) At the written request of the insured, National Service life 
insurance dividends may be left to accumulate on deposit at interest 
which will be credited in such manner and at such rate as the Secretary 
may determine: Provided, That the policy is in force on a basis other 
than extended term insurance or level premium term insurance. Dividend 
credit of the insured held for payment of premiums or dividends left to 
accumulate on deposit as provided in this paragraph may be applied to 
the payment of premiums in advance upon written request of the insured 
made before default in payment of a premium. Dividends on deposit under 
the provisions of this paragraph will be used in addition to the reserve 
on the policy for the purpose of computing the period of extended term 
insurance or the amount of paid-up insurance as provided in Sec. Sec. 
8.14 and 8.15, respectively. Any dividend credit of a person who no 
longer has insurance in force by payment or waiver of premiums will be 
paid in cash to such person. If a person has a dividend credit option on 
a lapsed level premium term policy or a permanent plan policy on which 
extended term insurance has expired and such person has another policy 
in force by payment or waiver of premiums, any dividend credit or unpaid 
dividends on the lapsed policy, in the absence of instructions from the 
insured to the contrary, will be transferred to the policy which is in 
force and will be held on such policy as a dividend credit. Such 
dividend credit will be deemed to have accrued on the policy which is in 
force. Upon maturity of the policy, any dividend on deposit, any unpaid 
dividend payable in cash, and any dividend credit accruing from such 
policy which cannot be used to pay premiums will be paid to the person 
currently entitled to receive payments under the policy. If the policy 
is not in force at death, any such unpaid dividends and dividend

[[Page 500]]

credits will be paid to the insured's estate.
    (h) Any insured receiving an annual dividend in cash may return such 
dividend check or an equivalent amount of money in order to have the 
dividend retained under the deposit or credit option. The return of such 
dividend must be made during the lifetime of the insured and before the 
end of the calendar year during which the dividend was paid. Dividends 
returned under this provision are not available for the payment of 
premiums, receipt of interest, or calculation of cash value prior to the 
postmark date of the returned check.

policy year thereafter, for which premiums have been paid in full, shall

insurance and all claims thereunder, the United States will pay to the 
insured the cash value of the policy less any indebtedness, provided the 
policy has been in force by payment or waiver of the premiums for at 
least 1 year. Paid-up additions do not have to be in force for 1 year 
before they have cash values. Unless otherwise requested by the insured, 
a surrender will be deemed completed as of the end of the premium month 
in which the application for cash surrender is delivered to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, or as of the date of the check for the 
cash value, whichever is later. If the application is forwarded by mail, 
properly addressed, the postmark date will be taken as the date of

paid or waived, the reserve at the end of the preceding policy year

Sec. 8.13  Policy loans.

    (a) At any time after the premiums for the first policy year have 
been paid and earned and before default in payment of any subsequent 
premium, and upon the execution of a loan agreement satisfactory to the 
Secretary, the United States will lend to the insured on the security of 
his or her National Service Life Insurance policy, any amount which will 
not exceed 94 percent of the reserve, and any indebtedness on the policy 
shall be deducted from the amount advanced on such loan. At any time 
before default in the payment of the premium, the loan may be repaid in 
full or in amounts of $5 or more. Failure to pay either the amount of 
the loan or the interest thereon shall not make the policy voidable 
unless the total indebtedness shall equal or exceed the cash value. When 
the amount of the indebtedness equals or exceeds the cash value, the 
policy shall become voidable. On loans applied for before the effective 
date of this regulation (November 2, 1987) and not exchanged pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, the policy loan interest rate in effect 
when the loan was applied for shall not be increased for the term of the 
loan.

[[Page 502]]

    (b) Loans applied for or exchanged on and after the effective date 
of this regulation (November 2, 1987) shall bear interest at a rate 
which may be varied during the term of the loan, not more frequently 
than once a year, as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
After October 1, 1988, the policy loan rate shall not be varied more 
frequently than once a year. Notification of the initial rate of 
interest on new loans will be forwarded at the time the loan is made. 
Policyholders with existing variable rate loans will be forwarded 
reasonable advance notice of any increase in the rate. Reasonable 
advance notice of any change in the variable loan rate will be published 
in the Federal Register. A notice pertaining to variable loans which is 
sent to the policyholder's last address of record will constitute 
sufficient evidence of notice.
    (c) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, loan 
rates established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall equal 
the yield on the Ten-Year Constant Maturities Index for U.S. Treasury 
Securities for the month of June of the year of calculation rounded down 
to the next whole percentage. Such loan rate shall be effective on the 
date on or after the first day of October on which the rate change is 
made in the insurance automatic data processing system, and shall remain 
in effect for not less than one year after the date of establishment. 
The prevailing variable loan rate shall apply to all loans granted under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the 
variable loan rate shall not exceed 12 percent or be lower than 5 
percent per annum.

<R05>
Sec. 8.14  Provision for extended term insurance--other than 5-year level premium term or limited convertible 5-year level premium term policies.

    (a) After the expiration of the first policy year and upon default 
in the payment of a premium within the grace period, if a permanent plan 
National Service Life Insurance policy other than the modified life plan 
has not been surrendered for cash or for paid-up insurance, the policy 
shall be extended automatically as term insurance. The extended term 
insurance shall be for an amount of the insurance equal to the face 
value of the policy less any indebtedness for such time from the due 
date of the premium in default as the cash value less any indebtedness 
and a charge for administrative cost for insurance issued under 38 
U.S.C. 1925, will purchase when applied as a net single premium at the 
attained age of the insured. For this purpose the attained age is the 
age on the birthday anniversary nearest to the effective date of the 
policy plus the number of years and months from that date to the date

modified life plan and any plan of insurance issued under 38 U.S.C. 
1925, if the policy has been in force by payment or waiver of premiums 
for not less than 3 months nor more than 11 months, the policy shall be 
extended automatically as term insurance. The extended term insurance 
shall be for an amount of insurance equal to the face value of the 
policy less any indebtedness for such time from the due date of the 
premium in default as the reserve of the policy less any indebtedness 
will purchase when applied as a net single premium at the attained age 
of the insured. For this purpose the attained age is the age on the 
birthday anniversary nearest to the effective date of the policy plus 
the number of months from that date to

the date extended term insurance becomes effective. Extended term 
insurance under this provision shall not have a cash or loan value. This 
paragraph shall be effective from and after August 2, 1948.
    (c) Upon default in payment of a premium within the grace period, if 
a modified life plan of National Service Life Insurance has not been 
surrendered for cash or paid-up insurance and if the policy has been in 
force by payment or waiver of premiums for not less than 3 months, or 
for not less than 1 year for insurance issued under 38 U.S.C. 1925, the 
policy shall be extended automatically as of insurance equal to (1) the 
Initial Face Amount of Insurance (face amount of policy in force prior 
to insured's 65th birthday) less any indebtedness, for lapses which 
occur prior to the insured's 65th birthday, or (2) the Ultimate Face 
Amount of Insurance (face amount of policy in force on or after 
insured's 65th birthday) less any indebtedness, for lapses which occur 
on or after the insured's 65th birthday. The extended term insurance 
shall be for an amount of insurance equal to:
    (i) The initial face amount of insurance (face amount of policy in 
force prior to the insured's 65th or 70th birthday, depending on the 
plan of insurance), less any indebtedness, for lapses which occur prior 
to the insured's 65th or 70th birthday, depending on the plan of 
insurance, or
    (ii) The ultimate face amount of insurance (face amount of policy in 
force on or after insured's 65th or 70th birthday, depending on the plan 
of insurance) less any indebtedness, for lapses which occur on or after 
the insured's 65th or 70th birthday, depending on the plan of insurance. 
If a modified life plan policy is on extended term insurance at the end 
of the day preceding the insured's 65th or 70th birthday, depending on 
the plan of insurance, the amount of extended term insurance in effect 
under such policy shall be automatically reduced by one-half thereof. If 
the policy lapsed prior to the end of the first policy year, the 
extended term insurance shall not have a cash or loan value. If the 
policy lapsed after the first policy year, the extended term insurance 
shall not have a loan value, but shall have a cash value.

Sec. 8.15  Provision for paid-up insurance; other than 5-year level premium term or limited convertible 5-year level premium term policies.

    If a National Service Life Insurance policy on any plan other than 
5-year level premium term or limited convertible 5-year level premium 
term plan has not been surrendered for cash, upon written request of the 
insured and complete surrender of the insurance with all claims 
thereunder, after the expiration of the first policy year and while the 
policy is in force under premium-paying conditions, the United States 
will issue paid-up insurance for such amount as the cash value less any 
indebtedness, and a charge for administrative cost for insurance issued 
under 38 U.S.C. 1925, will purchase when applied as a net single premium 
at the attained age of the insured. For this purpose the attained age is 
the age on the birthday anniversary nearest to the effective date of the 
policy plus the number of years and months from that date to the date 
the paid-up insurance becomes effective. Such paid-up insurance will be 
effective as of the expiration of the period for which premiums have 
been paid and earned; and, any premiums paid in advance for months 
subsequent to that in which the application for paid-up insurance is 
made shall be refunded to the insured. The paid-up insurance, if 
eligible to participate in and to receive dividends, shall be with the 
right to dividends. The insured may at any time surrender the paid-up 
policy for its cash value or obtain a loan on such paid-up insurance.

Sec. 8.16  Conversion of a 5-year level premium term policy as provided for under Sec. 1904 of title 38 U.S.C.

    National Service Life Insurance on the level premium term plan which 
is in force may be exchanged for a permanent plan policy upon written 
application by the insured and the payment of the current monthly 
premium at the attained age for the plan of insurance selected (except 
where premium waiver under 38 U.S.C. 1912 is effective). The reserve (if 
any) on the policy will be allowed as a credit on the current monthly 
premium except where premium waiver is effective. Conversion to an 
endowment plan may not be made while the insured is totally disabled. 
The conversion will be made without medical examination, except when 
deemed necessary to determine whether an applicant for conversion to an 
endowment plan is totally disabled, and upon complete surrender of the 
term insurance while in force by payment or waiver of premium.

                  Premium Waivers and Total Disability


<R05>
Sec. 8.17  Discontinuance of premium waiver.

    (a) The Secretary may require proof of continuance of total 
disability at any time the Secretary may deem same necessary. In the 
event it is found that an insured is no longer totally disabled, the 
waiver of premiums shall cease as of the date of such finding, and the 
insurance may be continued by payment of premiums, the due date of the 
first premium payable being the next regular monthly due date of the 
premium under the policy. The insurance shall not lapse prior to the 
date of expiration of the grace period allowed for the payment of such 
premium or prior to the expiration of 31 days after date of notice to 
the insured of the termination of the premium waiver, whichever is the 
later date. Such notice shall be sent by registered mail or by certified 
mail and sufficient notice will be deemed to have been given when such 
letter has been placed in the mails by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs: Provided, That the Secretary may grant an additional period of 
not more than 31 days for payment of the premiums in any case in which 
it is shown that the failure to make payment within 31 days after notice 
as defined in this paragraph was due to circumstances beyond the 
insured's control; but the premiums in any such case must be paid during 
the lifetime of the insured. The failure of the insured to furnish a 
correct current address at which mail will reach him or her promptly 
shall not be grounds for a further extension of time for payment of 
premiums under this section.
    (b) In the event a finding that insured is no longer totally 
disabled is made at the same time a finding is made of total disability 
entitling the insured to a waiver of premiums while so disabled, the 
waiver of premiums shall cease as of the date on which total disability 
ceased and continuance of the insurance in such cases shall be subject 
to the timely payment of the premiums as they become or have become due 
and payable. The due date of the first premium payable subsequent to the 
date total disability ceased is the next regular due date of the premium 
under the policy, and if such premium was not paid within 31 days after 
the due date, the insurance lapsed.
    (c) If the insured shall fail to cooperate with the Secretary in 
securing any evidence he may require to determine whether total 
disability has continued, the premium waiver shall cease effective as of 
the date finding is made of such failure to cooperate, and the insurance 
may be continued by payment of the premiums within 31 days after notice 
of termination as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

beneficiary or optional settlement to be effective must be made by

of Veterans Affairs by the insured or designated agent, and must contain 
sufficient information to identify the insured. A beneficiary 
designation and an optional settlement selection, but not a change of 
beneficiary, may be made by last will and testament duly probated. Upon 
receipt by the Department of Veterans Affairs, a valid designation or 
change of beneficiary or option shall be deemed to be effective as of 
the date of execution. Any payment made before proper notice of 
designation or change of beneficiary has been received in the Department 
of Veterans Affairs shall be deemed to have been properly made and to 
satisfy fully the obligations of the United States under such insurance 
policy to the extent of such payments.

the District of Columbia, or by a duly licensed osteopathic physician 
who is a graduate of a recognized and approved college of osteopathy and 
who is listed in the current directory of the American Osteopathic 
Association. Such examination may be made by a physician or osteopath 
who is not related to the applicant by blood or marriage, associated 
with him or her in business, or pecuniarily interested in the insurance 
or reinstatement of the policy. Examinations made in a foreign country 
by a physician duly licensed for the practice of medicine and otherwise 
acceptable may be accepted if submitted through the American consul. The 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs may require such further medical 
examination or additional medical evidence as may be deemed necessary 
and proper to establish the physical and

her insurance under conditions which would entitle the insured to 
continued insurance protection but for such expiration, such insurance, 
if subject to renewal under this paragraph shall be automatically 
renewed for an additional period of 5 years at the applicable premium 
rate. The renewal of insurance for any successive 5-year period will

a notice of disagreement, any unpaid premiums, normally due under the 
policy from effective date of issue or reinstatement (as appropriate), 
will become an interest-bearing lien, enforceable as a legal debt due 
the United States and subject to all available collection procedures in 
the event of favorable action by the Board.
    (c) Where the adverse action from which appeal is taken involves a

policy issued on a 5-year level premium term plan does not accrue cash 
value (see section 8.14). However, notwithstanding any other provisions 
of this part, reserves have been established to provide for cash value 
for term-capped policies.
    (c) On what basis have the reserve values been established? Reserve 
values have been established based upon the 1980 Commissioners Standard 
Ordinary Basic Table and interest at five per centum per annum in 
accordance with accepted actuarial practices.
    (d) How much cash value does a term-capped policy have? The cash 
value for each policy will depend on the age of the insured, the type of 
policy, and the amount of coverage in force and will be calculated in 
accordance with accepted actuarial practices. For illustrative purposes, 
below are some examples of cash values based upon a $10,000 policy at 
various attained ages for an NSLI ``V'' policy and a VSLI ``RS'' policy:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 Cash value   Cash value
                      Age                          ``V''        ``RS''
------------------------------------------------------------------------
75............................................       $1,494       $1,716
80............................................        3,212        3,358
85............................................        4,786        4,818
90............................................        6,249        6,217
95............................................        8,887        7,286
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) What can be done with this cash value? Upon cancellation or 
lapse of the policy, a policyholder may receive the cash value in a lump 
sum or may use the cash value to purchase paid-up insurance. If a term-
capped policy is kept in force, cash values will continue to grow.
    (f) How much paid-up insurance can be obtained for the cash value? 
The amount of paid-up insurance that can be purchased will depend on the 
amount of cash value that the policy has accrued and will be calculated 
in accordance with accepted actuarial practices. For illustrative 
purposes, below are some examples of paid-up insurance that could be 
purchased by the cash value of a ``V'' and an ``RS'' $10,000 policy at 
various attained ages:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Paid-up      Paid-up
                      Age                          ``V''        ``RS''

75............................................       $2,284       $2,625

85............................................        6,109        6,149
90............................................        7,421        7,115
95............................................        9,331        7,650
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (g) If the policy lapses due to non-payment of the premium, does the 
policyholder nonetheless have a choice of receiving the cash value or 
paid-up insurance? Yes, the policyholder will have that choice, along 
with the option to reinstate the policy (see section 8.10 for 
reinstatement of a policy). However, if a policyholder does not make a 
selection, VA will apply the cash value to purchase paid-up insurance. 
Paid-up insurance may be surrendered for cash at any time.
    (h) If a policyholder elects to receive either the cash surrender or 
paid-up insurance due to lapse or voluntary cancellation of a term-
capped policy, may the original term-capped policy be reinstated? Yes, 
the term-capped policy may be reinstated but the policyholder, in 
addition to meeting the reinstatement requirements of term policies, 
must also pay the current reserve value of the reinstated policy.

on August 11, 1971, or on the date of approval of his or her grant, 
whichever date is the later date, but such insurance did not become 
effective because he or she was not obligated under a mortgage loan on

failed to timely respond to a request for information on which his or 
her premium could be based, the insurance will be effective on a date 
agreed upon by the veteran and the Secretary, but only if the veteran 
files an application in writing with the Department of Veterans Affairs 
for such insurance, submits evidence that he or she meets the health 
requirements of the Secretary, together with information on which his or 
her premiums can be based, and is or becomes obligated under a mortgage

insurance will be effective upon a date requested by the veteran and 
agreed to by the Secretary, but only if the eligible veteran files an

his or her premium can be based, and is or becomes obligated under a 
mortgage loan on the date the insurance is to become effective.

refinances the mortgage loan which is the basis for such insurance on 
his or her life, any increase in the amount of insurance or any delay in 
the rate of reduction of insurance will be effective only if the 
eligible veteran files an application for insurance, submits evidence 
that he or she meets the health requirements of the Secretary, and 
furnishes information on which his or her premium can be based.

Sec. 8a.4  Coverage.

    (a) The amount of VMLI in force on his or her life at any one time 
shall be reduced simultaneously (1) with the reduction in the principal 
of the mortgage loan, whether or not the mortgage loan is amortized, and 
(2) in addition, if the mortgage loan is amortized, according to the 
schedule for the reduction of the principal of the mortgage loan whether 
or not the schedule payments are timely made.
    (b) If the amount of the mortgage loan exceeds $90,000, or the 
reduced maximum amount of insurance available to an eligible veteran, 
whichever amount is the lesser, the amount of insurance in force on the 
life of the veteran shall remain at a constant level until the principal 
amount of the mortgage loan which is basis for establishing the amount 
of insurance is reduced to $90,000, or to the amount of the reduced 
maximum amount of insurance available to the veteran, at which time the 
amount of insurance in force on his or her life shall be reduced in 
accordance with the schedule for the reduction of the principal of the 
mortgage loan, and whether or not the scheduled payments are timely 
made.
    (c) Subject to the $90,000 maximum amount of insurance, and to the 
reduced maximum amount of insurance available to the eligible veteran, 
he or she is entitled to be insured under VMLI or to apply for such 
insurance as often as he or she becomes obligated under a mortgage loan 
or a refinanced mortgage loan on a housing unit or a successor housing 
unit owned and occupied by the eligible veteran. Where a veteran who is 
not automatically insured under VMLI applies for such insurance, he or 
she shall be required to meet the health standards and other conditions 
established by the Secretary for such insureds.

Sec. 9.3  Waiver or reduction of coverage.

    (a) Full-time coverage which is in effect will terminate or be 
reduced at midnight of the last day of the month a member's written 
notice requesting such termination or reduction is received by his or 
her uniformed service.

[[Page 515]]

In the case of a member paying premiums directly to the administrative 
office, full-time coverage will terminate or be reduced as of the last 
day of the month for which the last full premium was paid. Termination 
or reduction of coverage is effective for the entire remaining period of 
active duty unless the member reinstates his or her coverage under the 
provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1967(c). If, following termination of duty, a 
member reenters duty (in the same or another uniformed service), a 
waiver or reduction for the previous period of duty will not apply to 
the subsequent period of duty.
    (b) Part-time coverage will terminate or be reduced at the end of 
the last day of the period of duty then being performed if the member is 
on active duty or active duty for training when the waiver or reduction 
is filed; at the end of the period of inactive duty training then being 
performed if the member is on inactive duty training when the waiver or 
reduction is filed; or on the date the waiver or reduction is received 
by his or her uniformed service if the member is not on active duty, 
active duty for training; or inactive duty training on the date the 
waiver or reduction is filed.
    (1) When a member insured under part-time coverage waives his or her 
right to group coverage or elects a reduced amount of insurance, such 
waiver or election, unless changed, is effective throughout the period 
of the member's continuous reserve obligation in the same uniformed 
service. If, following termination of duty, the member reenters duty or 
resumes the obligation to perform duty (in the same or another uniformed 
service), the waiver or reduction will not apply to the subsequent 
period of duty or obligation.
    (2) If a reservist insured under part-time coverage is called or 
ordered to active duty or active duty for training under a call or order 
that does not specify a period of less than 31 days and is separated or 
released from such duty and then resumes his or her reserve obligation, 
any waiver or election of reduced coverage made while eligible for part-
time coverage, unless changed, shall be effective throughout the entire 
period of part-time coverage, the active duty or active duty for

resumed reserve obligation.
    (3) If a member, other than a member referred to in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, upon termination of duty qualifying him or her for 
full-time coverage assumes an obligation to perform duty as a reservist, 
any waiver or election previously made by the member shall not apply to 
coverage arising from his or her reservist obligation. Furthermore, 
during the 120 days following termination of such duty the full-time 
coverage shall not be reduced by any waiver or election made by a member 
as a reservist.

    Any designation of beneficiary or election of settlement options is 
subject to the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1970 and 1977 and the following 
provisions:
    (a) Any designation of beneficiary or settlement option election 
made by any member insured under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance 
for full-time coverage or part-time coverage will remain in effect until 
properly changed by the member or canceled automatically for any of the 
following reasons:
    (1) The insurance terminates following separation or release from 
all duty in a uniformed service.
    (2) The member enters on duty in another uniformed service.
    (3) The member reenters on duty in the same uniformed service more 
than 1 calendar day after separation or release from all duty in that 
uniformed service.
    (b) A change of beneficiary may be made at any time and without the 
knowledge or consent of the previous beneficiary.
    (c) Until and unless otherwise changed, a beneficiary designation 
and settlement option election of record on the date a statutory 
increase in coverage takes effect shall be considered to be a 
beneficiary and optional settlement election for the increased amount as 
well, and any beneficiary named therein shall be entitled to the same

Sec. 9.5  Payment of proceeds.

    Proceeds shall be paid in accordance with provisions set forth in 38 
U.S.C. 1970 and the following provisions:
    (a) If proceeds are to be paid in installments, the first 
installment will be payable as of the date of death. The amount of each 
installment will be computed so as to include interest on the unpaid 
balance at the then effective rate.
    (b) If, following the death of an insured member who has designated 
both principal and contingent beneficiaries and elected to have payment 
made in 36 equal monthly installments, the principal beneficiary dies 
before all 36 installments have been paid, the remaining installments 
will be paid as they fall due to the contingent beneficiary. At the 
death of such a contingent beneficiary, and in other instances of a 
beneficiary's death, where there is no contingent beneficiary, the value 
of any unpaid installments, discounted to the date of his or her death 
at the same rate used for inclusion of interest in the computation of 
installments will be paid, without further accrual of interest, in one 
sum to the estate of the beneficiary or continent beneficiary last 
receiving payment.
    (c) In instances where payment in installments is made at the 
election of the beneficiary, upon his or her request, the value of such 
installments as remain unpaid will be discounted to the date of payment 
at the same rate used for inclusion of interest in the computation of 
installments and paid to him or her in one sum.
    (d) If a member whose coverage is extended due to total disability 
converts the group insurance to an individual policy which is effective 
before he or she ceases to be totally disabled or before the end of 1 
year following termination of duty, whichever is earlier, and dies while 
group insurance would be in effect, except for such conversion, the 
group insurance will be payable, provided the individual policy is 
surrendered for a return of premiums and without further claim. When 
there is no such surrender, any amount of group insurance in excess of 
the amount of the individual policy will be payable.

Sec. 9.7  Administrative decisions.

    (a) Determinations of the Department of Veterans Affairs are 
conclusive under the policy with respect to the following:
    (1) The status of any person being within the term member and 
whether or not he or she is covered at any point of time under the 
policy including traveltime under 38 U.S.C. 1967(b) and death within 120 
days thereafter from a disability incurred or aggravated while on duty.
    (2) The fact and date of a member's termination of active duty, or 
active duty for training, and the fact, date and hours of a member's 
performance of inactive duty training.
    (3) The fact and dates with respect to a member's absence without 
leave, confinement by civilian authorities under a sentence adjudged by 
a civil court, or confinement by military authorities under a court-
martial sentence involving total forfeiture of pay and allowances.
    (4) The operation of the forfeiture provision provided in 38 U.S.C. 
1973 with respect to any member.
    (5) The existence of total disability or insurability at standard 
premium rates under 38 U.S.C. 1968.
    (b) When determination is required on a claim that a member who 
waived coverage, or whose coverage was forfeited for one of the offenses 
listed under 38 U.S.C. 1973 was in fact insured,

[[Page 517]]

or that a member who elected to be insured was insured for an amount 
greater than the amount shown in the record, and there is no record of 
an application to be insured or to increase the amount of insurance as 
required under 38 U.S.C. 1967(c):
    (1) The person making the claim will be required to submit all 
evidence available concerning the member's actions and intentions with 
respect to Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance or Veterans' Group Life 
Insurance.
    (2) Request will be made to the member's uniformed service and any 
other likely source of information considered necessary, for whatever 
evidence in the form of copies of payroll or personnel records, 
statements of persons having knowledge of the facts, etc., is essential 
to a decision in the matter.

Based on the evidence obtained, a formal determination will be made as 
to whether the member involved is deemed to have applied to be insured, 
or to be insured for an amount other than the amount shown in the 
record. The determination will include a finding as to the member's 
health status for insurance purposes based on the evidence available.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1967)

    (c) In making the determination required under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the following will be considered:
    (1) The possibility that due to widespread geographic distribution, 
inadequate means of communication and the nature of the group insurance 
program, members may not be adequately and accurately informed, 
especially in time of war or military emergency, about the detailed 
requirements for obtaining insurance protection.
    (2) Payroll deductions made without objection by a member, following 
waiver or termination of coverage, representing premiums for insurance 
or additional insurance, may, by virtue of continuity or the 
circumstances surrounding their initiation, be indicative that the 
member did apply. Such deductions without a formal application of record 
may be considered as evidence that the member's application was not in 
proper form or misplaced. They may also be considered as evidence that 
an application was not made solely because of erroneous or incomplete 
counseling or absence of counseling on the part of the responsible 
personnel of the uniformed service.
    (d) Questions for determination under this section as well as those 
involving coverage of groups and classes of members and other questions 
are properly referable to the Assistant Director for Insurance. 
Authority to make any determinations required under this section is 
delegated to the Under Secretary for Benefits and Assistant Director for 
Insurance.

38 U.S.C. 1968 and Sec. 9.3 of this part and the following provisions:
    (a) In the case of a member whose coverage is forfeited under 38 
U.S.C. 1973, coverage terminates at the end of the day preceding the day 
on which the act or omission forming the basis for such forfeiture 
occurred.
    (b) In the event of discontinuance of the group policy, coverage 
terminates at the end of the day preceding the date of the 
discontinuance of the policy except for those members who are insured 
under Veterans' Group Life Insurance in which event coverage terminates 
at the expiration of the day preceding the anniversary of the effective 
date of such insurance which first occurs, 90 days or more after the 
discontinuance of the group policy.

Sec. 9.9  Conversion privilege.

    (a) With respect to a member on active duty or active duty for 
training under a call or order to duty that specifies a period of less 
than 31 days, and a member insured during inactive duty training 
scheduled in advance by competent authority there shall be no right of 
conversion unless the insurance is continued in force under 38

[[Page 518]]

U.S.C. 1967(b) or 1968(a) for 120 days following a period of such duty, 
as the result of a disability incurred or aggravated during such a 
period of duty.
    (b) The individual policy of life insurance to which an insured may 
convert under 38 U.S.C. 1968(b) or 1977(e) shall not have disability or 
other supplementary benefits and shall not be term insurance or any 
policy which does not provide for cash values. Term riders providing 
level or decreasing insurance for which an additional premium is charged 
may be attached to an eligible basic conversion policy, but the rider 
will be excluded from the conversion pool agreement under the policy.
    (c) The insurer will establish a conversion pool in cooperation with 
the reinsurers and converters in accordance with the terms of the 
policy. Its purpose will be to provide for the determination and 
maintenance of appropriate charges arising from excess mortality under 
individual conversion policies issued in accordance with this section 
and provide for the appropriate distribution of the risk of loss due to 
such excess mortality among the reinsurers and converters.

Sec. 9.10  Health standards.

    (a) For the purpose of determining if a member who incurred a 
disability or aggravated a preexisting disability during a period of 
active duty or active duty for training under a call to duty specifying 
a period of less than 31 days or during a period of inactive duty was 
rendered uninsurable at standard premium rates, the underwriting 
criteria used by the insurer in determining good health for persons 
applying to it for life insurance in amounts not exceeding the maximum 
amount of coverage then available under 38 U.S.C. 1967 will be used.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1967)

    (b) For all other purposes of determining if a member meets the 
necessary health requirements except paragraph (a) of this section, the 
underwriting criteria used by the insurer in determining good health for 
group life insurance purposes will be used.

Sec. 9.11  Criteria for reinsurers and converters.

    The following criteria will control eligibility for reinsuring and 
converting companies:
    (a) The company must be a legal reserve life insurance company as 
classified by the insurance supervisory authorities of the State of 
domicile. Qualified fraternal organizations are included.
    (b) The company must have been in the life insurance business for a 
continuous period of 5 years prior to October 1, 1965, or the December 
31 preceding any redeterminations of the allocations. In the event of a 
merger, the 5-year requirement may be satisfied by either the surviving 
company or by one of the absorbed companies. Upon joint application by a 
subsidiary of a participating company, together with the parent company, 
the 5-year requirement may be waived provided such parent company owns 
more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock of the subsidiary and has 
been a legal reserve life insurance company for a period of 10 years or 
more.
    (c) The company must be licensed to engage in life insurance in at 
least one State of the United States or the District of Columbia.
    (d) The company will not be one: (1) Certified by the Department of 
Defense as being under suspension for cause for purpose of allotment or 
on-base solicitation privileges.
    (2) That solicits life insurance applications as conversion or other 
replacement of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance or Veterans' Group 
Life Insurance coverage in jurisdictions in which it is not licensed.
    (3) That fails to take effective action to correct an improper 
practice followed by it or its agents within 30 days after written 
receipt of notice issued by the insurer or the Assistant Director for 
Insurance. Improper practice includes:
    (i) The use for solicitation purposes of lists of names and 
addresses of

[[Page 519]]

former members without obtaining reasonable assurance that such lists 
have not been obtained contrary to regulations of the Department of 
Defense or other uniformed service;
    (ii) Failure to reveal sources and copies of mailing lists upon 
proper request or to otherwise cooperate in an authorized investigation 
of a reported improper practice;
    (iii) The use of written or oral representations which may mislead 
the person addressed as to the true role of the company or its 
representatives as one of the participating companies;
    (iv) The use of written or oral representations which may mislead 
the person addressed as to rights, privileges, coverage, premiums, or 
similar matters under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, Veterans' 
Group Life Insurance, or any policy issued or proposed to be issued as a 
conversion or other replacement coverage;
    (v) Violation of regulations of a uniformed service concerning 
solicitation of life insurance; and
    (vi) The use of written or oral references to Servicemembers' Group 
Life Insurance, Veterans' Group Life Insurance or conversions of 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance or Veterans' Group Life Insurance 
in connection with the attempted sale of an insurance policy which would 
not be, in fact, a conversion policy or a policy issued in lieu of a 
conversion, if those references might lead a person addressed to believe 
there is a connection between the policy being sold and coverage under 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, Veterans' Group Life Insurance or 
a conversion of it.
    (e) Each reinsuring and converting company must agree to issue 
conversion policies to any qualified applicant regardless of race, 
color, religion, sex, or national origin, under terms and conditions 
established by the primary insurer.

Sec. 9.12  Reinsurance formula.

    The allocation of insurance to the insurer and each reinsurer will 
be based upon the following:
    (a) An amount of the total life insurance in force under the policy 
in proportion to the company's total life insurance in force in the 
United States where:

    The first $100 million in force is counted in full,
    The second $100 million in force is counted at 75 percent,
    The third $100 million in force is counted at 50 percent,
    The fourth $100 million in force is counted at 25 percent,
    And any amount above $400 million in force is counted at 5 percent.

    (b) The allocation will be redetermined at the beginning of each 
policy year for the primary insurer and the companies then reinsuring, 
with the portion as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section based 
upon the corresponding in force (excluding the Servicemembers' Group 
Life Insurance in force) as of the preceding December 31.
    (c) Any life insurance company, which is not initially participating 
in reinsurance or conversions, but satisfies the criteria set forth in 
Sec. 9.11, may subsequently apply to the primary insurer to reinsure 
and convert, or to convert only. The participation of such company will 
be effective as of the beginning of the policy year following the date 
on which application is approved by the insurer.

brought against the insurer.

Sec. 9.14  Accelerated Benefits.

    (a) What is an Accelerated Benefit? An Accelerated Benefit is a 
payment of a portion of your Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance or 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance to you before you die.
    (b) Who is eligible to receive an Accelerated Benefit? You are 
eligible to receive

[[Page 520]]

an Accelerated Benefit if you have a valid written medical prognosis 
from a physician of 9 months or less to live, and otherwise comply with 
the provisions of this section.
    (c) Who can apply for an Accelerated Benefit? Only you, the insured 
member, can apply for an Accelerated Benefit. No one can apply on your 
behalf.
    (d) How much can you request as an Accelerated Benefit? (1) You can 
request as an Accelerated Benefit an amount up to a maximum of 50% of 
the face value of your insurance coverage.
    (2) Your request for an Accelerated Benefit must be $5,000 or a 
multiple of $5000 (for example, $10,000, $15,000).
    (e) How much can you receive as an Accelerated Benefit? You can 
receive as an Accelerated Benefit the amount you request up to a maximum 
of 50% of the face value of your insurance coverage, minus the interest 
reduction. The interest reduction is the amount the Office of 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance actuarially determines to be the 
amount of interest that would be lost because of the early payment of 
part of your insurance coverage. This means that if you have $100,000 in 
coverage and you request the maximum amount that you are eligible to 
request as an Accelerated Benefit, you will be paid $50,000 minus the 
interest reduction.
    (f) How do you apply for an Accelerated Benefit? (1) You can obtain 
an application form entitled ``Claim for Accelerated Benefits'' by 
writing the Office of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, 290 W. Mt.

duty servicemember, your branch of service will also be required to

member was deployed outside of the United States on orders in support of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom or served in a geographic location that

of itself.
    (c) What is a traumatic injury? (1) A traumatic injury is physical 
damage to a living body that is caused by a traumatic event as defined 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the term ``traumatic injury'' does 
not include damage to a living body caused by--
    (i) A mental disorder; or
    (ii) A mental or physical illness or disease, except if the physical 
illness or disease is caused by a pyogenic infection, biological, 
chemical, or radiological weapons, or accidental ingestion of a 
contaminated substance.
    (3) For purposes of this section, all traumatic injuries will be 
considered to have occurred at the same time as the traumatic event.
    (d) What are the eligibility requirements for payment of traumatic 
injury protection benefits? You must meet all of the following 
requirements in order to be eligible for traumatic injury protection 
benefits.
    (1) You must be a member of the uniformed services who is insured by 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance under section 1967(a)(1)(A)(i), (B) 
or (C)(i) of title 38, United States Code, on the date you sustained a 
traumatic injury, except if you are a member who experienced a traumatic 
injury on or after October 7, 2001, through and including December 1, 
2005, and your scheduled loss was a direct result of injuries incurred 
in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom. (For this 
purpose, you will be considered a member of the uniformed services until 
midnight on the date of termination of your duty status in the uniformed 
services that established your eligibility for Servicemembers' Group 
Life Insurance, notwithstanding an extension of your Servicemembers' 
Group Life Insurance coverage under section 1968(a) of title 38, United 
States Code.)
    (2) You must suffer a scheduled loss that is a direct result of a 
traumatic injury and no other cause.
    (3) You must survive for a period not less than seven full days from 
the date of the traumatic injury. The seven day period begins on the 
date and Zulu (Greenwich Meridean) time of the traumatic injury and ends 
168 full hours later.
    (4) You must suffer a scheduled loss under paragraph (e)(7) of this 
section within two years of the traumatic injury.
    (e) What is a scheduled loss and what amount will be paid because of 
that loss? (1) The term ``scheduled loss'' means a condition listed in 
the schedule in paragraph (e)(7) of this section if directly caused by a 
traumatic injury. A scheduled loss is payable at the amount specified in 
the schedule.
    (2) The maximum amount payable under the schedule for all losses 
resulting from traumatic events occurring within a seven-day period is 
$100,000. We will calculate the seven-day period beginning with the day 
on which the first traumatic event occurs.
    (3) A benefit will not be paid if a scheduled loss is due to a 
traumatic injury--
    (i) Caused by--
    (A) The member's attempted suicide, while sane or insane;
    (B) An intentionally self-inflicted injury or an attempt to inflict 
such injury;
    (C) Medical or surgical treatment of an illness or disease;
    (D) Willful use of an illegal or controlled substance, unless 
administered or consumed on the advice of a medical doctor; or
    (ii) Sustained while a member was committing or attempting to commit 
a felony.
    (4) A benefit will not be paid for a scheduled loss resulting from--

[[Page 523]]

    (i) A physical or mental illness or disease, whether or not caused 
by a traumatic injury, other than a pyogenic infection or physical 
illness or disease caused by biological, chemical, or radiological 
weapons or accidental ingestion of a contaminated substance; or
    (ii) A mental disorder whether or not caused by a traumatic injury.
    (5) Amount Payable under the Schedule of Losses. (i) The maximum 
amount payable for all scheduled losses resulting from a single 
traumatic event is limited to $100,000. For example, if a traumatic 
event on April 1, 2006, results in the immediate total and permanent 
loss of sight in both eyes, and the loss of one foot on May 1, 2006, as 
a direct result of the same traumatic event, the member will be paid 
$100,000.
    (ii) If a member suffers more than one scheduled loss as a result of 
a single traumatic event, payment will be made for the scheduled loss 
with the highest benefit amount.
    (iii) If a member suffers more than one scheduled loss from separate 
traumatic events occurring more than seven full days apart, the 
scheduled losses will be considered separately and a benefit will be 
paid for each loss up to the maximum amount according to the schedule. 
For example, if a member suffers the loss of one foot at or above the 
ankle on May 1, 2006, from one event, the member will be paid $50,000. 
If the same member suffers loss of sight in both eyes from an event that 
occurred on November 1, 2006, the member will be paid an additional 
$100,000.
    (6) Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(6)--

    (f) Who will determine eligibility for traumatic injury protection 
benefits? Each uniformed service will certify its own members for 
traumatic injury protection benefits based upon section 1032 of Public 
Law 109-13, section 501 of Public Law 109-233, and this section. The 
uniformed service will certify whether you were at the time of the 
traumatic injury insured under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance and 
whether you have sustained a qualifying loss.
    (g) How does a member make a claim for traumatic injury protection 
benefits? (1)(i) A member who believes he or she qualifies for traumatic 
injury protection benefits must complete Part A of the Certification of 
Traumatic Injury Protection Form and sign the form.
    (ii) If a member is unable to do so, anyone acting on the member's 
behalf may request a Certification of Traumatic Injury Protection Form 
from the uniformed service. However, the Certification of Traumatic 
Injury Protection Form must be signed by the member, the member's 
guardian, or the member's attorney-in-fact.
    (iii) If a member suffered a scheduled loss as a direct result of 
the traumatic injury, survived seven full days from the date of the 
traumatic event, and then died before the maximum benefit for which the 
service member qualifies is paid the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the 
member's Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance policy should complete a 
Certification of Traumatic Injury Protection Form.
    (2) If a member seeks traumatic injury protection benefits for a 
scheduled loss occurring after submission of a completed Certification 
of Traumatic Injury Protection Form for a different scheduled loss, the 
member must submit a completed Certification of Traumatic Injury 
Protection Form for the new scheduled loss and for each scheduled loss 
that occurs thereafter. For example, if a member seeks traumatic injury 
protection benefits for a scheduled loss due to coma from traumatic 
injury and/or the inability to carry out activities of daily living due 
to traumatic brain injury (Sec. 9.20(e)(7)(xxxvii)), or the inability 
to carry out activities of daily living due to loss directly resulting 
from a traumatic injury other than an injury to the brain (Sec. 
9.20(e)(7)(xliv)), a completed Certification of Traumatic Injury 
Protection Form must be submitted for each increment of time for which 
TSGLI is payable. Also, for example, if a service member suffers a 
scheduled loss due to a coma, a completed Certification of Traumatic 
Injury Protection Form should be filed after the 15th consecutive day 
that the member is in the coma, for which $25,000 is payable. If the 
member remains in a coma for another 15 days, another completed 
Certification of Traumatic Injury Protection Form should be submitted 
and another $25,000 will be paid.
    (h) How does a member or beneficiary appeal an adverse eligibility 
determination? (1) Notice of a decision regarding a member's eligibility 
for traumatic injury protection benefits will include an explanation of 
the procedure for obtaining review of the decision. An appeal of an 
eligibility determination, such as whether the loss occurred within 365 
days of the traumatic injury, whether the injury was self-inflicted or 
whether a loss of hearing was total and permanent, must be in writing. 
An appeal must be submitted by a member or a member's legal 
representative or by the beneficiary or the beneficiary's legal 
representative, within one year of the date of a denial of eligibility, 
to the office of the uniformed service identified in the decision 
regarding the member's eligibility for the benefit.
    (2) An appeal regarding whether a member was insured under 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance when the traumatic injury was 
sustained must be in writing. An appeal must be submitted by a member or 
a member's legal representative or by the beneficiary or the 
beneficiary's legal representative within one year of the date of a 
denial of eligibility to the Office of Servicemembers' Group Life 
Insurance.
    (3) Nothing in this section precludes a member from pursuing legal 
remedies under 38 U.S.C. 1975 and 38 CFR 9.13.
    (i) Who will be paid the traumatic injury protection benefit? The 
injured member who suffered a scheduled loss will be paid the traumatic 
injury protection benefit in accordance with title

[[Page 526]]

38 U.S.C. 1980A except under the following circumstances:
    (1) If a member is legally incapacitated, the member's guardian or 
attorney-in-fact will be paid the benefit on behalf of the member.
    (2) If a member dies before payment is made, the beneficiary or 
beneficiaries who will be paid the benefit will be determined in 
accordance with 38 U.S.C. 1970(a).
    (j) The Traumatic Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program will 
be administered in accordance with this rule, except to the extent that

                     Adjusted Compensation; General


<R05>
Sec. 10.0  Adjusted service pay entitlements.

    A veteran entitled to adjusted service pay is one whose adjusted 
service credit does not amount to more than $50 as distinguished from a 
veteran whose adjusted service credit exceeds $50 and who therefore is 
entitled to an adjusted service certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 10.1  Issuance of duplicate adjusted service certificate without bond.

    If the veteran named in an adjusted service certificate issued 
pursuant to the provisions of section 501 of the World War Adjusted 
Compensation Act, without bad faith, has not received such certificate, 
or if prior to receipt by the veteran such certificate was destroyed 
wholly or in part or was so defaced as to impair its value, or, if after 
delivery it was partially destroyed or defaced so as to impair its value 
but

[[Page 527]]

can be identified to the satisfaction of the Secretary, a duplicate 
adjusted service certificate will be issued upon application and a bond 
of indemnity will not be required: Provided, That if the adjusted 
service certificate was destroyed in part or so defaced as to impair its 
value, the veteran or person entitled to payment thereon will be 
required to surrender to the Department of Veterans Affairs the original 
certificate or so much thereof as may remain.


<R05>
Sec. 10.2  Evidence required of loss, destruction or mutilation of adjusted service certificate.

    The veteran named in an adjusted service certificate issued pursuant 
to the provisions of section 501 of the World War Adjusted Compensation 
Act, or the person entitled to payment thereon will be required to 
furnish evidence of the nonreceipt of the adjusted service certificate, 
or of its receipt in a mutilated or defaced condition, or of the loss or 
destruction in whole or in part of defacement of the certificate after 
its receipt, as the case may be. The evidence must be sufficient to 
establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that neither the veteran 
nor the person entitled to payment thereon, or any person for or on 
their behalf, received the adjusted service certificate, or that at the 
time of its receipt it was mutilated or defaced to such an extent as to 
impair its value, or that after receipt of the certificate it was lost 
or destroyed in whole or in part or defaced, but without bad faith on 
the part of the veteran, and that every effort has been made to recover 
the lost certificate. Unless determination is otherwise made by the 
Secretary the evidence must be in the form of a written statement sworn 
to by the veteran or person entitled to payment thereon and witnessed by 
at least two persons who shall state, under oath that they personally 
know the affiant, that they have read his or her statement and that it 
is true to the best of their knowledge and belief. These statements 
should be supplemented by affidavits of any persons having personal 
knowledge of additional facts and circumstances concerning the matter, 
and the Secretary may require any additional evidence deemed necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 10.3  Issuance of duplicate adjusted service certificate with bond.

    An indemnity bond will be required as a prerequisite to the issuance 
of a duplicate adjusted service certificate in all cases where the 
certificate was lost after receipt by the veteran, or after receipt by 
the veteran was defaced or mutilated and cannot be identified to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary, provided the loss, defacement, or 
mutilation was without bad faith on the part of the veteran or the 
person entitled to payment thereon. The bond must be in the manner and 
form prescribed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and for an amount 
equal to the face value of the certificate, with surety or sureties 
residents of the United States and satisfactory to the Secretary, with 
condition to indemnify and save harmless the United States from any 
claim on account of such certificate. If the certificate was defaced or 
mutilated the veteran or person entitled to payment thereon will be 
required to surrender to the Department of Veterans Affairs the 
certificate or so much thereof as may remain.


<R05>
Sec. 10.4  Loss, destruction, or mutilation of adjusted service certificate while in possession of Department of Veterans Affairs.

    A new adjusted service certificate will be issued without bond in 
lieu of the certificate which has been lost or destroyed, or has been 
mutilated, defaced or damaged so as to impair its value, while in 
possession of the Department of Veterans Affairs.


<R05>
Sec. 10.15  Designation of more than one beneficiary under an adjusted service certificate.

    A veteran to whom an adjusted service certificate has been issued 
pursuant to the provisions of section 501 of the World War Adjusted 
Compensation Act may name more than one beneficiary to receive the 
proceeds of his adjusted service certificate, and may from time to time 
with the approval of the Secretary change such beneficiaries. The 
designated beneficiaries shall share equally unless otherwise specified 
by the veteran. Wherever the word beneficiary appears in the law and 
Department of Veterans Affairs regulations it

[[Page 528]]

valid must be made:
    (a) By notice signed by the veteran or his duly authorized agent, 
and delivered or properly mailed to the Department of Veterans Affairs 
during the lifetime of the veteran. Such change shall not take effect 
until approved by the Secretary and after such approval the change shall 
be deemed to have been made as of the date the veteran signed said 
written notice and change, whether the veteran be living at the time of 
said approval or not.
    (b) Or by last will and testament of the veteran, duly probated. 
Such change shall not be effective until received by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and approved by the Secretary and after such approval 
the change shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of death of 
the veteran: Provided, That a change of beneficiary signed subsequent to 
the date upon which the will was executed and delivered in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section shall if approved in accordance with 
regulations take precedence over the designation by will.

Provided, however, That any payment made to a beneficiary of record,

Department of Veterans Affairs and approved by the Secretary, shall not 
be made again to the changed beneficiary.


<R05>
Sec. 10.17  Designation of beneficiary subsequent to cancellation of previous designation.

made.


<R05>

Loans by Banks on Adjusted Service Certificates Under Section 502 of the 
                   World War Adjusted Compensation Act

    Source: 13 FR 7125, Nov. 27, 1948, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 11.75  Certificates.

    Adjusted service certificates are dated as of the 1st day of the 
month in which the applications were filed, but no certificates are 
dated prior to January 1, 1925. Loans on the security of such 
certificates may be made at any time after the date of the certificate. 
The fact that a certificate is stamped or marked ``duplicate'' does not 
destroy its value as security for a loan.


<R05>
Sec. 11.76  To whom loan may be made.

    Only the veteran named in the certificate can lawfully obtain a loan 
on his adjusted service certificate and neither the beneficiary nor any 
other person than the veteran has any rights in this respect. The person 
to whom the loan is made must be known to the lending bank to be the 
veteran named in the certificate securing such note. The consent of the 
beneficiary is not required, the act providing that a loan on the 
security of the certificate may be made ``with or without the consent of 
the beneficiary thereof.'' Loans may be made to veterans adjudged 
incompetent only through the guardians of such veterans and pursuant to 
specific order of the court having jurisdiction. Certified copy of court 
order must be submitted if note be presented for redemption by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.


<R05>
Sec. 11.77  By whom loans may be made.

    Any national bank or any bank or trust company incorporated under 
the laws of any State, Territory, possession, or the District of 
Columbia, hereinafter referred to as any bank, is authorized to loan to 
any veteran upon his promissory note secured by his Adjusted Service 
Certificate any amount not in excess of the loan value of the 
certificate at the date the loan is made. Each certificate contains on 
its face a table for determining the loan value of the certificate, but 
it is provided by amendment to the World War Adjusted Compensation Act 
dated February 27, 1931, that the loan value of any certificate shall at 
no time be less than 50 percent of the face value. Upon the making of 
such loan, the lending bank shall promptly notify the Department of 
Veterans Affairs of the name of the veteran, the A-number shown

[[Page 535]]

immediately after the name, the number of the certificate, the amount, 
the rate of interest, and date of loan: However, this requirement may be 
waived by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.


<R05>
Sec. 11.80  Sale or discount of note by holding bank.

    Any bank holding a note secured by an Adjusted Service Certificate 
may sell the note to any bank authorized to make a loan to a veteran and 
deliver the certificate to such bank. In case a note secured by an 
Adjusted Service Certificate is sold or transferred, the bank selling, 
discounting or rediscounting the note is required by law to notify the 
veteran promptly by mail at his last known post office address. No 
Adjusted Service Certificate is negotiable or assignable, or may serve 
as security for a loan, except as provided in section 502 of the World 
War Adjusted Compensation Act, as amended. Any negotiation, assignment 
or loan made in violation of section 502 of the World War Adjusted 
Compensation Act is void. In case of sale, discount or rediscount by the 
bank which made the loan, the note or notes should be accompanied by the 
affidavit required by Sec. 11.85.


<R05>
Sec. 11.81  Rediscounts with Federal Reserve Banks.

    Upon the endorsement of any bank, which shall be deemed a waiver of 
demand, notice and protest by such bank as to its own endorsement 
exclusively, and subject to regulations to be prescribed by the Federal 
Reserve Board, any such note secured by an Adjusted Service Certificate 
and held by a bank is made eligible for discount or rediscount by the 
Federal reserve bank of the Federal reserve district in which such bank 
is located, whether or not the bank offering the note for discount or 
rediscount is a member of the Federal Reserve System and whether or not 
it acquired the note in the first instance from the veteran or acquired 
it by transfer upon the endorsement of any other bank: Provided, That at 
the time of discount or rediscount such note has a maturity not in 
excess of 9 months, exclusive of days of grace, and complies in all 
other respects with the provisions of the law, the regulations of the 
Federal Reserve Board and the regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 11.83  Additional loans by reason of 50 percent loan value.

    (a) It will be the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
redeem all loans made in accordance with the law and regulations made 
pursuant thereto, when such loans are made in good faith to the veteran 
to whom the certificate was issued. If, while his certificate is held by 
a bank as security for a loan, the veteran applies for the increased 
loan value authorized by the amendment to the World War Adjusted 
Compensation Act dated February 27, 1931, whether or not the loan has 
matured, the veteran and the bank will be informed fully of the 
provisions of this section and that the bank may make the loan for the 
additional amount or, upon request of the veteran, may send the note and 
certificate to the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs. The Secretary shall, 
if the loan was legally made, accept such certificate and note, and pay 
to the bank in full satisfaction of its claim the amount of the unpaid 
principal due it and the unpaid interest at the rate authorized by the 
World War Adjusted Compensation Act, as amended, up to the date of the 
check issued to the bank. If the veteran has not filed application for 
final settlement of his adjusted service certificate under the 
provisions of the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, 1936, and demand is 
made upon the bank to present the note and certificate for redemption 
prior to the maturity date of the loan and during the lifetime of the 
veteran, interest will be payable up to the date the check is issued to 
the bank, or, if demanded by the bank, up to the maturity date of the 
loan.
    (b) If, however, an application for final settlement is filed and 
the bank is notified to present the note and certificate to the 
Secretary and does so within 15 days after the mailing of such notice 
interest will be payable to the date the check is issued to the bank. If 
the bank fails to forward the note and certificate within 15 days after 
the mailing of the notice, interest shall be paid only up to the 
fifteenth day after the mailing of such notice.

[[Page 536]]


<R05>
Sec. 11.84  Redemption because of veteran's death.

    If the veteran dies before the maturity of the loan, the amount of 
the unpaid principal and the unpaid interest shall be immediately due 
and payable. In such case, or if the veteran dies on the day the loan 
matures or within six months thereafter, the bank holding the note and 
certificate shall, upon notice of the death, present them to the 
Secretary, who shall pay to the bank, in full satisfaction of its claim 
the amount of the unpaid principal and unpaid interest, at the rate 
authorized by the World War Adjusted Compensation Act, as amended, 
accrued up to the date of the check issued to the bank; except that if, 
prior to the payment, the bank is notified of the death by the Secretary 
and fails to present the certificate and note to the Secretary within 15 
days after the notice such interest shall be paid only up to the 
fifteenth day after such notice.


<R05>
Sec. 11.85  Condition requisite for redemption.

    In order to be eligible for redemption by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, the note and certificate must be accompanied by an affidavit of 
a duly authorized officer (the capacity in which the officer serves must 
be shown) of the lending bank showing that the said bank has not charged 
or collected, or attempted to charge or collect, directly or indirectly, 
any fee or other compensation in respect of the loan, or any other loan 
made by the bank under the provisions of section 502 of the World War 
Adjusted Compensation Act, except the rate of interest specified in the 
section of the Act cited; that the person who obtained the loan is known 
to the lending bank to be the person named in the Adjusted Service 
Certificate; and that notice required by Sec. 11.77 was promptly given. 
In case the note was sold or discounted by the lending bank, there 
should be incorporated in the affidavit a statement that the veteran was 
notified promptly of the transfer by mail to his last known address. In 
case the note was resold or rediscounted by any other bank, affidavit 
shall be made by a duly authorized officer of such bank that proper 
notice of such resale or rediscount was promptly mailed to the veteran 
at his last known address. The proper execution of the appropriate 
affidavit on Form 6615 or 6615a will be considered as a compliance with 
the requirements of this section. A single affidavit setting forth the 
full particulars may be accepted to cover any number of veterans' notes 
submitted for redemption at one time. The affidavit must be executed 
before a judge of the United States court, a United States commissioner, 
a United States district attorney, a United States marshal, a collector 
of internal revenue, a collector of customs, a United States postmaster, 
a clerk of court of record under the seal of the court, an executive 
officer of an incorporated bank or trust company, under his official 
designation and the seal of the bank or trust company, or a notary 
public under his seal, or a diplomatic or consular officer of the United 
States, under his official seal.

until such time as settlement is made.


<R05>
Sec. 11.89  Notification of veteran.

    When a note is redeemed notification will be sent to the veteran at 
his last known address, advising him that the Department of Veterans 
Affairs holds his note, and outlining the conditions governing

<R05>
Sec. 11.91  Repayment of loans.

    Should the veteran so desire, he may repay the amount due on his 
note in full or in installments.

[[Page 537]]


<R05>
Sec. 11.93  Failure to redeem.

    (a) If the veteran fails to redeem his certificate before its 
maturity there will be deducted from the face value of the certificate 
the amount of the unpaid principal of the note of the veteran and the 
unpaid interest thereon through September 30, 1931.
    (b) If the veteran failed to redeem his certificate and died prior 
to January 27, 1936, there will be deducted from the face value of the 
certificate the amount of the unpaid principal of the veteran's note and 
the unpaid interest thereon to the date of his death. If the veteran 
died on or after January 27, 1936, the amount to be deducted when making 
settlement will be the unpaid principal of the veteran's note and the 
unpaid interest thereon through September 30, 1931.

<R05>
Sec. 11.114  Identification.

    Before settlement is made on an adjusted service certificate, the 
person applying therefor will be identified as the person entitled to 
the settlement for which an application is made. If made in the United 
States or possessions, certification will be accepted if made by a 
United States postmaster or assistant postmaster over an impression of 
the post office cancellation stamp; a commissioned officer of the 
regular establishment of the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps; a member of 
the United States Senate or the House of Representatives; an officer, 
over his official title, of a post, chapter, or other comparable unit of 
an organization recognized under Veterans Regulation No. 10 (38 U.S.C. 
ch. 12A), or an officer over his official title, of the State or 
national body of such organization, or any person who is legally 
authorized to administer oaths in a State, Territory, possession, 
District of Columbia, or in a Federal judicial district, of the United 
States. If identification is made in a foreign country, it will be 
certified by an American consul, a recognized representative of an 
American Embassy or Legation, or by a person authorized to administer 
oaths under the laws of the place where identification is made; 
provided, there be attached to the certificate of such latter officer a 
proper certification by an accredited official of the State Department 
of the United States that such officer was authorized to administer 
oaths in the place where certification was made. A manager of a 
Department of Veterans Affairs hospital is authorized to identify 
patients, members, or employees of the hospital over which he has 
charge. An employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs who has been 
specifically designated in writing to do so may identify applicants 
during official hours and on the premises of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs using

[[Page 539]]

for this purpose, if necessary, the official records of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs. Field station finance employees may not be 
designated for this purpose.
    (a) Fingerprint impressions shall be required on the application and 
shall be imprinted thereon in the presence of the persons identifying 
the veteran. In the case of veterans who are mentally incapacitated and 
application is being executed by a representative of the veteran, the 
veterans' fingerprints will be obtained if possible. If this cannot be 
done, as also in the case of an individual whose fingers are all 
missing, a statement of explanation will be required.

Sec. 11.115  Where to file application.

    The application for final settlement, accompanied by the veteran's

the Department of Veterans Affairs as collateral for a loan, must be 
forwarded to the Manager, Veterans Benefits Office, Washington, DC 
20421.

Sec. 11.116  Death of veteran before final settlement.

    If the veteran dies after making application under the Adjusted 
Compensation Payment Act, 1936, but before it is filed, it may be filed 
by any person and will be considered valid if found to bear the bona-
fide signature of the applicant, discloses an intention to claim 
benefits under the Act, and is filed before the maturity of the 
certificate and before payment is made to the beneficiary. An 
application made by the veteran or his legal representative shall 
evidence his intention to claim the benefits of this Act; no other 
evidence shall be acceptable.
    (a) If the veteran's death occurs after the application is filed but 
before payment is received under this Act, or if the application is 
filed after death occurs but before the maturity of the certificate and 
before payment is made to the beneficiary under section 501 of the World 
War Adjusted Compensation Act, as amended, payment under this act shall 
be made to the estate of the veteran irrespective of any beneficiary 
designation.
    (b) If the veteran dies without filing a valid application under 
this Act, no payment under this Act shall be made. In such case, payment 
of the certificate will be made under the World War Adjusted 
Compensation Act, as amended, in accordance with Sec. 11.128; however, 
in making any settlement there shall be deducted from the face value of 
the certificate the amount of any outstanding loans and so much of the 
unpaid interest as accrued prior to October 1, 1931.

[19 FR 5087, Aug. 12, 1954]

Sec. 11.117  Missing applications.

    Where the records of the Department of Veterans Affairs show that an 
application, disclosing an intention to claim the benefits of this Act, 
has been filed and the application cannot be found, such application 
shall be presumed, in the absence of affirmative evidence to the 
contrary, to have been valid when originally filed. The determination of 
the correctness of this assumption shall be made by the Manager, 
Veterans Benefits Office, Washington, DC, or his designee.

certificate has not matured, payment will be made to the last designated 
beneficiary or, if no beneficiary, to his estate. If the certificate has 
matured, payment will be made to the veteran's estate regardless of any 
beneficiary designation. Payment of the amount due on a deceased 
veteran's certificate will be made only on an approved award based upon 
receipt in the Department of Veterans Affairs of an application properly 
executed by the person or persons entitled.

  Disposition of Veteran's Personal Funds and Effects on Facility Upon 
 Death, or Discharge, or Unauthorized Absence, and of Funds and Effects 
                            Found on Facility


<R05>
Sec. 12.0  Definitions.

    (a) As used in respect to the disposition of property of veterans 
dying at Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers or other field 
facilities, or who are discharged or who elope, or are absent without 
leave therefrom, and in respect to property found thereat, the term 
funds means all types of United States currency and coin, checks payable 
to the decedent except checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United 
States which have never been negotiated, and includes deposits to the 
credit of the veteran in the account ``Personal Funds of Patients,'' and 
each competent veteran will be so advised. The term effects means and 
embraces all other property of every description, including insurance 
policies, certificates of stock, bonds and notes the obligation of the 
United States or of others, and all other papers of every character 
except checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United States, as well as 
clothing, jewelry and other forms of property, or evidences of interest 
therein. Checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United States which have 
never been negotiated will be returned to the issuing office for 
disposition.
    (b) Field facilities as used in Sec. Sec. 12.1 to 12.13 includes 
hospitals, centers, domiciliary activities, supply depots, and other 
offices over which the Department of Veterans Affairs has direct and 
exclusive administrative jurisdiction, and excludes State, county, city, 
private, and contract hospitals and hospitals or other institutions 
operated by the United States through agencies other than the Department 
of Veterans Affairs. At institutions other than field facilities as 
herein defined funds or effects as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
section, except for funds derived from gratuitous benefits under laws 
administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and deposited by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs in the account Personal Funds of Patients 
for incompetent veterans, will be disposed of under the laws governing 
such institutions. In any case where the veteran died intestate without 
heirs or next of kin his or her personal property vests in the United 
States. Disposition of the property will be made in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 12.19 to 12.23.

<R05>
Sec. 12.1  Designee cases; competent veterans.

    (a) Each competent veteran now being cared for or who is hereafter 
admitted to receive care as such at a Department of Veterans Affairs 
field facility, unless it be detrimental to his or her health, will be 
requested and encouraged to designate on the prescribed VA Form 10-P-10, 
Application for Hospital Treatment or Domiciliary Care, the person to 
whom he or she desires the Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver his 
or her funds and effects in event of death. He or she may also designate 
an alternate to whom delivery will be made if the first designee fails 
or refuses to accept delivery. It should be clearly understood that the 
delivery of such funds or effects will constitute only a delivery of 
possession thereof, and such delivery is not intended to affect in any 
manner the title to such funds or effects or determine the person 
ultimately entitled to receive same from the person to whom delivery is 
made (hereinafter in the regulations in this part termed the designee). 
The person designated may not be an employee of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs unless such employee be the wife (or husband), child, 
grandchild, mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, brother, or sister 
of the veteran. The veteran may in writing change or revoke such 
designation at any time. If a veteran becomes incompetent, any 
designation previously made will become inoperative with respect to 
those funds deposited by the Department of Veterans Affairs in Personal 
Funds of Patients which were derived from gratuitous benefits under laws 
administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The guardian may 
change or revoke the existing designation with respect to personal 
effects and funds derived from other sources.
    (b) Veterans will be encouraged to place in the custody of their 
relatives

[[Page 542]]

articles of little or no utility value to them during their period of 
care at a Department of Veterans Affairs field facility, and to retain 
in their possession only such funds and effects as are actually required 
and necessary for their immediate convenience.

[13 FR 7128, Nov. 27, 1948, as amended at 25 FR 1612, Feb. 25, 1960]


<R05>
Sec. 12.2  Designee cases; incompetent veterans.

    (a) An incompetent veteran will not be informed concerning the 
designation of a person to receive funds or effects; but if he or she 
has a guardian the guardian will be requested to make such designation 
of himself or herself or another person to receive possession of the 
funds and effects (other than funds deposited by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs in Personal Funds of Patients which were derived from 
gratuitous benefits under laws administered by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs) upon the incompetent's death. The guardian will sign 
the letter designating himself or herself or another person with the 
veteran's name ``By ----------, guardian of his or her estate''.
    (b) No effort will be made to obtain a designation by or on behalf 
of an incompetent veteran who has no guardian.

[13 FR 7128, Nov. 27, 1948, as amended at 25 FR 1613, Feb. 25, 1960]


<R05>
Sec. 12.3  Deceased veteran's cases.

    (a) Immediately upon the death or the absence without leave of any 
beneficiary at a field facility, as defined in Sec. 12.0(b), a survey 
and inventory of the funds and effects of such beneficiary will be taken 
in the following manner:
    (1) If the death or absence without leave occurred during 
hospitalization, a complete inventory (VA Form 10-2687, Inventory of 
Funds and Effects) will be made of all personal effects (including those 
in the custody of the hospital, jewelry being worn by the deceased 
person, or jewelry and other effects in pockets of clothing he or she 
may have been wearing) and all funds found and moneys on deposit in 
Personal Funds of Patients. In the case of death of incompetent veterans 
after November 30, 1959, the inventory will be completed to show 
separately those funds deposited by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
in Personal Funds of Patients which were derived from gratuitous 
benefits under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
For purpose of determining the source of funds, expenditures from the 
account will be considered as having been made from gratuitous benefits, 
not to exceed the extent of deposits of such benefits. In the event 
death occurred during other than official working hours, the officer of 
the day and/or a representative of Nursing Service will collect and 
inventory all funds and personal effects on the person of the deceased 
beneficiary and on the ward, will carefully safeguard such property and, 
upon completion of the tour of duty, will turn the funds and effects 
over to the properly designated employees.
    (2) If the death or absence without leave occurred while the 
beneficiary was assigned to a domiciliary section, or while receiving 
hospitalization and at time of death or absence without leave any 
effects are in the section, a like inventory will be made by 
representatives of the Chief, Domiciliary Operations and/or Medical 
Administration Division.
    (3) The inventory report will be executed in triplicate, original 
and two copies. All will be signed by the employee making the inventory, 
and disposed of as provided for in pertinent procedural instructions.
    (4) Personally owned clothing or other effects (such as tooth 
brushes, false teeth not containing gold, etc.), which are unserviceable 
by reason of wear or tear or insanitary condition, and clothing that had 
been supplied by the Government, will not be included in this inventory; 
instead, the unserviceable personally owned articles will be listed on a 
separate list, with their condition briefly described, and their 
disposition recommended in a separate report to the facility head. The 
facility head, if approving this recommendation, will order destruction 
or utilization in occupational therapy, or as wipe rags, etc., of such 
unserviceable articles and, when they are so destroyed or utilized, will 
have entered

[[Page 543]]

on the papers the date and nature of the disposition. The completed 
papers will then be placed in the correspondence file of the 
beneficiary. Clothing that had been supplied by the Government will be 
reconditioned if possible and returned to stock for issue to other 
eligible beneficiaries. When Government-owned clothing cannot be 
reconditioned it will be disposed of.
    (5) When the nearest relative requests that the deceased beneficiary 
be clad for burial in clothing he or she personally owned, instead of 
burial clothing to be supplied under the contract for mortuary services, 
such request will be honored. A receipt in such cases will be obtained 
from the undertaker, specifying the articles of clothing so used. 
Adjustment of the undertaker's bill in the case will correspondingly be 
made.
    (6) In accomplishing such inventories, detailed description will be 
given of items of material value or importance, for example:

Watch--Yellow metal (make, movement, and case number, if available 
without damage to watch).
Ring--Yellow metal (probably gold-plated or stamped 14-K., setting if 
any).
Discharge certificate.
Adjusted service certificate (number).
Bonds or stocks (name of company, registered or nonregistered, 
identifying number, recited par value, if any).
Bank books or other asset evidence (name of bank or other obligor, 
apparent value, identifying numbers, etc.).
Clothing (brief description and statement of condition). Etc.

    (b) Upon completion of the survey and inventory, the effects will be 
turned over to the designated employee for safekeeping. Any funds found 
in excess of $100 which apparently were the property of the deceased 
will be turned over to the details clerk and delivered immediately to 
the agent cashier, who shall deposit same in the account ``Personal 
Funds of Patients''. Unendorsed checks other than Treasury checks and 
funds not in excess of $100 will be considered personal effects and not 
funds and will be handled accordingly.

[13 FR 7128, Nov. 27, 1948, as amended at 25 FR 1613, Feb. 25, 1960; 29 
FR 17904, Dec. 17, 1964; 36 FR 5911, Mar. 31, 1971]


<R05>
Sec. 12.4  Disposition of effects and funds to designee; exceptions.

    (a) Upon authorization by the facility head or his or her designated 
representative, all funds, as defined in Sec. 12.0 (except funds on 
deposit in Personal Funds of Patients derived from gratuitous benefits 
under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and 
deposited by the Department of Veterans Affairs where the veteran was 
incompetent at time of death), and effects will be delivered or sent to 
the designee of the deceased veteran if request therefor be made after 
death and within 90 days following the mailing of notice to such 
designee (see Sec. 12.9(a)), unless:
    (1) The executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased 
veteran shall have notified the facility head or his or her designated 
representative of his or her desire and readiness to receive such funds 
or effects, in which event the facility head or his or her designated 
representative will authorize delivery of all funds and effects to such 
executor or administrator upon receipt of appropriate documentary 
evidence of his or her qualifications and in exchange for appropriate 
receipts, or
    (2) An heir capable of inheriting the personal property of the 
veteran makes claim for the funds and effects prior to delivery to the 
designee.
    (3) Subsequent to the naming of a designee the veteran became 
incompetent and his or her guardian revoked such designation, in which 
event the facility head or his or her designated representative will 
deliver all funds and effects to his guardian in exchange for 
appropriate receipts subject to the limitation contained in paragraph 
(d) of this section, or
    (4) Designee was the wife (or husband) of the veteran at the time of 
designation, and information at the disposal of the field facility 
indicates that she (or he) was thereafter divorced and the veteran was 
incompetent at or subsequent to the time of divorce, or
    (5) Notwithstanding there is a designee, it is probable that title 
would pass to the United States under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 12.19 
to 12.23 issued pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 5502(e) and 38 U.S.C. 8520(a), or

[[Page 544]]

    (6) The facility head or his or her designated representative 
determines that there is reasonable ground to believe that the transfer 
of such possession to the designee probably would be contrary to the 
interests of the person legally entitled to the personal property, or 
there are any other special circumstances raising a serious doubt as to 
the propriety of such delivery to the designee.

In any case in which the facility head does not deliver the funds and 
effects, because of the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3), (4), and (5) of 
this section, he or she will develop all facts and refer the matter to 
the Chief Attorney of the regional office having jurisdiction over the 
area where the hospital is located, for advice as to the disposition 
which legally should be made of such funds and effects.
    (b) When authorized by the facility head or his or her designated 
representative, the effects will be delivered or shipped to the 
designee. If shipped at Government expense, the shipment shall be made 
in the most economical manner but in no case at a cost in excess of $25. 
If such expenses will exceed $25, the excess amount shall be paid by the 
consignee to the facility head in advance. There will be no obligation 
on the Government, initially or otherwise, to pay such expenses in 
excess of $25.
    (c) When possession of funds or effects is transferred to a 
designee, the attention of the designee will again be directed to the 
fact that possession only has been transferred to him or her and that 
such transfer does not of itself affect title thereto and that such 
designee will be accountable to the owner of said funds and effects 
under applicable laws.
    (d) Upon receipt from the proper Chief Attorney of an appropriate 
certification that the guardianship was in full force and effect at the 
time of the veteran's death and that the guardian's bond is adequate, 
funds (other than funds deposited by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
in Personal Funds of Patients derived from gratuitous benefits under 
laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs) and effects of 
an incompetent veteran may be immediately delivered or sent to such 
guardian, inasmuch as the guardian had a right to possession, and he or 
she will be accountable therefor to the party entitled to receive the 
decedent's estate. If, however, it appears probable that decedent died 
without a valid will and left no person surviving entitled to inherit, 
the funds will not be paid to the former guardian but will be disposed 
of as provided in Sec. 12.19(a). The effects will be sold, used, or 
destroyed, at the discretion of the facility head or his designated 
representative.

[25 FR 1613, Feb. 25, 1960, as amended at 29 FR 17904, Dec. 17, 1964]


<R05>
Sec. 12.5  Nondesignee cases.

    (a) If there exists no designee at the time of death at a hospital, 
domiciliary, or regional office of a veteran admitted as competent, or 
the designee fails or refuses to claim the funds and effects as defined 
in Sec. 12.0(a) within 90 days following the mailing of notice to such 
designee, the facility head will take appropriate action to dispose of 
the effects to the person or persons legally entitled thereto, i.e., the 
executor or administrator of the decedent, or, if no notice of such an 
appointment has been received, to the decedent's widow, child, 
grandchild, mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, brother, or 
sister, in the order named. Subject to the applicable provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 12.3 and 12.4, such delivery may be made at any time before 
the sale contemplated by Sec. 12.9 to the designee or other person 
entitled under the facts of the case. Delivery will be made to the 
person entitled to priority as prescribed in this paragraph, unless such 
person waives right to possession, in which event delivery will be to 
the person, if any, in whose favor such prior entitled person waives 
right to possession. If the waiver is not in favor of a particular 
person or class, delivery will be to the person or persons next in order 
of priority under this paragraph. If in any case there be more than one 
person in the class entitled to priority, initially or by reason of 
waiver, delivery will be made only to their joint designated agent (who 
may, but need not, be one of the class), or to one of such class in his 
or her own behalf upon written waiver of all others of the class 
entitled thereto. The guardian of

[[Page 545]]

a minor or incompetent may waive his or her ward's prior right to 
possession.
    (b) Except where delivery is made to a designee, executor, or 
administrator, funds of veterans who were competent at time of death 
will be released to the person or persons who would ultimately be 
entitled to distribution under the laws of the State of the decedent's 
domicile. The person or persons entitled may waive in writing his or her 
right to the funds in favor of another heir or next of kin.
    (c) Funds of veterans who were incompetent at time of death 
occurring after November 30, 1959, if derived from sources other than 
gratuitous benefits deposited by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 
Personal Funds of Patients under laws administered by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, will be disposed of in the same manner as for 
competent veterans.
    (d) Funds deposited by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 
Personal Funds of Patients, at any office, for veterans who were 
incompetent at time of death occurring after November 30, 1959 and which 
were derived from gratuitous benefits under laws administered by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, will be paid upon receipt of proper 
application to the following persons living at the time of settlement, 
and in the order named: the surviving spouse, the children (without 
regard to age or marital status) in equal parts, and the dependent 
parents of such veteran, in equal parts. Any funds derived from 
gratuitous benefits not disposed of in accordance with this paragraph 
shall be deposited to the credit of the applicable current 
appropriation; except that there may be paid only so much of such funds 
as may be necessary to reimburse a person (other than a political 
subdivision of the United States) who bore the expenses of last sickness 
or burial of the veteran for such expenses.
    (e) No payment shall be made under paragraph (d) of this section 
unless claim therefor is filed with the Department of Veterans Affairs 
within 5 years after the death of the veteran, except that, if any 
person so entitled under such regulation is under legal disability at 
the time of death of the veteran, such 5-year period of limitation shall 
run from the termination or removal of the legal disability.

<R05>
Sec. 12.6  Cases of living veterans.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 12.8, effects of veterans absent 
without leave or who have been discharged or have eloped (and who are 
not to be returned to the field facility) will be disposed of as 
follows:
    (1) To the owner if competent, or if deceased to his or her 
administrator or executor or as directed in writing by such owner, or 
his or her executor or administrator.
    (2) To the guardian of the owner if the latter be incompetent, or if 
deceased to his or her administrator or executor, or as directed in 
writing by such guardian, executor or administrator.
    (3) To the incompetent owner if he or she has no guardian; delivery, 
however, to the incompetent owner may be withheld and may be made to the 
person who is caring for such incompetent if, in the judgment of the 
facility head or his or her designated representative, such delivery is 
to the incompetent's best interest.

    Note: The Government will not pay expense of transportation of 
effects of competent or incompetent veterans discharged, on trail visit, 
absent without leave, or who have eloped, except that personal effects 
of a beneficiary discharged or on trail visit, or of a beneficiary being 
transferred to another facility at Government expense, which are not 
available at time of discharge, beginning of trail visit, or transfer of 
the beneficiary, due to the articles being in custody of the Government, 
may be shipped at Government expense.

    (b) Funds of veterans absent without leave or who have been 
discharged or have eloped (and who are not to be returned to the 
station) will be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of 
current Department of Veterans Affairs procedures.

Sec. 12.7  Cases not applicable to provisions of Sec. Sec. 12.0 to 12.6.

    The provisions of Sec. Sec. 12.0 to 12.6 shall be inapplicable to 
property known to be that of any person dying in or discharged or absent 
without leave from a Department of Veterans Affairs field facility other 
than a veteran admitted as such to such field facility.

[13 FR 7129, Nov. 27, 1948]


<R05>
Sec. 12.8  Unclaimed effects of veterans.

    (a) In the case of any property of a veteran who was in receipt of 
hospital or domiciliary care, heretofore or hereafter left at a 
Department of Veterans Affairs field facility, the owner of which is 
discharged or absent without leave or who has eloped and is not to be 
returned to a Department of Veterans Affairs field facility, or has died 
after departure therefrom, or in case the whereabouts or identity of any 
owner of any property thereat be unknown, such property, unless it shall 
be disposed of under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 12.4 and 12.6 shall be 
sold, used, destroyed or otherwise disposed of as the manager or his or 
her designated representative shall determine the circumstances in the 
case may warrant. Any sale of such property shall be conditioned upon 
the 90-day notice provided in section 6 of the Act of June 25, 1938 (38 
U.S.C. 5-16e).
    (b) If the circumstances are such that retention of any property as 
is mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section, or of any property of 
unknown ownership found on the premises would endanger the health or 
life of patients or others on the premises (by reason of contagion, 
infection, or otherwise) such property shall be forthwith destroyed on 
order of the manager or his or her designated representative, and proper 
record of the action taken will be made.
    (c) If there be no known claimant of any such property and if it may 
be used at the field facility for the benefit of the members or patients 
for such purposes as the General Post Fund is intended to serve, and if 
the value is inconsequential, the manager or his or her designated 
representative may authorize the retention and use of such property at 
the field facility.
    (d) Any such property which is not destroyed or used as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be sold in the manner 
provided in Sec. Sec. 12.9 and 12.10, after notice as therein provided 
unless, prior to sale, claim be made for any such property by someone 
legally entitled thereto.

<R05>
Sec. 12.9  Rights of designate; sales instruction; transportation charges.

    (a) Upon death of a veteran admitted as such to a field facility, 
the Manager or his or her designated representative will cause notice 
(parts I and V of VA Form 10-1171) to be sent to the designate: 
Provided, however, That if the Manager or his or her designated 
representative has information of the death of the primary designate, 
notice shall be sent to the alternate designate and all of the 
provisions of the regulations in this part respecting the designate will 
be deemed to apply to the alternate. If the designate is a minor or a 
person known to be incompetent, delivery of the funds or effects will be 
made only to the designate's guardian or custodian upon qualification. 
The right of the designate to receive possession ceases when he or she 
refuses to accept delivery or if he or she fails to respond within 90 
days after VA Form 10-1171 was mailed. When the right of a designate 
ceases, VA Form 10-1171 will be forwarded immediately to the alternate 
designate, whose rights then become identical with those forfeited by 
the first designate, and the rights of the alternate designate shall 
terminate at the expiration of 90 days after VA Form 10-1171 was mailed 
to him or her. Delivery will not be made to a designate until he or she 
submits a signed statement to the effect that he or she understands that 
the delivery of such funds and effects constitutes a delivery of 
possession only and that such delivery is not intended to affect in any 
manner the title thereto. Such notice shall fully identify the decedent 
and state the fact that he or she designated the addressee to receive 
possession of such property; that the right to receive possession 
thereof does not affect the ownership but that the designate will

[[Page 547]]

be responsible for the ultimate disposition thereof to those who, under 
applicable law, are entitled to the decedent's property; and will 
request prompt advice as to whether the designate will accept such 
property and that, if he or she will, he or she furnish shipping 
instructions, upon receipt of which the property will be shipped at the 
expense of the Government. However, prior to dispatching such notice, it 
will be definitely determined that the shipping expense will not exceed 
$25. If such expense will exceed $25, the excess cost will be 
ascertained, and the notice will include a statement of the amount of 
such excess shipping cost with request that the amount thereof be 
remitted at the time shipping instructions are furnished. In estimating 
the shipping expense, it will be assumed that shipment to the designate 
will be to the same address as that to which the notice is sent. Each 
notice, however, shall contain a statement that in no event will the 
Government pay shipping expense in excess of $25. The notice will 
include a copy of the inventory of the property which it is proposed to 
deliver to the designate.
    (b) Upon receipt of appropriate shipping instructions the property 
will be shipped, transportation charges prepaid, by mail, express, or 
freight as may be appropriate under the circumstances and most 
economical to the Government. The expense of such shipment, chargeable 
to the Government, in no case to exceed $25.00, is payable the same as 
other administrative expenses of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (c) The living owner of any property left or found at a field 
facility will be promptly notified thereof. Except as provided in Sec. 
12.6(a), transportation charges on property shipped to a living veteran 
will not be paid by the Government. In such cases, shipment shall be 
made as requested by the owner of the property (or his or her guardian) 
upon receipt of necessary transportation charges, which will be prepaid, 
unless the owner requests shipment with charges collect and the carrier 
will accept such shipment without liability for such charges, contingent 
or otherwise, upon the Government.
    (d) If the designate refuses or, upon the lapse of 90 days, has 
failed to take possession or request shipment of decedent's property 
(paragraph (a) of this section), or if 90 days have elapsed after the 
finding of any property and the owner (known or unknown) has failed to

will occur and that the same will be at public auction

[[Page 548]]

for cash upon delivery without warranty, express or implied, and that 
such sale is pursuant to the act of June 25, 1938 (38 U.S.C. 16-16j); 
and shall also state that any person legally entitled to said property 
may claim the same at any time prior to sale thereof and in the event of 
such claim by a proper person the property will not be sold but will be 
delivered to the person lawfully entitled thereto. Said notice shall 
also contain a statement substantially to the effect that if sold the 
net proceeds of sale may be claimed by the person who is legally 
entitled at any time within 5 years after the date of notice; or in case 
of property the ownership of which was not originally known, within 5 
years after its finding; otherwise such proceeds will be retained in the 
General Post Fund, subject to disbursement for the purposes of such 
fund.
    (i) The person (or persons) posting said notice of sale (Form 4-
1171) shall make appropriate affidavit on a copy thereof as to his or 
her action in that respect and the manager or his or her designated 
representative will also certify on the same copy as to the persons to

Sec. 12.10  Proceeds of sale.

    After proper notice as prescribed, sale of any such property which 
it is proper to sell, will be made by public auction by the manager (or 
any employee designated by him or her) at the time and place stated in 
the notice of sale. The property will be sold to the highest bidder (no 
employee except member employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
shall purchase any of this property) and forthwith delivered and the 
amount of the bid collected and deposited to the credit of ``General 
Post Fund, Department of Veterans Affairs.'' Care will be taken to 
segregate the property of each owner and separate account will be 
maintained as to the proceeds of sale thereof. Property not disposed of 
by public auction will be included in the next sale or will be used or 
destroyed as the value thereof warrants at the discretion of the 
manager.

Sec. 12.12  Miscellaneous provisions.

    If it is shown that some person other than the veteran has title to 
property in a veteran's possession at the time of death, nothing 
contained in Sec. Sec. 12.0 to 12.12 shall be construed as prohibiting 
delivery of such property to the owner. A life insurance policy may be 
delivered to the beneficiary therein named if the insured is deceased, 
notwithstanding the veteran has designated a person to whom possession 
of his or her property at the field facility is to be transferred. In no 
case will funds or effects be delivered to a minor, or to an incompetent 
person other than as provided in Sec. 12.9 (a) and (c), but where any 
such person is entitled to title or possession delivery may be made to 
his or her guardian.

    (b) In making disposition of funds and effects the manager will 
release the funds to the owner if living and will release the effects to 
him or her or as directed by him or her, provided that if he or she is 
incompetent and has a guardian the funds and effects will be released to 
such guardian. If the owner is deceased, and left a last will and 
testament probated under the laws of the place of his or her last legal 
domicile or under the laws of the State, territory, insular possession, 
or dependency, within which the field facility may be, the personal 
property of such decedent situated upon such premises will be released 
to the executor. If such person left on said premises funds or effects 
not disposed of by a will probated in accordance with the provisions of 
this paragraph, such property shall be released to the administrator, if 
one has been appointed.
    (c) In those cases where there is neither an administrator nor an 
executor the funds and effects will be released to the person entitled 
to inherit the personal property of the decedent under the intestacy 
laws of the State where the decedent was last domiciled.
    (d) Where disposition of the funds and effects cannot be 
accomplished under the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, the funds, at the expiration of 90 days will be deposited to 
the General Post Fund and the effects will be disposed of in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 12.8, 12.9, and 12.10.

reclaimed within five years after notice of sale, by or on behalf of any 
person or persons who, if known, would have been entitled to the

without expense to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the funds and 
effects of the deceased or absent officer, or enlisted man procuring a 
receipt therefor.
    (b) If the funds and effects are not delivered to the commanding 
officer within seven days after the death or absence without leave of an 
officer, or enlisted man, the funds will be deposited in the Personal 
Funds of Patients. If not disposed of at the expiration of 90 days after 
the date of death or absence, the funds will be transferred to the 
General Post Fund and the effects will be handled in accordance with 
regulations governing the disposition of unclaimed effects left by

personal effects will be paid to the person lawfully entitled thereto, 
providing claim is made within five years from the date of notice of 
sale, or in the case of legal disability within five years after 
termination of legal disability.

<R05>
Sec. 12.19  Provisions of Pub. L. 382 (38 U.S.C. 17-17j).

    (a) Whenever any veteran (admitted as a veteran) shall die in any 
Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, center, or domiciliary activity 
or in any Federal, State, or private hospital or other institution, 
while being furnished care or treatment therein by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, without leaving a will and without leaving any spouse, 
heirs, or next of kin entitled to his or her personal property, all such 
property, except funds on deposit in Personal Funds of Patients to the 
credit of an incompetent beneficiary, derived from payments of 
compensation, automatic or term insurance, emergency officers' 
retirement pay or pension, shall immediately vest in and become the 
property of the United States as trustee for the sole use and benefit of 
the General Post Fund, subject to claim as elsewhere provided. Funds to 
the credit of an incompetent beneficiary derived from payments of 
compensation, automatic or term insurance, emergency officers' 
retirement pay or pension will be deposited to the credit of the current 
appropriations provided for the payment of compensation, insurance or 
pension.
    (b) Personal property as used in this section shall include cash, 
funds on deposit in Personal Funds of Patients, bank accounts, 
certificates of stock, bonds, and notes, the obligation of the United 
States or of others, money orders, checks, insurance policies the 
proceeds of which are payable to the veteran or his or her estate, 
postal savings certificates, money and choses in action, and all other 
papers of every character; also clothing, jewelry, and all other forms

    (a) VA Form 10-P-10, Application for Hospital Treatment or

of care or treatment by any veteran shall constitute acceptance of the 
provisions of the act. Similar notice shall be given to each veteran 
receiving care as of March 26, 1942, by posting notice in a prominent 
place in each building wherein patients or members are housed. Such 
notices shall be posted immediately and kept posted.
    (b) Since the provisions of the law are applicable to all veterans 
receiving care at the expense of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(whether in contract, Federal, State or private hospital) it shall be 
the responsibility of the Department of Veterans Affairs officer 
authorizing admission of a veteran to other than a Department of 
Veterans Affairs hospital, center or home, to cause the chief officer of 
such institution to post in a conspicuous place, in all buildings where 
veterans are housed, the provisions of Sec. 12.19(a), or if he or she 
declines to post such provisions, notify the patients individually and 
supply a statement from each acknowledging notice. Such provisions 
supersede in part the provisions of Form 10-P-10, executed prior to 
March 26, 1942.

Sec. 12.21  Action upon death of veteran.

    Upon the death of a veteran at a Department of Veterans Affairs 
hospital, center or domiciliary activity while receiving care or 
treatment therein, and who it is believed leaves no will or heirs or 
next of kin entitled to his or her personal property, regardless of

inventory of the funds and effects, VA Form 10-2687, will be promptly 
prepared and supplemented by all information or evidence available as to 
personal property owned by the veteran in addition to that left at the 
place of death; similar action will be taken when the death of such a 
veteran hospitalized by the Department of Veterans Affairs occurs at a 
contract hospital, Army, Navy, Marine or other hospital. Such 
inventories and information together with any bank books, stocks, bonds, 
or other valuable paper as enumerated in Sec. 12.19(b), left in the

otherwise converted into cash, except that articles of personal 
adornment which are obviously of sentimental value shall, if unclaimed, 
be retained for 5 years from the date of death of the veteran, unless 
for sanitary or other reasons their retention is deemed unsafe. 
Possession of effects other than those located on the premises of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs will be obtained, except that if 
transportation, storage, etc., is involved, determination will be made 
as to whether expenditure therefor is warranted. Proceeds from the 
conversion or sale will be deposited to the credit of the General Post 
Fund. Funds on deposit in Personal Funds of Patients will be transferred 
to the General Post Fund. Any claims against the estate of the deceased 
veteran will be adjudicated and paid, if valid.

[33 FR 1073, Jan. 27, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 12.23  Recognition of valid claim against the General Post Fund.

    Effective December 26, 1941, the assets of the estate of a veteran 
theretofore or thereafter deposited to the General Post Fund are subject 
to the valid claims of creditors presented to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs within 1 year from the date of death or otherwise as provided by 
any applicable law. Any heir, next of kin, legatee, or other person 
found to be legally entitled to the personal property of the veteran may 
claim same within 5 years from the date of the veteran's death. If 
claimant is under any legal disability (as a minor, incompetent, etc.) 
at the date of the veteran's death, the 5-year period begins upon the 
termination of removal of legal disability. Such claims are for 
settlement by the field facility which had originally made the deposit. 
In the event of doubt as to entitlement or the necessity of legal 
proceedings to obtain assets for the benefit of the General Post Fund, 
the case will be referred to the Chief Attorney of jurisdiction for 
advice and/or appropriate action. Any necessary court costs or expenses 
will be paid from the appropriation, General Operating Expenses, 
Department of Veterans Affairs.

Sec. 12.24  Operation of lost and found service.

    Unless maintained by the Public Buildings Service, the lost and 
found service will be maintained by an employee designated by the 
Manager to be known as the lost and found custodian. VA Form 3771, 
Record of Lost or Found Article, will be used for recording articles of 
any personal property lost or found. Every effort will be made to 
determine rightful ownership of found articles and to recover items 
which have been reported lost. Currency, including readily negotiable 
instruments, found and delivered to the lost and found custodian will 
not be retained beyond the official closing hour. The currency or 
negotiable instruments will be delivered to the agent cashier before the 
close of business. Individuals claiming found articles will furnish 
complete identification and satisfy the facility authority of rightful 
ownership. Where more than one individual claims ownership the matter 
will be referred to the Manager for decision. All articles of personal 
property remaining unclaimed for 90 days or more will be disposed of in 
accordance with Sec. 12.8.

Sec. 13.64  Fiduciary commissions.

    Generally, a VA appointed fiduciary is to be encouraged to serve 
without fee.
    (a) Authority. The Veterans Service Center Manager is authorized to 
determine when a commission is necessary in order to obtain the services 
of a fiduciary, except that the Veterans Service Center Manager may not 
authorize a commission to a fiduciary who receives any other form of 
remuneration or payment in connection with rendering fiduciary services 
on behalf of the beneficiary. Necessity is established only if the 
beneficiary's best interest would be served by the appointment of a 
qualified professional, or, if a qualified professional is not 
available, the proposed fiduciary is the only qualified person available 
and is not willing to serve without a fee.
    (b) Amount; notice to beneficiary. The Veterans Service Center 
Manager shall authorize a fiduciary to whom a commission is payable 
under paragraph (a) of this section to deduct from the beneficiary's 
estate a reasonable commission for fiduciary services rendered. The 
commission for any year may not exceed 4 percent of the monetary 
benefits paid by VA on behalf of the beneficiary to the fiduciary during 
that year; a year being the normal 12 month period following the 
anniversary date of appointment. The Veterans Service Center Manager 
shall furnish appropriate notice to the beneficiary, either directly or 
through the fiduciary, that a commission is payable.
    (c) Persons who may be excluded. Commissions may not be authorized 
to dependents of the beneficiary or other close relatives acting in a 
fiduciary capacity on behalf of the beneficiary, except under 
extraordinary circumstances.

Manager, a fiduciary has been appointed or is seeking appointment in a 
case in excess of that number, the Veterans Service Center Manager will 
initiate action to obtain a suitable substitute fiduciary.

Sec. 13.70  Apportionment of benefits to dependents.

    (a) Incompetent veterans being furnished hospital treatment, 
institutional or domiciliary care by United States or political 
subdivision thereof. When compensation, pension or emergency officers' 
retirement pay is payable in behalf of a veteran who is incompetent or 
under other legal disability by court action, the Veterans Service 
Center Manager may recommend such apportionment to or in behalf of the 
veteran's spouse, child or dependent parent as may be necessary to 
provide for their needs.
    (b) Dependent parents. When the compensation of a veteran paid to 
his or her fiduciary includes an additional amount for a dependent 
parent or parents and the fiduciary neglects or refuses to make an 
equivalent contribution for their support, the Veterans Service Center 
Manager may recommend the apportionment to the parent or parents of the 
additional amount.
    (c) Payments withheld because of fiduciary's failure to properly 
administer veteran's estate. When payments of compensation, pension or 
emergency officers' retirement pay in behalf of a veteran have been 
stopped because of the fiduciary's failure or inability to properly 
account or otherwise administer the estate, the Veterans Service Center 
Manager may recommend the apportionment to the veteran's spouse, child 
or dependent parent of any benefit not paid under an institutional award 
or to a custodian-in-fact.

Sec. 13.71  Payment of cost of veteran's maintenance in institution.

    (a) The payment of part of compensation, pension or emergency 
officers' retirement pay for the cost of a veteran's hospital treatment, 
institutional or domiciliary care in an institution operated by a 
political subdivision of the United States may be authorized as provided 
in paragraph (b) of this section when:
    (1) The veteran is rated incompetent by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.
    (2) It has been determined the veteran is legally liable for the 
cost of his or her maintenance, and
    (3) The institution's representative has asserted or probably will 
assert a claim for full maintenance costs.
    (b) Subject to these conditions and the further condition that the 
responsible official of the institution or political subdivision will 
agree not to assert against Department of Veterans Affairs benefits any 
further claim for maintenance during the veteran's lifetime, the 
Veterans Service Center Manager may agree with such official to the 
payment of the veteran's benefits through an institutional award to be 
applied to:
    (1) A monthly amount determined by the Veterans Service Center 
Manager to be needed for the veteran's personal use,
    (2) An amount to be agreed upon to be accumulated to provide for the 
veteran's rehabilitation upon release from the institution, and
    (3) So much of the amount of the benefit as remains not exceeding 
the amount the Veterans Service Center Manager determines to be the 
proper charge as fixed by statute or administrative regulation, to the 
cost of the veteran's maintenance.
    (c) Upon execution of an agreement as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, the Veterans Service Center Manager will certify the total 
amount to be released to the chief officer of the institution.

    (a) Federal fiduciaries. In Federal fiduciary cases, the Veterans 
Service Center Manager may, when he or she deems it necessary for the 
protection of the beneficiary's interests:
    (1) Require an accounting, formal or informal, of Department of 
Veterans Affairs benefits paid.
    (2) Terminate the appointment of a Federal fiduciary and appoint a 
successor Federal fiduciary.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5502)

    (b) Court-appointed fiduciaries. In court-appointed fiduciary cases, 
the Veterans Service Center Manager will take such informal action as 
may be necessary to assure that the needs of the beneficiary are 
provided for and Department of Veterans Affairs benefits are prudently 
administered and adequately protected.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)


[[Page 557]]


    (c) Unsatisfactory conditions. In any case where a fiduciary fails 
to render a satisfactory account or has collected or paid, or is 
attempting to collect or pay, fees, commissions, or allowances that are 
illegal or inequitable or in excess of those allowed by law, or has 
failed to use Department of Veterans Affairs funds for the benefit of

surety bond in an amount determined to be sufficient to protect the 
interest of the beneficiary. Such bond shall run to the Secretary of

custodian to furnish an agreement in lieu of a surety bond or additional

Veterans Affairs policy to invest income or estate derived from 
Department of Veterans Affairs benefits only in legal investments which 
have safety, assured income, stability of principal and ready 
convertibility for the requirements of the beneficiary and his or her 
dependents. When notice of a contemplated or actual illegal or imprudent

beneficiary's estate. Cases in which it becomes necessary to institute 
court action will be referred to the Regional Counsel.

    (a) Functions and responsibilities of the Regional Counsels are 
those set forth in this part and all other matters assigned by the 
General Counsel.

delegated or otherwise assigned, the Regional Counsel and designated 
staff attorneys are authorized to conduct investigations, examine 
witnesses, take affadavits, administer oaths and affirmations and 
certify copies of public or private documents.
    (c) The Regional Counsel is authorized to, and shall, under the 
guidance of the General Counsel, provide legal services, advice and 
assistance to Department of Veterans Affairs installations within the 
district assigned. In any area of regulatory, assigned or delegated 
responsibility, the Regional Counsel may delegate to staff members or 
other Department of Veterans Affairs attorneys authority to perform, to 
the extent specified, any legal function under the professional 
direction of the Regional Counsel. Conversely, the Regional Counsel may 
modify, suspend, or rescind any authority delegated hereunder.
    (d) The Regional Counsel is authorized to cooperate with affiliated 
organizations, legislative committees, and with local and State bar

legal action and payment of costs and necessary expenses incident 
thereto are involved, the administration requesting such action will pay 
such cost and expenses. Where it is impractical for the Regional Counsel

<R05>
Sec. 14.503  Requests for legal advice and assistance in other than domestic relations matters.

    (a) Requests from administrative officials in the field for legal 
advice or assistance will be addressed to the appropriate Regional 
Counsel and will be in writing if requested by the Regional Counsel. 
Questions regarding insurance activities at St. Paul and Philadelphia 
should be referred to the Regional Counsel at the respective station. 
Except as to matters referred to in Sec. 14.504(b), the Regional 
Counsel's authority to render legal advice and assistance shall extend 
to the release (unless otherwise instructed by the General Counsel), 
without prior approval of the General Counsel, of opinions on all legal 
questions which are either:
    (1) Wholly controlled by the interpretation or application of the 
laws of the State or States in the district office area, or

necessary) to the views of the General Counsel, and release it to the 
requesting official. The Regional Counsel may release any modified 
opinion as the opinion of the General Counsel.
    (b) The Regional Counsel may submit to the General Counsel any legal 
question, opinion, or question pertinent to legal functions, upon which

<R05>
Sec. 14.504  Domestic relations questions, authority and exceptions.

    (a) Regional Counsels have the same authority with respect to 
domestic relations questions as they do with respect to matters covered 
by Sec. 14.503 except as specifically excluded by the provisions of 
paragraph (a) of that section.
    (b) In the following instances the Regional Counsel, regardless of 
whether State law is wholly controlling or a Department of Veterans 
Affairs precedent is available, will prepare a tentative opinion, 
researched as completely as possible with reasonably available 
facilities, and forward two copies thereof directly to the General 
Counsel for review and disposition (as provided in Sec. 14.503 
respecting other than domestic relations matters):
    (1) Where it is not clear under applicable State law: (i) Whether 
the marriage of a veteran's child or the remarriage of a veteran's widow 
was void without decree of annulment, or (ii) whether an annulment 
decree was rendered by a court with basic authority to render annulment 
decrees;
    (2) When fraud or collusion by either party appears to have 
influenced the granting of an annulment decree;
    (3) Cases in which there are contesting claims;
    (4) Unusual situations, such as those involving proxy marriages, the 
law of two or more jurisdictions or of a foreign country;
    (5) Cases involving difference of opinion between Regional Counsels 
or between a Regional Counsel and the official who submitted the 
question involved.

[42 FR 41411, Aug. 17, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 14.505  Submissions.

    All submissions will set forth the question of law on which the 
opinion is desired, together with a complete and accurate summary of 
relevant facts. Files, correspondence, and other original papers will 
not be submitted unless pertinent portions thereof cannot practicably be 
summarized or copies made and attached as exhibits.

[42 FR 41411, Aug. 17, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 14.507  Opinions.

    (a) A written legal opinion of the General Counsel involving 
veterans' benefits under laws administered by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs shall be conclusive as to all Department officials and employees 
with respect to the matter at issue, unless there has been a material 
change in controlling statute or regulation, a superseding written legal 
opinion by the General Counsel, or the designation on its face as 
``advisory only'' by the General Counsel or the Deputy General Counsel 
acting as or for the General Counsel. Written legal opinions having 
conclusive effect under this section and not designated as precedent 
opinions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be considered 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs to be subject to the provisions of 
5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2).

[[Page 564]]

Advice, recommendations, or conclusions on matters of Government or 
Department policy, contained within a written legal opinion, shall not 
be binding on Department officials and employees merely because of their 
being contained within a written legal opinion. Written legal opinions 
will be maintained in the Office of the General Counsel. Written legal 
opinions involving veterans' benefits under laws administered by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, which pertain to a particular benefit 
matter, in addition to being maintained in the Office of the General 
Counsel, will be filed in the individual claim folder.
    (b) A written legal opinion of the General Counsel involving 
veterans' benefits under laws administered by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs which, in the judgment of the General Counsel or the Deputy 
General Counsel acting as or for the General Counsel, necessitates 
regulatory change, interprets a statute or regulation as a matter of 
first impression, clarifies or modifies a prior opinion, or is otherwise 
of significance beyond the matter at issue, may be designated a 
``precedent opinion'' for purposes of such benefits. Written legal 
opinions designated as precedent opinions under this section shall be 
considered by Department of Veterans Affairs to be subject to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1). An opinion designated as a precedent 
opinion is binding on Department officials and employees in subsequent 
matters involving a legal issue decided in the precedent opinion, unless 
there has been a material change in a controlling statute or regulation 
or the opinion has been overruled or modified by a subsequent precedent 
opinion or judicial decision.
    (c) For purposes of this section, the term written legal opinion of 
the General Counsel means a typed or printed memorandum or letter signed 
by the General Counsel or by the Deputy General Counsel acting as or for 
the General Counsel, addressed to an official or officials of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs stating a conclusion on a legal issue 
pertaining to Department of Veterans Affairs activities.

       Litigation (Other Than Under the Federal Tort Claims Act); 
                             Indemnification


<R05>
Sec. 14.514  Suits by or against United States or Department of Veterans Affairs officials; indemnification of Department of Veterans Affairs employees.

    (a) Suits against United States or Department of Veterans Affairs 
officials. When a suit involving any activities of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs is filed against the United States or the Secretary or 
a suit is filed against any employee of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs in which is involved any official action of the employee, not 
covered by the provisions of Sec. Sec. 14.600 through 14.617, a copy of 
the petition will be forwarded to the General Counsel who will take 
necessary action to obtain the pertinent facts, cooperate with or 
receive the cooperation of the Department of Justice and, where 
indicated, advise the Regional Counsel of any further action required.
    (b) Counsel and representation of employees. The Department of 
Justice may afford counsel and representation to Government employees 
who are sued individually as a result of the performance of their 
official duties. A civil action commenced in a State court against an 
employee, as the result of an action under color of his or her office, 
may be removed to the applicable Federal District Court. If a suit is 
filed against an employee as the result of the performance of his or her 
official duties, where the provisions of either 28 U.S.C. 2679 or 38 
U.S.C. 7316 are not applicable (see Sec. 14.610), and the employee 
desires to be represented by the U.S. Attorney, the Regional Counsel 
will obtain a written request to this effect from the employee and will 
also obtain an affidavit of the facility Director describing the 
incident in sufficient detail to enable a determination to be made as to 
whether the employee was in the scope of his or her employment at the 
time. These statements,

[[Page 565]]

together with a copy of the petition and two copies of a summary of 
pertinent facts, will be sent to the General Counsel, who will transmit 
copies thereof to the Department of Justice for appropriate action.
    (c) Indemnification. (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs may 
indemnify a Department of Veterans Affairs employee, who is personally 
named as a defendant in any civil suit in state or Federal court or an 
arbitration proceeding or other proceeding seeking damages against the 
employee personally, where either 28 U.S.C. 2679 or 38 U.S.C. 7316 is 
not applicable, for any verdict, judgment, or other monetary award which 
is rendered against such employee; provided that: the alleged conduct 
giving rise to the verdict, judgment, or award was taken within the 
scope of his or her employment and that such indemnification is in the 
interest of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as determined by the 
Secretary or his designee.
    (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs may settle or compromise a 
personal damage claim against a Department of Veterans Affairs employee, 
in cases where the provisions of either 28 U.S.C. 2679 or 38 U.S.C. 7316 
are not applicable, by the payment of available funds, at any time; 
provided that: the alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage 
claim was taken within the employee's scope of employment and that such 
settlement or compromise is in the interest of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, as determined by the Secretary or his designee.
    (3) Absent exceptional circumstances as determined by the Secretary 
or his designee, the Agency will not entertain a request either to agree 
to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before entry of an 
adverse verdict, judgment, or award.
    (4) A Department of Veterans Affairs employee may request 
indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment, or award entered against 
that employee. The employee shall submit a written request, with 
appropriate documentation including copies of the verdict, judgment, 
award, or settlement proposal, in a timely manner to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs General Counsel, who shall make a recommended 
disposition of the request. Where the Department of Veterans Affairs 
determines it appropriate, the Agency shall seek the view of the 
Department of Justice. The General Counsel shall forward the employee 
request for indemnification, and the accompanying documentation, with 
the General Counsel's recommendation to the Secretary for decision.
    (5) Any payment under this section either to indemnify a Department 
of Veterans Affairs employee or to settle or compromise a personal 
damage claim shall be contingent upon the availability of appropriated 
funds of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (d) Attorney-client privilege. Attorneys employed by the Department 
of Veterans Affairs who participate in any process utilized for the 
purpose of determining whether the Agency should request the Department 
of Justice to provide representation to a Department employee sued, 
subpoenaed or charged in his individual capacity, or whether attorneys 
employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs should provide assistance 
in the representation of such a Department employee, undertake a full 
and traditional attorney-client relationship with the employee with 
respect to application of the attorney-client privilege. If 
representation is authorized, Department of Veterans Affairs attorneys 
who assist in the representation of an employee also undertake a full 
and traditional attorney-client relationship with the employee with 
respect to the attorney-client privilege. Any adverse information 
communicated by the client-employee to an attorney during the course of 
such attorney-client relationship shall not be disclosed to anyone, 
either inside or outside the Department of Veterans Affairs, other than 
attorneys responsible for representation of the employee, unless such 
disclosure is authorized by the employee.
    (e) Suits by the United States. In any instance wherein direct 
submission to a U.S. Attorney for institution of civil action has been 
authorized by the Department of Justice, the Regional Counsel will 
furnish the U.S. Attorney a complete report of the facts and applicable 
law, documentary evidence, names and addresses of witnesses and,

[[Page 566]]

in cases wherein Department of Veterans Affairs action has been taken, a 
copy of any pertinent decision rendered. The Regional Counsel will 
forward two copies of such report and of any proposed pleading to the 
General Counsel, and will render any practicable assistance requested by 
the U.S. Attorney.

[42 FR 41411, Aug. 17, 1977, as amended at 54 FR 5614, Feb. 6, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 14.515  Suits involving loan guaranty matters.

    (a) In actions for debt, possession or actions similar in substance 
(including title actions) in which Sec. 36.4282 or Sec. 36.4319 of 
this chapter has been complied with, the Regional Counsel is authorized 
to enter the appearance of and represent the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs as the attorney of record and to file claims for debt in probate 
proceedings without prior reference to the General Counsel. Any such 
action will normally be taken within the time prescribed by law as 
though there had been valid service of process. In all other types of 
cases, the Regional Counsel will not enter an appearance or file any 
pleading on behalf of the Secretary except in imperative emergency until 
authorization is received from the General Counsel after submission of 
all relevant facts. In doubtful cases, the Regional Counsel will request 
instructions from the General Counsel, submitting copy of so much of the 
pleadings or other papers, together with a sufficient recital of the 
facts as will make clear the background, the issues, and the relief 
sought. The submission also will include names and addresses of adverse 
parties and attorneys so that immediate action may be taken if 
injunctive relief seems proper. Where necessary in any case to preserve 
rights which might be lost by default if there had been proper service 
of process, appropriate action will be taken by a special appearance, 
or, in jurisdictions where a special appearance does not serve the 
purpose or under State statute or decisions will constitute a general 
appearance for a later date, by an appearance through amicus curiae, to 
obtain an extension of time, preferably 30 days or more, in which to 
appear and plead without prejudice. If not feasible to obtain an 
extension, the Regional Counsel will explain to adverse counsel by 
letter, and personally, if desirable, the necessity of deferring all 
action and will see that the proper judge receives a signed copy of the 
letter before default day. The letter will point out that there is no 
valid service of process on the Secretary of Veterans Affairs but will 
not base the delay on that alone.
    (b) The General Counsel or each Regional Counsel representing the 
General Counsel is the attorney of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for 
all purposes of 38 U.S.C. 3720 and, as such, is authorized to represent 
the Secretary in any court action or other legal matter arising under 
said statutory provisions. Said authorization is subject to any 
applicable statutes and Executive orders concerning claims of the United 
States. A Regional Counsel may enter appearance in such cases, subject 
to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 36.4282 and 36.4319 of this chapter and 
paragraph (a) of this section. Each Regional Counsel is authorized to 
contract for the employment of attorneys on a fee basis for conducting 
any action arising under guaranty or insurance of loans or direct loans 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs; or for examination and other 
proper services with respect to title to and liens on real and personal 
property, material incident to such activities of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, when, such employment is deemed by the Regional 
Counsel to be appropriate. the authority delegated to the Regional 
Counsel may be redelegated with the approval of the General Counsel.
    (c) The General Counsel and each Regional Counsel, in carrying out 
their duties as authorized in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, are 
authorized: (1) To contract for and execute, for and on behalf of the 
Secretary, any bond (and appropriate contract or application therefor) 
which is required in or preliminary to or in connection with any 
judicial proceeding in which the Regional Counsel is attorney for the 
Secretary, and to incur obligations for premiums for such bonds and (2) 
to do all

[[Page 567]]

other acts and incur all costs and expenses which are necessary or 
appropriate to further or protect the interests of the Secretary in or 
in connection with prosecuting or defending any cause in any court or 
tribunal within the United States, which cause arises out of or incident 
to the guaranty or insurance of loans, or the making or direct loans by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. ch. 37.
    (d) Except in an emergency, no Regional Counsel will initiate action 
for appellate review without prior approval by the General Counsel. 
These limitations do not preclude the filing of a motion for a new 
trial, appeal to intermediate court with hearing do novo, the giving of 
notice of appeal, reserving of bills of exception, or any other 
preliminary action in the trial court which may be necessary or 
appropriate to protect or facilitate, the exercise of the right of 
appellate review, nor do they preclude the taking of appropriate steps 
on behalf of the Secretary as appellee (respondent) without prior 
reference to the General Counsel. Upon the conclusion of the trial of a 
case, the Regional Counsel will report the result thereof to the General 
Counsel with recommendation as to seeking appellate review if the result 
reported is adverse to the position of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs in the litigation. The reporting Regional Counsel who recommends 
appellate review will include as a part of the communication, or in 
exhibits attached: (1) A summary of the evidence; (2) a summary of the 
law points to be reviewed; (3) citations of statutes and cases; (4) 
statements of special reasons for recommending appellate review; (5) 
time limitations for the action recommended; (6) requirements, if any, 
respecting printing of the record and briefs; (7) the estimated total 
expenses to be incurred by reason of the appeal, reporting separately 
the estimated costs for printing the brief and record so that authority 
for printing may be granted in accordance with the prescribed procedure, 
MP-1, part II, chapter 9;\1\ and (8) the recommendation or a statement 
as to nonrecommendation by the Loan Guaranty Officer.

Sec. 14.516  Escheat and post fund cases.

    In any case in which the Department of Veterans Affairs is entitled 
to possession of assets or property under the escheat provisions of 38 
U.S.C. 5502(e), the gifts provisions of 38 U.S.C. ch. 83 or the General 
Post Fund provisions of 38 U.S.C. ch. 85, the Regional Counsel will 
endeavor to obtain possession of such assets or property in any manner 
appropriate under local procedure and practice, other than litigation. 
This procedure would include exploratory inquiry of the person having 
custody or possession of the assets or property for the purpose of 
determining whether the person would be willing to turn over the 
property to the Department of Veterans Affairs without litigation. If 
unsuccessful in this effort, a complete report will be submitted by the 
Regional Counsel to the General Counsel so that appropriate action may 
be taken to obtain the assistance of the Department of Justice in the 
matter.

Sec. 14.517  Cases affecting the Department of Veterans Affairs generally.

    Regional Counsels will establish and maintain such close liaison

Department of Veterans Affairs. Such information will be forwarded to 
the General Counsel promptly in every case.

Sec. 14.518  Litigation involving beneficiaries in custody of Department of Veterans Affairs employees acting in official capacity.

    (a) Service of process generally. An employee, at a field facility, 
served with a writ of habeas corpus involving a beneficiary of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs in the employee's custody will 
immediately notify the Regional Counsel of the region in addition to 
taking such steps as in his or her judgment are necessary for self 
protection.

[[Page 568]]

    (b) Habeas corpus writs. (1) If a Director of a Department of 
Veterans Affairs hospital concerned advises that, according, to current 
medical opinion, hospitalization is necessary for the veteran's safety 
or the safety of others, the Regional Counsel will vigorously oppose the 
writ at the trial court level. If the writ is granted, no further action 
will be taken unless so instructed by the General Counsel.
    (2) If the medical opinion is that hospitalization is not required 
for the veteran's safety or the safety of others but continued treatment 
is clearly indicated in the veteran's interest, the Regional Counsel 
will assure that the court issuing the writ is so informed and will 
abide by the court's decision.
    (3) If the medical opinion is that there is no danger of self injury 
to the veteran or others and the need for continued treatment is not 
clearly demonstrated, the Regional Counsel will advise the Director of 
the hospital concerned that the veteran should be released and will 
notify the veteran's attorney of the planned discharge. These cases will 
be handled informally to the extent practicable.
    (4) Involuntary confinement of mentally ill patients in Department 
of Veterans Affairs installations is predicated upon the law of the 
State in which the installation is located. In the event the writ is 
filed in Federal Court, the Regional Counsel will cooperate with the 
U.S. Attorney to the end that the case is removed to the appropriate 
State court.

                               Prosecution


<R05>
Sec. 14.560  Procedure where violation of penal statutes is involved including those offenses coming within the purview of the Assimilative Crime Act (18 
          U.S.C. 13).

    The Department of Justice, or the U.S. Attorneys, are charged with 
the duty and responsibility of interpreting and enforcing criminal 
statutes, and the final determination as to whether the evidence in any 
case is sufficient to warrent prosecution is a matter solely for their 
determination. If the Department of Justice or U.S. Attorney decides to 
initiate action, the Regional Counsel will cooperate as may be 
requested. The Regional Counsel will promptly bring to the attention of 
the General Counsel any case wherein he or she is of the opinion that 
criminal or civil action should be initiated notwithstanding a decision 
by the U.S. Attorney not to bring such action; any case where action has 
been inordinately delayed; and any case which would cause significant 
publicity or notoriety.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

<R05>
Sec. 14.561  Administrative action prior to submission.

    Before a submission is made to the U.S. Attorney in cases involving 
personnel or claims, the General Counsel, if the file is in Central 
Office, or the Regional Counsel at the regional office, hospital or 
center, if the file is in the regional office or other field facility, 
will first ascertain that necessary administrative or adjudicatory 
(forfeiture (see Pub. L. 86-222; 73 Stat. 452), etc.), action has been 
taken; except that in urgent cases such as breaches of the peace, 
disorderly conduct, trespass, robbery, or where the evidence may be lost 
by delay, or prosecution barred by the statute of limitations, 
submission to the U.S. Attorney will be made immediately.

[42 FR 41413, Aug. 17, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 14.562  Collections or adjustments.

    When it is determined that a submission is to be made to the U.S. 
Attorney, no demand for payment or adjustment will be made without the 
advice of the U.S. Attorney. However, if, before or after submission, 
the potential defendant or other person tenders payment of the liability 
to the United States, payment will be accepted if the U.S. Attorney has 
no objection. If the U.S. Attorney determines that prosecution is not 
indicated, or when prosecution has ended, the file will be returned to 
the appropriate office with a report as to the action taken.

Sec. 14.601  Investigation and development.

    (a) Development of untoward incidents. (1) A report of any collision 
involving a Government-owned vehicle which results in property damage or 
personal injury or death will be made by the operator of the Government 
vehicle immediately following the accident, on SF 91, Operator's Report 
of Motor Vehicle Accident, and shall be submitted to the Director of the 
facility involved. A copy of said report, accompanied by an executed 
copy of VA Form 2162, Report of Accident, will be promptly submitted by 
the Director to the appropriate Regional Counsel, who will authorize 
such additional investigation as the circumstances of the case may 
warrant. Forms required by other agencies will continue to be used in 
addition to VA Form 2162.
    (2)(i) Any incident resulting in damage to, or loss of, property, 
other than personal effects of a patient in a Department of Veterans 
Affairs facility, or in personal injury or death, due apparently or 
allegedly to the negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs acting within the scope of his or her 
office or employment, or damage to or loss of Government-owned property 
caused by other than a Department of Veterans Affairs employee acting 
within the scope of his or her office or employment, will be immediately 
reported. The Director of the facility where such occurrence took place 
will promptly transmit a copy of the report to the appropriate Regional 
Counsel who will authorize such additional investigation as the 
circumstances of the case may warrant.
    (ii) Where the incident involves the loss of personal effects of a 
patient in a Department of Veterans Affairs facility, the Director will 
assist the patient in completing an SF 95, Claim for Damage, Injury, or 
Death, and will advise the patient that it will be forwarded immediately 
to the appropriate Regional Counsel for consideration. The Director will 
forward along with the claim a brief summary of the facts, as well as 
his or her recommendation, to the Regional Counsel. The Regional Counsel 
will expedite the processing of claims of this nature.
    (3) An employee will be designated at each facility to investigate 
motor vehicle collisions and other incidents involving damage to, or 
loss of privately owned property or personal injury or death, apparently 
or allegedly resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of 
an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs acting within the 
scope of his or her employment, other than investigation of alleged 
malpractice, or damage to or loss of Government-owned property caused by 
other than Department of Veterans Affairs employees. In Central Office, 
the designation will be made by the Director of Support Service, Office 
of the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration, and 
at all other facilities, by the Director.
    (4) The Regional Counsel for the area in which a field facility is 
located will be responsible for processing claims involving motor 
vehicle collisions and other occurrences resulting in property damage, 
personal injury, or death, within such area. The Baltimore Regional 
Counsel will also have jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section over incidents occurring in Department 
of Veterans Affairs Central Office.
    (b) Development of medical malpractice claims. In medical 
malpractice cases, the Regional Counsel may refer a claim to the Under 
Secretary for Health via the Director, Medical-Legal Affairs for review 
and for professional opinion or guidance. In the consideration of claims 
involving a medical question, the responsible Regional Counsel involved 
and the General Counsel will be guided by the views of the Under 
Secretary for Health as to the standard of medical care and treatment, 
the nature and extent of the injuries, the degree of temporary or 
permanent disability, the prognosis, the necessity for future treatment 
or physical rehabilitation,

Sec. 14.604  Filing a claim.

    (a) Each person who inquires as to the procedure for filing a claim 
against the United States, predicated on a negligent or wrongful act or 
omission of an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs acting 
within the scope of his or her employment, will be furnished a copy of 
SF 95, Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death. The claimant will be advised 
to submit the executed claim directly to the Regional Counsel having 
jurisdiction of the area wherein the occurrence complained of took 
place. He or she will also be advised to submit the information 
prescribed by 28 CFR 14.4 to the extent applicable. If a claim is 
presented to the Department of Veterans Affairs which involves the 
actions of employees or officers of other agencies, it will be forwarded 
to the Department of Veterans Affairs General Counsel, for appropriate 
action in accord with 28 CFR 14.2.
    (b) A claim shall be deemed to have been presented when the 
Department of Veterans Affairs receives from a claimant, his or her duly 
authorized agent or legal representative, an executed SF 95, or other 
written notification of an incident, together with a claim for money 
damages, in a sum certain, for damage to or loss of property or personal 
injury or death: Provided, however, That before compromising or settling 
any claim, an executed SF 95 shall be obtained from the claimant.
    (c) A claim presented in compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final 
Department of Veterans Affairs action or prior to the exercise of the 
claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). Amendments shall be submitted 
in writing and signed by the claimant or his or her duly authorized 
agent or legal representative. Upon the timely filing of an amendment to 
a pending claim, the Department of Veterans Affairs shall have 6 months 
in which to make a final disposition of the claim as amended and the 
claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) shall not accrue until 6 
months after the filing of the amendment.

<R05>
Sec. 14.605  Suits against Department of Veterans Affairs employees arising out of a wrongful act or omission or based upon medical care and treatment 
          furnished in or for the Veterans Health Administration.

    (a)(1) Section 2679 of title 28 U.S.C., provides that no suit will 
lie against a Federal employee, or the employee's estate, for damage to 
property, personal injury, or death resulting from his or her wrongful 
act or omission while acting within the scope of his or her office or 
employment with the Federal Government. An action against the United 
States under 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680 is the exclusive remedy under these 
circumstances.
    (2) Section 7316 of title 38 U.S.C., provides that (i) where there 
is remedy against the United States under 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680, or (ii) 
where proceedings for compensation or other benefits from the United 
States are provided by law, and the availability of such benefits 
precludes a remedy under 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680 (as is the case, for 
example, in the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. 8101, et 
seq.), such recourse is the exclusive remedy for property damage, 
personal injury, or death allegedly occurring as a result of malpractice 
or negligence committed by a physician, dentist, nurse, physician's 
assistant, dentist's assistant, pharmacist or paramedical (for example, 
medical and dental technicians, nursing assistants, and therapists), or 
other supporting personnel, while furnishing medical care and treatment 
in the exercise of duties in or for the Veterans Health Administration. 
Accordingly, a malpractice or negligence suit for property damage, 
personal injury, or death will not lie against such personnel under the 
circumstances set forth in this subparagraph.
    (b) The Department of Justice will defend any civil action or 
proceeding brought in any court against persons referred to in paragraph 
(a) (1) or (2) of this section under the circumstances set forth 
therein. Accordingly, when a suit is filed against any employee of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs as a result of a wrongful act or omission 
arising out of employment with the Government, or as a result of 
furnishing medical or dental care and treatment in or for the Veterans 
Health Administration, the employee shall immediately forward a copy of 
all papers served on him or her to the Regional Counsel having 
jurisdiction over the area in which the employee works. The employee 
will also promptly forward to the appropriate Regional Counsel a signed 
statement indicating whether he or she desires the Department of Justice 
to provide representation, and to otherwise protect his or her interests 
as provided for by law. Even though there may not have been service, if 
an employee learns that a suit arising from either of the above-
described circumstances has been filed against him or her, the employee 
shall immediately so advise the appropriate Regional Counsel, provide 
the Regional Counsel with a brief description of the facts involved, and 
state whether he or she desires Federal intervention.
    (c) Upon receipt of notice that suit has been filed against an 
employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs who is entitled to 
protection under 28 U.S.C. 2679 or 38 U.S.C. 7316, the Regional Counsel 
having jurisdiction over the place where the employee works will conduct 
a preliminary investigation, which will include an affidavit by the 
employee's supervisor as to whether the defendant-employee was acting in 
the scope of his or her employment at the time of the incident, and a 
request from the defendant-employee for representation. The affidavit 
will contain a factual description of the employee's duties and 
responsibilities at the time of the incident and should describe the 
incident in question. Upon receipt of such information, the Regional 
Counsel will make a preliminary determination as to whether such suit 
comes within the provisions of either 28 U.S.C. 2679 or 38 U.S.C. 7316. 
The Regional Counsel will refer the matter to the appropriate U.S. 
Attorney with a recommendation as to whether the employee is eligible 
for protection under 28 U.S.C. 2679 or 38 U.S.C. 7316. The U.S. Attorney 
will decide whether the Department of Veterans Affairs employee is 
eligible for the protection. The Regional Counsel will submit to the 
General Counsel a preliminary report in duplicate containing the 
information

[[Page 573]]

furnished the U.S. Attorney. In all such cases, the Regional Counsel 
will conduct a complete investigation of the facts and law. Two copies 
of the investigation report will be sent to the General Counsel and one 
copy will be sent to the appropriate U.S. Attorney. The General Counsel, 
through the Regional Counsel, will keep the employee advised of the 
action being taken concerning the suit. In the event that the U.S. 
Attorney or the Department of Justice determines that the employee is 
not eligible for immunization pursuant to one of the aformentioned 
provisions, the General Counsel's office, through the Regional Counsel, 
will advise the employee and will call to his or her attention the 
discretionary conditional indemnification provisions of section 7316(e) 
of title 38 U.S.C.
    (d) Where a civil action is commenced in a State court against a 
Department of Veterans Affairs employee, and the matter is within the 
purview of either 28 U.S.C. 2679, or 38 U.S.C. 7316, the Department of 
Justice will be asked to remove such suit to the appropriate Federal 
District Court before trial, where it will be deemed an action against 
the United States. The defendant employee will be dismissed from the 
suit. After such removal, the United States has available all defenses 
to which it would have been entitled if the action had originally been 
commenced against the United States in the proper Federal District 
Court. Should a Federal District Court determine that the Department of 
Veterans Affairs employee whose acts or omissions gave rise to the suit 
was not acting within the scope of his or her office or employment, and 
therefore not eligible for immunization as provided for in the 
aforementioned section, the case will be remanded to the State court 
from which it was removed, the employee will be reinstated as the 
defendant, and the United States will be dismissed from the suit. Where 
the employee has been reinstated as the defendant under such 
circumstances, in order to protect any rights which he or she may have 
under 38 U.S.C. 7316(e), he or she shall immediately notify the General 
Counsel, through the local Regional Counsel. Through the Regional 
Counsel, the General Counsel will call the employee's attention to the 
discretionary conditional indemnification provisions of section 7316(e).
    (e) Under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 7316(e), the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs may pay for monetary damages sustained by or assessed 
against an individual (or his or her estate) described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, as the result of any suit instituted against 
such individual which is not congnizable under the provisions of 28 
U.S.C. 2671-2680 because the individual was assigned to a foreign 
country, the said individual was detailed to a State or political 
division thereof, or the cause of action was specifically excluded under 
the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2680(h); Provided, That the amount of 
damages sustained is reasonable when compared with similar cases, 
litigated or settled, and the United States was given a reasonable 
opportunity to defend such individual and to participate in settlement 
negotiations.

    (a) National organization. An organization may be recognized as a 
national organization if:

[[Page 578]]

    (1) It was recognized by the Department of Veterans Affairs prior to 
October 10, 1978, and continues to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 
14.628(d) of this section, or
    (2) It satisfies the following requirements:

of that State may be recognized. Only one such organization may be 
recognized in each State.
    (c) Regional or local organization. An organization other than a 
State or national organization as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section may be recognized when the Department of Veterans Affairs 
has determined that it is a veterans' service organization primarily 
involved in delivering services connected with either title 38 U.S.C., 
benefits and programs or other Federal and State programs designed to 
assist veterans. The term veteran as used in this paragraph shall 
include veterans, former armed forces personnel, and the dependents or 
survivors of either. Further, the organization shall provide 
responsible, qualified representation in the preparation, presentation, 
and prosecution of claims for title 38 U.S.C., benefits.
    (d) Requirements for recognition. (1) In order to be recognized 
under this section, an organization shall meet the following 
requirements:
    (i) Have as a primary purpose serving veterans. In establishing that 
it meets this requirement, an organization requesting recognition shall 
submit a statement establishing the purpose of the organization and that 
veterans would benefit by recognition of the organization.
    (ii) Demonstrate a substantial service commitment to veterans either 
by showing a sizable organizational membership or by showing performance 
of veterans' services to a sizable number of veterans. In establishing 
that it meets this requirement, an organization requesting recognition 
shall submit:
    (A) The number of members and number of posts, chapters, or offices 
and their addresses;
    (B) A copy of the articles of incorporation, constitution, charter, 
and bylaws of the organization, as appropriate;
    (C) A description of the services performed or to be performed in 
connection with programs administered by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, with an approximation of the number of veterans, survivors, and 
dependents served or to be served by the organization in each type of 
service designated; and
    (D) A description of the type of services, if any, performed in 
connection with other Federal and State programs which are designed to 
assist former Armed Forces personnel and their dependents, with an 
approximation of the number of veterans, survivors, and dependents 
served by the organization under each program designated.
    (iii) Commit a significant portion of its assets to veterans' 
services and have adequate funding to properly perform those services. 
In establishing that it meets this requirement, an organization 
requesting recognition shall submit:
    (A) A copy of the last financial statement of the organization 
indicating the amount of funds allocated for conducting particular 
veterans' services (VA may, in cases where it deems necessary, require 
an audited financial statement); and
    (B) A statement indicating that use of the organization's funding is 
not subject to limitations imposed under any Federal grant or law which 
would prevent it from representing claimants

[[Page 579]]

before the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (iv) Maintain a policy and capability of providing complete claims 
service to each claimant requesting representation or give written 
notice of any limitation in its claims service with advice concerning 
the availability of alternative sources of claims service. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section, in 
establishing that it meets this requirement, an organization requesting 
recognition shall submit evidence of its capability to represent 
claimants before Department of Veterans Affairs regional offices and 
before the Board of Veterans' Appeals.
    (A) If an organization does not intend to represent claimants before 
the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the organization shall submit evidence 
of an association or agreement with a recognized service organization 
for the purpose of representation before the Board of Veterans' Appeals, 
or the proposed method of informing claimants of the limitations in 
service that can be provided, with advice concerning the availability of 
alternative sources of claims service.
    (B) If an organization does not intend to represent each claimant 
requesting assistance, the organization shall submit a statement of its 
policy concerning the selection of claimants and the proposed method of 
informing claimants of this policy, with advice concerning the 
availability of alternative sources of claims service.

    Note to paragraph (d)(1)(iv): An organization may be considered to 
provide complete claims service notwithstanding the exercise of 
discretion to determine that provision of representation in a particular 
case is impracticable or inappropriate because, under the circumstances, 
the facts or law do not support the filing of a claim or appeal, an 
appropriate representative-claimant relationship cannot be maintained, 
or representation would give rise to a conflict of interest on the part 
of the organization.

    (v) Take affirmative action, including training and monitoring of 
accredited representatives, to ensure proper handling of claims. In 
establishing that it meets this requirement, an organization requesting 
recognition shall submit:

current paid or volunteer staff personnel for handling veterans' claims; 
and
    (B) A plan for recruiting and training qualified claim

training, a schedule or timetable for training, the projected number of 
trainees for the first year, and the name(s) and qualifications of the 
individual(s) primarily responsible for the training.
    (2) In addition, the organization requesting recognition shall 
supply:
    (i) A statement that neither the organization nor its accredited 
representatives will charge or accept a fee or gratuity for service to a 
claimant and that the organization will not represent to the public that 
Department of Veterans Affairs recognition of the organization is for 
any purpose other than claimant representation; and
    (ii) The names, titles, and addresses of officers and the 
official(s) authorized to certify representatives.
    (e) Recognition or denial. Only the Secretary is authorized to 
recognize organizations. Notice of the Secretary's determination on a 
request for recognition will be sent to an organization within 90 days 
of receipt of all information to be supplied.
    (f) Requests for further information. The Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee may request further information from any recognized 
organization, including progress reports, updates, or verifications.

Sec. 14.629  Requirements for accreditation of service organization representatives; agents; and attorneys.

    The Assistant General Counsel of jurisdiction or his or her designee 
will conduct an inquiry and make an initial determination regarding any 
question

[[Page 580]]

relating to the qualifications of a prospective service organization 
representative, agent, or attorney. If the Assistant General Counsel or 
designee determines that the prospective service organization 
representative, agent, or attorney meets the requirements for 
accreditation in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, notification of 
accreditation will be issued by the Assistant General Counsel or the 
Assistant General Counsel's designee and will constitute authority to 
prepare, present, and prosecute claims before an agency of original 
jurisdiction or the Board of Veterans' Appeals. If the Assistant General 
Counsel determines that the prospective representative, agent, or 
attorney does not meet the requirements for accreditation, notification 
will be issued by the Assistant General Counsel concerning the reasons 
for disapproval, an opportunity to submit additional information, and 
any restrictions on further application for accreditation. If an 
applicant submits additional evidence, the Assistant General Counsel 
will consider such evidence and provide further notice concerning his or 
her final decision. The determination of the Assistant General Counsel 
regarding the qualifications of a prospective service organization 
representative, agent, or attorney may be appealed by the applicant to 
the General Counsel. Appeals must be in writing and filed with the 
Office of the General Counsel (022D), 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., 
Washington, DC 20420, not later than 30 days from the date on which the 
Assistant General Counsel's decision was mailed. In deciding the appeal, 
the General Counsel's decision shall be limited to the evidence of 
record before the Assistant General Counsel. A decision of the General 
Counsel is a final agency action for purposes of review under the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701-706.
    (a) Service Organization Representatives. A recognized organization 
shall file with the Office of the General Counsel VA Form 21 
(Application for Accreditation as Service Organization Representative) 
for each person it desires accredited as a representative of that 
organization. The form must be signed by the prospective representative 
and the organization's certifying official. For each of its accredited 
representatives, a recognized organization's certifying official shall 
complete, sign and file with the Office of the General Counsel, not 
later than five years after initial accreditation through that 
organization or the most recent recertification by that organization, VA 
Form 21 to certify that the representative continues to meet the 
criteria for accreditation specified in paragraph (a)(1), (2) and (3) of 
this section. In recommending a person, the organization shall certify 
that the designee:
    (1) Is of good character and reputation and has demonstrated an 
ability to represent claimants before the VA;
    (2) Is either a member in good standing or a paid employee of such 
organization working for it not less than 1,000 hours annually; is 
accredited and functioning as a representative of another recognized 
organization; or, in the case of a county veteran's service officer 
recommended by a recognized State organization, meets the following 
criteria:
    (i) Is a paid employee of the county working for it not less than 
1,000 hours annually;
    (ii) Has successfully completed a course of training and an 
examination which have been approved by a Regional Counsel with 
jurisdiction for the State; and
    (iii) Will receive either regular supervision and monitoring or 
annual training to assure continued qualification as a representative in 
the claim process; and
    (3) Is not employed in any civil or military department or agency of 
the United States.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a), 5902)

    (b) Accreditation of Agents and Attorneys. (1) No individual may 
assist claimants in the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of 
claims for VA benefits as an agent or attorney unless he or she has 
first been accredited by VA for such purpose.
    (i) For agents, the initial accreditation process consists of 
application to the General Counsel, self-certification of admission 
information concerning practice before any other court, bar, or

[[Page 581]]

State or Federal agency, an affirmative determination of character and 
fitness by VA, and a written examination.
    (ii) For attorneys, the initial accreditation process consists of 
application to the General Counsel, self-certification of admission 
information concerning practice before any other court, bar, or State or 
Federal agency, and a determination of character and fitness. The 
General Counsel will presume an attorney's character and fitness to 
practice before VA based on State bar membership in good standing unless 
the General Counsel receives credible information to the contrary.
    (iii) As a further condition of initial accreditation, both agents 
and attorneys are required to complete 3 hours of qualifying continuing 
legal education (CLE) during the first 12-month period following the 
date of initial accreditation by VA. To qualify under this subsection, a 
CLE course must be approved for a minimum of 3 hours of CLE credit by 
any State bar association and, at a minimum, must cover the following 
topics: representation before VA, claims procedures, basic eligibility 
for VA benefits, right to appeal, disability compensation (38 U.S.C. 
Chapter 11), dependency and indemnity compensation (38 U.S.C. Chapter 
13), and pension (38 U.S.C. Chapter 15). Upon completion of the initial 
CLE requirement, agents and attorneys shall certify to the Office of the 
General Counsel in writing that they have completed qualifying CLE. Such 
certification shall include the title of the CLE, date and time of the 
CLE, and identification of the CLE provider, and shall be submitted to 
VA as part of the annual certification prescribed by Sec. 14.629(b)(4).
    (iv) To maintain accreditation, agents and attorneys are required to 
complete an additional 3 hours of qualifying CLE on veterans benefits 
law and procedure not later than 3 years from the date of initial 
accreditation and every 2 years thereafter. To qualify under this 
subsection, a CLE course must be approved for a minimum of 3 hours of 
CLE credit by any State bar association. Agents and attorneys shall 
certify completion of the post-accreditation CLE requirement in the same 
manner as described in Sec. 14.629(b)(1)(iii).
    (2) An individual desiring accreditation as an agent or attorney 
must establish that he or she is of good character and reputation, is 
qualified to render valuable assistance to claimants, and is otherwise 
competent to advise and assist claimants in the preparation, 
presentation, and prosecution of their claim(s) before the Department. 
An individual desiring accreditation as an agent or attorney must file a 
completed application (VA Form 21a) with the Office of the General 
Counsel (022D), 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, on which 
the applicant submits the following:
    (i) His or her full name and home and business addresses;
    (ii) Information concerning the applicant's military and civilian 
employment history (including character of military discharge, if 
applicable);
    (iii) Information concerning representation provided by the 
applicant before any department, agency, or bureau of the Federal 
government;
    (iv) Information concerning any criminal background of the 
applicant;
    (v) Information concerning whether the applicant has ever been 
determined mentally incompetent or hospitalized as a result of a mental 
disease or disability, or is currently under treatment for a mental 
disease or disability;
    (vi) Information concerning whether the applicant was previously 
accredited as a representative of a veterans service organization and, 
if so, whether that accreditation was terminated or suspended by or at 
the request of that organization;
    (vii) Information concerning the applicant's level of education and 
academic history;
    (viii) The names, addresses, and phone numbers of three character 
references; and
    (ix) Information relevant to whether the applicant for accreditation 
as an agent has any physical limitations that would interfere with the 
completion of a comprehensive written examination administered under the 
supervision of a VA Regional Counsel (agents only); and
    (x) Certification that the applicant has satisfied the 
qualifications and

[[Page 582]]

standards required for accreditation as prescribed by VA in this 
section, and that the applicant will abide by the standards of conduct 
prescribed by VA in Sec. 14.632 of this part.
    (3) Evidence showing lack of good character and reputation includes, 
but is not limited to, one or more of the following: Conviction of a 
felony, conviction of a misdemeanor involving fraud, bribery, deceit, 
theft, or misappropriation; suspension or disbarment from a court, bar, 
or Federal or State agency on ethical grounds; or resignation from 
admission to a court, bar, or Federal or State agency while under 
investigation to avoid sanction.
    (4) As a further condition of initial accreditation and annually 
thereafter, each person seeking accreditation as an agent or attorney 
shall submit to VA information about any court, bar, or Federal or State 
agency to which the agent or attorney is admitted to practice or 
otherwise authorized to appear. Applicants shall provide identification 
numbers and membership information for each jurisdiction in which the 
applicant is admitted and a certification that the agent or attorney is 
in good standing in every jurisdiction in which admitted. After 
accreditation, agents and attorneys must notify VA within 30 days of any 
change in their status in any jurisdiction in which they are admitted to 
appear.
    (5) VA will not accredit an individual as an agent or attorney if 
the individual has been suspended by any court, bar, or Federal or State 
agency in which the individual was previously admitted and not 
subsequently reinstated. However, if an individual remains suspended in 
a jurisdiction on grounds solely derivative of suspension or disbarment 
in another jurisdiction to which he or she has been subsequently 
reinstated, the General Counsel may evaluate the facts and grant or 
reinstate accreditation as appropriate.
    (6) After an affirmative determination of character and fitness for 
practice before the Department, applicants for accreditation as a claims 
agent must achieve a score of 75 percent or more on a written 
examination administered by VA as a prerequisite to accreditation. No 
applicant shall be allowed to sit for the examination more than twice in 
any 6-month period.
    (c) Representation by Attorneys, Law Firms, Law Students and 
Paralegals. (1) After accreditation by the General Counsel, an attorney 
may represent a claimant upon submission of a VA Form 21-22a, 
``Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative.''
    (2) If the claimant consents in writing, an attorney associated or 
affiliated with the claimant's attorney of record or employed by the 
same legal services office as the attorney of record may assist in the 
representation of the claimant.
    (3) A legal intern, law student, or paralegal may not be 
independently accredited to represent claimants under this paragraph. A 
legal intern, law student, or certified paralegal may assist in the 
preparation, presentation, or prosecution of a claim, under the direct 
supervision of an attorney of record designated under Sec. 14.631(a), 
if the claimant's written consent is furnished to VA. Such consent must 
specifically state that participation in all aspects of the claim by a 
legal intern, law student, or paralegal furnishing written authorization 
from the attorney of record is authorized. In addition, suitable 
authorization for access to the claimant's records must be provided in 
order for such an individual to participate. The supervising attorney 
must be present at any hearing in which a legal intern, law student, or 
paralegal participates. The written consent must include the name of the 
veteran, or the name of the appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a 
veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA 
benefits on an individual's behalf); the applicable VA file number; the 
name of the attorney-at-law; the consent of the appellant for the use of 
the services of legal interns, law students, or paralegals and for such 
individuals to have access to applicable VA records; and the names of 
the legal interns, law students, or paralegals who will be assisting in 
the case. The signed consent must be submitted to the agency of original 
jurisdiction and maintained in the claimant's file. In the case of 
appeals before the Board in Washington, DC, the signed consent

[[Page 583]]

must be submitted to: Director, Management and Administration (01E), 
Board of Veterans' Appeals, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 
20420. In the case of hearings before a Member or Members of the Board 
at VA field facilities, the consent must be presented to the presiding 
Member of the hearing.
    (4) Unless revoked by the claimant, consent provided under paragraph 
(c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall remain effective in the 
event the claimant's original attorney is replaced as attorney of record 
by another member of the same law firm or an attorney employed by the 
same legal services office.

    Note to Sec. 14.629: A legal intern, law student, paralegal, or 
veterans service organization support-staff person, working under the 
supervision of an individual designated under Sec. 14.631(a) as the 
claimant's representative, attorney, or agent, may qualify for read-only 
access to pertinent Veterans Benefits Administration automated claims 
records as described in Sec. Sec. 1.600 through 1.603 in part 1 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 14.630  Authorization for a particular claim.

    (a) Any person may be authorized to prepare, present, and prosecute 
one claim. A power of attorney executed on VA Form 21-22a, ``Appointment 
of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative,'' and a statement 
signed by the person and the claimant that no compensation will be 
charged or paid for the services, shall be filed with the agency of 
original jurisdiction where the claim is presented. The power of 
attorney identifies to VA the claimant's appointment of representation 
and authorizes VA's disclosure of information to the person representing 
the claimant.
    (b) Representation may be provided by an individual pursuant to this 
section one time only. An exception to this limitation may be granted by 
the General Counsel in unusual circumstances. Among the factors which 
may be considered in determining whether an exception will be granted 
are:
    (1) The number of accredited representatives, agents, and attorneys 
operating in the claimant's geographic region;
    (2) Whether the claimant has unsuccessfully sought representation 
from other sources;
    (3) The nature and status of the claim; and
    (4) Whether there exists unique circumstances which would render 
alternative representation inadequate.
    (c) Persons providing representation under this section must comply 
with the laws administered by VA and with the regulations governing 
practice before VA including the rules of conduct in Sec. 14.632 of 
this part.
    (d) Persons providing representation under this section are subject 
to suspension and or exclusion from representation of claimants before 
VA on the same grounds as apply to representatives, agents, and 
attorneys in Sec. 14.633 of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 14.631  Powers of attorney; disclosure of claimant information.

    (a) A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22, 
``Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's 
Representative,'' or VA Form 21-22a, ``Appointment of Attorney or Agent 
as Claimant's Representative,'' is required to represent a claimant 
before VA and to authorize VA's disclosure of information to any person 
or organization representing a claimant before the Department. Without 
the signature of a person providing representation for a particular 
claim under Sec. 14.630 of this part or an accredited veterans service 
organization representative, agent, or attorney, the appointment is 
invalid, and the person appointed to provide representation is under no 
obligation to do so. The power of attorney shall meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) Contain signature by:

[[Page 584]]

    (i) The claimant, or
    (ii) The claimant's guardian, or
    (iii) In the case of an incompetent, minor, or otherwise 
incapacitated person without a guardian, the following in the order 
named--spouse, parent, other relative or friend (if interests are not 
adverse), or the director of the hospital in which the claimant is 
maintained; and
    (iv) An individual providing representation on a particular claim 
under Sec. 14.630 of this part or an accredited veterans service 
organization representative, agent, or attorney; and
    (2) Shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in 
the veteran's claims folder.
    (b) VA may, for any purpose, treat a power of attorney naming as a 
claimant's representative an organization recognized under Sec. 14.628, 
a particular office of such an organization, or an individual 
representative of such an organization as an appointment of the entire 
organization as the claimant's representative, unless the claimant 
specifically indicates in the power of attorney a desire to appoint only 
the individual representative. Such specific indication must be made in 
the space on the power-of-attorney form for designation of the 
representative and must use the word ``only'' with reference to the 
individual representative.
    (c) An organization, individual providing representation on a 
particular claim under Sec. 14.630, representative, agent, or attorney 
named in a power of attorney executed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section may withdraw from representation provided before a VA agency of 
original jurisdiction if such withdrawal would not adversely impact the 
claimant's interests. This section is applicable until an agency of 
original jurisdiction certifies an appeal to the Board of Veterans' 
Appeals after which time 38 CFR 20.608 governs withdrawal from 
representation before the Board. Withdrawal is also permissible if a 
claimant persists in a course of action that the organization or 
individual providing representation reasonably believes is fraudulent or 
criminal and is furthered through the representation of the organization 
or individual; the claimant fails to uphold an obligation to the 
organization or individual providing representation regarding the 
services of the organization or individual; or other good cause for 
withdrawal exists. An organization or individual providing 
representation withdraws from representation by notifying the claimant, 
the VA organization in possession of the claims file, and the agency of 
original jurisdiction in writing prior to taking any action to withdraw 
and takes steps necessary to protect the claimant's interests including, 
but not limited to, giving advance notice to the claimant, allowing time 
for appointment of alternative representation, and returning any 
documents provided by VA in the course of the representation to the 
agency of original jurisdiction or pursuant to the claimant's 
instructions, to the organization or individual substituted as the 
representative, agent, or attorney of record. Upon withdrawing from 
representation, all property of the claimant must be returned to the 
claimant. If the claimant is unavailable, all documents provided by VA 
for purposes of representation must be returned to the VA organization 
in possession of the claims file. Any other property of the claimant 
must be maintained by the organization or individual according to 
applicable law.

    (d) Questions concerning the validity or effect of powers of 
attorney shall be referred to the Regional Counsel of jurisdiction for 
initial determination. This determination may be appealed to the General 
Counsel.
    (e)(1) Only one organization, representative, agent, or attorney 
will be recognized at one time in the prosecution of a particular claim. 
Except as provided in Sec. 14.629(c) and paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, all transactions concerning the claim will be conducted 
exclusively with the recognized organization, representative, agent, or 
attorney of record until notice of a change, if any, is received by the 
appropriate office of VA.
    (2) An organization named in a power of attorney executed in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may employ an attorney to 
represent a claimant in a particular claim. Unless the attorney is an 
accredited representative of the organization, the

[[Page 585]]

written consent of the claimant shall be required.
    (f)(1) A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent 
or attorney may be discharged at any time. Unless a claimant 
specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney 
executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing 
representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of 
attorney.
    (2) If an agent or attorney limits the scope of his or her 
representation regarding a particular claim by so indicating on VA Form 
21-22a, or a claimant authorizes a person to provide representation in a 
particular claim under Sec. 14.630, such specific authority shall 
constitute a revocation of an existing general power of attorney filed 
under paragraph (a) of this section only as it pertains to, and during 
the pendency of, that particular claim. Following the final 
determination of such claim, the general power of attorney shall remain 
in effect as to any new or reopened claim.

Sec. 14.632  Standards of conduct for persons providing representation before the Department

    (a)(1) All persons acting on behalf of a claimant shall faithfully 
execute their duties as individuals providing representation on a 
particular claim under Sec. 14.630, representatives, agents, or 
attorneys.
    (2) All individuals providing representation are required to be 
truthful in their dealings with claimants and VA.
    (b) An individual providing representation on a particular claim 
under Sec. 14.630, representative, agent, or attorney shall:
    (1) Provide claimants with competent representation before VA. 
Competent representation requires the knowledge, skill, thoroughness, 
and preparation necessary for the representation. This includes 
understanding the issues of fact and law relevant to the claim as well 
as the applicable provisions of title 38, United States Code, and title 
38, Code of Federal Regulations;
    (2) Act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing 
claimants. This includes responding promptly to VA requests for 
information or assisting a claimant in responding promptly to VA 
requests for information.
    (c) An individual providing representation on a particular claim 
under Sec. 14.630, representative, agent, or attorney shall not:
    (1) Violate the standards of conduct as described in this section;
    (2) Circumvent a rule of conduct through the actions of another;
    (3) Engage in conduct involving fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or 
dishonesty;
    (4) Violate any of the provisions of title 38, United States Code, 
or title 38, Code of Federal Regulations;
    (5) Enter into an agreement for, charge, solicit, or receive a fee 
that is clearly unreasonable or otherwise prohibited by law or 
regulation;
    (6) Solicit, receive, or enter into agreements for gifts related to 
representation provided before an agency of original jurisdiction has 
issued a decision on a claim or claims and a Notice of Disagreement has 
been filed with respect to that decision;
    (7) Delay, without good cause, the processing of a claim at any 
stage of the administrative process;
    (8) Mislead, threaten, coerce, or deceive a claimant regarding 
benefits or other rights under programs administered by VA;
    (9) Engage in, or counsel or advise a claimant to engage in acts or 
behavior prejudicial to the fair and orderly conduct of administrative 
proceedings before VA;
    (10) Disclose, without the claimant's authorization, any information 
provided by VA for purposes of representation; or
    (11) Engage in any other unlawful or unethical conduct.
    (d) In addition to complying with standards of conduct for practice 
before VA in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, an attorney 
shall not, in providing representation to a claimant

[[Page 586]]

before VA, engage in behavior or activities prohibited by the rules of 
professional conduct of any jurisdiction in which the attorney is 
licensed to practice law.

Sec. 14.633  Termination of accreditation or authority to provide representation under Sec. 14.630.

    (a) Accreditation or authority to provide representation on a 
particular claim under Sec. 14.630 may be suspended or canceled at the 
request of an organization, individual providing representation under 
Sec. 14.630, representative, agent, or attorney. When an organization 
requests suspension or cancellation of the accreditation of a 
representative due to misconduct or lack of competence on the part of 
the representative or because the representative resigned to avoid 
suspension or cancellation of accreditation for misconduct or lack of 
competence, the organization shall inform VA of the reason for the 
request for suspension or cancellation and the facts and circumstances 
surrounding any incident that led to the request.
    (b) Accreditation shall be canceled at such time as a determination 
is made by the General Counsel that any requirement of Sec. 14.629 is 
no longer met by a representative, agent, or attorney.
    (c) Accreditation or authority to provide representation on a 
particular claim shall be canceled when the General Counsel finds, by 
clear and convincing evidence, one or more of the following:
    (1) Violation of or refusal to comply with the laws administered by 
VA or with the regulations governing practice before VA including the 
standards of conduct in Sec. 14.632;
    (2) Knowingly presenting or prosecuting a fraudulent claim against 
the United States, or knowingly providing false information to the 
United States;
    (3) Demanding or accepting unlawful compensation for preparing, 
presenting, prosecuting, or advising or consulting, concerning a claim;
    (4) Knowingly presenting to VA a frivolous claim, issue, or 
argument. A claim, issue, or argument is frivolous if the individual 
providing representation under Sec. 14.630, representative, agent, or 
attorney is unable to make a good faith argument on the merits of the 
position taken or to support the position taken by a good faith argument 
for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;
    (5) Suspension or disbarment by any court, bar, or Federal or State 
agency to which such individual providing representation under Sec. 
14.630, representative, agent, or attorney was previously admitted to 
practice, or disqualification from participating in or appearing before 
any court, bar, or Federal or State agency and lack of subsequent 
reinstatement;
    (6) Charging excessive or unreasonable fees for representation as 
determined by VA, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, or the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; or
    (7) Any other unlawful or unethical practice adversely affecting an 
individual's fitness for practice before VA.
    (d) Accreditation or authority to provide representation on a 
particular claim shall be canceled when the General Counsel finds that 
the performance of an individual providing representation under Sec. 
14.630, representative, agent, or attorney before VA demonstrates a lack 
of the degree of competence necessary to adequately prepare, present, 
and prosecute claims for veteran's benefits. A determination that the 
performance of an individual providing representation under Sec. 
14.630, representative, agent, or attorney before VA demonstrates a lack 
of the degree of competence required to represent claimants before VA 
will be based upon consideration of the following factors:
    (1) The relative complexity and specialized nature of the matter;
    (2) The individual's general experience;
    (3) The individual's training and experience; and
    (4) The preparation and study the individual is able to give 
veterans benefits matters and whether it is feasible to refer such 
matters to, or associate or consult with, an individual of established 
competence in the field of practice.

[[Page 587]]

    (e) As to cancellation of accreditation under paragraphs (c) or (d) 
of this section, upon receipt of credible written information from any 
source indicating improper conduct, or incompetence, the Assistant 
General Counsel of jurisdiction shall inform the subject of the 
allegations about the specific law, regulation, or policy alleged to 
have been violated or the nature of the alleged incompetence and the 
source of the complaint, and shall provide the subject with the 
opportunity to respond. If the matter involves an accredited 
representative of a recognized organization, the notice shall include 
contact with the representative's organization. When appropriate, 
including situations where no harm results to the claimant or VA, the 
Assistant General Counsel will provide the subject with an opportunity 
to correct the offending behavior before deciding whether to proceed 
with a formal inquiry. If the subject refuses to comply and the matter 
remains unresolved, or the behavior subsequently results in harm to a 
claimant or VA, the Assistant General Counsel shall immediately initiate 
a formal inquiry into the matter.
    (1) If the result of the inquiry does not justify further action, 
the Assistant General Counsel will close the inquiry and maintain the 
record for 3 years.
    (2) If the result of the inquiry justifies further action, the 
Assistant General Counsel shall:
    (i) Inform the General Counsel of the result of the inquiry and 
notify the individual providing representation under Sec. 14.630, 
representative, agent or attorney of an intent to cancel accreditation 
or authority to provide representation on a particular claim. The notice 
will be sent to individuals providing representation on a particular 
claim by certified or registered mail to the individual's last known 
address of record as indicated on the VA Form 21-22a on file with the 
agency of original jurisdiction. The notice will be sent to accredited 
individuals by certified or registered mail to the individual's last 
known address of record as indicated in VA's accreditation records. The 
notice will state the reason(s) for the cancellation proceeding and 
advise the individual to file an answer, in oath or affidavit form or 
the form specified for unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury in 
28 U.S.C. 1746, within 30 days from the date the notice was mailed, 
responding to the stated reasons for cancellation and explaining why he 
or she should not be suspended or excluded from practice before VA. The 
notice will also advise the individual of the right to submit additional 
evidence and the right to request a hearing on the matter. Requests for 
hearings must be made in the answer. If the individual does not file an 
answer with the Office of the General Counsel within 30 days of the date 
that the Assistant General Counsel mailed the notice, the Assistant 
General Counsel shall close the record and forward it with a 
recommendation to the General Counsel for a final decision.
    (ii) In the event that a hearing is not requested, the Assistant 
General Counsel shall close the record and forward it with a 
recommendation to the General Counsel for a final decision.
    (iii) The Assistant General Counsel may extend the time to file an 
answer or request a hearing for a reasonable period upon a showing of 
sufficient cause.
    (iv) For purposes of computing time for responses to notices of 
intent to cancel accreditation, days means calendar days. In computing 
the time for filing this response, the date on which the notice was 
mailed by the Assistant General Counsel shall be excluded. A response 
postmarked prior to the expiration of the 30th day shall be accepted as 
timely filed. If the 30th day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the 
first business day thereafter shall be included in the computation. As 
used in this section, legal holiday means New Year's Day, Birthday of 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, 
Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving 
Day, Christmas Day, and any other day appointed as a holiday by the 
President or the Congress of the United States, or by the State in which 
the individual resides.
    (f) If a hearing is requested, it will be held at the VA Regional 
Office nearest the individual's principal place of business. If the 
individual's principal place of business is Washington, DC, the

[[Page 588]]

hearing will be held at the VA Central Office or other VA facility in 
Washington, DC. For hearings conducted at either location, the Assistant 
General Counsel or his or her designee shall present the evidence. The 
hearing officer shall not report, directly or indirectly to, or be 
employed by the General Counsel or the head of the VA agency of original 
jurisdiction before which the individual provided representation. The 
hearing officer shall provide notice of the hearing to the individual 
providing representation under Sec. 14.630, representative, agent, or 
attorney by certified or registered mail at least 21 days before the 
date of the hearing. Hearings shall not be scheduled before the 
completion of the 30-day period for filing an answer to the notice of 
intent to cancel accreditation. The hearing officer will have authority 
to administer oaths. The party requesting the hearing will have a right 
to counsel, to present evidence, and to cross-examine witnesses. Upon 
request of the individual requesting the hearing, an appropriate VA 
official designated in Sec. 2.1 of this chapter may issue subpoenas to 
compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents 
necessary for a fair hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in an 
informal manner and court rules of evidence shall not apply. Testimony 
shall be recorded verbatim. The evidentiary record shall be closed 10 
days after the completion of the hearing. The hearing officer shall 
submit the entire hearing transcript, any pertinent records or 
information, and a recommended finding to the Assistant General Counsel 
within 30 days of closing the record. The Assistant General Counsel 
shall immediately forward the record and the hearing officer's 
recommendation to the General Counsel for a final decision.
    (g) The General Counsel may suspend the accreditation of a 
representative, agent, or attorney, under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of 
this section, for a definite period or until the conditions for 
reinstatement specified by the General Counsel are satisfied. The 
General Counsel shall reinstate an individual's accreditation at the end 
of the suspension period or upon verification that the individual has 
satisfied the conditions for reinstatement.
    (h) The decision of the General Counsel is a final adjudicative 
determination of an agency of original jurisdiction and may be appealed 
to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. The effective date for cancellation 
of accreditation or authority to provide representation on a particular 
claim shall be the date upon which the General Counsel's final decision 
is rendered. Notwithstanding provisions in this section for closing the 
record at the end of the 30-day period for filing an answer or 10 days 
after a hearing, appeals shall be initiated and processed using the 
procedures in 38 CFR parts 19 and 20. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to limit the Board's authority to remand a matter to the 
General Counsel under 38 CFR 19.9 for any action that is essential for a 
proper appellate decision or the General Counsel's ability to issue a 
Supplemental Statement of the Case under 38 CFR 19.31.
    (i) In cases where the accreditation of an agent or attorney is 
cancelled, the Office of the General Counsel may notify all agencies, 
courts, and bars to which the agent or attorney is admitted to practice.

Sec. 14.635  Office space and facilities.

    The Secretary may furnish office space and facilities, if available, 
in buildings owned or occupied by the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
for the use of paid full-time representatives of recognized national 
organizations, and for employees of recognized State organizations who 
are accredited to national organizations, for purposes of assisting 
claimants in the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims 
for Department of Veterans Affairs benefits.
    (a) Request for office space should be made by an appropriate 
official of the organization to the Director of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs facility in which space is desired and should set 
forth:
    (1) The number of full-time paid representatives who will be 
permanently assigned to the office;
    (2) The number of secretarial or other support staff who will be 
assigned to the office;
    (3) The number of claimants for whom the organization holds powers 
of attorney whose claims are within the jurisdiction of the facility or 
who reside in the area served by the facility, the number of such 
claimants whose claims are pending, and the number of claims prosecuted 
during the previous three years; and
    (4) Any other information the organization deems relevant to the 
allocation of office space.
    (b) When in the judgment of the Director office space and facilities 
previously granted could be better used by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, or would receive more effective use or serve more claimants if 
allocated to another recognized national organization, the Director may 
withdraw such space or reassign such space to another organization. In 
the case of a facility under the control of the Veterans Benefits 
Administration or the Veterans Health Administration, the final decision 
on such matters will be made by the Under Secretary for Benefits or the

<R05>
Sec. 14.636  Payment of fees for representation by agents and attorneys in proceedings before Agencies of Original Jurisdiction and before the Board of 
          Veterans' Appeals.

    (a) Applicability of rule. The provisions of this section apply to 
the services of accredited agents and attorneys with respect to benefits 
under laws administered by VA in all proceedings before the agency of 
original jurisdiction or before the Board of Veterans' Appeals 
regardless of whether an appeal has been initiated.
    (b) Who may charge fees for representation. Only accredited agents 
and attorneys may receive fees from claimants or appellants for their 
services provided in connection with representation. Recognized 
organizations (including their accredited representatives when acting as 
such) and individuals recognized under Sec. 14.630 of this part are not 
permitted to receive fees. An agent or attorney who may also be an 
accredited representative of a recognized organization may not receive 
such fees unless he or she has been properly designated as an agent or 
attorney in accordance with Sec. 14.631 of this part in his or her 
individual capacity as an accredited agent or attorney.
    (c) Circumstances under which fees may be charged. Except as noted 
in paragraph (c)(2) and in paragraph (d) of this section, agents and 
attorneys may charge claimants or appellants for representation 
provided: after an agency of original jurisdiction has issued a decision 
on a claim or claims, including any claim to reopen under 38 CFR 3.156 
or for an increase in rate of a benefit; a Notice of Disagreement has 
been filed with respect to that decision on or after June 20, 2007; and 
the agent or attorney has complied with the power of attorney 
requirements in Sec. 14.631 and the fee agreement requirements in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (1) Agents and attorneys may charge fees for representation provided 
with respect to a request for revision of a

[[Page 590]]

decision of an agency of original jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 5109A or 
the Board of Veterans' Appeals under 38 U.S.C. 7111 based on clear and 
unmistakable error if a Notice of Disagreement was filed with respect to 
the challenged decision on or after June 20, 2007, and the agent or 
attorney has complied with the power of attorney requirements in Sec. 
14.631 and the fee agreement requirements in paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (2) In cases in which a Notice of Disagreement was filed on or 
before June 19, 2007, agents and attorneys may charge fees only for 
services provided after both of the following conditions have been met:
    (i) A final decision was promulgated by the Board with respect to 
the issue, or issues, involved in the appeal; and
    (ii) The agent or attorney was retained not later than 1 year 
following the date that the decision by the Board was promulgated. (This 
condition will be considered to have been met with respect to all 
successor agents or attorneys acting in the continuous prosecution of 
the same matter if a predecessor was retained within the required time 
period.)
    (3) Except as noted in paragraph (i) of this section and Sec. 
14.637(d), the agency of original jurisdiction that issued the decision 
identified in a Notice of Disagreement shall determine whether an agent 
or attorney is eligible for fees under this section. The agency of 
original jurisdiction's eligibility determination is a final 
adjudicative action and may be appealed to the Board.
    (d) Exceptions--(1) Chapter 37 loans. With respect to services of 
agents and attorneys provided after October 9, 1992, a reasonable fee 
may be charged or paid in connection with any proceeding in a case 
arising out of a loan made, guaranteed, or insured under chapter 37, 
United States Code, even though the conditions set forth in paragraph 
(c) of this section are not met.
    (2) Payment of fee by disinterested third party. (i) An agent or 
attorney may receive a fee or salary from an organization, governmental 
entity, or other disinterested third party for representation of a 
claimant or appellant even though the conditions set forth in paragraph 
(c) of this section have not been met. An organization, governmental 
entity, or other third party is considered disinterested only if the 
entity or individual does not stand to benefit financially from the 
successful outcome of the claim. In no such case may the attorney or 
agent charge a fee which is contingent, in whole or in part, on whether 
the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or 
appellant.
    (ii) For purposes of this part, a person shall be presumed not to be 
disinterested if that person is the spouse, child, or parent of the 
claimant or appellant, or if that person resides with the claimant or 
appellant. This presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing 
evidence that the person in question has no financial interest in the 
success of the claim.
    (iii) The provisions of paragraph (g) of this section (relating to 
fee agreements) shall apply to all payments or agreements to pay 
involving disinterested third parties. In addition, the agreement shall 
include or be accompanied by the following statement, signed by the 
attorney or agent: ``I certify that no agreement, oral or otherwise, 
exists under which the claimant or appellant will provide anything of 
value to the third-party payer in this case in return for payment of my 
fee or salary, including, but not limited to, reimbursement of any fees 
paid.''
    (e) Fees permitted. Fees permitted for services of an agent or 
attorney admitted to practice before VA must be reasonable. They may be 
based on a fixed fee, hourly rate, a percentage of benefits recovered, 
or a combination of such bases. Factors considered in determining 
whether fees are reasonable include:
    (1) The extent and type of services the representative performed;
    (2) The complexity of the case;
    (3) The level of skill and competence required of the representative 
in giving the services;
    (4) The amount of time the representative spent on the case;
    (5) The results the representative achieved, including the amount of 
any benefits recovered;

[[Page 591]]

    (6) The level of review to which the claim was taken and the level 
of the review at which the representative was retained;
    (7) Rates charged by other representatives for similar services; and
    (8) Whether, and to what extent, the payment of fees is contingent 
upon the results achieved.
    (f) Presumptions. Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-
due benefits awarded as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section 
shall be presumed to be reasonable. Fees which exceed 33\1/3\ percent of 
any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be unreasonable. 
These presumptions may be rebutted through an examination of the factors 
in paragraph (e) of this section establishing that there is clear and 
convincing evidence that a fee which does not exceed 20 percent of any 
past-due benefits awarded is not reasonable or that a fee which exceeds 
33\1/3\ percent is reasonable in a specific circumstance.
    (g) Fee agreements. All agreements for the payment of fees for 
services of agents and attorneys (including agreements involving fees or 
salary paid by an organization, governmental entity or other 
disinterested third party) must be in writing and signed by both the 
claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.
    (1) To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following:
    (i) The name of the veteran,
    (ii) The name of the claimant or appellant if other than the 
veteran,
    (iii) The name of any disinterested third-party payer (see paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section) and the relationship between the third-party 
payer and the veteran, claimant, or appellant,
    (iv) The applicable VA file number, and
    (v) The specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the 
services of the attorney or agent will be determined.
    (2) Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the 
agent or attorney directly out of past due benefits. A direct-pay fee 
agreement is a fee agreement between the claimant or appellant and an 
agent or attorney providing for payment of fees out of past-due benefits 
awarded directly to an agent or attorney. A fee agreement that does not 
clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent or attorney out of past-due 
benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due 
benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which 
the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for 
representation from the claimant without assistance from VA.
    (3) A copy of the agreement must be filed with the Office of the 
General Counsel within 30 days of its execution by mailing the copy to 
the following address: Office of the General Counsel (022D), 810 Vermont 
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420. Only fee agreements and documents 
related to review of fees under paragraph (i) of this section and 
expenses under Sec. 14.637 may be filed with the Office of the General 
Counsel. All documents relating the adjudication of a claim for VA 
benefits, including any correspondence, evidence, or argument, must be 
filed with the agency of original jurisdiction, Board of Veterans' 
Appeals, or other VA office as appropriate.
    (h) Payment of fees by Department of Veterans Affairs directly to an 
agent or attorney from past-due benefits. (1) Subject to the 
requirements of the other paragraphs of this section, including 
paragraphs (c) and (e), the claimant or appellant and an agent or 
attorney may enter into a fee agreement providing that payment for the 
services of the agent or attorney will be made directly to the agent or 
attorney by VA out of any past-due benefits awarded in any proceeding 
before VA or the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. VA 
will charge and collect an assessment out of the fees paid directly to 
agents or attorneys from past-due benefits awarded. The amount of such 
assessment shall be equal to five percent of the amount of the fee 
required to be paid to the agent or attorney, but in no event shall the 
assessment exceed $100. Such an agreement will be honored by VA only if 
the following conditions are met:
    (i) The total fee payable (excluding expenses) does not exceed 20 
percent of the total amount of the past-due benefits awarded,

[[Page 592]]

    (ii) The amount of the fee is contingent on whether or not the claim 
is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, and
    (iii) The award of past-due benefits results in a cash payment to a 
claimant or an appellant from which the fee may be deducted. (An award 
of past-due benefits will not always result in a cash payment to a 
claimant or an appellant. For example, no cash payment will be made to 
military retirees unless there is a corresponding waiver of retirement 
pay. (See 38 U.S.C. 5304(a) and 38 CFR 3.750)
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (h), a claim will be considered 
to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant 
if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph (h), ``past-due benefits'' means 
a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on 
appeal or awarded on the basis of a claim reopened after a denial by a 
VA agency of original jurisdiction or the Board of Veterans' Appeals or 
the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash 
payments that accrued between the effective date of the award, as 
determined by applicable laws and regulations, and the date of the grant 
of the benefit by the agency of original jurisdiction, the Board of 
Veterans' Appeals, or an appellate court.
    (i) When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the 
reopened claim, is service connection for a disability, the ``past-due 
benefits'' will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by 
the agency of original jurisdiction following the award of service 
connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective 
date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. 
If an increased evaluation is subsequently granted as the result of an 
appeal of the disability evaluation initially assigned by the agency of 
original jurisdiction, and if the agent or attorney represents the 
claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney 
will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on 
appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found 
to have existed between the initial effective date of the award 
following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating 
action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.
    (ii) Unless otherwise provided in the fee agreement between the 
claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney, the agent's or 
attorney's fees will be determined on the basis of the total amount of 
the past-due benefits even though a portion of those benefits may have 
been apportioned to the claimant's or appellant's dependents.
    (iii) If an award is made as the result of favorable action with 
respect to several issues, the past-due benefits will be calculated only 
on the basis of that portion of the award which results from action 
taken on issues concerning which the criteria in paragraph (c) of this 
section have been met.
    (4) In addition to filing a copy of the fee agreement with the 
Office of the General Counsel as required by paragraph (g) of this 
section, the agent or attorney must notify the agency of original 
jurisdiction within 30 days of the date of execution of the agreement of 
the existence of an agreement providing for the direct payment of fees 
out of any benefits subsequently determined to be past due and provide 
that agency with a copy of the fee agreement.
    (i) Motion for review of fee agreement. Before the expiration of 120 
days from the date of the final VA action, the Office of the General 
Counsel may review a fee agreement between a claimant or appellant and 
an agent or attorney upon its own motion or upon the motion of the 
claimant or appellant. The Office of the General Counsel may order a 
reduction in the fee called for in the agreement if it finds by a 
preponderance of the evidence, or by clear and convincing evidence in 
the case of a fee presumed reasonable under paragraph (f) of this 
section, that the fee is unreasonable. The Office of the General Counsel 
may approve a fee presumed unreasonable under paragraph (f) of this 
section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the fee is 
reasonable. The Office of the General Counsel's review of the agreement 
under this paragraph will address the issues

[[Page 593]]

of eligibility under paragraph (c) of this section and reasonableness 
under paragraph (e) of this section. The Office of the General Counsel 
will limit its review and decision under this paragraph to the issue of 
reasonableness if another agency of original jurisdiction has reviewed 
the agreement and made an eligibility determination under paragraph (c) 
of this section. Motions for review of fee agreements must be in writing 
and must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or 
appellant if other than the veteran, and the applicable VA file number. 
Such motions must set forth the reason, or reasons, why the fee called 
for in the agreement is unreasonable and must be accompanied by all 
evidence the moving party desires to submit.
    (1) A claimant's or appellant's motion for review of a fee agreement 
must be served on the agent or attorney and must be filed at the 
following address: Office of the General Counsel (022D), 810 Vermont 
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420. The agent or attorney may file a 
response to the motion, with any relevant evidence, with the Office of 
the General Counsel not later than 30 days from the date on which the 
claimant or appellant served the motion on the agent or attorney. Such 
responses must be served on the claimant or appellant. The claimant or 
appellant then has 15 days from the date on which the agent or attorney 
served a response to file a reply with the Office of the General 
Counsel. Such replies must be served on the agent or attorney.
    (2) The Assistant General Counsel shall initiate the Office of the 
General Counsel's review of a fee agreement on its own motion by serving 
the motion on the agent or attorney and the claimant or appellant. The 
agent or attorney may file a response to the motion, with any relevant 
evidence, with the Office of the General Counsel (022D), 810 Vermont 
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, not later than 30 days from the date 
on which the Office of the General Counsel served the motion on the 
agent or attorney. Such responses must be served on the claimant or 
appellant.
    (3) The Office of the General Counsel shall close the record in 
proceedings to review fee agreements 15 days after the date on which the 
agent or attorney served a response on the claimant or appellant, or 30 
days after the claimant, appellant, or the Office of the General Counsel 
served the motion on the agent or attorney if there is no response. The 
Assistant General Counsel may, for a reasonable period upon a showing of 
sufficient cause, extend the time for an agent or attorney to serve an 
answer or for a claimant or appellant to serve a reply. The Assistant 
General Counsel shall forward the record and a recommendation to the 
General Counsel for a final decision. Unless either party files a Notice 
of Disagreement with the Office of the General Counsel, the agent or 
attorney must refund any excess payment to the claimant or appellant not 
later than the expiration of the time within which the General Counsel's 
decision may be appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.
    (j) In addition to whatever other penalties may be prescribed by law 
or regulation, failure to comply with the requirements of this section 
may result in proceedings under Sec. 14.633 of this chapter to 
terminate the agent's or attorney's accreditation to practice before VA.
    (k) Notwithstanding provisions in this section for closing the 
record at the end of the 30-day period for serving a response or 15 days 
after the date on which the agent or attorney served a response, appeals 
shall be initiated and processed using the procedures in 38 CFR parts 19 
and 20. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Board's 
authority to remand a matter to the General Counsel under 38 CFR 19.9 
for any action that is essential for a proper appellate decision or the 
General Counsel's ability to issue a Supplemental Statement of the Case 
under 38 CFR 19.31.

<R05>
Sec. 14.637  Payment of the expenses of agents and attorneys in proceedings before Agencies of Original Jurisdiction and before the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

    (a) Applicability of rule. The provisions of this section apply to 
the services of accredited agents and attorneys with respect to benefits 
under laws administered by VA in all proceedings before the agency of 
original jurisdiction or before the Board of Veterans' Appeals 
regardless of whether an appeal has been initiated.
    (b) General. Any agent or attorney may be reimbursed for expenses 
incurred on behalf of a veteran or a veteran's dependents or survivors 
in the prosecution of a claim for benefits pending before VA. Whether 
such an agent or attorney will be reimbursed for expenses and the method 
of such reimbursement is a matter to be determined by the agent or 
attorney and the claimant or appellant in the fee agreement filed with 
the Office of the General Counsel under Sec. 14.636 of this part. 
Expenses are not payable directly to the agent or attorney by VA out of 
benefits determined to be due to a claimant or appellant.
    (c) Nature of expenses subject to reimbursement. ``Expenses'' 
include nonrecurring expenses incurred directly in the prosecution of a 
claim for benefits on behalf of a claimant or appellant. Examples of 
such expenses include expenses for travel specifically to attend a 
hearing with respect to a particular claim, the cost of copies of 
medical records or other documents obtained from an outside source, and 
the cost of obtaining the services of an expert witness or an expert 
opinion. ``Expenses'' do not include normal overhead costs of the agent 
or attorney such as office rent, utilities, the cost of obtaining or 
operating office equipment or a legal library, salaries of the 
representative and his or her support staff, and the cost of office 
supplies.
    (d) Expense charges permitted; motion for review of expenses. 
Reimbursement for the expenses of an agent or attorney may be obtained 
only if the expenses are reasonable. The Office of the General Counsel 
may review the expenses charged by an agent or attorney upon its own 
motion or the motion of the claimant or appellant and may order a 
reduction in the expenses charged if it finds that they are excessive or 
unreasonable. The Office of the General Counsel's review of expenses 
under this paragraph will address the issues of eligibility under Sec. 
14.636(c) and reasonableness. The Office of the General Counsel will 
limit its review and decision under this paragraph to the issue of 
reasonableness if another agency of original jurisdiction has reviewed 
the fee agreement between the claimant and the agent or attorney and 
determined that the agent or attorney is eligible for reimbursement of 
expenses. Motions for review of expenses must be in writing and must 
include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant 
if other than the veteran, and the applicable VA file number. Such 
motions must specifically identify which expenses charged are 
unreasonable; must set forth the reason, or reasons, why such expenses 
are excessive or unreasonable and must be accompanied by all evidence 
the claimant or appellant desires to submit. Factors considered in 
determining whether expenses are excessive or unreasonable include the 
complexity of the case, the potential extent of benefits recoverable, 
and whether travel expenses are in keeping with expenses normally 
incurred by other representatives.
    (1) A claimant's or appellant's motion for review of expenses must 
be served on the agent or attorney and must be filed at the following 
address: Office of the General Counsel (022D), 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., 
Washington, DC 20420. The agent or attorney may file a response to the 
motion, with any accompanying evidence, with the Office of the General 
Counsel not later than 30 days from the date on which the claimant or 
appellant served the motion on the agent or attorney. Such responses 
must be served on the claimant or appellant. The claimant or appellant 
then has 15 days from the date on which the agent or attorney served a 
response to file a reply with the Office of the General Counsel. Such 
replies must be served on the agent or attorney.
    (2) The Assistant General Counsel shall initiate the Office of the 
General Counsel's review of expenses on its own

[[Page 595]]

motion by serving the motion on the agent or attorney and the claimant 
or appellant. The agent or attorney may file a response to the motion, 
with any accompanying evidence, with the Office of the General Counsel 
(022D), 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, not later than 30 
days from the date on which the Office of the General Counsel served the 
motion on the agent or attorney. Such responses must be served on the 
claimant or appellant.
    (3) The Office of the General Counsel shall close the record in 
proceedings to review expenses 15 days after the date on which the agent 
or attorney served a response on the claimant or appellant, or 30 days 
after the claimant, appellant, or the Office of the General Counsel 
served the motion on the agent or attorney if there is no response. The 
Assistant General Counsel may, for a reasonable period upon a showing of 
sufficient cause, extend the time for an agent or attorney to serve an 
answer or for a claimant or appellant to serve a reply. Unless either 
party files a Notice of Disagreement with the General Counsel's 
decision, the attorney or agent must refund any excess payment to the 
claimant or appellant not later than the expiration of the time within 
which the General Counsel's decision may be appealed to the Board of 
Veterans' Appeals.
    (e) In addition to whatever other penalties may be prescribed by law 
or regulation, failure to comply with the requirements of this section 
may result in proceedings under Sec. 14.633 of this part to terminate 
the agent's or attorney's accreditation to practice before VA.
    (f) Notwithstanding provisions in this section for closing the 
record at the end of the 30-day period for serving a response or 15 days 
after the date on which the agent or attorney served a response, appeals 
shall be initiated and processed using the procedures in 38 CFR parts 19 
and 20. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Board's 
authority to remand a matter to the General Counsel under 38 CFR 19.9 
for any action that is essential for a proper appellate decision or the 
General Counsel's ability to issue a Supplemental Statement of the Case 
under 38 CFR 19.31.

<R05>
Sec. 14.665  Claims.

    (a) The claim must be presented in writing on VA Form 2-4760, 
Employee's Claim for Reimbursement for Personal Property Damaged or Lost 
Incident to Employment. It will be submitted to the personnel office 
where the claim originates within 2 years after it accrues except that 
if the claim accrues in time of war or in time of armed conflict in 
which any Armed Force of the United States is engaged or if such war or 
armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after it accrues, and if good 
cause is shown, the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after 
that cause ceases to exist. The claim must be executed and certified by 
the officer or the employee suffering the loss or damage, or in the 
event of his or her death, by the surviving spouse, children, father

[[Page 596]]

or mother or both, or brothers or sisters or both. Claims of survivors 
shall be settled and paid in the order named. All claims must contain 
the following:
    (1) The date, time, and place the loss or damage occurred and the 
circumstances surrounding such loss or damage, together with the 
supporting statements of any witnesses who can verify such facts.
    (2) In the event of damage, the date of acquisition, original cost, 
condition before damage, and at least two estimates of the cost of 
repair or replacement. In the event of loss, the date of acquisition, 
the original cost, the condition, and an estimate of the reasonable 
market value of the article or articles.
    (3) A statement as to any claims or potential claim he or she may 
have for indemnification of the loss or damage against other than the 
United States and whether he or she will assign such to the United 
States and cooperate in its prosecution. Where such claim or potential 
claim is against a carrier or insurer, evidence that a timely claim has 
been properly made. Where a recovery from the carrier or his or her 
insurer has been obtained or offered, such information shall be 
included.
    (4) In cases involving damage or destruction of personal property by 
patients or domiciliary members, a statement as to whether a claim was 
filed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 703(a)(5) and whether such claim has been 
finally denied.
    (b) The Personnel Officer receiving the claim will forward same to 
the person designated to investigate accidents at the station pursuant 
to Sec. 14.605 within 5 days after receipt.
    (c) The employee designated pursuant to Sec. 14.605 will ascertain 
if such claim is complete in all respects and conduct such investigation 
as is necessary to establish all facts required to properly evaluate the 
claim both as to merit and the reasonable amount payable for the loss or 
damage. Where it is indicated that the claimant may have a potential 
claim against other than the United States, the employee designated will 
secure a suitable assignment of all right and title to such claim, to 
the extent the United States makes reimbursement, and the agreement of 
the claimant to furnish such evidence as may be necessary to pursue such 
claim. If the potential claim is against a carrier or insurer, the 
employee designated will ascertain that the claimant has filed a timely 
proper claim and procure evidence thereof. The employee designated will 
also include information concerning any offer of settlement the carrier 
may have made. The completed investigation, original claim and 
supporting evidence will be forwarded to the appropriate Regional 
Counsel.

<R05>
Sec. 14.666  Regional Counsel responsibility.

    (a) The Regional Counsel having jurisdiction will conduct such 
additional investigation as is deemed necessary to establish all facts 
required. If the claimant has a potential claim for indemnification 
against other than the United States, the Regional Counsel will 
ascertain that a suitable assignment, legally enforceable, of all right 
and title to such claim, to the extent the United States makes 
reimbursement, and the agreement of the claimant to furnish such 
evidence as may be necessary to pursue such claim is of record. If such 
potential claim is against a carrier or insurer, the Regional Counsel 
will ascertain that claimant has filed a timely proper claim against the 
carrier or insurer and review same for legal sufficiency.
    (b) The Regional Counsel having jurisdiction over a claim will not 
authorize payment thereon unless the requirement of Sec. Sec. 14.664 
through 14.667 are met. In determining the equitable value of a claim, 
the depreciation schedule issued by the General Counsel will be used as 
a guide.

Sec. 14.667  Claims payable.

    (a) No claim shall be paid unless timely filed in proper form as 
provided in Sec. 14.665 and the preponderance of the evidence 
establishes that the loss or damage:
    (1) Actually occurred and the amount claimed is reasonable,

[[Page 597]]

    (2) Was incident to the employee's service and his or her possession 
of the property was reasonable, useful, or proper under the 
circumstances,
    (3) Did not occur at quarters occupied within the 50 States or the 
District of Columbia that were not assigned to the claimant or otherwise 
provided in kind by the United States.
    (4) Was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent act of 
claimant, the claimant's agent, or employee, and that the claimant has 
no right to indemnification for the loss or damage from other than the 
United States, except to the extent that the claimant assigns such right 
to the United States and agrees to furnish evidence required to enable 
the United States to enforce such right. In the event there is a right 
to recovery for the loss or damage from a carrier or insurer the 
claimant will be required to file a timely claim for such recovery 
before consideration of the claim against the United States.
    (b) No claim for the cost of repair or replacement of personal 
property of employees damaged or destroyed by patients or domiciliary 
members while such employees are engaged in the performance of official 
duties shall be entertained under Sec. Sec. 14.664 through 14.667, 
unless claim filed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 703(a)(5) (Sec. 17.78 of this 
chapter) has been finally denied for the reason that such claim did not 
meet the criteria established by that law.

Sec. 14.668  Disposition of claims.

    (a) Disallowed claims. Claimants will be promptly notified of the 
disallowance of a claim and the reasons therefor.
    (b) Allowed claims--(1) Reimbursement in kind. Where a claim is 
allowed and it is determined to be to the advantage of the Government, 
reimbursement will be made in kind. The official authorizing settlement 
will request the Director, Supply Service, Veterans Health Services and 
Research Administration, to procure the necessary article or articles 
and deliver same to the claimant.
    (2) Reimbursement by check. The official authorizing settlement will 
forward allowed claims, other than those requiring reimbursement in 
kind, to the Finance activity at the Department of Veterans Affairs 
installation where the claim arose. That activity will audit the claim, 
which if found proper for payment, will be scheduled on SF 1166, Voucher 
and Schedule of Payments, and forwarded to the appropriate Regional 
Disbursing Office for payment.

                        Commitments--Fiduciaries

    Source: 42 FR 41422, Aug. 17, 1977, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 14.700  Court cost and expenses; commitment, restoration, fiduciary appointments.

    It is the responsibility of the Regional Counsel to assure the 
protection of the veteran, his or her beneficiaries, and their estates 
in State court proceedings involving commitment and restoration, and the 
appointment of fiduciaries. To this end certain expenses such as court 
costs, publication fees, recording fees, transportation expenses and 
fees for medical testimony may be authorized by the Regional Counsel. 
Payment of these costs will be borne by the administration concerned. 
However, every effort will be made by the Regional Counsel to avoid 
having these costs imposed on the Department of Veterans Affairs. The 
travel and per

[[Page 598]]

diem cost of the Regional Counsel personnel will be borne by the 
Regional Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 14.701  Commitment and restoration proceedings.

    (a) State institutions. Regional Counsels are authorized to 
cooperate with State courts, including the production of required 
records in the commitment of veterans to State hospitals or in their 
restoration to full civil rights.
    (b) Department of Veterans Affairs institutions--(1) Assistance to 
courts in commitment proceedings. The Regional Counsel will render 
assistance to the courts in cases involving the commitment of mentally 
ill veterans to the Department of Veterans Affairs. To this end, the 
Regional Counsel may:
    (i) Produce Department of Veterans Affairs records.
    (ii) Appear in court and present material facts.
    (iii) When authorized to institute commitment proceedings under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, prepare and present all necessary 
legal papers, and arrange and authorize transportation costs of veterans 
and attendants at Department of Veterans Affairs expense (Sec. Sec. 
14.703 and 14.704).
    (2) Commitment proceedings. If a mentally ill veteran will accept 
hospitalization voluntarily, no action will be initiated by any 
Department of Veterans Affairs employee to commit such veteran. If the 
veteran will not accept hospitalization, or after being voluntarily 
hospitalized by the Department of Veterans Affairs demands his or her 
release, and hospitalization is necessary for the veteran's safety or 
the safety of others, the Regional Counsel (if a relative of the veteran 
or other interested person has not done so) may institute proceedings to 
commit the veteran to the Department of Veterans Affairs subject to the 
following conditions:
    (i) That the written consent of the veteran's nearest relative has 
been obtained. If the nearest relative cannot be readily contacted or 
refuses to consent, coupled with inability or refusal to offer adequate 
alternative care, the Regional Counsel may initiate the action if the 
petition is signed by another relative, a civil official or 
representative of a cooperating agency or other person authorized by 
State law.
    (ii) If timely action cannot be taken under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section, the Hospital or Clinic Director, or designee, may sign the 
petition if permissible under State law, and the Regional Counsel will 
then take any action necessary to bring the matter before the 
appropriate court.
    (3) Illegal commitment. When a hospitalized veteran, previously 
committed to the Department of Veterans Affairs, demands release and 
continued hospitalization is necessary for the veteran's safety or the 
safety of others, and the Regional Counsel determines the commitment to 
be illegal, immediate action will be taken to obtain a legal commitment.
    (4) Restoration proceedings. When a veteran has been a committed 
patient in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital and is subsequently 
rated competent by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Regional 
Counsel upon request, may institute proceedings necessary to restore the 
veteran to full civil rights.


<R05>
Sec. 14.702  Medical testimony in commitment or restoration proceedings.

    (a) Commitment. When permissable under State law, Department of 
Veterans Affairs physicans, upon request of the Regional Counsel, will 
sign interrogatories or certificates of mental illness or insanity and, 
unless unavailable, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, will 
testify in proceedings which the Regional Counsel is authorized to 
institute under Sec. 14.701 to commit eligible veterans to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (b) Restoration. (1) When permissible under State law, Department of 
Veterans Affairs physicans, upon the request of the Regional Counsel, 
will testify in proceedings brought for the purpose of restoring a 
committed veteran to full civil rights when the veteran is a committed 
patient in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital.
    (2) The Director of a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital or the 
Regional Counsel upon discharge of the veteran, may furnish a 
certificate of sanity or such similar certificate to the proper civil 
authorities.

[[Page 599]]

    (c) Employment of private physicians. When testimony of Department 
of Veterans Affairs physicians is prohibited or is unavailable because 
of a duty assignment, comparative expense or other valid reason, the 
Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, upon 
recommendation of the Regional Counsel, may employ any qualified 
physician for preliminary examination of the veteran and for testimony 
in any commitment or restoration proceeding which the Regional Counsel 
is authorized to institute under Sec. 14.701, and authorize the payment 
of a fee not to exceed the prescribed fee, or in the absence thereof, 
the customary fee charged for the service rendered.


<R05>
Sec. 14.703  Costs in commitment or restoration proceedings.

    (a) When authorized to institute a proceeding under Sec. 14.701, 
the Regional Counsel may authorize in advance or thereafter the payment 
or reimbursement of costs and other expenses for which the veteran is 
legally liable, including publication of notice necessary to accomplish 
the commitment.
    (b) The Regional Counsel also may authorize the payment of necessary 
costs and expenses for which the veteran is legally liable incident to 
his or her restoration to full civil rights in any case in which the 
Regional Counsel ia authorized to institute restoration proceedings 
under Sec. 14.701(b)(4).


<R05>
Sec. 14.704  Authorization of transportation necessary for commitment of a veteran beneficiary.

    When a mentally ill veteran who should be committed is hospitalized 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs and under the law of the State 
wherein the hospital is located, a commitment may not be had locally, 
the veteran may be returned temporarily to the jurisdiction of the 
appropriate court in order that the commitment can be accomplished. If 
the veteran is in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, the 
Hospital Director may authorize travel of the veteran and an attendant 
or attendants, if necessary, upon request of the Regional Counsel. If 
the veteran is being maintained in a non-Department of Veterans Affairs 
hospital, the Director of the facility authorizing and paying for the 
care may authorize such travel upon request of the Regional Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 14.705  Authority to file petitions for appointment of fiduciaries in State courts.

    (a) Adult beneficiary. The Regional Counsel is authorized to file or 
cause to be filed on behalf of a petitioner in a case coming within 
Sec. 14.706(a) a petition for the appointment of a fiduciary and all 
necessary legal papers for an adult beneficiary only if it has been 
determined that alternative methods of payment would not be to the best 
interests of the beneficiary and when the Regional Counsel has obtained 
the written consent of:
    (1) The beneficiary's spouse.
    (2) The beneficiary's adult child, parent, adult brother or sister 
if the beneficiary is unmarried, or consent of the spouse is immaterial 
because of estrangement or mental incapacity, or refusal to consent 
coupled with failure to offer adequate alternative means for providing 
for the beneficiary's needs.
    (3) A civil official or representative of a cooperating agency when 
none of the relative listed in paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section 
can be located after reasonable inquiry or those located are not 
mentally competent to consent or refuse without offering adequate 
alternative means for providing for the needs of the beneficiary.
    (b) Minor beneficiaries. The Regional Counsel is authorized to file 
or cause to be filed on behalf of a petitioner in a case coming within 
Sec. 14.706(a) a petition for the appointment of a fiduciary for a 
minor. If permissible under the law of the jurisdiction concerned and if 
it has been determined that protection of the minor's rights under laws 
administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs requires the 
appointment, provided: the written consent of the minor's natural or 
adoptive parent or parents or the person or persons occupying the 
relationship of ``in loco parentis'' as defined, by the law of the 
jurisdiction, in which they reside has been obtained. The Regional 
Counsel will not institute a court proceeding for the appointment of a 
fiduciary over the objections of such parent or parents if they are sui

[[Page 600]]

juris unless the parent or parents have abandoned the minor or have 
otherwise refused to meet their parental obligations toward the minor or 
they have previously been appointed or recognized as the minor's 
fiduciary and failed to properly execute the duties of their trust. If 
the minor has no parent or the parent or parents are not sui juris, the 
Regional Counsel may file the petition without the consent of any 
relative.
    (c) Court-appointed fiduciaries. In court-appointed fiduciary cases, 
the Regional Counsel may appear in the court of appointment or in any 
court having original, concurrent, or appellate jurisdiction, and make 
proper presentation relating to the foregoing matters. The Regional 
Counsel's authority includes by is not limited to:
    (1) Petitioning the court to cite a fiduciary to account;
    (2) Filing exceptions to accountings;
    (3) Requiring fiduciaries to file bonds or make any necessary 
adjustments;
    (4) Requiring investments;
    (5) Filing petitions to vacate or modify court orders;
    (6) Appearing or intervening in any State court as attorney for the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs in litigation instituted by the Secretary 
or otherwise affecting money paid to such fiduciary by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs;
    (7) Incurring necessary court costs and other expenses, including 
witness fees, appeal bonds, advertising in any newspaper or other 
publication, preparing briefs or transcripts, purchase of records of 
trial or other records;
    (8) Instituting any other action necessary to secure proper 
administration of the estate of a Department of Veterans Affairs 
beneficiary, such as filing petitions for the removal of a fiduciary and 
appointment of a successor;
    (9) Taking appropriate action to recover funds improperly disbursed.
    (d) Appeal. Unless a trial is de novo, no appeal shall be taken to 
an appellate court and no costs incurred in connection therewith without 
the prior approval of the General Counsel and the Under Secretary for 
Benefits or their designees.


<R05>
Sec. 14.706  Legal services in behalf of beneficiaries.

    (a) The Regional Counsel may furnish legal services in behalf of 
minor and incompetent beneficiaries of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs in fiduciary appointment and estate administration matters 
involving Department of Veterans Affairs benefits or property derived 
therefrom when the beneficiary's estate or income is not sufficient to 
justify the employment of an attorney.
    (b) The Regional Counsel may also furnish legal services in hardship 
situations when restoration from legal disability is a condition of 
precedent to direct payment of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits.
    (c) Where the fiduciary does not in due course institute the 
necessary action to terminate the trust relationship and the beneficiary 
requests representation by the Regional Counsel or in any such case 
where there is in question the proper administration of the estate, the 
Regional Counsel may file the necessary action and supply legal 
services. Costs, unless assessed against the fiduciary, should be 
charged to the estate of the beneficiary.


<R05>
Sec. 14.707  Authorization of transportation of a veteran beneficiary for appointment of a fiduciary.

    When the appointment of a fiduciary is required for an incompetent 
veteran hospitalized by the Department of Veterans Affairs and, under 
the law of the State wherein the hospital is located, the appointment 
cannot be had locally, the veteran may be returned temporarily to the 
jurisdiction of the appropriate court in order that the appointment can 
be accomplished. If the veteran is in a Department of Veterans Affairs 
hospital, the Hospital Director, upon request of the Regional Counsel, 
may authorize travel of the veteran and an attendant or attendants, if 
necessary. If the veteran is being maintained in a non-Department of 
Veterans Affairs hospital, the Director of the facility authorizing and 
paying for the care may authorize such travel upon request of the 
Regional Counsel.

[[Page 601]]


<R05>
Sec. 14.708  Costs and other expenses incident to appointment of fiduciary.

    (a) The Regional Counsel may authorize the payment of costs and 
other necessary expenses incident to the appointment of an initial or 
successor fiduciary for a Department of Veterans Affairs beneficiary 
when:
    (1) Authorized to render legal services under Sec. 14.706.
    (2) Appointment was caused by the Department of Veterans Affairs and 
it develops that no benefits are payable and there is no estate from 
which costs may be paid.
    (3) Costs must be advanced when there is no immediate estate from 
which same may be paid. These costs are to be recovered from benefits 
payable unless the case falls within paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Costs and necessary expenses include:
    (1) All those chargeable by statute or rule of court and certified 
by the clerk of court.
    (2) Certified copies of court records required by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs.
    (3) Fees for guardian ad litem when chargeable as court costs and 
required by State law.


<R05>
Sec. 14.709  Surety bonds; court-appointed fiduciary.

    (a) It is the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
require, where possible under State laws and rules of the court, 
corporate surety bonds in all court-appointed fiduciary cases where the 
fiduciary is an individual and the estate is sufficient to justify the 
expense of procuring a corporate surety bond. Corporate bonds may be 
required of corporate fiduciaries in accordance with State laws. In 
cases wherein fiduciaries neglect or refuse to furnish corporate bonds, 
as requested by the Regional Counsel, the Regional Counsel should take 
appropriate court action and notify the Veterans Service Center Manager.
    (b) When it is not practical or feasible to require a fiduciary to 
furnish a corporate surety bond, the Regional Counsel is authorized to 
accept bonds with such number of personal sureties as is permissible 
under State law, but in no event less than one. To be acceptable for 
Department of Veterans Affairs purposes, each personal surety must be 
worth at least the penal sum named in the bond over and above all debts, 
liabilities and exemptions and qualify in accordance with the 
requirements of State law. The Regional Counsel will request suitable 
evidence of financial responsibility whenever there is any question as 
to the ability of a personal surety to meet any probable liability. When 
suitable evidence is not furnished as requested, or financial 
responsibility is found to be insufficient to meet the penal sum of the 
bond, the Regional Counsel should take appropriate court action and 
notify the Veterans Service Center Manager.
    (c) It is the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
require surety bonds in an amount commensurate with value of the 
personal estate derived from Department of Veterans Affairs benefits 
plus the anticipated net income from Department of Veterans Affairs 
benefits received during the ensuing accounting period. In cases where 
the fiduciaries neglect or refuse to furnish surety bonds in the amount 
requested by the Regional Counsel, the Regional Counsel should take 
appropriate court action and notify the Veterans Service Center Manager. 
When permissible under State law, the Regional Counsel may accept, 
without objection, a lesser degree of protection approved by the court 
when it is determined that such action will adequately protect the 
beneficiary's estate.

<R05>
Sec. 14.803  Policy.

    (a) VA personnel may provide testimony or produce VA records in 
legal proceedings covered by Sec. Sec. 14.800 through 14.810 only as 
authorized in accordance with these regulations. In determining whether 
to authorize testimony or the production of records, the determining 
official will consider the effect in this case, as well as in future 
cases generally, based on the factors set forth in Sec. 14.804, which 
testifying or producing records not available for public disclosure will 
have on the ability of the agency or VA personnel to perform their

    (b) The Department of Veterans Affairs does not seek to deny its 
employees access to the courts as citizens, or in the employees' private 
capacities on off-duty time.
    (c) The Department of Veterans Affairs does not seek to deny the 
Nation's veterans access to the courts.

<R05>
Sec. 14.804  Factors to consider.

    In deciding whether to authorize the disclosure of VA records or 
information or the testimony of VA personnel, VA personnel responsible 
for making the decision should consider the following types of factors:
    (a) The need to avoid spending the time and money of the United 
States for private purposes and to conserve the time of VA personnel for 
conducting their official duties concerning

[[Page 604]]

servicing the Nation's veteran population;
    (b) How the testimony or production of records would assist VA in 
performing its statutory duties;
    (c) Whether the disclosure of the records or presentation of 
testimony is necessary to prevent the perpetration of fraud or other 
injustice in the matter in question;
    (d) Whether the demand or request is unduly burdensome or otherwise 
inappropriate under the applicable court or administrative rules;
    (e) Whether the testimony or production of records, including 
release in camera, is appropriate or necessary under the rules of 
procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand or request 
arose, or under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege;
    (f) Whether the testimony or production of records would violate a 
statute, executive order, regulation or directive. (Where the production 
of a record or testimony as to the content of a record or about 
information contained in a record would violate a confidentiality 
statute's prohibition against disclosure, disclosure will not be made. 
Examples of such statutes are the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 
sections 5701, 5705 and 7332 of title 38, United States Code.);
    (g) Whether the testimony or production of records, except when in 
camera and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, would reveal 
information properly classified pursuant to applicable statutes or 
Executive Orders;
    (h) Whether the testimony would interfere with ongoing law 
enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, compromise 
national security interests, hamper VA or private health care research 
activities, reveal sensitive patient or beneficiary information, 
interfere with patient care, disclose trade secrets or similarly 
confidential commercial or financial information or otherwise be 
inappropriate under the circumstances.
    (i) Whether such release or testimony reasonably could be expected 
to result in the appearance of VA or the Federal government favoring one 
litigant over another;
    (j) Whether such release or testimony reasonably could be expected 
to result in the appearance of VA or the Federal government endorsing or 
supporting a position advocated by a party to the proceeding;
    (k) The need to prevent the public's possible misconstruction of 
variances between personal opinions of VA personnel and VA or Federal 
policy.
    (l) The need to minimize VA's possible involvement in issues 
unrelated to its mission;
    (m) Whether the demand or request is within the authority of the 
party making it;
    (n) Whether the demand or request is sufficiently specific to be 
answered;
    (o) Other matters or concerns presented for consideration in making 
the decision.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501 (a) and (b); 5 U.S.C. 301)


<R05>
Sec. 14.805  Contents of a demand or request.

    The request or demand for testimony or production of documents shall 
set forth in, or be accompanied by, an affidavit, or if that is not 
feasible, in, or accompanied by, a written statement by the party 
seeking the testimony or records or by the party's attorney, a summary 
of the nature and relevance of the testimony or records sought in the 
legal proceedings containing sufficient information for the responsible 
VA official to determine whether VA personnel should be allowed to 
testify or records should be produced. Where the materials are 
considered insufficient to make the determination as described in Sec. 
14.807, the responsible VA official may ask the requester to provide 
additional information.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501 (a) and (b); 5 U.S.C. 301)


<R05>
Sec. 14.806  Scope of testimony or production.

    VA personnel shall not, in response to a request or demand for 
testimony or production of records in legal proceedings, comment or 
testify or produce records without the prior written approval of the 
responsible VA official designated in Sec. 14.807(b). VA personnel may 
only testify concerning or comment upon official VA information,

[[Page 605]]

subjects or activities, or produce records, that were specified in 
writing, submitted to and properly approved by the responsible VA 
official.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501 (a) and (b); 5 U.S.C. 301)


<R05>
Sec. 14.807  Procedure when demand or request is made.

    (a) VA personnel upon whom a demand or request for testimony or the 
production of records in connection with legal proceedings as defined in 
Sec. 14.802(d) is made shall notify the head of his or her field 
station, or if in Central Office, the head of the component for which he 
or she works. The field station or Central Office component shall notify 
the responsible VA official designated in Sec. 14.807(b).
    (b) In response to a demand or request for the production of records 
or the testimony of VA personnel, other than personnel in the Office of 
the Inspector General (OIG), as witnesses in legal proceedings covered 
by these regulations, the General Counsel, the Regional Counsel, an 
attorney in the Office of General Counsel designated by the General 
Counsel, or an attorney in the Regional Counsel office designated by the 
Regional Counsel is the responsible VA official authorized to determine 
whether VA personnel may be interviewed, contacted or used as witnesses, 
including used as expert witnesses, and whether VA records may be 
produced; and what, if any, conditions will be imposed upon such 
interview, contact, testimony or production of records. For personnel in 
the OIG, the Counselor to the Inspector General or an attorney 
designated by the Counselor to the Inspector General, is the responsible 
VA official authorized to make the determinations provided in Sec. 
14.807, and that official will keep the General Counsel informed of such 
determinations for purposes of litigation or claims of privilege.
    (c) In appropriate cases, the responsible VA official shall promptly 
notify the Department of Justice of the demand or request. After 
consultation and coordination with the Department of Justice, as 
required, and after any necessary consultation with the VA component 
which employs or employed the VA personnel whose testimony is sought or 
which is responsible for the maintenance of the records sought, the VA 
official shall determine in writing whether the individual is required 
to comply with the demand or request and shall notify the requester or 
the court or other authority of the determination reached where the 
determination is that VA will not comply fully with the request or 
demand. The responsible VA official shall give notice of the decision to 
other persons as circumstances may warrant. Oral approval may be 
granted, and a record of such approval made and retained in accordance 
with the procedures in Sec. 14.807(f) concerning oral requests or 
demands.
    (d) If, after VA personnel have received a request or demand in a 
legal proceeding and have notified the responsible VA official in 
accordance with this section, a response to the request or demand is 
required before instructions from the responsible official are received, 
the responsible official designated in paragraph (b) of this section 
shall furnish the requester or the court or other authority with a copy 
of Sec. Sec. 14.800 through 14.810 and any other relevant 
documentation, inform the requester or the court or other authority that 
the request or demand is being reviewed, and seek a stay of the request 
or demand pending a final determination by the VA official concerned.
    (e) If a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate 
authority declines to stay the effect of the demand or request in 
response to action taken pursuant to Sec. 14.807(d), or if such court 
or other authority orders that the demand or request be complied with 
notwithstanding the final decision of the appropriate VA official, the 
VA personnel upon whom the demand or request was made shall notify the 
responsible VA official of such ruling or order. If the responsible VA 
official determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the 
ruling or order will be sought, the affected VA personnel shall comply 
with the demand, order or request. If directed by the appropriate VA 
official after consultation with the appropriate United States 
Attorney's office, however, the affected VA personnel shall respectfully 
decline to comply with the demand, request or

[[Page 606]]

order. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).
    (f) Normally, written demands or requests allowing reasonable lead 
time for evaluation and processing are required. However, in emergency 
situations where response time is limited and a written demand or 
request is impractical, the following procedures should be followed:
    (1) The responsible VA official has the authority to waive the 
requirement of a written demand or request and may expedite a response 
in the event of an emergency under conditions which could not be 
anticipated in the course of proper planning or which demonstrate a good 
faith attempt to comply with these regulations. Determinations on oral 
demands or requests should be reserved for instances where insistence on 
compliance with the requirements of a proper written request would 
result in the effective denial of the request and cause an injustice in 
the outcome of the legal proceeding for which the testimony or records 
are sought. No requester has a right to make an oral demand or request 
and receive a determination, however. Whether to permit such an 
exceptional procedure is a decision within the sole discretion of the 
responsible VA official.
    (2) If the responsible VA official concludes that the demand or 
request, or any portion of it, should be granted (after considering the 
factors listed in Sec. 14.804), the responsible VA official will then 
orally advise the requester of the determination in accordance with the 
procedures provided in Sec. 14.807(c), including any limitations on 
such testimony or production of records, and seek a written confirmation 
of the oral demand or request. The responsible VA official will make a 
written record of the determination made concerning the oral demand or 
request, including the grant or denial, the circumstances requiring the 
procedure, and the conditions to which the requester agreed.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501 (a) and (b); 5 U.S.C. 301)


<R05>
Sec. 14.808  Expert or opinion testimony.

    (a) VA personnel shall not provide, with or without compensation, 
opinion or expert testimony in any legal proceedings concerning official 
VA information, subjects or activities, except on behalf of the United 
States or a party represented by the United States Department of 
Justice. Upon a showing by the requester or court or other appropriate 
authority that, in light of the factors listed in Sec. 14.804, there 
are exceptional circumstances and that the anticipated testimony will 
not be adverse to the interests of the Department of Veterans Affairs or 
to the United States, the responsible VA official designated in Sec. 
14.807(b) may, in writing, grant special authorization for VA personnel 
to appear and testify. If, despite the final determination of the 
responsible VA official, a court of competent jurisdiction or other 
appropriate authority, orders the expert or opinion testimony of VA 
personnel, the personnel shall notify the responsible VA official of 
such order. If the responsible VA official determines that no further 
legal review of or challenge to the order will be sought, the affected 
VA personnel shall comply with the order. If directed by the appropriate 
VA official after consultation with the appropriate United States 
Attorney's office, however, the affected VA personnel shall respectfully 
decline to comply with the demand, request or order. See United States 
ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).
    (b)(1) If, while testifying in any legal proceeding, VA personnel 
are asked for expert or opinion testimony concerning official VA 
information, subjects or activities, which testimony has not been 
approved in advance in accordance with these regulations, the witness 
shall:
    (i) Respectfully decline to answer on the grounds that such expert 
or opinion testimony is forbidden by these regulations;
    (ii) Request an opportunity to consult with the responsible VA 
official mentioned in Sec. 14.807(b) before giving such testimony;
    (iii) Explain that, upon such consultation, approval for such 
testimony may be provided; and

[[Page 607]]

    (iv) Explain that providing such testimony absent such approval may 
expose the individual to criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. 201-209 and 
to disciplinary or other adverse personnel action.
    (2) If the witness is then ordered by the body conducting the 
proceeding to provide expert or opinion testimony concerning official VA 
information, subjects or activities without the opportunity to consult 
with the appropriate VA official, the witness respectfully shall refuse 
to do so. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).
    (c) Upon notification by the witness of a request for opinion or 
expert testimony concerning official VA information, subjects or 
activities during Sec. 14.802(d) legal proceedings, the responsible VA 
official shall follow the procedures contained in this section to 
determine whether such testimony shall be approved.
    (d) If VA personnel who are unaware of these regulations provide 
expert or opinion testimony concerning official VA information, subjects 
or activities in any legal proceeding, including one mentioned in Sec. 
14.802(d) in which the United States is not already represented, without 
consulting with the responsible VA official, the witness, as soon after 
testifying as possible, shall inform the responsible VA official of the 
fact that such testimony was given and provide a summary of the expert 
or opinion testimony given.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501 (a) and (b); 5 U.S.C. 301)


<R05>
Sec. 14.809  Demands or requests in legal proceedings for records protected by confidentiality statutes.

    In addition to complying with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 14.800 
through 14.810, requests or demands in legal proceedings for the 
production of records, or for testimony of VA employees concerning 
information, protected by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, or other 
confidentiality statutes, such as 38 U.S.C. 5701, 5705 and 7332, must 
satisfy the requirements for disclosure imposed by those statutes, and 
implementing regulations, such as 38 CFR 1.511, before the records may 
be provided or testimony given. Accordingly, the responsible VA official 
may first determine whether there is legal authority to provide the 
testimony or records sought under applicable confidentiality statutes 
before applying Sec. Sec. 14.800 through 14.810. Where an applicable 
confidentiality statute mandates disclosure, Sec. Sec. 14.800 through 
14.810 will not apply.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501 (a) and (b); 5 U.S.C. 301)


<R05>
Sec. 14.810  Fees.

    (a) The testimony of VA personnel as witnesses, particularly as 
expert witnesses, and the production of VA records in legal proceedings 
subject to Sec. Sec. 14.800 through 14.810 are services which convey 
special benefits to the individuals or entities seeking such testimony 
or production of records above and beyond those accruing to the general 
public. These services are not regularly received by or available 
without charge to the public at large. Consequently, these are the sort 
of services for which the VA may establish a charge for providing under 
31 U.S.C. 9701. The responsible VA official will determine all fees 
associated with Sec. Sec. 14.800 through 14.810, and shall timely 
notify the requester of the fees, particularly those which are to be 
paid in advance.
    (b)(1) When a request is granted under Sec. 14.808 to permit VA 
personnel to testify in whole or in part as to expert, opinion or policy 
matters, the requester shall pay to the government a fee calculated to 
reimburse the cost of providing the witness. The fee shall include:
    (i) Costs of the time expended by VA personnel to process and 
respond to the demand or request;
    (ii) Costs of attorney time expended in reviewing the demand or 
request and any information located in connection with the demand or 
request;
    (iii) Expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search 
for, produce, and copy the responsive information;
    (iv) The cost of the time expended by the witness to prepare to 
testify; and
    (v) Costs of travel by the witness and attendance at trial.

[[Page 608]]

    (2) All costs for documents necessary for such expert testimony 
shall be calculated as provided in VA regulations implementing the fee 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
    (c) When an individual testifies in legal proceedings covered by 
these regulations in any capacity other than as an expert witness, the 
requester shall pay to the witness the fee and expenses prescribed for 
attendance by the applicable rule of court. If no such fee is 
prescribed, the applicable Federal rule, such as a local Federal 
district court rule, will apply. No additional fee will be prescribed 
for the time spent while testifying or in attendance to do so.
    (d) When a requester wishes to interview VA personnel as part of 
legal proceedings covered by these regulations, and such interview has 
been approved in accordance with these regulations, the requester shall 
pay a fee calculated upon the total hourly pay of the individual 
interviewed.
    (e) When VA produces records in legal proceedings pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 14.800 through 14.810, the fees to be charged and paid prior 
to production of the records shall be the fees charged by VA under its 
regulations implementing the fee provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
    (f) Fees shall be paid as follows:
    (1) Fees for copies of documents, blueprints, electronic tapes, or 
other VA records will be paid to the VA office or station providing the 
records, and covered to the General Fund of the Department of the 
Treasury.
    (2) Witness fees for testimony shall be paid to the witness, who 
shall endorse the check ``pay to the United States,'' and surrender it 
to his or her supervisor. It shall thereafter be deposited in the 
General Fund.
    (3) The private party requesting a VA witness shall forward in 
advance necessary round trip tickets and all requisite travel and per 
diem funds.
    (g) A waiver of any fees in connection with the testimony of an 
expert witness may be granted by the appropriate VA official at the 
official's discretion provided that the waiver is in the interest of the 
United States. Fee waivers shall not be routinely granted, nor shall 
they be granted under circumstances which might create the appearance 
that the VA or the United States favors one party or a position 
advocated by a party to the legal proceeding.

discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or 
activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are 
not, themselves, covered by this regulation.
    (c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a 
program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals 
with handicaps or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with 
handicaps from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order 
to a different class of individuals with handicaps is not prohibited by 
this regulation.
    (d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals 
with handicaps.

Sec. 15.140  Employment.

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 15.141-15.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 15.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 15.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from

[[Page 612]]

participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any 
program or activity conducted by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 15.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 15.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 15.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give 
priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with 
handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property 
is not required because of Sec. 15.150(a)(2) or (3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be

[[Page 613]]

undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, 
by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to 
complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to 
interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or 
organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in 
the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral 
and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for 
public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 15.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 15.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 15.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not

[[Page 614]]

result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless 
ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps 
receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

<R05>
Sec. 16.101  To what does this policy apply?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this policy 
applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported or 
otherwise subject to regulation by any federal department or agency 
which takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy 
applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by federal 
civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or 
agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be 
appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research 
conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the federal 
government outside the United States.
    (1) Research that is conducted or supported by a federal department 
or agency, whether or not it is regulated as defined in Sec. 16.102(e), 
must comply with all sections of this policy.
    (2) Research that is neither conducted nor supported by a federal 
department or agency but is subject to regulation as defined in Sec. 
16.102(e) must be reviewed and approved, in compliance with Sec. Sec. 
16.101, 16.102, and Sec. Sec. 16.107 through 16.117 of this policy, by 
an institutional review board (IRB) that operates in accordance with the 
pertinent requirements of this policy.
    (b) Unless otherwise required by department or agency heads, 
research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will 
be in one or more of the following categories are exempt from this 
policy:
    (1) Research conducted in established or commonly accepted 
educational settings, involving normal educational practices, such as 
(i) research on regular and special education instructional strategies, 
or (ii) research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among 
instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.
    (2) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, 
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview 
procedures or observation of public behavior, unless:
    (i) Information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human 
subjects can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to 
the subjects; and (ii) any disclosure of the human subjects' responses 
outside the research could reasonably place the subjects at risk of 
criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial 
standing, employability, or reputation.
    (3) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, 
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview 
procedures, or observation of public behavior that is not exempt under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if:
    (i) The human subjects are elected or appointed public officials or 
candidates for public office; or (ii) federal statute(s) require(s) 
without exception that the confidentiality of the personally 
identifiable information will be maintained throughout the research and 
thereafter.
    (4) Research, involving the collection or study of existing data, 
documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if 
these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded 
by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, 
directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects.

[[Page 616]]

    (5) Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or 
subject to the approval of department or agency heads, and which are 
designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine:
    (i) Public benefit or service programs; (ii) procedures for 
obtaining benefits or services under those programs; (iii) possible 
changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or (iv) 
possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or 
services under those programs.
    (6) Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance 
studies, (i) if wholesome foods without additives are consumed or (ii) 
if a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the 
level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or 
environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the 
Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental Protection 
Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture.
    (c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a 
particular activity is covered by this policy.
    (d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research 
activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or 
otherwise subject to regulation by the department or agency but not 
otherwise covered by this policy, comply with some or all of the 
requirements of this policy.
    (e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent 
federal laws or regulations which provide additional protections for 
human subjects.
    (f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or 
regulations which may otherwise be applicable and which provide 
additional protections for human subjects.
    (g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations 
which may otherwise be applicable and which provide additional 
protections to human subjects of research.
    (h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign 
countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to 
protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. 
[An example is a foreign institution which complies with guidelines 
consistent with the World Medical Assembly Declaration (Declaration of 
Helsinki amended 1989) issued either by sovereign states or by an 
organization whose function for the protection of human research 
subjects is internationally recognized.] In these circumstances, if a 
department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by 
the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those 
provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the 
substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural 
requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by 
statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of 
these actions as they occur will be published in the Federal Register or 
will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency 
procedures.
    (i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may 
waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy 
to specific research activities or classes of research activities 
otherwise covered by this policy. Except when otherwise required by 
statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward 
advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research 
Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any 
successor office, and shall also publish them in the Federal Register or 
in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Institutions with HHS-approved assurances on file will abide by 
provisions of title 45 CFR part 46 subparts A-D. Some of the other 
Departments and Agencies have incorporated all provisions of title 45 
CFR part 46 into their policies and procedures as well. However, the 
exemptions at 45 CFR 46.101(b) do not apply to research involving 
prisoners, subpart C. The exemption at 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2), for research 
involving survey or interview procedures or observation of public 
behavior, does not apply to research with children, subpart D, except 
for research involving observations of public behavior when the 
investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed.

Sec. 16.102  Definitions.

    (a) Department or agency head means the head of any federal 
department or agency and any other officer or employee of any department 
or agency to whom authority has been delegated.
    (b) Institution means any public or private entity or agency 
(including federal, state, and other agencies).
    (c) Legally authorized representative means an individual or 
judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on 
behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the 
procedure(s) involved in the research.
    (d) Research means a systematic investigation, including research 
development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute 
to generalizable knowledge. Activities which meet this definition 
constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are 
conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for 
other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may 
include research activities.
    (e) Research subject to regulation, and similar terms are intended 
to encompass those research activities for which a federal department or 
agency has specific responsibility for regulating as a research 
activity, (for example, Investigational New Drug requirements 
administered by the Food and Drug Administration). It does not include 
research activities which are incidentally regulated by a federal 
department or agency solely as part of the department's or agency's 
broader responsibility to regulate certain types of activities whether 
research or non-research in nature (for example, Wage and Hour 
requirements administered by the Department of Labor).
    (f) Human subject means a living individual about whom an 
investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research 
obtains
    (1) Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or
    (2) Identifiable private information.

Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are 
gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or 
the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes. 
Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between 
investigator and subject. ``Private information'' includes information 
about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can 
reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and 
information which has been provided for specific purposes by an 
individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be 
made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be 
individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or may 
readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the 
information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute 
research involving human subjects.
    (g) IRB means an institutional review board established in accord 
with and for the purposes expressed in this policy.
    (h) IRB approval means the determination of the IRB that the 
research has been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within 
the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and 
federal requirements.
    (i) Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or 
discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of 
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the 
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
    (j) Certification means the official notification by the institution 
to the supporting department or agency, in accordance with the 
requirements of this policy, that a research project or activity 
involving human subjects has been reviewed and approved by an IRB in 
accordance with an approved assurance.


<R05>
Sec. 16.103  Assuring compliance with this policy--research conducted or supported by any Federal Department or Agency.

    (a) Each institution engaged in research which is covered by this 
policy

[[Page 618]]

and which is conducted or supported by a federal department or agency 
shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency 
head that it will comply with the requirements set forth in this policy. 
In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department 
or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, 
appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for 
Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office for federalwide 
use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is 
accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports 
(except certification) required by this policy to be made to department 
and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research 
Protections, HHS, or any successor office.
    (b) Departments and agencies will conduct or support research 
covered by this policy only if the institution has an assurance approved 
as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified 
to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and 
approved by an IRB provided for in the assurance, and will be subject to 
continuing review by the IRB. Assurances applicable to federally 
supported or conducted research shall at a minimum include:
    (1) A statement of principles governing the institution in the 
discharge of its responsibilities for protecting the rights and welfare 
of human subjects of research conducted at or sponsored by the 
institution, regardless of whether the research is subject to federal 
regulation. This may include an appropriate existing code, declaration, 
or statement of ethical principles, or a statement formulated by the 
institution itself. This requirement does not preempt provisions of this 
policy applicable to department- or agency-supported or regulated 
research and need not be applicable to any research exempted or waived 
under Sec. 16.101 (b) or (i).
    (2) Designation of one or more IRBs established in accordance with 
the requirements of this policy, and for which provisions are made for 
meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and 
recordkeeping duties.
    (3) A list of IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; 
representative capacity; indications of experience such as board 
certifications, licenses, etc., sufficient to describe each member's 
chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment 
or other relationship between each member and the institution; for 
example: full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing 
panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant. Changes in IRB 
membership shall be reported to the department or agency head, unless in 
accord with Sec. 16.103(a) of this policy, the existence of an HHS-
approved assurance is accepted. In this case, change in IRB membership 
shall be reported to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or 
any successor office.
    (4) Written procedures which the IRB will follow (i) for conducting 
its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its 
findings and actions to the investigator and the institution; (ii) for 
determining which projects require review more often than annually and 
which projects need verification from sources other than the 
investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB 
review; and (iii) for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed 
changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that such changes in 
approved research, during the period for which IRB approval has already 
been given, may not be initiated without IRB review and approval except 
when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.
    (5) Written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB, 
appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head 
of (i) any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others 
or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this policy or the 
requirements or determinations of the IRB and (ii) any suspension or 
termination of IRB approval.
    (c) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to 
act for the institution and to assume on behalf

[[Page 619]]

of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be 
filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head 
prescribes.
    (d) The department or agency head will evaluate all assurances 
submitted in accordance with this policy through such officers and 
employees of the department or agency and such experts or consultants 
engaged for this purpose as the department or agency head determines to 
be appropriate. The department or agency head's evaluation will take 
into consideration the adequacy of the proposed IRB in light of the 
anticipated scope of the institution's research activities and the types 
of subject populations likely to be involved, the appropriateness of the 
proposed initial and continuing review procedures in light of the 
probable risks, and the size and complexity of the institution.
    (e) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head 
may approve or disapprove the assurance, or enter into negotiations to 
develop an approvable one. The department or agency head may limit the 
period during which any particular approved assurance or class of 
approved assurances shall remain effective or otherwise condition or 
restrict approval.
    (f) Certification is required when the research is supported by a 
federal department or agency and not otherwise exempted or waived under 
Sec. 16.101 (b) or (i). An institution with an approved assurance shall 
certify that each application or proposal for research covered by the 
assurance and by Sec. 16.103 of this Policy has been reviewed and 
approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted with the 
application or proposal or by such later date as may be prescribed by 
the department or agency to which the application or proposal is 
submitted. Under no condition shall research covered by Sec. 16.103 of 
the Policy be supported prior to receipt of the certification that the 
research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Institutions without 
an approved assurance covering the research shall certify within 30 days 
after receipt of a request for such a certification from the department 
or agency, that the application or proposal has been approved by the 
IRB. If the certification is not submitted within these time limits, the 
application or proposal may be returned to the institution.

Sec. 16.107  IRB membership.

    (a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying 
backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research 
activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be 
sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its 
members, and the diversity of the members, including consideration of 
race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as 
community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in 
safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. In addition to 
possessing the professional competence necessary to review specific 
research activities, the IRB shall be able to ascertain the 
acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments 
and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct 
and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in 
these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a 
vulnerable category of subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant 
women, or handicapped or mentally disabled persons, consideration shall 
be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are 
knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these subjects.
    (b) Every nondiscriminatory effort will be made to ensure that no 
IRB consists entirely of men or entirely of women, including the 
institution's consideration of qualified persons of both sexes, so long 
as no selection is made to the IRB on the basis of gender. No IRB may 
consist entirely of members of one profession.
    (c) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary 
concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary 
concerns are in nonscientific areas.

[[Page 620]]

    (d) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise 
affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate 
family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.
    (e) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or 
continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting 
interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.
    (f) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with 
competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues which 
require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. 
These individuals may not vote with the IRB.


<R05>
Sec. 16.108  IRB functions and operations.

    In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:
    (a) Follow written procedures in the same detail as described in 
Sec. 16.103(b)(4) and, to the extent required by, Sec. 16.103(b)(5).
    (b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (see Sec. 
16.110), review proposed research at convened meetings at which a 
majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one 
member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for 
the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority 
of those members present at the meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 16.109  IRB review of research.

    (a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require 
modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research 
activities covered by this policy.
    (b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects as part 
of informed consent is in accordance with Sec. 16.116. The IRB may 
require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in 
Sec. 16.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the 
information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and 
welfare of subjects.
    (c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may 
waive documentation in accordance with Sec. 16.117.
    (d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing 
of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, 
or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research 
activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall 
include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its 
decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person 
or in writing.
    (e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research covered by 
this policy at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less 
than once per year, and shall have authority to observe or have a third 
party observe the consent process and the research.

<R05>
Sec. 16.110  Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.

    (a) The Secretary, HHS, has established, and published as a Notice 
in the Federal Register, a list of categories of research that may be 
reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The list will 
be amended, as appropriate after consultation with other departments and 
agencies, through periodic republication by the Secretary, HHS, in the 
Federal Register. A copy of the list is available from the Office for 
Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.
    (b) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review either 
or both of the following:
    (1) Some or all of the research appearing on the list and found by 
the reviewer(s) to involve no more than minimal risk,
    (2) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period 
(of one year or less) for which approval is authorized.

Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by 
the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated 
by the chairperson from among members of

[[Page 621]]

the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of 
the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove 
the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review 
in accordance with the non-expedited procedure set forth in Sec. 
16.108(b).
    (c) Each IRB which uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a 
method for keeping all members advised of research proposals which have 
been approved under the procedure.
    (d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, 
or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the 
expedited review procedure.

<R05>
Sec. 16.111  Criteria for IRB approval of research.

    (a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB 
shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:
    (1) Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which 
are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily 
expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using 
procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or 
treatment purposes.
    (2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated 
benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that 
may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, 
the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result 
from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies 
subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The 
IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying 
knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of 
the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall 
within the purview of its responsibility.
    (3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment 
the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the 
setting in which the research will be conducted and should be 
particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving 
vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, 
mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally 
disadvantaged persons.
    (4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or 
the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and 
to the extent required by Sec. 16.116.
    (5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance 
with, and to the extent required by Sec. 16.117.
    (6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for 
monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.
    (7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the 
privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
    (b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to 
coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, pregnant 
women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally 
disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the 
study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.


<R05>
Sec. 16.112  Review by institution.

    Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may 
be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by 
officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve 
the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.


<R05>
Sec. 16.113  Suspension or termination of IRB approval of research.

    An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of 
research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's 
requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to 
subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a 
statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported 
promptly to the investigator,

[[Page 622]]

appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head.

<R05>
Sec. 16.114  Cooperative research.

    Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this 
policy which involve more than one institution. In the conduct of 
cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for 
safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying 
with this policy. With the approval of the department or agency head, an 
institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a 
joint review arrangement, rely upon the review of another qualified IRB, 
or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.


<R05>
Sec. 16.115  IRB records.

    (a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and 
maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the 
following:
    (1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific 
evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample 
consent documents, progress reports submitted by investigators, and 
reports of injuries to subjects.
    (2) Minutes of IRB meetings which shall be in sufficient detail to 
show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on 
these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and 
abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; 
and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their 
resolution.
    (3) Records of continuing review activities.
    (4) Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the 
investigators.
    (5) A list of IRB members in the same detail as described is Sec. 
16.103(b)(3).
    (6) Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described 
in Sec. Sec. 16.103(b)(4) and 16.103(b)(5).
    (7) Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as 
required by Sec. 16.116(b)(5).
    (b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at 
least 3 years, and records relating to research which is conducted shall 
be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. All 
records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized 
representatives of the department or agency at reasonable times and in a 
reasonable manner.

Sec. 16.116  General requirements for informed consent.

    Except as provided elsewhere in this policy, no investigator may 
involve a human being as a subject in research covered by this policy 
unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed 
consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized 
representative. An investigator shall seek such consent only under 
circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative 
sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and 
that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The 
information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be 
in language understandable to the subject or the representative. No 
informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory 
language through which the subject or the representative is made to 
waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases 
or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution or 
its agents from liability for negligence.
    (a) Basic elements of informed consent. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, in seeking informed consent the 
following information shall be provided to each subject:
    (1) A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of 
the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's 
participation, a description of the procedures to be followed, and 
identification of any procedures which are experimental;

[[Page 623]]

    (2) A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts 
to the subject;
    (3) A description of any benefits to the subject or to others which 
may reasonably be expected from the research;
    (4) A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of 
treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject;
    (5) A statement describing the extent, if any, to which 
confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained;
    (6) For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as 
to whether any compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical 
treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist 
of, or where further information may be obtained;
    (7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent 
questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to 
contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject; and
    (8) A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to 
participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue 
participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which 
the subject is otherwise entitled.
    (b) Additional elements of informed consent. When appropriate, one 
or more of the following elements of information shall also be provided 
to each subject:
    (1) A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may 
involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject 
is or may become pregnant) which are currently unforeseeable;
    (2) Anticipated circumstances under which the subject's 
participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to 
the subject's consent;
    (3) Any additional costs to the subject that may result from 
participation in the research;
    (4) The consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the 
research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the 
subject;
    (5) A statement that significant new findings developed during the 
course of the research which may relate to the subject's willingness to 
continue participation will be provided to the subject; and
    (6) The approximate number of subjects involved in the study.
    (c) An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, 
or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set 
forth above, or waive the requirement to obtain informed consent 
provided the IRB finds and documents that:
    (1) The research or demonstration project is to be conducted by or 
subject to the approval of state or local government officials and is 
designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine: (i) Public benefit of 
service programs; (ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or services 
under those programs; (iii) possible changes in or alternatives to those 
programs or procedures; or (iv) possible changes in methods or levels of 
payment for benefits or services under those programs; and
    (2) The research could not practicably be carried out without the 
waiver or alteration.
    (d) An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, 
or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set 
forth in this section, or waive the requirements to obtain informed 
consent provided the IRB finds and documents that:
    (1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;
    (2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights 
and welfare of the subjects;
    (3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the 
waiver or alteration; and
    (4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with 
additional pertinent information after participation.
    (e) The informed consent requirements in this policy are not 
intended to preempt any applicable federal, state, or local laws which 
require additional information to be disclosed in order for informed 
consent to be legally effective.
    (f) Nothing in this policy is intended to limit the authority of a 
physician to

[[Page 624]]

provide emergency medical care, to the extent the physician is permitted 
to do so under applicable federal, state, or local law.

Sec. 16.117  Documentation of informed consent.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed 
consent shall be documented by the use of a written consent form 
approved by the IRB and signed by the subject or the subject's legally 
authorized representative. A copy shall be given to the person signing 
the form.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the consent 
form may be either of the following:
    (1) A written consent document that embodies the elements of 
informed consent required by Sec. 16.116. This form may be read to the 
subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but in any 
event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the 
representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed; or
    (2) A short form written consent document stating that the elements 
of informed consent required by Sec. 16.116 have been presented orally 
to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When 
this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. 
Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to 
the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be 
signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall 
sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person 
actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of 
the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in 
addition to a copy of the short form.
    (c) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain 
a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either:
    (1) That the only record linking the subject and the research would 
be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm 
resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be asked 
whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the 
research, and the subject's wishes will govern; or
    (2) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context.
    In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB 
may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written 
statement regarding the research.

Sec. 16.118  Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvement of human subjects.

    Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or 
contracts are submitted to departments or agencies with the knowledge 
that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite 
plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. 
These include activities such as institutional type grants when 
selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; 
research training grants in which the activities involving subjects 
remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement 
will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or 
purification of compounds. These applications need not be reviewed by an 
IRB before an award may be made. However, except for research exempted 
or waived under Sec. 16.101 (b) or (i), no human subjects may be 
involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has 
been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and 
certification submitted, by the institution, to the department or 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 16.119  Research undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects.

    In the event research is undertaken without the intention of 
involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human 
subjects in the

research, the research shall first be reviewed and approved by an IRB, 
as provided in this policy, a certification submitted, by the 
institution, to the department or agency, and final approval given to 
the proposed change by the department or agency.


<R05>
Sec. 16.120  Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency.

    (a) The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and 
proposals involving human subjects submitted to the department or agency 
through such officers and employees of the department or agency and such 
experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to 
be appropriate. This evaluation will take into consideration the risks 
to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the 
potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the 
importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained.
    (b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head 
may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into 
negotiations to develop an approvable one.

Sec. 16.123  Early termination of research support: Evaluation of applications and proposals.

    (a) The department or agency head may require that department or 
agency support for any project be terminated or suspended in the manner 
prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the department or 
agency head finds an institution has materially failed to comply with 
the terms of this policy.
    (b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications 
or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may 
take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and 
program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject 
to a termination or suspension under paragarph (a) of this section and 
whether the applicant or the person or persons who would direct or has 
have directed the scientific and technical aspects of an activity has 
have, in the judgment of the department or agency head, materially 
failed to discharge responsibility for the protection of the rights and 
welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research was subject to 
federal regulation).

                      Protection of Patient Rights


<R05>
Sec. 17.32  Informed consent and advance care planning.

    (a) Definitions:
    Advance Directive. Specific written statements made by a patient who 
has decision-making capacity regarding future health care decisions in 
any of the following:
    (i) VA Living Will. A written statement made by a patient on an 
authorized VA form which sets forth the patient's wishes regarding the 
patient's health care treatment preferences including the withholding 
and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment.
    (ii) VA Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care. A written 
instruction on a VA form which designates the patient's choice of health 
care agent.
    (iii) State-Authorized Advance Directive. A non-VA living will, 
durable power of attorney for health care, or other advance health care 
planning document, the validity of which is determined pursuant to 
applicable State law. For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 
(h) of this section, ``applicable State law'' means the law of the State 
where the advance directive was signed, the State where the patient 
resided when the advance directive was signed, the State where the 
patient now resides, or the State where the patient is receiving 
treatment. VA will resolve any conflict between those State laws 
regarding the validity of the advance directive by following the law of 
the State that gives effect to the expressed wishes in the advance 
directive.
    Close friend. Any person eighteen years or older who has shown care 
and concern for the patient's welfare, who is familiar with the 
patient's activities, health, religious beliefs and values, and who has 
presented a signed written statement for the record that describes that 
person's relationship to and familiarity with the patient.
    Decision-making capacity. The ability to understand and appreciate 
the nature and consequences of health care treatment decisions.
    Health care agent. An individual named by the patient in a Durable 
Power of Attorney for Health Care.
    Legal guardian. A person appointed by a court of appropriate 
jurisdiction to make decisions for an individual who has been judicially 
determined to be incompetent.
    Practitioner. Any physician, dentist, or health care professional 
who has been granted specific clinical privileges to perform the 
treatment or procedure. For the purpose of obtaining informed consent 
for medical treatment, the term practitioner includes medical and dental 
residents and other appropriately trained health care professionals 
designated by VA regardless of

[[Page 631]]

whether they have been granted clinical privileges.
    Signature consent. The patient's or surrogate's signature on a VA-
authorized consent form.
    Special guardian. A person appointed by a court of appropriate 
jurisdiction for the specific purpose of making health care decisions.
    Surrogate. An individual, organization or other body authorized 
under this section to give informed consent on behalf of a patient who 
lacks decision-making capacity.
    (b) Policy. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all 
patient care furnished under title 38 U.S.C. shall be carried out only 
with the full and informed consent of the patient or, in appropriate 
cases, a representative thereof. In order to give informed consent, the 
patient must have decision-making capacity and be able to communicate 
decisions concerning health care. If the patient lacks decision-making 
capacity or has been declared incompetent, consent must be obtained from 
the patient's surrogate. Practitioners may provide necessary medical 
care in emergency situations without the patient's or surrogate's 
express consent when immediate medical care is necessary to preserve 
life or prevent serious impairment of the health of the patient or 
others and the patient is unable to consent and the practitioner 
determines that the patient has no surrogate or that waiting to obtain 
consent from the patient's surrogate would increase the hazard to the 
life or health of the patient or others. In such circumstances consent 
is implied.
    (c) General requirements for informed consent. Informed consent is 
the freely given consent that follows a careful explanation by the 
practitioner to the patient or the patient's surrogate of the proposed 
diagnostic or therapeutic procedure or course of treatment. The 
practitioner, who has primary responsibility for the patient or who will 
perform the particular procedure or provide the treatment, must explain 
in language understandable to the patient or surrogate the nature of a 
proposed procedure or treatment; the expected benefits; reasonably 
foreseeable associated risks, complications or side effects; reasonable 
and available alternatives; and anticipated results if nothing is done. 
The patient or surrogate must be given the opportunity to ask questions, 
to indicate comprehension of the information provided, and to grant 
permission freely without coercion. The practitioner must advise the 
patient or surrogate if the proposed treatment is novel or unorthodox. 
The patient or surrogate may withhold or revoke his or her consent at 
any time.
    (d) Documentation of informed consent. (1) The informed consent 
process must be appropriately documented in the health record. In 
addition, signature consent is required for all diagnostic and 
therapeutic treatments or procedures that:
    (i) Require the use of sedation;
    (ii) Require anesthesia or narcotic analgesia;
    (iii) Are considered to produce significant discomfort to the 
patient;
    (iv) Have a significant risk of complication or morbidity;
    (v) Require injections of any substance into a joint space or body 
cavity; or
    (vi) Involve testing for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
    (2) A patient or surrogate will sign with an ``X'' when the patient 
or surrogate has a debilitating illness or disability, i.e., significant 
physical impairment and/or difficulty in executing a signature due to an 
underlying health condition(s), or is unable to read and write. When the 
patient's or surrogate's signature is indicated by an ``X,'' two adults 
must witness the act of signing. By signing, the witnesses are attesting 
only to the fact that they saw the patient or surrogate and the 
practitioner sign the form. The signed form must be filed in the 
patient's health record. A properly executed VA-authorized consent form 
is valid for a period of 60 calendar days. If, however, the treatment 
plan involves multiple treatments or procedures, it will not be 
necessary to repeat the informed consent discussion and documentation so 
long as the course of treatment proceeds as planned, even if treatment 
extends beyond the 60-day period. If there is a change in the patient's 
condition that might alter the diagnostic or therapeutic decision, the 
consent is automatically rescinded.

[[Page 632]]

    (3) If it is impractical to consult with the surrogate in person, 
informed consent may be obtained by mail, facsimile, or telephone. A 
facsimile copy of a signed consent form is adequate to proceed with 
treatment. However, the surrogate must agree to submit a signed consent 
form to the practitioner. If consent is obtained by telephone, the 
conversation must be audiotaped or witnessed by a second VA employee. 
The name of the person giving consent and his or her authority to act as 
surrogate must be adequately identified for the record.
    (e) Surrogate consent. If the practitioner who has primary 
responsibility for the patient determines that the patient lacks 
decision-making capacity and is unlikely to regain it within a 
reasonable period of time, informed consent must be obtained from the 
patient's surrogate. Patients who are incapable of giving consent as a 
matter of law, i.e., persons judicially determined to be incompetent and 
minors not otherwise able to provide informed consent, will be deemed to 
lack decision-making capacity for the purposes of this section. If the 
patient is considered a minor in the state where the VA facility is 
located and cannot consent to medical treatment, consent must be 
obtained from the patient's parent or legal guardian. The surrogate 
generally assumes the same rights and responsibilities as the patient in 
the informed consent process. The surrogate's decision must be based on 
his or her knowledge of what the patient would have wanted, i.e., 
substituted judgment. If the patient's wishes are unknown, the decision 
must be based on the patient's best interest. The following persons are 
authorized to consent on behalf of patients who lack decision-making 
capacity in the following order of priority:
    (1) Health care agent;
    (2) Legal guardian or special guardian;
    (3) Next-of-kin: a close relative of the patient eighteen years of 
age or older, in the following priority: spouse, child, parent, sibling, 
grandparent, or grandchild; or
    (4) Close friend.
    (f) Consent for patients without surrogates. (1) If none of the 
surrogates listed in paragraph (e) of this section are available, the 
practitioner may request Regional Counsel assistance to obtain a special 
guardian for health care or follow the procedures outlined in this 
paragraph (f).
    (2) Facilities may use the following process to make treatment 
decisions for patients who lack decision-making capacity and have no 
surrogate. For treatments or procedures that involve minimal risk, the 
practitioner must verify that no authorized surrogate can be located. 
The practitioner must attempt to explain the nature and purpose of the 
proposed treatment to the patient and enter this information in the 
health record. For procedures that require signature consent, the 
practitioner must certify that the patient has no surrogate. The 
attending physician and the Chief of Service (or his or her designee) 
must indicate their approval of the treatment decision in writing. Any 
decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment for such 
patients must be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary committee appointed by 
the facility Director. The committee functions as the patient's advocate 
and may not include members of the treatment team. The committee must 
submit its findings and recommendations in a written report to the Chief 
of Staff who must note his or her approval of the report in writing. 
After reviewing the record, the facility Director may concur with the 
decision to withhold or withdraw life support or request further review 
by Regional Counsel.
    (g) Special consent situations. In addition to the other 
requirements of this section, additional protections are required in the 
following situations.
    (1) No patient will undergo any unusual or extremely hazardous 
treatment or procedure, e.g., that which might result in irreversible 
brain damage or sterilization, except as provided in this paragraph (g). 
Before treatment is initiated, the patient or surrogate must be given 
adequate opportunity to consult with independent specialists, legal 
counsel or other interested parties of his or her choosing. The 
patient's or surrogate's signature on a VA authorized consent form must 
be witnessed by someone who is not affiliated with the VA health care 
facility,

[[Page 633]]

e.g., spouse, legal guardian, or patient advocate. If a surrogate makes 
the treatment decision, a multi-disciplinary committee, appointed by the 
facility Director, must review that decision to ensure it is consistent 
with the patient's wishes or in his or her best interest. The committee 
functions as the patient's advocate and may not include members of the 
treatment team. The committee must submit its findings and 
recommendations in a written report to the facility Director. The 
Director may authorize treatment consistent with the surrogate's 
decision or request that a special guardian for health care be appointed 
to make the treatment decision.
    (2) Administration of psychotropic medication to an involuntarily 
committed patient against his or her will must meet the following 
requirements. The patient or surrogate must be allowed to consult with 
independent specialists, legal counsel or other interested parties 
concerning the treatment with psychotropic medication. Any 
recommendation to administer or continue medication against the 
patient's or surrogate's will must be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary 
committee appointed by the facility Director for this purpose. This 
committee must include a psychiatrist or a physician who has 
psychopharmacology privileges. The facility Director must concur with 
the committee's recommendation to administer psychotropic medications 
contrary to the patient's or surrogate's wishes. Continued therapy with 
psychotropic medication must be reviewed every 30 days. The patient (or 
a representative on the patient's behalf) may appeal the treatment 
decision to a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
    (3) If a proposed course of treatment or procedure involves approved 
medical research in whole or in part, the patient or representative 
shall be advised of this. Informed consent shall be obtained 
specifically for the administration or performance of that aspect of the 
treatment or procedure that involves research. Such consent shall be in 
addition to that obtained for the administration or performance of the 
nonresearch aspect of the treatment or procedure and must meet the 
requirements for informed consent set forth in 38 CFR Part 16, 
Protection of Human Subjects.
    (4) Testing for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) must be voluntary 
and must be conducted only with the prior informed and (written) 
signature consent of the patient or surrogate. Patients who consent to 
testing for HIV must sign VA form 10-012, ``Consent for HIV Antibody 
Testing.'' This form must be filed in the patient's health record. 
Testing must be accompanied by pre-test and post-test counseling.
    (h) Advance health care planning. Subject to the provisions of 
paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(4) of this section, VA will follow the 
wishes of a patient expressed in an Advance Directive when the attending 
physician determines and documents in the patient's health record that 
the patient lacks decision-making capacity and is not expected to regain 
it. An advance directive that is valid in one or more States under 
applicable State law, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, will 
be recognized throughout the VA health care system.
    (1) Witnesses. A VA Advance Directive: Living Will and Durable Power 
of Attorney for Health Care must be signed by the patient in the 
presence of two witnesses. Neither witness may to the witness' knowledge 
be named in the patient's will, appointed as health care agent in the 
advance directive, or financially responsible for the patient's care. VA 
employees of the Chaplain Service, Psychology Service, Social Work 
Service, or nonclinical employees (e.g., Medical Administration Service, 
Voluntary Service, or Environmental Management Service) may serve as 
witnesses. Other individuals employed by the VA facility in which the 
patient is being treated may not sign as witnesses to the advance 
directive. Witnesses are attesting only to the fact that they saw the 
patient sign the form.
    (2) Instructions in critical situations. VA will follow the 
unambiguous verbal or non-verbal instructions regarding future health 
care decisions of a patient who has decision-making capacity when the 
patient is admitted to

[[Page 634]]

care when critically ill and loss of capacity may be imminent and the 
patient is not physically able to sign an advance directive form, or the 
appropriate form is not readily available. The patient's instructions 
must have been expressed to at least two members of the health care 
team. The substance of the patient's instructions must be recorded in a 
progress note in the patient's health record and must be co-signed by at 
least two members of the health care team who were present and can 
attest to the wishes expressed by the patient. These instructions will 
be given effect only if the patient loses decision-making capacity 
during the presenting situation.
    (3) Revocation. A patient who has decision-making capacity may 
revoke an advance directive or instructions in a critical situation at 
any time by using any means expressing the intent to revoke.
    (4) VA policy and disputes. Neither the treatment team nor surrogate 
may override a patient's clear instructions in an Advance Directive or 
in instructions in critical situations, except that those portions of an 
Advance Directive or instructions given in a critical situation that are 
not consistent with VA policy will not be given effect.

Sec. 17.33  Patients' rights.

    (a) General. (1) Patients have a right to be treated with dignity in 
a humane environment that affords them both reasonable protection from 
harm and appropriate privacy with regard to their personal needs.
    (2) Patients have a right to receive, to the extent of eligibility 
therefor under the law, prompt and appropriate treatment for any 
physical or emotional disability.
    (3) Patients have the right to the least restrictive conditions 
necessary to achieve treatment purposes.
    (4) No patient in the Department of Veterans Affairs medical care 
system, except as otherwise provided by the applicable State law, shall 
be denied legal rights solely by virtue of being voluntarily admitted or 
involuntarily committed. Such legal rights include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
    (i) The right to hold and to dispose of property except as may be 
limited in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
    (ii) The right to execute legal instruments (e.g., will);
    (iii) The right to enter into contractual relationships;
    (iv) The right to register and vote;
    (v) The right to marry and to obtain a separation, divorce, or 
annulment;
    (vi) The right to hold a professional, occupational, or vehicle 
operator's license.
    (b) Residents and inpatients. Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section, patients admitted on a residential or inpatient care basis 
to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical care system have the 
following rights:
    (1) Visitations and communications. Each patient has the right to 
communicate freely and privately with persons outside the facility, 
including government officials, attorneys, and clergymen. To facilitate 
these communications each patient shall be provided the opportunity to 
meet with visitors during regularly scheduled visiting hours, convenient 
and reasonable access to public telephones for making and receiving 
phone calls, and the opportunity to send and receive unopened mail.
    (i) Communications with attorneys, law enforcement agencies, or 
government officials and representatives of recognized service 
organizations when the latter are acting as agents for the patient in a 
matter concerning Department of Veterans Affairs benfits, shall not be 
reviewed.
    (ii) A patient may refuse visitors.
    (iii) If a patient's right to receive unopened mail is restricted 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the patient shall be required 
to open the sealed mail while in the presence of an appropriate person 
for the sole purpose of ascertaining whether the mail contains 
contraband material, i.e., implements which pose significant risk of 
bodily harm to the patient or others or

[[Page 635]]

any drugs or medication. Any such material will be held for the patient 
or disposed of in accordance with instructions concerning patients' mail 
published by the Veterans Health Administration, Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and/or the local health care facility.
    (iv) Each patient shall be afforded the opportunity to purchase, at 
the patient's expense, letter writing material including stamps. In the 
event a patient needs assistance in purchasing writing material, or in 
writing, reading or sending mail, the medical facility will attempt, at 
the patient's request, to provide such assistance by means of 
volunteers, sufficient to mail at least one (1) letter each week.
    (v) All information gained by staff personnel of a medical facility 
during the course of assisting a patient in writing, reading, or sending 
mail is to be kept strictly confidential except for any disclosure 
required by law.
    (2) Clothing. Each patient has the right to wear his or her own 
clothing.
    (3) Personal Possessions. Each patient has the right to keep and use 
his or her own personal possessions consistent with available space, 
governing fire safety regulations, restrictions on noise, and 
restrictions on possession of contraband material, drugs and 
medications.
    (4) Money. Each patient has the right to keep and spend his or her 
own money and to have access to funds in his or her account in 
accordance with instructions concerning personal funds of patients 
published by the Veterans Health Administration.
    (5) Social Interaction. Each patient has the right to social 
interaction with others.
    (6) Exercise. Each patient has the right to regular physical 
exercise and to be outdoors at regular and frequent intervals. 
Facilities and equipment for such exercise shall be provided.
    (7) Worship. The opportunity for religious worship shall be made 
available to each patient who desires such opportunity. No patient will 
be coerced into engaging in any religious activities against his or her 
desires.
    (c) Restrictions. (1) A right set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section may be restricted within the patient's treatment plan by written 
order signed by the appropriate health care professional if--
    (i) It is determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
that a valid and sufficient reason exists for a restriction, and
    (ii) The order imposing the restriction and a progress note 
detailing the indications therefor are both entered into the patient's 
permanent medical record.
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (c) of this section, a valid and 
sufficient reason exists when, after consideration of pertinent facts, 
including the patient's history, current condition and prognosis, a 
health care professional reasonably believes that the full exercise of 
the specific right would--
    (i) Adversely affect the patient's physical or mental health,
    (ii) Under prevailing community standards, likely stigmatize the 
patient's reputation to a degree that would adversely affect the 
patient's return to independent living,
    (iii) Significantly infringe upon the rights of or jeopardize the 
health or safety of others, or
    (iv) Have a significant adverse impact on the operation of the 
medical facility, to such an extent that the patient's exercise of the 
specific right should be restricted. In determining whether a patient's 
specific right should be restricted, the health care professional 
concerned must determine that the likelihood and seriousness of the 
consequences that are expected to result from the full exercise of the 
right are so compelling as to warrant the restriction. The Chief of 
Service or Chief of Staff, as designated by local policy, should concur 
with the decision to impose such restriction. In this connection, it 
should be noted that there is no intention to imply that each of the 
reasons specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section 
are logically relevant to each of the rights set forth in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (3) If it has been determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
that a valid and sufficient reason exists for restricting any of the 
patient's rights set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the least 
restrictive method for protecting the interest or interests

[[Page 636]]

specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section that are 
involved shall be employed.
    (4) The patient must be promptly notified of any restriction imposed 
under paragraph (c) of this section and the reasons therefor.
    (5) All restricting orders under paragraph (c) of this section must 
be reviewed at least once every 30 days by the practitioner and must be 
concurred in by the Chief of Service or Chief of Staff.
    (d) Restraint and seclusion of patients. (1) Each patient has the 
right to be free from physical restraint or seclusion except in 
situations in which there is a substantial risk of imminent harm by the 
patient to himself, herself, or others and less restrictive means of 
preventing such harm have been determined to be inappropriate or 
insufficient. Patients will be physically restrained or placed in 
seclusion only on the written order of an appropriate licensed health 
care professional. The reason for any restraint order will be clearly 
documented in the progress notes of the patient's medical record. The 
written order may be entered on the basis of telephonic authority, but 
in such an event, an appropriate licensed health care professional must 
examine the patient and sign a written order within an appropriate 
timeframe that is in compliance with current community and/or 
accreditation standards. In emergency situations, where inability to 
contact an appropriate licensed health care professional prior to 
restraint is likely to result in immediate harm to the patient or 
others, the patient may be temporarily restrained by a member of the 
staff until appropriate authorization can be received from an 
appropriate licensed health care professional . Use of restraints or 
seclusion may continue for a period of time that does not exceed current 
community and/or accreditation standards, within which time an 
appropriate licensed health care professional shall again be consulted 
to determine if continuance of such restraint or seclusion is required. 
Restraint or seclusion may not be used as a punishment, for the 
convenience of staff, or as a substitute for treatment programs.
    (2) While in restraint or seclusion, the patient must be seen within 
appropriate timeframes in compliance with current community and/or 
accreditation standards:
    (i) By an appropriate health care professional who will monitor and 
chart the patient's physical and mental condition; and
    (ii) By other ward personnel as frequently as is reasonable under 
existing circumstances.
    (3) Each patient in restraint or seclusion shall have bathroom 
privileges according to his or her needs.
    (4) Each patient in restraint or seclusion shall have the 
opportunity to bathe at least every twenty-four (24) hours.
    (5) Each patient in restraint or seclusion shall be provided 
nutrition and fluid appropriately.
    (e) Medication. Patients have a right to be free from unnecessary or 
excessive medication. Except in an emergency, medication will be 
administered only on a written order of an appropriate health care 
professional in that patient's medical record. The written order may be 
entered on the basis of telephonic authority received from an 
appropriate health care professional, but in such event, the written 
order must be countersigned by an appropriate health care professional 
within 24 hours of the ordering of the medication. An appropriate health 
care professional will be responsible for all medication given or 
administered to a patient. A review by an appropriate health care 
professional of the drug regimen of each inpatient shall take place at 
least every thirty (30) days. It is recognized that administration of 
certain medications will be reviewed more frequently. Medication shall 
not be used as punishment, for the convenience of the staff, or in 
quantities which interfere with the patient's treatment program.
    (f) Confidentiality. Information gained by staff from the patient or 
the patient's medical record will be kept confidential and will not be 
disclosed except in accordance with applicable law.
    (g) Patient grievances. Each patient has the right to present 
grievances with respect to perceived infringement of the rights 
described in this section

[[Page 637]]

or concerning any other matter on behalf of himself, herself or others, 
to staff members at the facility in which the patient is receiving care, 
other Department of Veterans Affairs officials, government officials, 
members of Congress or any other person without fear or reprisal.
    (h) Notice of patient's rights. Upon the admission of any patient, 
the patient or his/her representative shall be informed of the rights 
described in this section, shall be given a copy of a statement of those 
rights and shall be informed of the fact that the statement of rights is 
posted at each nursing station. All staff members assigned to work with 
patients will be given a copy of the statement of rights and these 
rights will be discussed with them by their immediate supervisor.
    (i) Other rights. The rights described in this section are in 
addition to and not in derogation of any statutory, constitutional or 
other legal rights.

<R05>
Sec. 17.34  Tentative eligibility determinations.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 17.36 through 17.38, when an 
application for hospital care or other medical services, except 
outpatient dental care, has been filed which requires an adjudication as 
to service connection or a determination as to any other eligibility 
prerequisite which cannot immediately be established, the service 
(including transportation) may be authorized without further delay if it 
is determined that eligibility for care probably will be established. 
Tentative eligibility determinations under this section, however, will 
only be made if:
    (a) In emergencies. The applicant needs hospital care or other 
medical services in emergency circumstances, or
    (b) For persons recently discharged from service. The application 
was filed within 6 months after date of honorable discharge from a 
period of not less than 6 months of active duty.

    The Secretary may furnish hospital care and medical services to any 
veteran sojourning or residing outside the United States, without regard 
to the veteran's citizenship:
    (a) If necessary for treatment of a service-connected disability, or 
any disability associated with and held to be aggravating a service-
connected disability;
    (b) If the care is furnished to a veteran participating in a 
rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 who requires care for 
the reasons enumerated in 38 CFR 17.48(j)(2).

[55 FR 11370, Mar. 28, 1990. Redesignated at 61 FR 21965, May 13, 1996]

           Enrollment Provisions and Medical Benefits Package


<R05>
Sec. 17.36  Enrollment--provision of hospital and outpatient care to veterans.

    (a) Enrollment requirement for veterans. (1) Except as otherwise 
provided in Sec. 17.37, a veteran must be enrolled in the VA healthcare 
system as a condition for receiving the 'medical benefits package' set 
forth in Sec. 17.38.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1): A veteran may apply to be enrolled at any 
time. (See Sec. 17.36(d)(1).)

    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a 
veteran enrolled under this section and who, if required by law to do 
so, has agreed to make any applicable copayment is eligible for VA 
hospital and outpatient care as provided in the ``medical benefits 
package'' set forth in Sec. 17.38.

    Note to paragraph (a)(2): A veteran's enrollment status will be 
recognized throughout the United States.


[[Page 638]]


    (3) A veteran enrolled based on having a disorder associated with 
exposure to a toxic substance or radiation, for a disorder associated 
with service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf 
War, or any illness associated with service in combat in a war after the 
Gulf War or during a period of hostility after November 11, 1998, as 
provided in 38 U.S.C. 1710(e), is eligible for VA care provided in the 
``medical benefits package'' set forth in Sec. 17.38 for the disorder.
    (b) Categories of veterans eligible to be enrolled. The Secretary 
will determine which categories of veterans are eligible to be enrolled 
based on the following order of priority:
    (1) Veterans with a singular or combined rating of 50 percent or 
greater based on one or more service-connected disabilities or 
unemployability.
    (2) Veterans with a singular or combined rating of 30 percent or 40 
percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities.
    (3) Veterans who are former prisoners of war; veterans awarded the 
Purple Heart; veterans with a singular or combined rating of 10 percent 
or 20 percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities; 
veterans who were discharged or released from active military service 
for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; veterans 
who receive disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1151; veterans whose 
entitlement to disability compensation is suspended pursuant to 38 
U.S.C. 1151, but only to the extent that such veterans' continuing 
eligibility for that care is provided for in the judgment or settlement 
described in 38 U.S.C. 1151; veterans whose entitlement to disability 
compensation is suspended because of the receipt of military retired 
pay; and veterans receiving compensation at the 10 percent rating level 
based on multiple noncompensable service-connected disabilities that 
clearly interfere with normal employability.
    (4) Veterans who receive increased pension based on their need for 
regular aid and attendance or by reason of being permanently housebound 
and other veterans who are determined to be catastrophically disabled by 
the Chief of Staff (or equivalent clinical official) at the VA facility 
where they were examined.
    (5) Veterans not covered by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this 
section who are determined to be unable to defray the expenses of 
necessary care under 38 U.S.C. 1722(a).
    (6) Veterans of the Mexican border period or of World War I; 
veterans solely seeking care for a disorder associated with exposure to 
a toxic substance or radiation, for a disorder associated with service 
in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf War, or for 
any illness associated with service in combat in a war after the Gulf 
War or during a period of hostility after November 11, 1998, as provided 
and limited in 38 U.S.C. 1710(e); and veterans with 0 percent service-
connected disabilities who are nevertheless compensated, including 
veterans receiving compensation for inactive tuberculosis.
    (7) Veterans who agree to pay to the United States the applicable 
copayment determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 1710(g) if their income 
for the previous year constitutes ``low income'' under the geographical 
income limits established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development for the fiscal year that ended on September 30 of the 
previous calendar year. For purposes of this paragraph, VA will 
determine the income of veterans (to include the income of their spouses 
and dependents) using the rules in Sec. Sec. 3.271, 3.272, 3.273, and 
3.276. After determining the veterans' income and the number of persons 
in the veterans' family (including only the spouse and dependent 
children), VA will compare their income with the current applicable 
``low-income'' income limit for the public housing and section 8 
programs in their area that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development publishes pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2). If the 
veteran's income is below the applicable ``low-income'' income limits 
for the area in which the veteran resides, the veteran will be 
considered to have ``low income'' for purposes of this paragraph. To 
avoid a hardship to a veteran, VA may use the projected income for the 
current year of the veteran, spouse, and dependent children if the 
projected income is

[[Page 639]]

below the ``low income'' income limit referenced above. This category is 
further prioritized into the following subcategories:
    (i) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans who are 
in an enrolled status on a specified date announced in a Federal 
Register document promulgated under paragraph (c) of this section and 
who subsequently do not request disenrollment;
    (ii) Nonservice-connected veterans who are in an enrolled status on 
a specified date announced in a Federal Register document promulgated 
under paragraph (c) of this section and who subsequently do not request 
disenrollment;
    (iii) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not 
included in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section; and
    (iv) Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph 
(b)(7)(ii) of this section.
    (8) Veterans not included in priority category 4 or 7, who are 
eligible for care only if they agree to pay to the United States the 
applicable copayment determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 1710(g). 
This category is further prioritized into the following subcategories:
    (i) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans who are 
in an enrolled status on a specified date announced in a Federal 
Register document promulgated under paragraph (c) of this section and 
who subsequently do not request disenrollment;
    (ii) Nonservice-connected veterans who are in an enrolled status on 
a specified date announced in a Federal Register document promulgated 
under paragraph (c) of this section and who subsequently do not request 
disenrollment;
    (iii) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not 
included in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section; and
    (iv) Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph 
(b)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (c) Federal Register notification of eligible enrollees. (1) It is 
anticipated that on or before August 1 of each year the Secretary will 
announce in paragraph (c)(2) of this section which categories of 
veterans are eligible to be enrolled. As necessary, the Secretary at any 
time may revise this determination by further amending paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section. The preamble to a Federal Register document announcing 
which priority categories are eligible to be enrolled must specify the 
projected number of fiscal year applicants for enrollment in each 
priority category, projected healthcare utilization and expenditures for 
veterans in each priority category, appropriated funds and other revenue 
projected to be available for fiscal year enrollees, and results--
projected total expenditures for enrollees by priority category. The 
determination should include consideration of relevant internal and 
external factors, e.g., economic changes, changes in medical practices, 
and waiting times to obtain an appointment for care. Consistent with 
these criteria, the Secretary will determine which categories of 
veterans are eligible to be enrolled based on the order of priority 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Unless changed by a rulemaking document in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, VA will enroll all priority categories 
of veterans set forth in Sec. 17.36(b) beginning January 17, 2003 
except that those veterans in priority category 8 who were not in an 
enrolled status on January 17, 2003 or who requested disenrollment after 
that date, are not eligible to be enrolled.
    (d) Enrollment and disenrollment process--(1) Application for 
enrollment. A veteran may apply to be enrolled in the VA healthcare 
system at any time. A veteran who wishes to be enrolled must apply by 
submitting a VA Form 10-10EZ to a VA medical facility. Veterans applying 
based on inclusion in priority categories 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 do not need 
to complete section II, but must complete the rest of the form. Veterans 
applying based on inclusion in priority category 4 because of their need 
for regular aid and attendance or by being permanently housebound need 
not complete section II, but must complete the rest of the form. 
Veterans applying based on inclusion in priority category 4 because they 
are catastrophically disabled need not complete section II, but must 
complete the

[[Page 640]]

rest of the form, if: they agree to pay to the United States the 
applicable copayment determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 1710(g); 
they are a veteran of the Mexican border period or of World War I or a 
veteran with a 0 percent service-connected disability who is 
nevertheless compensated; their catastrophic disability is a disorder 
associated with exposure to a toxic substance or radiation, or with 
service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf War

U.S.C. 1710(e). All other veterans applying based on inclusion in 
priority category 4 because they are catastrophically disabled must 
complete the entire form. Veterans applying based on inclusion in 
priority category 5 must complete the entire form. Veterans applying 
based on inclusion in priority category 7 must complete the entire form 
except for section IIE. VA form 10-10EZ is set forth in paragraph (f) of 
this section and is available from VA medical facilities.
    (2) Action on application. Upon receipt of a completed VA Form 10-
10EZ, a VA network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary 
for Health for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration 
Service or equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, 
Health Eligibility Center, will accept a veteran as an enrollee upon 
determining that the veteran is in a priority category eligible to be 
enrolled as set forth in Sec. 17.36(c)(2). Upon determining that a 
veteran is not in a priority category eligible to be enrolled, the VA 
network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary for Health 
for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration Service or 
equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, Health 
Eligibility Center, will inform the applicant that the applicant is 
ineligible to be enrolled.
    (3) Placement in enrollment categories. (i) Veterans will be placed 
in priority categories whether or not veterans in that category are 
eligible to be enrolled.
    (ii) A veteran will be placed in the highest priority category or 
categories for which the veteran qualifies.
    (iii) A veteran may be placed in only one priority category, except 
that a veteran placed in priority category 6 based on a specified

to pay the applicable copayment, for all matters not covered by priority 
category 6.
    (iv) A veteran who had been enrolled based on inclusion in priority 
category 5 and became no longer eligible for inclusion in priority 
category 5 due to failure to submit to VA a current VA Form 10-10EZ will 
be changed automatically to enrollment based on inclusion in priority 
category 6 or 8 (or more than one of these categories if the previous 
principle applies), as applicable, and be considered continuously 
enrolled. To meet the criteria for priority category 5, a veteran must 
be eligible for priority category 5 based on the information submitted 
to VA in a current VA Form 10-10EZ. To be current, after VA has sent a 
form 10-10EZ to the veteran at the veteran's last known address, the 
veteran must return the completed form (including signature) to the 
address on the return envelope within 60 days from the date VA sent the

the priority categories listed with veterans in priority category 1 
being the last to be disenrolled and the first to be reenrolled. 
Similarly, within priority categories 7 and 8, veterans will be 
disenrolled, and reenrolled, in the order of the priority subcategories 
listed with veterans in subcategory (i) being the last to be disenrolled 
and first to be reenrolled.
    (4) Automatic enrollment. Notwithstanding other provisions of this

VA network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary for 
Health for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration 
Service or equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, 
Health Eligibility Center, that the veteran is in a priority category 
eligible to be enrolled as set forth in Sec. 17.36(c)(2). Upon 
determining that a veteran is not in a priority category eligible to be 
enrolled, the VA network or facility director, or the Deputy Under 
Secretary for Health for Operations and Management or Chief, Health 
Administration Service or equivalent official at a VA medical facility, 
or Director, Health Eligibility Center, will inform the veteran that the 
veteran is ineligible to be enrolled.
    (5) Disenrollment. A veteran enrolled in the VA health care system 
under paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(4) of this section will be disenrolled 
only if:
    (i) The veteran submits to a VA medical center or the VA Health 
Eligibility Center, 1644 Tullie Circle, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, a signed 
document stating that the veteran no longer wishes to be enrolled; or

been enrolled based on inclusion in priority category 5 or priority 
category 7; determines that the veteran was sent by mail a VA Form 10-
10EZ; and determines that the veteran failed to return the completed 
form to the address on the return envelope within 60 days from receipt 
of the form. VA Form 10-10EZ is set forth in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (6) Notification of enrollment status. Notice of a decision by a VA 
network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary for Health 
for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration Service or 
equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, Health 
Eligibility Center, regarding enrollment status will be provided to the 
affected veteran by letter and will contain the reasons for the 
decision. The letter will include an effective date for any changes and 
a statement regarding appeal rights. The decision will be based on all 
information available to the decisionmaker, including the information 
contained in VA Form 10-10EZ.

the activities of daily living to such a degree that the individual 
requires personal or mechanical assistance to leave home or bed or 
requires constant supervision to avoid physical harm to self or others.

Forces) and members of their families, when residing on reservations of 
field facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and when they 
cannot feasibly obtain emergency treatment from private facilities.
    (c) Hospital care when incidental to, and to the extent necessary 
for, the use of a specialized Department of Veterans Affairs medical 
resource pursuant to a sharing agreement entered into under Sec. 
17.210, may be authorized for any person designated by the other party 
to the agreement as a patient to be benefited under the agreement.
    (d) The authorization of services under any provision of this 
section, except services for eligible veterans, is subject to charges as 
required by Sec. 17.101.

hospitalization as Department of Veterans Affairs beneficiaries. Care 
under this section is subject to the following conditions:
    (a) Persons defined in this section who are members or former 
members of the active military, naval, or air service must agree to pay 
the subsistence rate set by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, except

Defense and Department of Health and Human Services. For the purpose of 
this section, blindness is defined as corrected visual acuity of 20/200 
or less in the better eye, or corrected central visual acuity of more 
than 20/200 if there is a field defect in which the peripheral field has 
contracted to such an extent that its widest diameter subtends the 
widest diameter of the field of the better eye at an angle no greater 
than 20[deg].
    (c) In the case of persons who are former members of the Coast and 
Geodetic Survey, care may be furnished under this section even though 
their retirement for disability was from the Environmental Science 
Services Administration or NOAA.

officials shall:
    (1) If the veteran is in immediate need of hospitalization, furnish 
care at VA facility where the veteran applies or, if that facility is 
incapable of furnishing care, arrange to admit the veteran to the 
nearest VA medical center, or Department of Defense hospital with which 
VA has a sharing agreement under 38 U.S.C. 8111, which is capable of 
providing the needed care, or if VA or DOD facilities are not available, 
arrange for care on a contract basis if authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1703 and 
38 CFR 17.52; or
    (2) If the veteran needs non-immediate hospitalization, schedule the 
veteran for admission at VA facility where the veteran applies, if the 
schedule permits, or refer the veteran for admission or scheduling for 
admission at the nearest VA medical center, or Department of Defense 
facility with which VA has a sharing agreement under 38 U.S.C. 8111.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1703, 1710; secs. 19011-19012, Pub. L. 99-272)

<R05>
Sec. 17.47  Considerations applicable in determining eligibility for hospital, nursing home or domiciliary care.

    (a)(1) For applicants discharged or released for disability incurred 
or aggravated in line of duty and who are not in receipt of compensation 
for service-connected or service-aggravated disability, the official 
records of the Armed Forces relative to findings of line of duty for its 
purposes will be accepted in determining eligibility for hospital care. 
Where the official records of the Armed Forces show a finding of 
disability not incurred or aggravated in line of duty and evidence is 
submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs which permits of a 
different finding, the decision of the Armed Forces will not be binding 
upon the Department of Veterans Affairs, which will be free to make its 
own determination of line of duty incurrence or aggravation upon 
evidence so submitted. It will be incumbent upon the applicant to 
present controverting evidence and, until such evidence is presented and 
a determination favorable to the applicant is made by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, the finding of the Armed Forces will control and 
hospital care will not be authorized. Such controverting evidence, when 
received from an applicant, will be referred to the adjudicating agency 
which would have jurisdiction if the applicant was filing claim for 
pension or disability compensation, and the determination of such agency 
as to line of duty, which is promptly to be communicated to the head of 
the field facility receiving the application for hospital care, will 
govern the facility Director's disapproval or approval of admission, 
other eligibility requirements having been met. Where the official 
records of the Armed Forces show that the disability for which a veteran 
was discharged or released from the Armed Forces under other than 
dishonorable conditions was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, 
such showing will be accepted for the purpose of determining his or her 
eligibility for hospitalization, notwithstanding the fact that the 
Department of Veterans Affairs has made a determination in connection 
with a claim for monetary benefits that the disability was incurred or 
aggravated not in line of duty.
    (2) In those exceptional cases where the official records of the 
Armed Forces show discharge or release under other than dishonorable 
conditions because of expiration of period of enlistment or any other 
reason except disability, but also show a disability incurred or 
aggravated in line of duty during the said enlistment; and the 
disability so recorded is considered in medical judgment to be or to 
have been of such character, duration, and degree as to have justified a 
discharge or release for disability had the period of enlistment not 
expired or other reason for discharge or release been given, the Under 
Secretary for Health, upon consideration of a clear, full statement of

[[Page 651]]

circumstances, is authorized to approve admission of the applicant for 
hospital care, provided other eligibility requirements are met. A 
typical case of this kind will be one where the applicant was under 
treatment for the said disability recorded during his or her service at 
the time discharge or release was given for the reason other than 
disability.
    (b)(1) Under 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(1), veterans who are receiving 
disability compensation awarded under Sec. 3.800 of this chapter, where 
a disease, injury or the aggravation of an existing disease or injury 
occurs as a result of VA examination, medical or surgical treatment, or 
of hospitalization in a VA health care facility or of participation in a 
rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. ch. 31, under any law 
administered by VA and not the result of his/her own willful misconduct. 
Treatment may be provided for the disability for which the compensation 
is being paid or for any other disability. Treatment under the authority 
of 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(1) may not be authorized during any period when 
disability compensation under Sec. 3.800 of this title is not being 
paid because of the provision of Sec. 3.800(a)(2), except to the extent 
continuing eligibility for such treatment is provided for in the 
judgment for settlement described in Sec. 3.800(a)(2) of this title.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1710(a); sec. 701, Pub. L. 98-160, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (2) For purposes of eligibility for domiciliary care, the phrase no 
adequate means of support refers to an applicant for domiciliary care 
whose annual income exceeds the annual rate of pension for a veteran in 
receipt of regular aid and attendance, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 1503, but 
who is able to demonstrate to competent VA medical authority, on the 
basis of objective evidence, that deficits in health and/or functional 
status render the applicant incapable of pursuing substantially gainful 
employment, as determined by the Chief of Staff, and who is otherwise 
without the means to provide adequately for self, or be provided for in 
the community.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1710(a); sec. 701, Pub. L. 98-160, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (c) A disability, disease, or defect will comprehend any acute, 
subacute, or chronic disease (or a general medical, tuberculous, or 
neuropsychiatric type) of any acute, subacute, or chronic surgical 
condition susceptible of cure or decided improvement by hospital care; 
or any condition which does not require hospital care for an acute or 
chronic condition but requires domiciliary care. Domiciliary care, as 
the term implies, is the provision of a home, with such ambulant medical 
care as is needed. To be provided with domiciliary care, the applicant 
must consistently have a disability, disease, or defect which is 
essentially chronic in type and is producing disablement of such degree 
and probable persistency as will incapacitate from earning a living for 
a prospective period.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1701, 1710)

    (d)(1) For purposes of determining eligibility for hospital or 
nursing home care under Sec. 17.47(a), a veteran will be determined 
unable to defray the expenses of necessary care if the veteran agrees to 
provide verifiable evidence, as determined by the Secretary, that:
    (i) The veteran is eligible to receive medical assistance under a 
State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act;


(Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.)

    (ii) The veteran is in receipt of pension under 38 U.S.C. 1521; or
    (iii) The veteran's attributable income does not exceed $15,000 if 
the veteran has no dependents, $18,000 if the veteran has one dependent, 
plus $1,000 for each additional dependent.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1722; sec. 19011, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (2) For purposes of determining eligibility for hospital or nursing 
home care under Sec. 17.47(c), a veteran will be determined eligible 
for necessary care if the veteran agrees to provide verifiable evidence, 
as determined by the Secretary, that: The veteran's attributable

[[Page 652]]

income does not exceed $20,000 if the veteran has no dependents, $25,000 
if the veteran has one dependent, plus $1,000 for each additional 
dependent.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1722; sec. 19011, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (3) Effective on January 1 of each year after calendar year 1986, 
the amounts set forth in paragraph (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall 
be increased by the percentage by which the maximum rates of pension 
were increased under 38 U.S.C. 1111(a), during the preceding year.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1722; sec. 19011, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (4) Determinations with respect to attributable income made under 
paragraph (d)(1) and (2) of this section, shall be made in the same 
manner, including the same sources of income and exclusions from income, 
as determinations with respect to income are made for determining 
eligibility for pension under Sec. Sec. 3.271 and 3.272 of this title. 
The term attributable income means income of a veteran for the calendar 
year preceding application for care, determined in the same manner as 
the manner in which a determination is made of the total amount of 
income by which the rate of pension for such veteran under 38 U.S.C. 
1521 would be reduced if such veteran were eligible for pension under 
that section.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1722; sec. 19011, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (5) Notwithstanding the attributable income of a veteran, VA may 
determine that such veteran is not eligible under paragraph (d)(1) and 
(2) of this section if the corpus of the estate of the veteran is such 
that under all the circumstances it is reasonable that some part of the 
corpus of the estate of the veteran be consumed for the veteran's 
maintenance. The corpus of the estate of a veteran shall be determined 
in the same manner as determinations are made with respect to the 
determinations of eligibility for pension under Sec. 3.275 of this 
chapter. The term corpus of the estate of the veteran includes the 
corpus of the estates of the veteran's spouse and dependent children, if 
any.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1722; sec. 19011, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (6) In order to avoid hardship VA may determine that a veteran is 
eligible for care notwithstanding that the veteran does not meet the 
income requirements established in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) or (d)(2) of 
this section, if projections of the veteran's income for the year 
following application for care are substantially below the income 
requirements established in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) or (d)(2) of this 
section.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1722; sec. 19011, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (e)(1) If VA determines that an individual was incorrectly charged a 
copayment, VA will refund the amount of any copayment actually paid by 
that individual.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501; sec. 19011, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (2) In the event a veteran provided inaccurate information on an 
application and is incorrectly deemed eligible for care under 38 U.S.C. 
1710(a)(1) or (a)(2) rather than 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(3), VA shall 
retroactively bill the veteran for the applicable copayment.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501 and 1710; sec. 19011, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (f) If a veteran who receives hospital or nursing home care under 38 
U.S.C. 1710(a)(2) or outpatient care under 38 U.S.C. 1712(a)(4) by 
virtue of the veteran's eligibility for hospital care under 38 U.S.C. 
1710(a), fails to pay to the United States the amounts agreed to under 
those sections shall be grounds for determining, in accordance with 
guidelines promulgated by the Under Secretary for Health, that the 
veteran is not eligible to receive further care under those sections 
until such amounts have been paid in full.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1710, 1721; sec. 19011, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (g)(1) Persons hospitalized who have no service-connected 
disabilities pursuant to Sec. 17.47, and/or persons receiving 
outpatient medical services pursuant

[[Page 653]]

to paragraphs (e), (f), (i), (j), and/or (k) of Sec. 17.60 who have no 
service-connected disabilities who it is believed may be eligible for 
hospital care and/or medical services, or reimbursement for the expenses 
of care or services for all or part of the cost thereof by reason of the 
following:
    (i) Membership in a union, fraternal or other organization, or
    (ii) Coverage under an insurance policy, or contract, medical, or 
hospital service agreement, membership, or subscription contract or 
similar arrangement under which health services for individuals are 
provided or the expenses of such services are paid, will not be 
furnished hospital care or medical services without charge therefore to 
the extent of the amount for which such parties referred to in 
paragraphs (g)(1)(i) or (g)(1)(ii) of this section, are, will become, or 
may be liable. Persons believed entitled to care under any of the plans 
discussed above will be required to provide such information as the 
Secretary may require. Provisions of this paragraph are effective April 
7, 1986, except in the case of a health care policy or contract that was 
entered into before that date, the effective date shall be the day after 
the plan was modified or renewed or on which there was any change in 
premium or coverage and will apply only to care and services provided by 
VA after the date the plan was modified, renewed, or on which there was 
any change in premium or coverage.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1729; sec. 19013, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (2) Persons hospitalized for the treatment of nonservice-connected 
disabilities pursuant to Sec. 17.47, or persons receiving outpatient 
medical services pursuant to paragraph (e), (f), (h), (i), (j), or (k) 
of Sec. 17.60, and who it is believed may be entitled to hospital care 
and/or medical services or to reimbursement for all or part of the cost 
thereof from any one or more of the following parties:
    (i) Workers' Compensation or employer's liability statutes, State or 
Federal;
    (ii) By reason of statutory or other relationships with third 
parties, including those liable for damages because of negligence or 
other legal wrong;
    (iii) By reason of a statute in a State, or political subdivision of 
a State;
    (A) Which requires automobile accident reparations or;
    (B) Which provides compensation or payment for medical care to 
victims suffering personal injuries as the result of a crime of personal 
violence;
    (iv) Right to maintenance and cure in admiralty;

will not be furnished hospital care or medical services without charge 
therefore to the extent of the amount for which such parties are, will 
become, or may be liable. Persons believed entitled to care under 
circumstances described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section will be 
required to complete such forms as the Secretary may require, such as a 
power of attorney and assignment. Notice of this assignment will be 
mailed promptly to the party or parties believed to be liable. When the 
amount of charges is ascertained, a bill therefore will be mailed to 
such party or parties. Persons believed entitled to care under 
circumstances described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) or (g)(2)(iii) of this 
section will be required to complete such forms as the Secretary may 
require.


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1729, sec. 19013, Pub. L. 99-272)

    (h) Within the limits of Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, 
any veteran who is receiving nursing home care in a hospital under the 
direct jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs, may be 
furnished medical services to correct or treat any nonservice-connected 
disability of such veteran, in addition to treatment incident to the 
disability for which the veteran is hospitalized, if the veteran is 
willing, and such services are reasonably necessary to protect the 
health of such veteran.

medical services (including dental) for any of the following reasons:
    (i) Make possible his or her entrance into a rehabilitation program;

    (j) Veterans eligible for treatment under chapter 17 of 38 U.S.C. 
who are alcohol or drug abusers or who are infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) shall not be discriminated against in 
admission or treatment by any Department of Veterans Affairs health care 
facility solely because of their alcohol or drug abuse or dependency or 
because of their viral infection. This does not preclude the rule of 
clinical judgment in determining appropriate treatment which takes into 
account the patient's immune status and/or the infectivity of the HIV or 
other pathogens (such as tuberculosis, cytemegalovirus, 
cryptosporidiosis, etc.). Hospital Directors are responsible for 
assuring that admission criteria of all programs in the medical center 
do not discriminate solely on the basis of alcohol, drug abuse or 
infection with human immunodeficiency virus. Quality Assurance Programs 
should include indicators and monitors for nondiscrimination.

Sec. 17.48  Compensated Work Therapy/Transitional Residences program.

    (a) This section sets forth requirements for persons residing in 
housing under the Compensated Work Therapy/Transitional Residences 
program.
    (b) House managers shall be responsible for coordinating and 
supervising the day-to-day operations of the facilities. The local VA 
program coordinator shall select each house manager and may give 
preference to an individual who is a current or past resident of the 
facility or the program. A house manager must have the following 
qualifications:
    (1) A stable, responsible and caring demeanor;
    (2) Leadership qualities including the ability to motivate;
    (3) Effective communication skills including the ability to 
interact;
    (4) A willingness to accept feedback;
    (5) A willingness to follow a chain of command.
    (c) Each resident admitted to the Transitional Residence, except for 
a house manager, must also be in the Compensated Work Therapy program.
    (d) Each resident, except for a house manager, must bi-weekly, in 
advance, pay a fee to VA for living in the housing. The local VA program 
coordinator will establish the fee for each resident in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

[[Page 655]]

    (1) The total amount of actual operating expenses of the residence 
(utilities, maintenance, furnishings, appliances, service equipment, all 
other operating costs) for the previous fiscal year plus 15 percent of 
that amount equals the total operating budget for the current fiscal 
year. The total operating budget is to be divided by the average number 
of beds occupied during the previous fiscal year and the resulting 
amount is the average yearly amount per bed. The bi-weekly fee shall 
equal 1/26th of the average yearly amount per bed, except that a 
resident shall not, on average, pay more than 30 percent of their gross 
CWT (Compensated Work Therapy) bi-weekly earnings. The VA program 
manager shall, bi-annually, conduct a review of the factors in this 
paragraph for determining resident payments. If he or she determines 
that the payments are too high or too low by more than 5 percent of the 
total operating budget, he or she shall recalculate resident payments 
under the criteria set forth in this paragraph, except that the 
calculations shall be based on the current fiscal year (actual amounts 
for the elapsed portion and projected amounts for the remainder).
    (2) If the revenues of a residence do not meet the expenses of the 
residence resulting in an inability to pay actual operating expenses, 
the medical center of jurisdiction shall provide the funds necessary to 
return the residence to fiscal solvency in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (e) The length of stay in housing under the Compensated Work

patients pursuant to agreements between the Department of Veterans 
Affairs and the department or agency operating the facility. When such

because a Department of Veterans Affairs or other Federal facility was 
not feasibly available, as defined in this section, the authorization 
will be continued after admission only for the period of time required 
to stabilize or improve the patient's condition to the extent that 
further care is no longer required to satisfy the purpose for which it

time of admission, an authorization may be deemed a prior authorization 
if an application, whether formal or informal, by telephone, telegraph 
or other communication, made by the veteran or by others in his or her 
behalf is dispatched to the Department of Veterans Affairs (1) for 
veterans in the 48 contiguous States and Puerto Rico, within 72 hours 
after the hour of admission, including in the computation of time 
Saturday, Sunday and holidays, or (2) for veterans in a noncontiguous 
State, territory or possession of the United States (not including 
Puerto Rico) if facilities for dispatch of application as described in 
this section are not available within the 72-hour period, provided the 
application was filed within 72 hours after facilities became available.
    (b) When an application for admission by a veteran in one of the 48 
contiguous States in the United States or in Puerto Rico has been made 
more than 72 hours after admission, or more than 72 hours after 
facilities are available in a noncontiguous State, territory of 
possession of the United States, authorization for continued care at 
Department of Veterans Affairs expense shall be effective as of the

Sec. 17.55  Payment for authorized public or private hospital care.

    Except as otherwise provided in this section, payment for public or 
private hospital care authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1703 and 38 CFR 17.52 
of this part or under 38 U.S.C. 1728 and 38 CFR 17.120 of this part 
shall be based on a prospective payment system similar to that used in 
the Medicare program for paying for similar inpatient hospital services 
in the community. Payment shall be made using the Health Care Financing 
Administration (HCFA) PRICER for each diagnosis-related group (DRG) 
applicable to the episode of care.
    (a) Payment shall be made of the full prospective payment amount per 
discharge, as determined according to the methodology in subparts D and 
G of 42 CFR part 412, as appropriate.
    (b)(1) In the case of a veteran who was transferred to another 
facility before completion of care, VA shall pay the transferring 
hospital an amount calculated by the HCFA PRICER for each patient day of 
care, not to exceed the full DRG rate as provided in paragraph (a) of 
this section. The hospital that ultimately discharges the patient will 
receive the full DRG payment.
    (2) In the case of a veteran who has transferred from a hospital 
and/or distinct part unit excluded by Medicare from the DRG-based 
prospective payment system or from a hospital that does not participate 
in Medicare, the transferring hospital will receive a payment for each 
patient day of care not to exceed the amount provided in paragraph (i) 
of this section.
    (c) VA shall pay the providing facility the full DRG-based rate or 
reasonable cost, without regard to any copayments or deductible required 
by any Federal law that is not applicable to VA.
    (d) If the cost or length of a veteran's care exceeds an applicable 
threshold amount, as determined by the HCFA

[[Page 659]]

PRICER program, VA shall pay, in addition to the amount payable under 
paragraph (a) of this section, an outlier payment calculated by the HCFA 
PRICER program, in accordance with subpart F of 42 CFR part 412.
    (e) In addition to the amount payable under paragraph (a) of this 
section, VA shall pay, for each discharge, an amount to cover the non-
Federal hospital's capital-related costs, kidney, heart and liver 
acquisition costs incurred by hospitals with approved transplantation 
centers, direct costs of medical education, and the costs of qualified 
nonphysician anesthetists in small rural hospitals. These amounts will 
be determined by the Under Secretary for Health on an annual basis and 
published in the ``Notices'' section of the Federal Register.
    (f) Payment shall be made only for those services authorized by VA.
    (g) Payments made in accordance with this section shall constitute 
payment in full and the provider or agent for the provider may not 
impose any additional charge on a veteran or his or her health care 
insurer for any inpatient services for which payment is made by the VA.
    (h) Hospitals of distinct part hospital units excluded from the 
prospective payment system by Medicare and hospitals that do not 
participate in Medicare will be paid at the national cost-to-charge 
ratio times the billed charges that are reasonable, usual, customary, 
and not in excess of rates or fees the hospital charges the general 
public for similar services in the community.
    (i) A hospital participating in an alternative payment system that 
has been granted a Federal waiver from the prospective payment system 
under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. section 1395f(b)(3) or 42 U.S.C. 
section 1395ww(c) for the purposes of Medicare payment shall not be 
subject to the payment methodology set forth in this section so long as 
such Federal waiver remains in effect.
    (j) Payments for episodes of hospital care furnished in Alaska that 
begin during the period starting on the effective date of this section 
through the 364th day thereafter will be in the amount determined by the 
HCFA PRICER plus 50 percent of the difference between the amount billed 
by the hospital and the amount determined by the PRICER. Claims for 
services provided during that period will be accepted for payment by VA 
under this paragraph (k) until December 31 of the year following the 
year in which this section became effective.
    (k) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, VA, for public 
or private hospital care covered by this section, will pay the lesser of 
the amount determined under paragraphs (a) through (j) of this section 
or the amount negotiated with the hospital or its agent.

Sec. 17.56  Payment for non-VA physician and other health care professional services.

    (a) Except for anesthesia services, and services provided in the 
State of Alaska under pargaraph (d) of this section, payment for non-VA 
health care professional services associated with outpatient and 
inpatient care provided at non-VA facilities authorized under Sec. 
17.52, or made under Sec. 17.120 of this part, shall be the lesser of 
the amount billed or the amount calculated using the formula developed 
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) participating 
physician fee schedule for the period in which the service is provided 
(see 42 CFR Parts 414 and 415). This payment methodology is set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section. If no amount has been calculated under 
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' participating physician fee 
schedule or if the services constitute anesthesia services, payment for 
such non-VA health care professional services associated with outpatient 
and inpatient care provided at non-VA facilities authorized under Sec. 
17.52, or made under Sec. 17.120 of this part, shall be the lesser of 
the actual amount billed or the amount calculated using the 75th 
percentile methodology set forth in paragraph (c) of

[[Page 660]]

this section; or the usual and customary rate if there are fewer than 8 
treatment occurrences for a procedure during the previous fiscal year.
    (b) The payment amount for each service paid under Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services' participating physician fee schedule is 
the product of three factors: a nationally uniform relative value for 
the service; a geographic adjustment factor for each physician fee 
schedule area; and a nationally uniform conversion factor for the 
service. The conversion factor converts the relative values into payment 
amounts. For each physician fee schedule service, there are three 
relative values: An RVU for physician work; an RVU for practice expense; 
and an RVU for malpractice expense. For each of these components of the 
fee schedule, there is a geographic practice cost index (GPCI) for each 
fee schedule area. The GPCIs reflect the relative costs of practice 
expenses, malpractice insurance, and physician work in an area compared 
to the national average. The GPCIs reflect the full variation from the 
national average in the costs of practice expenses and malpractice 
insurance, but only one-quarter of the difference in area costs for 
physician work. The general formula calculating the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services' fee schedule amount for a given service in a 
given fee schedule area can be expressed as: Payment = [(RVUwork x 
GPCIwork) + (RVUpractice expense x GPCIpractice expense) + 
(RVUmalpractice x GPCImalpractice)] x CF.
    (c) Payment under the 75th percentile methodology is determined for 
each VA medical facility by ranking all occurrences (with a minimum of 
eight) under the corresponding code during the previous fiscal year with 
charges ranked from the highest rate billed to the lowest rate billed 
and the charge falling at the 75th percentile as the maximum amount to 
be paid.
    (d) For services rendered in Alaska, VA will pay for services in 
accordance with a fee schedule that uses the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act mandated national standard coding 
sets. VA will pay a specific amount for each service for which there is 
a corresponding code. Under the VA Alaska Fee Schedule the amount paid 
in Alaska for each code will be 90 percent of the average amount VA 
actually paid in Alaska for the same services in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003. 
For services that VA provided less than eight times in Alaska in FY 
2003, for services represented by codes established after FY 2003, and 
for unit-based codes prior to FY 2004, VA will take the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services' rate for each code and multiply it times 
the average percentage paid by VA in Alaska for Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services-like codes. VA will increase the amounts on the VA 
Alaska Fee Schedule annually beginning in 2005 in accordance with the 
published national Medicare Economic Index (MEI). For those years where 
the annual average is a negative percentage, the fee schedule will 
remain the same as the previous year. Payment for non-VA health care 
professional services in Alaska shall be the lesser of the amount 
billed, or the amount calculated under this subpart.
    (e) Payments made in accordance with this section shall constitute 
payment in full. Accordingly, the provider or agent for the provider may 
not impose any additional charge for any services for which payment is 
made by VA.
    (f) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, VA, for 
physician services covered by this section, will pay the lesser of the 
amount determined under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section or 
the amount negotiated with the physician or the physician's agent.

disability, an extension of nursing care in a public or private nursing 
home care facility at VA expense beyond six months when the need for 
nursing home care continues to exist and
    (a) Arrangements for payment of such care through a public 
assistance program (such as Medicaid) for which the veteran has applied, 
have been delayed due to unforeseen eligibility problems which can 
reasonably be expected to be resolved within the extension period, or
    (b) The veteran has made specific arrangements for private payment 
for such care, and
    (1) Such arrangements cannot be effectuated as planned because of 
unforseen, unavoidable difficulties, such as a temporary obstacle to 
liquidation of property, and
    (2) Such difficulties can reasonably be expected to be resolved 
within the extension period; or
    (c) The veteran is terminally ill and life expectancy has been 
medically determined to be less than six months.

may furnish hospital care and medical services to individuals (including 
those who otherwise do not have VA eligibility for such care and 
services) responding to, involved in, or otherwise affected by that 
disaster or emergency.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a disaster or emergency means:
    (1) A major disaster or emergency declared by the President under 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 
U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) (Stafford Act); or

System established pursuant to section 2811(b) of the Public Health

    (d) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the terms

    (e) Unless the cost of care is charged at rates agreed upon in a 
sharing agreement as described in Sec. 17.102(e), the cost of hospital 
care and medical services provided under this section to an officer or 
employee of a department or agency of the United States (other than VA)

provisions of Sec. 17.102(h), without applying the exception provided 
in the first paragraph of Sec. 17.102.

    (2) The drugs and medicines are prescribed as specific therapy in 
the treatment of any of the veteran's illnesses or injuries.

Sec. 17.98  Mental health services.

    (a) Following the death of a veteran, bereavement counseling 
involving services defined in 38 U.S.C. 1701(6)(B), may be furnished to 
persons who were receiving mental health services in connection with 
treatment of the veteran under 38 U.S.C. 1710, 1712, 1712A, 1713, or 
1717, or 38 CFR 17.84 of this part, prior to the veteran's death, but 
may only be furnished in instances where the veteran's death had been 
unexpected or occurred while the veteran was participating in a VA 
hospice or similar program. Bereavement counseling may be provided only 
to assist individuals with the emotional and psychological stress 
accompanying the veteran's death, and only for a limited period of time, 
as determined by the Medical Center Director, but not to exceed 60 days. 
The Medical Center Director may approve a longer period of time when 
medically indicated.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an unexpected 
death is one which occurs when in the course of an illness the provider 
of care did not or could not have anticipated the timing of the death. 
Ordinarily, the provider of care can anticipate the patient's death and 
can inform the patient and family of the immediacy and certainty of 
death. If that has not taken place, a death can be described as 
unexpected.

<R05>
Sec. 17.100  Refusal of treatment by unnecessarily breaking appointments.

    A patient under medical treatment who breaks an appointment without 
a reasonable excuse will be informed that breaking an additional 
appointment will be deemed to be a refusal to accept VA treatment. If 
such a patient fails to keep a second appointment, without at least 24 
hours notice, such action will be deemed as a refusal to accept VA 
treatment. Thereafter, no further treatment will be furnished until the 
veteran has agreed to cooperate by keeping appointments. Treatment will 
not be discontinued until the treating physician has reviewed the 
treatment files, concurred in the action and signed a statement to this 
effect in the record. Consideration will be given to the veteran's 
ability to make a rational decision concerning the need for medical care 
and/or examination. The veteran will be advised of the final decision. 
Nothing in this section will be construed to prevent treatment for an 
emergent condition that may arise during or subsequent to this action. 
Where an appointment is broken without notice and satisfactory reasons 
are advanced for breaking the appointment and circumstances were such 
that notice could not be given, the patient will not be deemed to have 
refused treatment.

                    Charges, Waivers, and Collections


<R05>
Sec. 17.101  Collection or recovery by VA for medical care or services provided or furnished to a veteran for a nonservice-connected disability.

    (a)(1) General. This section covers collection or recovery by VA, 
under 38 U.S.C. 1729, for medical care or services provided or furnished 
to a veteran:
    (i) For a nonservice-connected disability for which the veteran is 
entitled to care (or the payment of expenses of care) under a health 
plan contract;
    (ii) For a nonservice-connected disability incurred incident to the 
veteran's employment and covered under a worker's compensation law or 
plan that provides reimbursement or indemnification for such care and 
services; or
    (iii) For a nonservice-connected disability incurred as a result of 
a motor vehicle accident in a State that requires automobile accident 
reparations insurance.
    (2) Methodologies. Based on the methodologies set forth in this 
section, the charges billed will include the following types of charges, 
as appropriate:

[[Page 677]]

Acute inpatient facility charges; skilled nursing facility/sub-acute 
inpatient facility charges; partial hospitalization facility charges; 
outpatient facility charges; physician and other professional charges, 
including professional charges for anesthesia services and dental 
services; pathology and laboratory charges; observation care facility 
charges; ambulance and other emergency transportation charges; and 
charges for durable medical equipment, drugs, injectables, and other 
medical services, items, and supplies identified by HCPCS Level II 
codes. In addition, the charges billed for prescription drugs not 
administered during treatment will be based on VA costs in accordance 
with the methodology set forth in Sec. 17.102. Data for calculating 
actual charge amounts based on the methodologies set forth in this 
section will either be published in a notice in the Federal Register or 
will be posted on the Internet site of the Veterans Health 
Administration Chief Business Office, currently at http://www.va.gov/
cbo, under ``Charge Data.'' For care for which VA has established a 
charge, VA will bill using its most recent published or posted charge. 
For care for which VA has not established a charge, VA will bill 
according to the methodology set forth in paragraph (a)(8) of this 
section.
    (3) Data sources. In this section, data sources are identified by 
name. The specific editions of these data sources used to calculate 
actual charge amounts, and information on where these data sources may 
be obtained, will be presented along with the data for calculating 
actual charge amounts, either in notices in the Federal Register or on 
the Internet site of the Veterans Health Administration Chief Business 
Office, currently at http://www.va.gov/cbo, under ``Charge Data.''
    (4) Amount of recovery or collection--third party liability. A 
third-party payer liable under a health plan contract has the option of 
paying either the billed charges described in this section or the amount 
the health plan demonstrates is the amount it would pay for care or 
services furnished by providers other than entities of the United States 
for the same care or services in the same geographic area. If the amount 
submitted by the health plan for payment is less than the amount billed, 
VA will accept the submission as payment, subject to verification at 
VA's discretion in accordance with this section. A VA employee having 
responsibility for collection of such charges may request that the third 
party health plan submit evidence or information to substantiate the 
appropriateness of the payment amount (e.g., health plan or insurance 
policies, provider agreements, medical evidence, proof of payment to 
other providers in the same geographic area for the same care and 
services VA provided).
    (5) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    APC means Medicare Ambulatory Payment Classification.
    CMS means the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
    CPI-U means Consumer Price Index--All Urban Consumers.
    CPT code and CPT procedure code mean Current Procedural Terminology 
code, a five-digit identifier defined by the American Medical 
Association for a specified physician service or procedure.
    DME means Durable Medical Equipment.
    DRG means Diagnosis Related Group.
    Geographic area means a three-digit ZIP Code area, where three-digit 
ZIP Codes are the first three digits of standard U.S. Postal Service ZIP 
Codes.
    HCPCS code means a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System Level 
II identifier, consisting of a letter followed by four digits, defined 
by CMS for a specified physician service, procedure, test, supply, or 
other medical service.
    ICU means Intensive Care Unit, including coronary care units.
    MDR means Medical Data Research, a medical charge database published 
by Ingenix, Inc.
    MedPAR means the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file.
    Non-provider-based means a VA health care entity (such as a small VA 
community-based outpatient clinic) that functions as the equivalent of a 
doctor's office or for other reasons does not meet CMS provider-based 
criteria,

[[Page 678]]

and, therefore, is not entitled to bill outpatient facility charges.
    Provider-based means the outpatient department of a VA hospital or 
any other VA health care entity that meets CMS provider-based criteria. 
Provider-based entities are entitled to bill outpatient facility 
charges.
    RBRVS means Resource-Based Relative Value Scale.
    RVU means Relative Value Unit.
    Unlisted procedures mean procedures, services, items, and supplies 
that have not been defined or specified by the American Medical 
Association or CMS, and the CPT and HCPCS codes used to report such 
procedures, services, items, and supplies.
    (6) Provider-based and non-provider-based entities and charges. Each 
VA health care entity (medical center, hospital, community-based 
outpatient clinic, independent outpatient clinic, etc.) is designated as 
either provider-based or non-provider-based. Provider-based entities are 
entitled to bill outpatient facility charges; non-provider-based 
entities are not. The charges for physician and other professional 
services provided at non-provider-based entities will be billed as 
professional charges only. Professional charges for both provider-based 
entities and non-provider-based entities are produced by the 
methodologies set forth in this section, with professional charges for 
provider-based entities based on facility practice expense RVUs, and 
professional charges for non-provider-based entities based on non-
facility practice expense RVUs.
    (7) Charges for medical care or services provided by non-VA 
providers at VA expense. When medical care or services are furnished at 
the expense of the VA by non-VA providers, the charges billed for such 
care or services will be the higher of the charges determined according 
to this section, or the amount VA paid to the non-VA provider.
    (8) Charges when a new DRG or CPT/HCPCS code identifier does not 
have an established charge. When VA does not have an established charge 
for a new DRG or CPT/HCPCS code to be used in determining a billing 
charge under the applicable methodology in this section, then VA will 
establish an interim billing charge or establish an interim charge to be 
used for determining a billing charge under the applicable methodology 
in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) through (a)(8)(viii) of this section.
    (i) If a new DRG or CPT/HCPCS code identifier replaces a DRG or CPT/
HCPCS code identifier, the most recently established charge for the 
identifier being replaced will continue to be used for determining a 
billing charge under paragraphs (b), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k), or 
(l) of this section until such time as VA establishes a charge for the 
new identifier.
    (ii) If medical care or service is provided or furnished at VA 
expense by a non-VA provider and a charge cannot be established under 
paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section, then VA's billing charge for such 
care or service will be the amount VA paid to the non-VA provider 
without additional calculations under this section.
    (iii) If a new CPT/HCPCS code has been established for a prosthetic 
device or durable medical equipment subject to paragraph (l) of this 
section and a charge cannot be established under paragraphs (a)(8)(i) or 
(ii) of this section, VA's billing charge for such prosthetic device or 
durable medical equipment will be 1 and \1/2\ times VA's average actual 
cost without additional calculations under this section.
    (iv) If a new medical identifier DRG code has been assigned to a 
particular type of medical care or service and a charge cannot be 
established under paragraphs (a)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section, 
then until such time as VA establishes a charge for the new medical 
identifier DRG code, the interim charge for use in paragraph (b) of this 
section will be the average charge of all medical DRG codes that are 
within plus or minus 10 of the numerical relative weight assigned to the 
new medical identifier DRG code.
    (v) If a new surgical identifier DRG code has been assigned to a 
particular type of medical care or service and a charge cannot be 
established under paragraphs (a)(8)(i) through (iv) of this section, 
then until such time as VA establishes a charge for the new surgical 
identifier DRG code, the interim charge for use in paragraph (b) of this 
section will be the average charge of all surgical DRG codes that are 
within

[[Page 679]]

plus or minus 10 of the numerical relative weight assigned to the new 
surgical identifier DRG code.
    (vi) If a new identifier CPT/HCPCS code is assigned to a particular 
type or item of medical care or service and a charge cannot be 
established under paragraphs (a)(8)(i) through (v) of this section, then 
until such time as VA establishes a charge for the new identifier for 
use in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k), or (l) of this section, 
VA's billing charge will be the Medicare allowable charge multiplied by 
1 and \1/2\, without additional calculations under this section.
    (vii) If a new identifier CPT/HCPCS code is assigned to a particular 
type or item of medical care or service and a charge cannot be 
established under paragraphs (a)(8)(i) through (vi) of this section, 
then until such time as VA establishes a charge for the new identifier, 
the interim charge for use in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k), 
or (l) of this section will be the charge for the CPT/HCPCS code that is 
closest in characteristics to the new CPT/HCPCS code.
    (viii) If a charge cannot be established under paragraphs (a)(8)(i) 
through (a)(8)(vii) of this section, then VA will not charge under this 
section for the care or service.
    (b) Acute inpatient facility charges. When VA provides or furnishes 
acute inpatient services within the scope of care referred to in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, acute inpatient facility charges 
billed for such services will be determined in accordance with the 
provisions of this paragraph. Acute inpatient facility charges consist 
of per diem charges for room and board and for ancillary services that 
vary by geographic area and by DRG. These charges are calculated as 
follows:
    (1) Formula. For each acute inpatient stay, or portion thereof, for 
which a particular DRG assignment applies, the total acute inpatient 
facility charge is the sum of the applicable charges determined pursuant 
to paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section. For purposes 
of this section, standard room and board days and ICU room and board 
days are mutually exclusive: VA will bill either a standard room and 
board per diem charge or an ICU room and board per diem charge, as 
applicable, for each day of a given acute inpatient stay.
    (i) Standard room and board charges. Multiply the nationwide 
standard room and board per diem charge determined pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section by the appropriate geographic area adjustment 
factor determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The 
result constitutes the area-specific standard room and board per diem 
charge. Multiply this amount by the number of days for which standard 
room and board charges apply to obtain the total acute inpatient 
facility standard room and board charge.
    (ii) ICU room and board charges. Multiply the nationwide ICU room 
and board per diem charge determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section by the appropriate geographic area adjustment factor 
determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The result 
constitutes the area-specific ICU room and board per diem charge. 
Multiply this amount by the number of days for which ICU room and board 
per diem charges apply to obtain the total acute inpatient facility ICU 
room and board charge.
    (iii) Ancillary charges. Multiply the nationwide ancillary per diem 
charge determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the 
appropriate geographic area adjustment factor determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The result constitutes the area-
specific ancillary per diem charge. Multiply this amount by the number 
of days of acute inpatient care to obtain the total acute inpatient 
facility ancillary charge.
    Note to paragraph (b)(1): If there is a change in a patient's 
condition and/or treatment during a single acute inpatient stay such 
that the DRG assignment changes (for example, a psychiatric patient who 
develops a medical or surgical problem), then calculations of acute 
inpatient facility charges will be made separately for each DRG, 
according to the number of days of care applicable for each DRG, and the 
total acute inpatient facility charge will be the sum of the total acute 
inpatient facility charges for the different DRGs.

[[Page 680]]

    (2) Per diem charges. To establish a baseline, two nationwide 
average per diem amounts for each DRG are calculated, one from the 
MedPAR file and one from the MedStat claims database, a database of 
nationwide commercial insurance claims. Average per diem charges are 
calculated based on all available charges, except for care reported for 
emergency room, ambulance, professional, and observation care. These two 
data sources may report charges for two differing periods of time; when 
this occurs, the data source charges with the earlier center date are 
trended forward to the center date of the other data source, based on 
changes to the inpatient hospital services component of the CPI-U. 
Results obtained from these two data sources are then combined into a 
single weighted average per diem charge for each DRG. The resulting 
charge for each DRG is then separated into its two components, a room 
and board component and an ancillary component, with the per diem charge 
for each component calculated by multiplying the weighted average per 
diem charge by the corresponding percentage determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. The room and board per diem charge 
is further differentiated into a standard room and board per diem charge 
and an ICU room and board per diem charge by multiplying the average 
room and board charge by the corresponding DRG-specific ratios 
determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The 
resulting per diem charges for standard room and board, ICU room and 
board, and ancillary services for each DRG are then each multiplied by 
the final ratio determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this 
section to reflect the nationwide 80th percentile charges. Finally, the 
resulting amounts are each trended forward from the center date of the 
trended data sources to the effective time period for the charges, as 
set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. The results 
constitute the nationwide 80th percentile standard room and board, ICU 
room and board, and ancillary per diem charges.
    (i) Room and board charge and ancillary charge component 
percentages. Using only those cases from the MedPAR file for which a 
distinction between room and board charges and ancillary charges can be 
determined, the percentage of the total charges for room and board 
compared to the combined total charges for room and board and ancillary 
services, and the percentage of the total charges for ancillary services 
compared to the combined total charges for room and board and ancillary 
services, are calculated by DRG.
    (ii) Standard room and board per diem charge and ICU room and board 
per diem charge ratios. Using only those cases from the MedPAR file for 
which a distinction between room and board and ancillary charges can be 
determined, overall average per diem room and board charges are 
calculated by DRG. Then, using the same cases, an average standard room 
and board per diem charge is calculated by dividing total non-ICU room 
and board charges by total non-ICU room and board days. Similarly, an 
average ICU room and board per diem charge is calculated by dividing 
total ICU room and board charges by total ICU room and board days. 
Finally, ratios of standard room and board per diem charges to average 
overall room and board per diem charges are calculated by DRG, as are 
ratios of ICU room and board per diem charges to average overall room 
and board per diem charges.
    (iii) 80th percentile. Using cases from the MedPAR file with 
separately identifiable semi-private room rates, the ratio of the day-
weighted 80th percentile semi-private room and board per diem charge to 
the average semi-private room and board per diem charge is obtained for 
each geographic area. The geographic area-based ratios are averaged to 
obtain a final 80th percentile ratio.
    (iv) Trending forward. 80th percentile charges for each DRG, 
obtained as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, are trended 
forward based on changes to the inpatient hospital services component of 
the CPI-U. Actual CPI-U changes are used from the center date of the 
trended data sources through the latest available month as

[[Page 681]]

of the time the calculations are performed. The three-month average 
annual trend rate as of the latest available month is then held constant 
to the midpoint of the calendar year in which the charges are primarily 
expected to be used. The projected total CPI-U change so obtained is 
then applied to the 80th percentile charges.
    (3) Geographic area adjustment factors. For each geographic area, 
the average per diem room and board charges and ancillary charges from 
the MedPAR file are calculated for each DRG. The DRGs are separated into 
two groups, surgical and non-surgical. For each of these groups of DRGs, 
for each geographic area, average room and board per diem charges and 
ancillary per diem charges are calculated, weighted by nationwide VA 
discharges and by average lengths of stay from the combined MedPAR file 
and MedStat claims database. This results in four average per diem 
charges for each geographic area: room and board for surgical DRGs, 
ancillary for surgical DRGs, room and board for non-surgical DRGs, and 
ancillary for non-surgical DRGs. Four corresponding national average per 
diem charges are obtained from the MedPAR file, weighted by nationwide 
VA discharges and by average lengths of stay from the combined MedPAR 
file and MedStat claims database. Four geographic area adjustment 
factors are then calculated for each geographic area by dividing each 
geographic area average per diem charge by the corresponding national 
average per diem charge.
    (c) Skilled nursing facility/sub-acute inpatient facility charges. 
When VA provides or furnishes skilled nursing/sub-acute inpatient 
services within the scope of care referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, skilled nursing facility/sub-acute inpatient facility 
charges billed for such services will be determined in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph. The skilled nursing facility/sub-acute 
inpatient facility charges are per diem charges that vary by geographic 
area. The facility charges cover care, including room and board, nursing 
care, pharmaceuticals, supplies, and skilled rehabilitation services 
(e.g., physical therapy, inhalation therapy, occupational therapy, and 
speech-language pathology), that is provided in a nursing home or 
hospital inpatient setting, is provided under a physician's orders, and 
is performed by or under the general supervision of professional 
personnel such as registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, physical 
therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and 
audiologists. These charges are calculated as follows:
    (1) Formula. For each stay, multiply the nationwide per diem charge 
determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the 
appropriate geographic area adjustment factor determined pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The result constitutes the area-
specific per diem charge. Finally, multiply the area-specific per diem 
charge by the number of days of care to obtain the total skilled nursing 
facility/sub-acute inpatient facility charge.
    (2) Per diem charge. To establish a baseline, a nationwide average 
per diem billed charge is calculated based on charges reported in the 
MedPAR skilled nursing facility file. For this purpose, the following 
MedPAR charge categories are included: room and board (private, semi-
private, and ward), physical therapy, occupational therapy, inhalation 
therapy, speech-language pathology, pharmacy, medical/surgical supplies, 
and ``other'' services. The following MedPAR charge categories are 
excluded from the calculation of the per diem charge and will be billed 
separately, using the charges determined as set forth in other 
applicable paragraphs of this section, when these services are provided 
to skilled nursing patients or sub-acute inpatients: ICU and CCU room 
and board, laboratory, radiology, cardiology, dialysis, operating room, 
blood and blood administration, ambulance, MRI, anesthesia, durable 
medical equipment, emergency room, clinic, outpatient, professional, 
lithotripsy, and organ acquisition services. The resulting average per 
diem billed charge is then multiplied by the 80th percentile adjustment 
factor determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to 
obtain a nationwide 80th percentile charge level. Finally, the resulting

[[Page 682]]

amount is trended forward to the effective time period for the charges, 
as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (i) 80th percentile adjustment factor. Using the MedPAR skilled 
nursing facility file, the ratio of the day-weighted 80th percentile 
room and board per diem charge to the day-weighted average room and 
board per diem charge is obtained for each geographic area. The 
geographic area-based ratios are averaged to obtain the 80th percentile 
adjustment factor.
    (ii) Trending forward. The 80th percentile charge is trended forward 
based on changes to the inpatient hospital services component of the 
CPI-U. Actual CPI-U changes are used from the time period of the source 
data through the latest available month as of the time the calculations 
are performed. The three-month average annual trend rate as of the 
latest available month is then held constant to the midpoint of the 
calendar year in which the charges are primarily expected to be used. 
The projected total CPI-U change so obtained is then applied to the 80th 
percentile charge.
    (3) Geographic area adjustment factors. The average billed per diem 
charge for each geographic area is calculated from the MedPAR skilled 
nursing facility file. This amount is divided by the nationwide average 
billed charge calculated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The 
geographic area adjustment factor for charges for each VA facility is 
the ratio for the geographic area in which the facility is located.
    (d) Partial hospitalization facility charges. When VA provides or 
furnishes partial hospitalization services that are within the scope of 
care referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the facility 
charges billed for such services will be determined in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph. Partial hospitalization facility 
charges are per diem charges that vary by geographic area. These charges 
are calculated as follows:
    (1) Formula. For each partial hospitalization stay, multiply the 
nationwide per diem charge determined pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section by the appropriate geographic area adjustment factor 
determined pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The result 
constitutes the area-specific per diem charge. Finally, multiply the 
area-specific per diem charge by the number of days of care to obtain 
the total partial hospitalization facility charge.
    (2) Per diem charge. To establish a baseline, a nationwide median 
per diem billed charge is calculated based on charges associated with 
partial hospitalization from the outpatient facility component of the 
Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 percent Sample. That median per diem 
billed charge is then multiplied by the 80th percentile adjustment 
factor determined pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to 
obtain a nationwide 80th percentile charge level. Finally, the resulting 
amount is trended forward to the effective time period for the charges, 
as set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (i) 80th percentile adjustment factor. The 80th percentile 
adjustment factor for partial hospitalization facility charges is the 
same as that computed for skilled nursing facility/sub-acute inpatient 
facility charges under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
    (ii) Trending forward. The 80th percentile charge is trended forward 
based on changes to the outpatient hospital services component of the 
CPI-U. Actual CPI-U changes are used from the time period of the source 
data through the latest available month as of the time the calculations 
are performed. The three-month average annual trend rate as of the 
latest available month is then held constant to the midpoint of the 
calendar year in which the charges are primarily expected to be used. 
The projected total CPI-U change so obtained is then applied to the 80th 
percentile charges, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (3) Geographic area adjustment factors. The geographic area 
adjustment factors for partial hospitalization facility charges are the 
same as those computed for outpatient facility charges under paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section.
    (e) Outpatient facility charges. When VA provides or furnishes 
outpatient facility services that are within the scope of care referred 
to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the charges billed

[[Page 683]]

for such services will be determined in accordance with the provisions 
of this paragraph. Charges for outpatient facility services vary by 
geographic area and by CPT/HCPCS code. These charges apply in the 
situations set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and are 
calculated as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (1) Settings and circumstances in which outpatient facility charges 
apply. Outpatient facility charges consist of facility charges for 
procedures, diagnostic tests, evaluation and management services, and 
other medical services, items, and supplies provided in the following 
settings and circumstances:
    (i) Outpatient departments and clinics at VA medical centers;
    (ii) Other VA provider-based entities; and
    (iii) VA non-provider-based entities, for procedures and tests for 
which no corresponding professional charge is established under the 
provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) Formula. For each outpatient facility charge CPT/HCPCS code, 
multiply the nationwide 80th percentile charge determined pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section by the appropriate geographic area 
adjustment factor determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section. The result constitutes the area-specific outpatient facility 
charge. When multiple surgical procedures are performed during the same 
outpatient encounter by a provider or provider team, the outpatient 
facility charges for such procedures will be reduced as set forth in 
paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
    (3) Nationwide 80th percentile charges by CPT/HCPCS code. For each 
CPT/HCPCS code for which outpatient facility charges apply, the 
nationwide 80th percentile charge is calculated as set forth in either 
paragraph (e)(3)(i) or (e)(3)(ii) of this section. The resulting amount 
is trended forward to the effective time period for the charges, as set 
forth in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section. The results constitute 
the nationwide 80th percentile outpatient facility charges by CPT/HCPCS 
code.
    (i) Nationwide 80th percentile charges for CPT/HCPCS codes which 
have APC assignments. Using the outpatient facility charges reported in 
the outpatient facility component of the Medicare Standard Analytical 
File 5 percent Sample, claim records are selected for which all charges 
can be assigned to an APC. Using this subset of the 5 percent Sample 
data, nationwide median charge to Medicare APC payment amount ratios, by 
APC, and nationwide 80th percentile to median charge ratios, by APC, are 
computed according to the methodology set forth in paragraphs 
(e)(3)(i)(A) and (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section, respectively. The product 
of these two ratios by APC is then computed, resulting in a composite 
nationwide 80th percentile charge to Medicare APC payment amount ratio. 
This ratio is then compared to the alternate nationwide 80th percentile 
charge to Medicare APC payment amount ratio computed in paragraph 
(e)(3)(i)(C) of this section, and the lesser amount is selected and 
multiplied by the current Medicare APC payment amount. The resulting 
product is the APC-specific nationwide 80th percentile charge amount for 
each applicable CPT/HCPCS code.
    (A) Nationwide median charge to Medicare APC payment amount ratios. 
For each CPT/HCPCS code, the ratio of median billed charge to Medicare 
APC payment amount is determined. The weighted average of these ratios 
for each APC is then obtained, using the reported 5 percent Sample 
frequencies as weights. In addition, corresponding ratios are calculated 
for each of the APC categories set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(D) of 
this section, again using the reported 5 percent Sample frequencies as 
weights. For APCs where the 5 percent Sample frequencies provide a 
statistically credible result, the APC-specific weighted average 
nationwide median charge to Medicare APC payment amount ratio so 
obtained is accepted without further adjustment. However, if the 5 
percent Sample data do not produce statistically credible results for 
any specific APC, then the APC category-specific ratio is applied for 
that APC.
    (B) Nationwide 80th percentile to median charge ratios. For each 
CPT/HCPCS code, a geographically normalized nationwide 80th percentile 
billed charge amount is divided by a similarly normalized nationwide 
median billed charge amount. The weighted average

[[Page 684]]

of these ratios for each APC is then obtained, using the reported 5 
percent Sample frequencies as weights. In addition, corresponding ratios 
are calculated for each of the APC categories set forth in paragraph 
(e)(3)(i)(D) of this section, again using the reported 5 percent Sample 
frequencies as weights. For APCs where the 5 percent Sample frequencies 
provide a statistically credible result, the APC-specific weighted 
average nationwide 80th percentile to median charge ratio so obtained is 
accepted without further adjustment. However, if the 5 percent Sample 
data do not produce statistically credible results for any specific APC, 
then the APC category-specific ratio is applied for that APC.
    (C) Alternate nationwide 80th percentile charge to Medicare APC 
payment amount ratios. A minimum 80th percentile charge to Medicare APC 
payment amount ratio is set at 2.0 for APCs with Medicare APC payment 
amounts of $25 or less. A maximum 80th percentile charge to Medicare APC 
payment amount ratio is set at 6.5 for APCs with Medicare APC payment 
amounts of $10,000 or more. Using linear interpolation with these 
endpoints, the alternate APC-specific nationwide 80th percentile charge 
to Medicare APC payment amount ratio is then computed, based on the 
Medicare APC payment amount.
    (D) APC categories for the purpose of establishing 80th percentile 
to median factors. For the purpose of the statistical methodology set 
forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, APCs are assigned to the 
following APC categories:
    (1) Radiology.
    (2) Drugs.
    (3) Office, Home, and Urgent Care Visits.
    (4) Cardiovascular.
    (5) Emergency Room Visits.
    (6) Outpatient Psychiatry, Alcohol and Drug Abuse.
    (7) Pathology.
    (8) Surgery.
    (9) Allergy Immunotherapy, Allergy Testing, Immunizations, and 
Therapeutic Injections.
    (10) All APCs not assigned to any of the above groups.
    (ii) Nationwide 80th percentile charges for CPT/HCPCS codes which do 
not have APC assignments. Nationwide 80th percentile billed charge 
levels by CPT/HCPCS code are computed from the outpatient facility 
component of the MDR database, from the MedStat claims database, and 
from the outpatient facility component of the Medicare Standard 
Analytical File 5 percent Sample. If the MDR database contains 
sufficient data to provide a statistically credible 80th percentile 
charge, then that result is retained for this purpose. If the MDR 
database does not provide a statistically credible 80th percentile 
charge, then the result from the MedStat database is retained for this 
purpose, provided it is statistically credible. If neither the MDR nor 
the MedStat databases provide statistically credible results, then the 
nationwide 80th percentile billed charge computed from the 5 percent 
Sample data is retained for this purpose. The nationwide 80th percentile 
charges retained from each of these data sources are trended forward to 
the effective time period for the charges, as set forth in paragraph 
(e)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) Trending forward. The charges for each CPT/HCPCS code, 
obtained as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, are trended 
forward based on changes to the outpatient hospital services component 
of the CPI-U. Actual CPI-U changes are used from the time period of the 
source data through the latest available month as of the time the 
calculations are performed. The three-month average annual trend rate as 
of the latest available month is then held constant to the midpoint of 
the calendar year in which the charges are primarily expected to be 
used. The projected total CPI-U change so obtained is then applied to 
the 80th percentile charges, as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section.
    (4) Geographic area adjustment factors. For each geographic area, a 
single adjustment factor is calculated as the arithmetic average of the 
outpatient geographic area adjustment factor published in the Milliman 
USA, Inc., Health Cost Guidelines (this factor constitutes the ratio of 
the level of charges for each geographic area to the

[[Page 685]]

nationwide level of charges), and a geographic area adjustment factor 
developed from the MDR database (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
for Data Sources). The MDR-based geographic area adjustment factors are 
calculated as the ratio of the CPT/HCPCS code weighted average charge 
level for each geographic area to the nationwide CPT/HCPCS code weighted 
average charge level.
    (5) Multiple surgical procedures. When multiple surgical procedures 
are performed during the same outpatient encounter by a provider or 
provider team as indicated by multiple surgical CPT/HCPCS procedure 
codes, then each CPT/HCPCS procedure code will be billed at 100 percent 
of the charges established under this section.
    (f) Physician and other professional charges except for anesthesia 
services and certain dental services. When VA provides or furnishes 
physician and other professional services, other than professional 
anesthesia services and certain professional dental services, within the 
scope of care referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, physician 
and other professional charges billed for such services will be 
determined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. Charges 
for professional dental services identified by CPT code are determined 
in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph; charges for 
professional dental services identified by HCPCS Level II code are 
determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (h) of this 
section. Physician and other professional charges consist of charges for 
professional services that vary by geographic area, by CPT/HCPCS code, 
by site of service, and by modifier, where applicable. These charges are 
calculated as follows:
    (1) Formula. For each CPT/HCPCS code or, where applicable, each CPT/
HCPCS code and modifier combination, multiply the total geographically-
adjusted RVUs determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section by 
the applicable geographically-adjusted conversion factor (a monetary 
amount) determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section to 
obtain the physician charge for each CPT/HCPCS code in a particular 
geographic area. Then, multiply this charge by the appropriate factors 
for any charge-significant modifiers, determined pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(4) of this section.
    (2)(i) Total geographically-adjusted RVUs for physician services 
that have Medicare RVUs. The work expense and practice expense RVUs for 
CPT/HCPCS codes, other than the codes described in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) 
and (f)(2)(iii) of this section, are compiled using Medicare Physician 
Fee Schedule RVUs. The sum of the geographically-adjusted work expense 
RVUs determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section and 
the geographically-adjusted practice expense RVUs determined pursuant to 
paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section equals the total geographically-
adjusted RVUs.
    (A) Geographically-adjusted work expense RVUs. For each CPT/HCPCS 
code for each geographic area, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule work 
expense RVUs are multiplied by the work expense Medicare Geographic 
Practice Cost Index. The result constitutes the geographically-adjusted 
work expense RVUs.
    (B) Geographically-adjusted practice expense RVUs. For each CPT/
HCPCS code for each geographic area, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule 
practice expense RVUs are multiplied by the practice expense Medicare 
Geographic Practice Cost Index. The result constitutes the 
geographically-adjusted practice expense RVUs. In these calculations, 
facility practice expense RVUs are used to obtain geographically-
adjusted practice expense RVUs for use by provider-based entities, and 
non-facility practice expense RVUs are used to obtain geographically-
adjusted practice expense RVUs for use by non-provider-based entities.
    (ii) RVUs for CPT/HCPCS codes that do not have Medicare RVUs and are 
not designated as unlisted procedures. For CPT/HCPCS codes that are not 
assigned RVUs in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section, 
total RVUs are developed based on various charge data sources. For these 
CPT/HCPCS codes, the nationwide 80th percentile billed charges are 
obtained, where statistically credible, from the MDR database. For any 
remaining CPT/HCPCS codes, the nationwide 80th percentile

[[Page 686]]

billed charges are obtained, where statistically credible, from the Part 
B component of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 percent Sample. 
For any remaining CPT/HCPCS codes, the nationwide 80th percentile billed 
charges are obtained, where statistically credible, from the Prevailing 
Healthcare Charges System nationwide commercial insurance database. For 
each of these CPT/HCPCS codes, nationwide total RVUs are obtained by 
taking the nationwide 80th percentile billed charges obtained using the 
preceding three databases and dividing by the untrended nationwide 
conversion factor for the corresponding CPT/HCPCS code group determined 
pursuant to paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(3)(i) of this section. For any 
remaining CPT/HCPCS codes that have not been assigned RVUs using the 
preceding data sources, the nationwide total RVUs are calculated by 
summing the work expense and non-facility practice expense RVUs found in 
Ingenix/St. Anthony's RBRVS. The resulting nationwide total RVUs 
obtained using these four data sources are multiplied by the geographic 
area adjustment factors determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of 
this section to obtain the area-specific total RVUs.
    (iii) RVUs for CPT/HCPCS codes designated as unlisted procedures. 
For CPT/HCPCS codes designated as unlisted procedures, total RVUs are 
developed based on the weighted median of the total RVUs of CPT/HCPCS 
codes within the series in which the unlisted procedure code occurs. A 
nationwide VA distribution of procedures and services is used for the 
purpose of computing the weighted median. The resulting nationwide total 
RVUs are multiplied by the geographic area adjustment factors determined 
pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section to obtain the area-
specific total RVUs.
    (iv) RVU geographic area adjustment factors for CPT/HCPCS codes that 
do not have Medicare RVUs, including codes that are designated as 
unlisted procedures. The adjustment factor for each geographic area 
consists of the weighted average of the work expense and practice 
expense Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Indices for each geographic 
area using charge data for representative CPT/HCPCS codes statistically 
selected and weighted for work expense and practice expense.
    (3) Geographically-adjusted 80th percentile conversion factors. CPT/
HCPCS codes are separated into the following 23 CPT/HCPCS code groups: 
allergy immunotherapy, allergy testing, cardiovascular, chiropractor, 
consults, emergency room visits and observation care, hearing/speech 
exams, immunizations, inpatient visits, maternity/cesarean deliveries, 
maternity/non-deliveries, maternity/normal deliveries, miscellaneous 
medical, office/home/urgent care visits, outpatient psychiatry/alcohol 
and drug abuse, pathology, physical exams, physical medicine, radiology, 
surgery, therapeutic injections, vision exams, and well baby exams. For 
each of the 23 CPT/HCPCS code groups, representative CPT/HCPCS codes are 
statistically selected and weighted so as to give a weighted average RVU 
comparable to the weighted average RVU of the entire CPT/HCPCS code 
group (the selected CPT/HCPCS codes are set forth in the Milliman USA, 
Inc., Health Cost Guidelines fee survey); see paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section for Data Sources. The 80th percentile charge for each selected 
CPT/HCPCS code is obtained from the MDR database. A nationwide 
conversion factor (a monetary amount) is calculated for each CPT/HCPCS 
code group as set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section. The 
nationwide conversion factors for each of the 23 CPT/HCPCS code groups 
are trended forward to the effective time period for the charges, as set 
forth in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. The resulting amounts for 
each of the 23 groups are multiplied by geographic area adjustment 
factors determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, 
resulting in geographically-adjusted 80th percentile conversion factors 
for each geographic area for the 23 CPT/HCPCS code groups for the 
effective charge period.
    (i) Nationwide conversion factors. Using the nationwide 80th 
percentile charges for the selected CPT/HCPCS codes from paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section, a nationwide conversion factor is calculated for 
each of the 23 CPT/HCPCS code groups by dividing the

[[Page 687]]

weighted average charge by the weighted average RVU.
    (ii) Trending forward. The nationwide conversion factors for each of 
the 23 CPT/HCPCS code groups, obtained as described in paragraph 
(f)(3)(i) of this section, are trended forward based on changes to the 
physicians' services component of the CPI-U. Actual CPI-U changes are 
used from the time period of the source data through the latest 
available month as of the time the calculations are performed. The 
three-month average annual trend rate as of the latest available month 
is then held constant to the midpoint of the calendar year in which the 
charges are primarily expected to be used. The projected total CPI-U 
change so obtained is then applied to the 23 conversion factors.
    (iii) Geographic area adjustment factors. Using the 80th percentile 
charges for the selected CPT/HCPCS codes from paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section for each geographic area, a geographic area-specific conversion 
factor is calculated for each of the 23 CPT/HCPCS code groups by 
dividing the weighted average charge by the weighted average 
geographically-adjusted RVU. The resulting conversion factor for each 
geographic area for each of the 23 CPT/HCPCS code groups is divided by 
the corresponding nationwide conversion factor determined pursuant to 
paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section. The resulting ratios are the 
geographic area adjustment factors for the conversion factors for each 
of the 23 CPT/HCPCS code groups for each geographic area.
    (4) Charge adjustment factors for specified CPT/HCPCS code 
modifiers. Surcharges are calculated in the following manner: From the 
Part B component of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 percent 
Sample, the ratio of weighted average billed charges for CPT/HCPCS codes 
with the specified modifier to the weighted average billed charge for 
CPT/HCPCS codes with no charge modifier is calculated, using the 
frequency of procedure codes with the modifier as weights in both 
weighted average calculations. The resulting ratios constitute the 
surcharge factors for specified charge-significant CPT/HCPCS code 
modifiers.
    (5) Certain charges for providers other than physicians. When 
services for which charges are established according to the preceding 
provisions of this paragraph (f) are performed by providers other than 
physicians, the charges for those services will be as determined by the 
preceding provisions of this paragraph, except as follows:
    (i) Outpatient facility charges. When the services of providers 
other than physicians are furnished in outpatient facility settings or 
in other facilities designated as provider-based, and outpatient 
facility charges for those services have been established under 
paragraph (e) of this section, then the outpatient facility charges 
established under paragraph (e) will apply instead of the charges 
established under this paragraph (f).
    (ii) Charges for professional services. Charges for the professional 
services of the following providers will be 100 percent of the amount 
that would be charged if the care had been provided by a physician:
    (A) Nurse practitioner.
    (B) Clinical nurse specialist.
    (C) Physician Assistant.
    (D) Clinical psychologist.
    (E) Clinical social worker.
    (F) Dietitian.
    (G) Clinical pharmacist.
    (H) Marriage and family therapist.
    (I) Licensed professional mental health counselor.
    (g) Professional charges for anesthesia services. When VA provides 
or furnishes professional anesthesia services within the scope of care 
referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, professional anesthesia 
charges billed for such services will be determined in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph. Charges for professional anesthesia 
services personally performed by anesthesiologists will be 100 percent 
of the charges determined as set forth in this paragraph. Charges for 
professional anesthesia services provided by non-medically directed 
certified registered nurse anesthetists will also be 100 percent of the 
charges determined as set forth in this paragraph. Charges for 
professional anesthesia services provided by medically directed 
certified registered nurse anesthetists will be 100 percent of the 
charges determined as set forth

[[Page 688]]

in this paragraph. Professional anesthesia charges consist of charges 
for professional services that vary by geographic area, by CPT/HCPCS 
code base units, and by number of time units. These charges are 
calculated as follows:
    (1) Formula. For each anesthesia CPT/HCPCS code, multiply the total 
anesthesia RVUs determined pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section 
by the applicable geographically-adjusted conversion factor (a monetary 
amount) determined pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section to 
obtain the professional anesthesia charge for each CPT/HCPCS code in a 
particular geographic area.
    (2) Total RVUs for professional anesthesia services. The total 
anesthesia RVUs for each anesthesia CPT/HCPCS code are the sum of the 
base units (as compiled by CMS) for that CPT/HCPCS code and the number 
of time units reported for the anesthesia service, where one time unit 
equals 15 minutes. For anesthesia CPT/HCPCS codes designated as unlisted 
procedures, base units are developed based on the weighted median base 
units for anesthesia CPT/HCPCS codes within the series in which the 
unlisted procedure code occurs. A nationwide VA distribution of 
procedures and services is used for the purpose of computing the 
weighted median base units.
    (3) Geographically-adjusted 80th percentile conversion factors. A 
nationwide 80th percentile conversion factor is calculated according to 
the methodology set forth in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section. The 
nationwide conversion factor is then trended forward to the effective 
time period for the charges, as set forth in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of 
this section. The resulting amount is multiplied by geographic area 
adjustment factors determined pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this 
section, resulting in geographically-adjusted 80th percentile conversion 
factors for each geographic area for the effective charge period.
    (i) Nationwide conversion factor. Preliminary 80th percentile 
conversion factors for each area are compiled from the MDR database. 
Then, a preliminary nationwide weighted-average 80th percentile 
conversion factor is calculated, using as weights the population 
(census) frequencies for each geographic area as presented in the 
Milliman USA, Inc., Health Cost Guidelines (see paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section for Data Sources). A nationwide 80th percentile fee by CPT/HCPCS 
code is then computed by multiplying this conversion factor by the MDR 
base units for each CPT/HCPCS code. An adjusted 80th percentile 
conversion factor by CPT/HCPCS code is then calculated by dividing the 
nationwide 80th percentile fee for each procedure code by the anesthesia 
base units (as compiled by CMS) for that CPT/HCPCS code. Finally, a 
nationwide weighted average 80th percentile conversion factor is 
calculated using combined frequencies for billed base units and time 
units from the part B component of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 
5 percent Sample as weights.
    (ii) Trending forward. The nationwide conversion factor, obtained as 
described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, is trended forward 
based on changes to the physicians' services component of the CPI-U. 
Actual CPI-U changes are used from the time period of the source data 
through the latest available month as of the time the calculations are 
performed. The three-month average annual trend rate as of the latest 
available month is then held constant to the midpoint of the calendar 
year in which the charges are primarily expected to be used. The 
projected total CPI-U change so obtained is then applied to the 
conversion factor.
    (iii) Geographic area adjustment factors. The preliminary 80th 
percentile conversion factors for each geographic area described in 
paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section are divided by the corresponding 
preliminary nationwide 80th percentile conversion factor also described 
in paragraph (g)(3)(i). The resulting ratios are the adjustment factors 
for each geographic area.
    (h) Professional charges for dental services identified by HCPCS 
Level II codes. When VA provides or furnishes outpatient dental 
professional services within the scope of care referred to in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, and such services are identified by HCPCS code 
rather than CPT code, the charges

[[Page 689]]

billed for such services will be determined in accordance with the 
provisions of this paragraph. The charges for dental services vary by 
geographic area and by HCPCS code. These charges are calculated as 
follows:
    (1) Formula. For each HCPCS dental code, multiply the nationwide 
80th percentile charge determined pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section by the appropriate geographic area adjustment factor determined 
pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) of this section. The result constitutes the 
area-specific dental charge.
    (2) Nationwide 80th percentile charges by HCPCS code. For each HCPCS 
dental code, 80th percentile charges are extracted from three 
independent data sources: Prevailing Healthcare Charges System database; 
National Dental Advisory Service nationwide pricing index; and the 
Dental UCR Module of the Comprehensive Healthcare Payment System, a 
release from Ingenix from a nationwide database of dental charges (see 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section for Data Sources). Charges for each 
database are then trended forward to a common date, based on actual 
changes to the dental services component of the CPI-U. Charges for each 
HCPCS dental code from each data source are combined into an average 
80th percentile charge by means of the methodology set forth in 
paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section. HCPCS dental codes designated as 
unlisted are assigned 80th percentile charges by means of the 
methodology set forth in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section. Finally, 
the resulting amounts are each trended forward to the effective time 
period for the charges, as set forth in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this 
section. The results constitute the nationwide 80th percentile charge 
for each HCPCS dental code.
    (i) Averaging methodology. The average charge for any particular 
HCPCS dental code is calculated by first computing a preliminary mean 
average of the three charges for each code. Statistical outliers are 
identified and removed by testing whether any charge differs from the 
preliminary mean charge by more than 50 percent of the preliminary mean 
charge. In such cases, the charge most distant from the preliminary mean 
is removed as an outlier, and the average charge is calculated as a mean 
of the two remaining charges. In cases where none of the charges differ 
from the preliminary mean charge by more than 50 percent of the 
preliminary mean charge, the average charge is calculated as a mean of 
all three reported charges.
    (ii) Nationwide 80th percentile charges for HCPCS dental codes 
designated as unlisted procedures. For HCPCS dental codes designated as 
unlisted procedures, 80th percentile charges are developed based on the 
weighted median 80th percentile charge of HCPCS dental codes within the 
series in which the unlisted procedure code occurs. The distribution of 
procedures and services from the Prevailing Healthcare Charges System 
nationwide commercial insurance database is used for the purpose of 
computing the weighted median.
    (iii) Trending forward. 80th percentile charges for each dental 
procedure code, obtained as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section, are trended forward based on the dental services component of 
the CPI-U. Actual CPI-U changes are used from the time period of the 
source data through the latest available month as of the time the 
calculations are performed. The three-month average annual trend rate as 
of the latest available month is then held constant to the midpoint of 
the calendar year in which the charges are primarily expected to be 
used. The projected total CPI-U change so obtained is then applied to 
the 80th percentile charges.
    (3) Geographic area adjustment factors. A geographic adjustment 
factor (consisting of the ratio of the level of charges in a given 
geographic area to the nationwide level of charges) for each geographic 
area and dental class of service is obtained from Milliman USA, Inc., 
Dental Health Cost Guidelines, a database of nationwide commercial 
insurance charges and relative costs; and a normalized geographic 
adjustment factor computed from the Dental UCR Module of the 
Comprehensive Healthcare Payment System compiled by Ingenix, as follows: 
Using local and nationwide average charges reported in the Ingenix data, 
a local

[[Page 690]]

weighted average charge for each dental class of procedure codes is 
calculated using utilization frequencies from the Milliman USA, Inc., 
Dental Health Cost Guidelines as weights (see paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section for Data Sources). Similarly, using nationwide average charge 
levels, a nationwide average charge by dental class of procedure codes 
is calculated. The normalized geographic adjustment factor for each 
dental class of procedure codes and for each geographic area is the 
ratio of the local average charge divided by the corresponding 
nationwide average charge. Finally, the geographic area adjustment 
factor is the arithmetic average of the corresponding factors from the 
data sources mentioned in the first sentence of this paragraph (h)(3).
    (i) Pathology and laboratory charges. When VA provides or furnishes 
pathology and laboratory services within the scope of care referred to 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, charges billed for such services 
will be determined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. 
Pathology and laboratory charges consist of charges for services that 
vary by geographic area and by CPT/HCPCS code. These charges are 
calculated as follows:
    (1) Formula. For each CPT/HCPCS code, multiply the total 
geographically-adjusted RVUs determined pursuant to paragraph (i)(2) of 
this section by the applicable geographically-adjusted conversion factor 
(a monetary amount) determined pursuant to paragraph (i)(3) of this 
section to obtain the pathology/laboratory charge for each CPT/HCPCS 
code in a particular geographic area.
    (2)(i) Total geographically-adjusted RVUs for pathology and 
laboratory services that have Medicare-based RVUs. Total RVUs are 
developed based on the Medicare Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Fee 
Schedule (CLAB). The CLAB payment amounts are upwardly adjusted such 
that the adjusted payment amounts are, on average, equivalent to 
Medicare Physician Fee Schedule payment levels, using statistical 
comparisons to the 80th percentile derived from the MDR database. These 
adjusted payment amounts are then divided by the corresponding Medicare 
conversion factor to derive RVUs for each CPT/HCPCS code. The resulting 
nationwide total RVUs are multiplied by the geographic adjustment 
factors determined pursuant to paragraph (i)(2)(iv) of this section to 
obtain the area-specific total RVUs.
    (ii) RVUs for CPT/HCPCS codes that do not have Medicare-based RVUs 
and are not designated as unlisted procedures. For CPT/HCPCS codes that 
are not assigned RVUs in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(iii) of this 
section, total RVUs are developed based on various charge data sources. 
For these CPT/HCPCS codes, the nationwide 80th percentile billed charges 
are obtained, where statistically credible, from the MDR database. For 
any remaining CPT/HCPCS codes, the nationwide 80th percentile billed 
charges are obtained, where statistically credible, from the Part B 
component of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 percent Sample. For 
any remaining CPT/HCPCS codes, the nationwide 80th percentile billed 
charges are obtained, where statistically credible, from the Prevailing 
Healthcare Charges System nationwide commercial insurance database. For 
each of these CPT/HCPCS codes, nationwide total RVUs are obtained by 
taking the nationwide 80th percentile billed charges obtained using the 
preceding three databases and dividing by the untrended nationwide 
conversion factor determined pursuant to paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(3)(i) 
of this section. For any remaining CPT/HCPCS codes that have not been 
assigned RVUs using the preceding data sources, the nationwide total 
RVUs are calculated by summing the work expense and non-facility 
practice expense RVUs found in Ingenix/St. Anthony's RBRVS. The 
resulting nationwide total RVUs obtained using these four data sources 
are multiplied by the geographic area adjustment factors determined 
pursuant to paragraph (i)(2)(iv) of this section to obtain the area-
specific total RVUs.
    (iii) RVUs for CPT/HCPCS codes designated as unlisted procedures. 
For CPT/HCPCS codes designated as unlisted procedures, total RVUs are 
developed based on the weighted median of the total RVUs of CPT/HCPCS 
codes within

[[Page 691]]

the series in which the unlisted procedure code occurs. A nationwide VA 
distribution of procedures and services is used for the purpose of 
computing the weighted median. The resulting nationwide total RVUs are 
multiplied by the geographic area adjustment factors determined pursuant 
to paragraph (i)(2)(iv) of this section to obtain the area-specific 
total RVUs.
    (iv) RVU geographic area adjustment factors for CPT/HCPCS codes that 
do not have Medicare RVUs, including codes that are designated as 
unlisted procedures. The adjustment factor for each geographic area 
consists of the weighted average of the work expense and practice 
expense Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Indices for each geographic 
area using charge data for representative CPT/HCPCS codes statistically 
selected and weighted for work expense and practice expense.
    (3) Geographically-adjusted 80th percentile conversion factors. 
Representative CPT/HCPCS codes are statistically selected and weighted 
so as to give a weighted average RVU comparable to the weighted average 
RVU of the entire pathology/laboratory CPT/HCPCS code group (the 
selected CPT/HCPCS codes are set forth in the Milliman USA, Inc., Health 
Cost Guidelines fee survey). The 80th percentile charge for each 
selected CPT/HCPCS code is obtained from the MDR database. A nationwide 
conversion factor (a monetary amount) is calculated as set forth in 
paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section. The nationwide conversion factor is 
trended forward to the effective time period for the charges, as set 
forth in paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section. The resulting amount is 
multiplied by a geographic area adjustment factor determined pursuant to 
paragraph (i)(3)(iv) of this section, resulting in the geographically-
adjusted 80th percentile conversion factor for the effective charge 
period.
    (i) Nationwide conversion factors. Using the nationwide 80th 
percentile charges for the selected CPT/HCPCS codes from paragraph 
(i)(3) of this section, a nationwide conversion factor is calculated by 
dividing the weighted average charge by the weighted average RVU.
    (ii) Trending forward. The nationwide conversion factor, obtained as 
described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, is trended forward based 
on changes to the physicians' services component of the CPI-U. Actual 
CPI-U changes are used from the time period of the source data through 
the latest available month as of the time the calculations are 
performed. The three-month average annual trend rate as of the latest 
available month is then held constant to the midpoint of the calendar 
year in which the charges are primarily expected to be used. The 
projected total CPI-U change so obtained is then applied to the 
pathology/laboratory conversion factor.
    (iii) Geographic area adjustment factor. Using the 80th percentile 
charges for the selected CPT/HCPCS codes from paragraph (i)(3) of this 
section for each geographic area, a geographic area-specific conversion 
factor is calculated by dividing the weighted average charge by the 
weighted average geographically-adjusted RVU. The resulting geographic 
area conversion factor is divided by the corresponding nationwide 
conversion factor determined pursuant to paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this 
section. The resulting ratios are the geographic area adjustment factors 
for pathology and laboratory services for each geographic area.
    (j) Observation care facility charges. When VA provides observation 
care within the scope of care referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, the facility charges billed for such care will be determined in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. The charges for this 
care vary by geographic area and number of hours of care. These charges 
are calculated as follows:
    (1) Formula. For each occurrence of observation care, add the 
nationwide base charge determined pursuant to paragraph (j)(2) of this 
section to the product of the number of hours in observation care and 
the hourly charge also determined pursuant to paragraph (j)(2) of this 
section. Then multiply this amount by the appropriate geographic area 
adjustment factor determined pursuant to paragraph (j)(3) of this 
section. The result constitutes the area-specific observation care 
facility charge.

[[Page 692]]

    (2)(i) Nationwide 80th percentile observation care facility charges. 
To calculate nationwide base and hourly facility charges, all claims 
with observation care line items are selected from the outpatient 
facility component of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 percent 
Sample. Then, using the 80th percentile observation line item charges 
for each unique hourly length of stay, a standard linear regression 
technique is used to calculate the nationwide 80th percentile base 
charge and 80th percentile hourly charge. Finally, the resulting amounts 
are each trended forward to the effective time period for the charges, 
as set forth in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section. The results 
constitute the nationwide 80th percentile base and hourly facility 
charges for observation care.
    (ii) Trending forward. The nationwide 80th percentile base and 
hourly facility charges for observation care, obtained as described in 
paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, are trended forward based on 
changes to the outpatient hospital services component of the CPI-U. 
Actual CPI-U changes are used from the time period of the source data 
through the latest available month as of the time the calculations are 
performed. The three-month average annual trend rate as of the latest 
available month is then held constant to the midpoint of the calendar 
year in which the charges are primarily expected to be used. The 
projected total CPI-U change so obtained is then applied to the 80th 
percentile charges.
    (3) Geographic area adjustment factors. The geographic area 
adjustment factors for observation care facility charges are the same as 
those computed for outpatient facility charges under paragraph (e)(4) of 
this section.
    (k) Ambulance and other emergency transportation charges. When VA 
provides ambulance and other emergency transportation services that are 
within the scope of care referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, the charges billed for such services will be determined in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. The charges for these 
services vary by HCPCS code, length of trip, and geographic area. These 
charges are calculated as follows:
    (1) Formula. For each occasion of ambulance or other emergency 
transportation service, add the nationwide base charge for the 
appropriate HCPCS code determined pursuant to paragraph (k)(2)(i) of 
this section to the product of the number of miles traveled and the 
appropriate HCPCS code mileage charge determined pursuant to paragraph 
(k)(2)(ii) of this section. Then multiply this amount by the appropriate 
geographic area adjustment factor determined pursuant to paragraph 
(k)(3) of this section. The result constitutes the area-specific 
ambulance or other emergency transportation service charge.
    (2)(i) Nationwide 80th percentile all-inclusive base charge. To 
calculate a nationwide all-inclusive base charge, all ambulance and 
other emergency transportation claims are selected from the outpatient 
facility component of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 percent 
Sample. Excluding professional and mileage charges, as well as all-
inclusive charges which are reported on such claims, the total charge 
per claim, including incidental supplies, is computed. Then, the 80th 
percentile amount for each HCPCS code is computed. Finally, the 
resulting amounts are each trended forward to the effective time period 
for the charges, as set forth in paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section. 
The results constitute the nationwide 80th percentile all-inclusive base 
charge for each HCPCS base charge code.
    (ii) Nationwide 80th percentile mileage charge. To calculate a 
nationwide mileage charge, all ambulance and other emergency 
transportation claims are selected from the outpatient facility 
component of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 percent Sample. 
Excluding professional, incidental, and base charges, as well as claims 
with all-inclusive charges, the total mileage charge per claim is 
computed. This amount is divided by the number of miles reported on the 
claim. Then, the 80th percentile amount for each HCPCS code, using miles 
as weights, is computed. Finally, the resulting amounts are each trended 
forward to the effective time period for the charges, as set

[[Page 693]]

forth in paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section. The results constitute 
the nationwide 80th percentile mileage charge for each HCPCS mileage 
code.
    (iii) Trending forward. The nationwide 80th percentile charge for 
each HCPCS code, obtained as described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and 
(k)(2)(ii) of this section, is trended forward based on changes to the 
outpatient hospital services component of the CPI-U. Actual CPI-U 
changes are used from the time period of the source data through the 
latest available month as of the time the calculations are performed. 
The three-month average annual trend rate as of the latest available 
month is then held constant to the midpoint of the calendar year in 
which the charges are primarily expected to be used. The projected total 
CPI-U change so obtained is then applied to the 80th percentile charges.
    (3) Geographic area adjustment factors. The geographic area 
adjustment factors for ambulance and other emergency transportation 
charges are the same as those computed for outpatient facility charges 
under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (l) Charges for durable medical equipment, drugs, injectables, and 
other medical services, items, and supplies identified by HCPCS Level II 
codes. When VA provides DME, drugs, injectables, or other medical 
services, items, or supplies that are identified by HCPCS Level II codes 
and that are within the scope of care referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, the charges billed for such services, items, and supplies 
will be determined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. 
The charges for these services, items, and supplies vary by geographic 
area, by HCPCS code, and by modifier, when applicable. These charges are 
calculated as follows:
    (1) Formula. For each HCPCS code, multiply the nationwide charge 
determined pursuant to paragraphs (l)(2), (l)(3), and (l)(4) of this 
section by the appropriate geographic area adjustment factor determined 
pursuant to paragraph (l)(5) of this section. The result constitutes the 
area-specific charge.
    (2) Nationwide 80th percentile charges for HCPCS codes with RVUs. 
For each applicable HCPCS code, RVUs are compiled from the data sources 
set forth in paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section. The RVUs are 
multiplied by the charge amount for each incremental RVU determined 
pursuant to paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this section, and this amount is 
added to the fixed charge amount also determined pursuant to paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii) of this section. Then, for each HCPCS code, this charge is 
multiplied by the appropriate 80th percentile to median charge ratio 
determined pursuant to paragraph (l)(2)(iii) of this section. Finally, 
the resulting amount is trended forward to the effective time period for 
the charges, as set forth in paragraph (l)(2)(iv) of this section to 
obtain the nationwide 80th percentile charge.
    (i) RVUs for DME, drugs, injectables, and other medical services, 
items, and supplies. For the purpose of the statistical methodology set 
forth in paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this section, HCPCS codes are assigned 
to the following HCPCS code groups. For the HCPCS codes in each group, 
the RVUs or amounts indicated constitute the RVUs:
    (A) Chemotherapy Drugs: Ingenix/St. Anthony's RBRVS Practice Expense 
RVUs.
    (B) Other Drugs: Ingenix/St. Anthony's RBRVS Practice Expense RVUs.
    (C) DME--Hospital Beds: Medicare DME Fee Schedule amounts.
    (D) DME--Medical/Surgical Supplies: Medicare DME Fee Schedule 
amounts.
    (E) DME--Orthotic Devices: Medicare DME Fee Schedule amounts.
    (F) DME--Oxygen and Supplies: Medicare DME Fee Schedule amounts.
    (G) DME--Wheelchairs: Medicare DME Fee Schedule amounts.
    (H) Other DME: Medicare DME Fee Schedule amounts.
    (I) Enteral/Parenteral Supplies: Medicare Parenteral and Enteral 
Nutrition Fee Schedule amounts.
    (J) Surgical Dressings and Supplies: Medicare DME Fee Schedule 
amounts.
    (K) Vision Items--Other Than Lenses: Medicare DME Fee Schedule 
amounts.
    (L) Vision Items--Lenses: Medicare DME Fee Schedule amounts.

[[Page 694]]

    (M) Hearing Items: Ingenix/St. Anthony's RBRVS Practice Expense 
RVUs.
    (ii) Charge amounts. Using combined Part B and DME components of the 
Medicare Standard Analytical File 5% Sample, the median billed charge is 
calculated for each HCPCS code. A mathematical approximation methodology 
based on least squares techniques is applied to the RVUs specified for 
each of the groups set forth in paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, 
yielding two charge amounts for each HCPCS code group: a charge amount 
per incremental RVU, and a fixed charge amount.
    (iii) 80th Percentile to median charge ratios. Two ratios are 
obtained for each HCPCS code group set forth in paragraph (l)(2)(i) of 
this section by dividing the weighted average 80th percentile charge by 
the weighted average median charge derived from two data sources: 
Medicare data, as represented by the combined Part B and DME components 
of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5% Sample; and the MDR 
database. Charge frequencies from the Medicare data are used as weights 
when calculating all weighted averages. For each HCPCS code group, the 
smaller of the two ratios is selected as the adjustment from median to 
80th percentile charges.
    (iv) Trending forward. The charges for each HCPCS code, obtained as 
described in paragraph (l)(2)(iii) of this section, are trended forward 
based on changes to the medical care commodities component of the CPI-U. 
Actual CPI-U changes are used from the time period of the source data 
through the latest available month as of the time the calculations are 
performed. The three-month average annual trend rate as of the latest 
available month is then held constant to the midpoint of the calendar 
year in which the charges are primarily expected to be used. The 
projected total CPI-U change so obtained is then applied to the 80th 
percentile charges, as described in paragraph (l)(2)(iii) of this 
section.
    (3) Nationwide 80th percentile charges for HCPCS codes without RVUs. 
For each applicable HCPCS code, 80th percentile charges are extracted 
from three independent data sources: the MDR database; Medicare, as 
represented by the combined Part B and DME components of the Medicare 
Standard Analytical File 5 percent Sample; and Milliman USA, Inc., 
Optimized HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) Data Sets (see paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section for Data Sources). Charges from each database are 
then trended forward to the effective time period for the charges, as 
set forth in paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section. Charges for each HCPCS 
code from each data source are combined into an average 80th percentile 
charge by means of the methodology set forth in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of 
this section. The results constitute the nationwide 80th percentile 
charge for each applicable HCPCS code.
    (i) Trending forward. The charges from each database for each HCPCS 
code, obtained as described in paragraph (l)(3) of this section, are 
trended forward based on changes to the medical care commodities 
component of the CPI-U. Actual CPI-U changes are used from the time 
period of each source database through the latest available month as of 
the time the calculations are performed. The three-month average annual 
trend rate as of the latest available month is then held constant to the 
midpoint of the calendar year in which the charges are primarily 
expected to be used. The projected total CPI-U change so obtained is 
then applied to the 80th percentile charges, as described in paragraph 
(l)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Averaging methodology. The average 80th percentile trended 
charge for any particular HCPCS code is calculated by first computing a 
preliminary mean average of the three charges for each HCPCS code. 
Statistical outliers are identified and removed by testing whether any 
charge differs from the preliminary mean charge by more than 5 times the 
preliminary mean charge, or by less than 0.2 times the preliminary mean 
charge. In such cases, the charge most distant from the preliminary mean 
is removed as an outlier, and the average charge is calculated as a mean 
of the two remaining charges. In cases where none of the charges differ 
from the preliminary mean charge by more than 5 times the preliminary 
mean charge, or less than

[[Page 695]]

0.2 times the preliminary mean charge, the average charge is calculated 
as a mean of all three reported charges.
    (4) Nationwide 80th percentile charges for HCPCS codes designated as 
unlisted or unspecified. For HCPCS codes designated as unlisted or 
unspecified procedures, services, items, or supplies, 80th percentile 
charges are developed based on the weighted median 80th percentile 
charges of HCPCS codes within the series in which the unlisted or 
unspecified code occurs. A nationwide VA distribution of procedures, 
services, items, and supplies is used for the purpose of computing the 
weighted median.
    (5) Geographic area adjustment factors. For the purpose of 
geographic adjustment, HCPCS codes are combined into two groups: drugs 
and DME/supplies, as set forth in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section. 
The geographic area adjustment factor for each of these groups is 
calculated as the ratio of the area-specific weighted average charge 
determined pursuant to paragraph (l)(5)(ii) of this section divided by 
the nationwide weighted average charge determined pursuant to paragraph 
(l)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (i) Combined HCPCS code groups for geographic area adjustment 
factors for DME, drugs, injectables, and other medical services, items, 
and supplies. For the purpose of the statistical methodology set forth 
in paragraph (l)(5) of this section, each of the HCPCS code groups set 
forth in paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section is assigned to one of two 
combined HCPCS code groups, as follows:
    (A) Chemotherapy Drugs: Drugs.
    (B) Other Drugs: Drugs.
    (C) DME--Hospital Beds: DME/supplies.
    (D) DME--Medical/Surgical Supplies: DME/supplies.
    (E) DME--Orthotic Devices: DME/supplies.
    (F) DME--Oxygen and Supplies: DME/supplies.
    (G) DME--Wheelchairs: DME/supplies.
    (H) Other DME: DME/supplies.
    (I) Enteral/Parenteral Supplies: DME/supplies.
    (J) Surgical Dressings and Supplies: DME/supplies.
    (K) Vision Items--Other Than Lenses: DME/supplies.
    (L) Vision Items--Lenses: DME/supplies.
    (M) Hearing Items: DME/supplies.
    (ii) Area-specific weighted average charges. Using the median 
charges by HCPCS code from the MDR database for each geographic area and 
utilization frequencies by HCPCS code from the combined Part B and DME 
components of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 percent Sample, an 
area-specific weighted average charge is calculated for each combined 
HCPCS code group.
    (iii) Nationwide weighted average charges. Using the area-specific 
weighted average charges determined pursuant to paragraph (l)(5)(ii) of 
this section, a nationwide weighted average charge is calculated for 
each combined HCPCS code group, using as weights the population (census) 
frequencies for each geographic area as presented in the Milliman USA, 
Inc., Health Cost Guidelines (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section for 
Data Sources).
    (m) Charges for prescription drugs not administered during 
treatment. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, when VA 
provides or furnishes prescription drugs not administered during 
treatment, within the scope of care referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, charges billed separately for such prescription drugs will 
be based on VA costs in accordance with the methodology set forth in 
Sec. 17.102 of this part.

    Note to Sec. 17.101: The charges generated by the methodology set 
forth in this section are the same charges prescribed by the Office of 
Management and Budget for use under the Federal Medical Care Recovery 
Act, 42 U.S.C. 2651-2653.

Sec. 17.102  Charges for care or services.

    Except as provided in Sec. 17.101, charges at the indicated rates 
shall be made for

[[Page 696]]

Department of Veterans Affairs hospital care or medical services 
(including, but not limited to, dental services, supplies, medicines, 
orthopedic and prosthetic appliances, and domiciliary or nursing home 
care) as follows:
    (a) Furnished in error or on tentative eligibility. Charges at rates 
prescribed by the Under Secretary for Health shall be made for inpatient 
or outpatient care or services (including domiciliary care) authorized 
for any person on the basis of eligibility as a veteran or a tentative 
eligibility determination under Sec. 17.34 but he or she was 
subsequently found to have been ineligible for such care or services as 
a veteran because the military service or any other eligibility 
requirement was not met, or
    (b) Furnished in a medical emergency. Charges at rates prescribed by 
the Under Secretary for Health shall be made for any inpatient or 
outpatient care or services rendered any person in a medical emergency 
who was not eligible for such care or services as a veteran, if:
    (1) The care or services were rendered as a humanitarian service, 
under Sec. 17.43(b)(1) or Sec. 17.95 to a person neither claiming 
eligibility as a veteran nor for whom the establishment of eligibility 
as a veteran was expected, or
    (2) The person for whom care or services were rendered was a 
Department of Veterans Affairs employee or a member of a Department of 
Veterans Affairs employee's family; or
    (c) Furnished beneficiaries of the Department of Defense or other 
Federal agencies. Except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this 
section and the second sentence of this paragraph, charges at rates 
prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget shall be made for any 
inpatient or outpatient care or services authorized for a member of the 
Armed Forces on active duty or for any beneficiary or designee of any 
other Federal agency. Charges for services provided a member or former 
member of a uniformed service who is entitled to retired or retainer 
pay, or equivalent pay, will be at rates prescribed by the Secretary 
(E.O. 11609, dated July 22, 1971, 36 FR 13747), or
    (d) Furnished pensioners of allied nations. Charges at rates 
prescribed by the Under Secretary for Health shall be made for any 
inpatient or outpatient care or services rendered a pensioner of a 
nation allied with the United States in World War I and World War II; or
    (e) Furnished under sharing agreements. Charges at rates agreed upon 
in an agreement for sharing specialized medical resources shall be made 
for all medical care or services, either on an inpatient or outpatient 
basis, rendered to a person designated by the other party to the 
agreement as a patient to be benefited under the agreement; or
    (f) Furnished military retirees with chronic disability. Charges for 
subsistence at rates prescribed by the Under Secretary for Health shall 
be made for the period during which hospital care is rendered when such 
care is rendered to a member or former member of the Armed Forces 
required to pay the subsistence rate under Sec. 17.47 (b)(2) and 
(c)(2).
    (g) Furnished for research purposes. Charges will not be made for 
medical services, including transportation, furnished as part of an 
approved Department of Veterans Affairs research project, except that if 
the services are furnished to a person who is not eligible for the 
services as a veteran, the medical care appropriation shall be 
reimbursed from the research appropriation at the same rates used for 
billings under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (h) Computation of charges. The method for computing the charges 
under Sec. 17.86 and under paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (f), and (g) and 
the last sentence of paragraph (c) of this section is based on the 
Monthly Program Cost Report (MPCR), which sets forth the actual basic 
costs and per diem rates by type of inpatient care, and actual basic 
costs and rates for outpatient care visits or prescriptions filled. 
Factors for depreciation of buildings and equipment and Central Office 
overhead are added, based on accounting manual instructions. Additional 
factors are added for interest on capital investment and for standard 
fringe benefit costs covering government employee retirement and 
disability costs. The current year billing rates are projected on prior 
year actual rates by applying

[[Page 697]]

the budgeted percentage increase. In addition, based on the detail 
available in the MPCR, VA intends to, on each bill break down the all-
inclusive rate into its three principal components; namely, physician 
cost, ancillary services cost, and nursing, room and board cost. The 
rates generated by the foregoing methodology will be published by either 
VA or OMB in the `Notices' section of the Federal Register.

Sec. 17.105  Waivers.

    Applications or requests for waiver of debts or claims asserted by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs in connection with the medical 
program generally will be denied by the facility Fiscal activity on the 
basis there is no legal authority to waive debts, unless the question of 
waiver should be referred as follows:
    (a) Of charges for medical services. If the debt represents charges 
made under Sec. 17.102, the application or request for waiver should be 
referred for disposition under Sec. 1.900 et seq. of this chapter to 
the field facility Committee on Waivers and Compromises which shall take 
final action, or
    (b) Of claims against third persons and other claims. If the debt is 
of a type contemplated in Sec. 17.103(b), the waiver question should be 
referred in accordance with the same referral procedures for compromise 
offers in such categories of claims, or
    (c) Of charges for copayments. If the debt represents charges for 
outpatient medical care, inpatient hospital care, medication or extended 
care services copayments made under Sec. Sec. 17.108, 17.110 or 17.111 
of this chapter, the claimant must request a waiver by submitting VA 
Form 5655 (Financial Status Report) to a Fiscal Officer at a VA medical 
facility where all or part of the debt was incurred. The claimant must 
submit this form within the time period provided in Sec. 1.963(b) of 
this chapter and may request a hearing under Sec. 1.966(a) of this 
chapter. The Fiscal Officer may extend the time period for submitting a 
claim if the Chairperson of the Committee on Waivers and Compromises 
could do so under Sec. 1.963(b) of this chapter. The Fiscal Officer 
will apply the standard ``equity and good conscience'' in accordance 
with Sec. Sec. 1.965 and 1.966(a) of this chapter, and may waive all or 
part of the claimant's debts. A decision by the Fiscal Officer under 
this provision is final (except that the decision may be reversed or 
modified based on new and material evidence, fraud, a change in law or 
interpretation of law, or clear and unmistakable error shown by the 
evidence in the file at the time of the prior decision as provided in 
Sec. 1.969 of this chapter) and may be appealed in accordance with 38 
CFR parts 19 and 20.
    (d) Other debts. If the debt represents any claim or charges other 
than those contemplated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and 
is a debt for which waiver has been specifically provided for by law or 
under the terms of a contract, initial action shall be taken at the 
station level for referral of the request for waiver through channels 
for action by the appropriate designated official. If, however, the 
question of waiver may also involve a concurrent opportunity to 
negotiate a compromise settlement, the application shall be referred to 
the Committee on Waivers and Compromises.

(The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information 
collection requirements in this section under control number 2900-0165.)

Disciplinary Control of Beneficiaries Receiving Hospital, Domiciliary or 
                            Nursing Home Care


<R05>
Sec. 17.106  Authority for disciplinary action.

    The good conduct of beneficiaries receiving hospitalization for 
observation and examination or for treatment, or receiving domiciliary 
or nursing home care in facilities under direct and exclusive 
jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs, will be maintained 
by corrective and disciplinary procedure formulated by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. Such corrective and disciplinary measures, to be

particular offense, will consist, in respect to hospital patients, of 
such penalties as the withholding for a determined period of pass 
privileges, exclusion from entertainments, or disciplinary discharge; 
and, in respect to domiciled members, such penalties as confinement to 
sections or

[[Page 699]]

grounds, deprivation of privileges, enforced furlough, or disciplinary 
discharge. Also, for any violation of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
rules set forth in Sec. 1.218, or other Federal laws on Department of 
Veterans Affairs property, a beneficiary is subject to the penalty 
prescribed for the offense.

                               Copayments


<R05>
Sec. 17.108  Copayments for inpatient hospital care and outpatient medical care.

    (a) General. This section sets forth requirements regarding 
copayments for inpatient hospital care and outpatient medical care 
provided to veterans by VA.
    (b) Copayments for inpatient hospital care. (1) Except as provided 
in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, a veteran, as a condition of 
receiving inpatient hospital care provided by VA (provided either 
directly by VA or obtained by VA by contract), must agree to pay VA (and 
is obligated to pay VA) the applicable copayment, as set forth in 
paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section.
    (2) The copayment for inpatient hospital care shall be, during any 
365-day period, a copayment equaling the sum of:
    (i) $10 for every day the veteran receives inpatient hospital care, 
and
    (ii) The lesser of:
    (A) The sum of the inpatient Medicare deductible for the first 90 
days of care and one-half of the inpatient Medicare deductible for each 
subsequent 90 days of care (or fraction thereof) after the first 90 days 
of such care during such 365-day period, or
    (B) VA's cost of providing the care.
    (3) The copayment for inpatient hospital care for veterans enrolled 
in priority category 7 shall be 20 percent of the amount computed under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    Note to Sec. 17.108(b): The requirement that a veteran agree to pay 
the copayment would be met by submitting to VA a signed VA Form 10-10EZ. 
This is the application form for enrollment in the VA healthcare system 
and also is the document used for providing means-test information 
annually.

    (c) Copayments for outpatient medical care. (1) Except as provided 
in paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of this section, a veteran, as a condition 
of receiving outpatient medical care provided by VA, must agree to pay 
VA (and is obligated to pay VA) a copayment as set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (2) The copayment for outpatient medical care is $15 for a primary 
care outpatient visit and $50 for a specialty care outpatient visit. If 
a veteran has more than one primary care encounter on the same day and 
no specialty care encounter on that day, the copayment amount is the 
copayment for one primary care outpatient visit. If a veteran has one or 
more primary care encounters and one or more specialty care encounters 
on the same day, the copayment amount is the copayment for one specialty 
care outpatient visit.
    (3) For purposes of this section, a primary care visit is an episode 
of care furnished in a clinic that provides integrated, accessible 
healthcare services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a 
large majority of personal healthcare needs, developing a sustained 
partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and 
community. Primary care includes, but is not limited to, diagnosis and 
management of acute and chronic biopsychosocial conditions, health 
promotion, disease prevention, overall care management, and patient and 
caregiver education. Each patient's identified primary care clinician 
delivers services in the context of a larger interdisciplinary primary 
care team. Patients have access to the primary care clinician and much 
of the primary care team without need of a referral. In contrast, 
specialty care is generally provided through referral. A specialty care 
outpatient visit is an episode of care furnished in a clinic that does 
not provide primary care, and is only provided through a referral. Some 
examples of specialty care provided at a specialty care clinic are 
radiology services requiring the immediate presence of a physician, 
audiology, optometry, magnetic resonance imagery (MRI), computerized 
axial tomography (CAT)

[[Page 700]]

scan, nuclear medicine studies, surgical consultative services, and 
ambulatory surgery.

    Note to Sec. 17.108(c): The requirement that a veteran agree to pay 
the copayment would be met by submitting to VA a signed VA Form 10-10EZ. 
This is the application form for enrollment in the VA healthcare system 
and also is the document used for providing means-test information 
annually.

    (d) Veterans not subject to copayment requirements for inpatient 
hospital care or outpatient medical care. The following veterans are not 
subject to the copayment requirements of this section:
    (1) A veteran with a compensable service-connected disability;
    (2) A veteran who is a former prisoner of war;
    (3) A veteran awarded a Purple Heart;
    (4) A veteran who was discharged or released from active military 
service for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty;
    (5) A veteran who receives disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. 
1151;
    (6) A veteran whose entitlement to disability compensation is 
suspended pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 1151, but only to the extent that the 
veteran's continuing eligibility for care is provided for in the 
judgment or settlement described in 38 U.S.C. 1151;
    (7) A veteran whose entitlement to disability compensation is 
suspended because of the receipt of military retirement pay;
    (8) A veteran of the Mexican border period or of World War I;
    (9) A military retiree provided care under an interagency agreement 
as defined in section 113 of Public Law 106-117, 113 Stat. 1545; or
    (10) A veteran who VA determines to be unable to defray the expenses 
of necessary care under 38 U.S.C. 1722(a).
    (e) Services not subject to copayment requirements for inpatient 
hospital care or outpatient medical care. The following are not subject 
to the copayment requirements under this section:
    (1) Care provided to a veteran for a noncompensable zero percent 
service-connected disability;
    (2) Care authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1710(e) for Vietnam-era 
herbicide-exposed veterans, radiation-exposed veterans, Gulf War 
veterans, or post-Gulf War combat-exposed veterans;
    (3) Special registry examinations (including any follow-up 
examinations or testing ordered as part of the special registry 
examination) offered by VA to evaluate possible health risks associated 
with military service;
    (4) Counseling and care for sexual trauma as authorized under 38 
U.S.C 1720D;
    (5) Compensation and pension examinations requested by the Veterans 
Benefits Administration;
    (6) Care provided as part of a VA-approved research project 
authorized by 38 U.S.C. 7303;
    (7) Outpatient dental care provided under 38 U.S.C. 1712;
    (8) Readjustment counseling and related mental health services 
authorized under 38 U.S.C 1712A;
    (9) Emergency treatment paid for under 38 U.S.C. 1725 or 1728;
    (10) Care or services authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1720E for certain 
veterans regarding cancer of the head or neck;
    (11) Publicly announced VA public health initiatives (e.g., health 
fairs) or an outpatient visit solely consisting of preventive screening 
and immunizations (e.g. influenza immunization, pneumonococcal 
immunization, hypertension screening, hepatitis C screening, tobacco 
screening, alcohol screening, hyperlipidemia screening, breast cancer 
screening, cervical cancer screening, screening for colorectal cancer by 
fecal occult blood testing, and education about the risks and benefits 
of prostate cancer screening);
    (12) Weight management counseling (individual and group);
    (13) Smoking cessation counseling (individual and group); and
    (14) Laboratory services, flat film radiology services, and 
electrocardiograms.
    (f) Additional care not subject to outpatient copayment. Outpatient

section when provided to a veteran during a day for which the veteran is 
required to make a copayment for extended care

services that were provided either directly by VA or obtained for VA by 
contract.

<R05>
Sec. 17.110  Copayments for medication.

    (a) General. This section sets forth requirements regarding 
copayments for medications provided to veterans by VA.
    (b) Copayments. (1) Unless exempted under paragraph (c) of this 
section, a veteran is obligated to pay VA a copayment for each 30-day or 
less supply of medication provided by VA on an outpatient basis (other 
than medication administered during treatment). For the period from 
February 4, 2002 through December 31, 2002, the copayment amount is $7. 
The copayment amount for each calendar year thereafter will be 
established by using the Prescription Drug component of the Medical 
Consumer Price Index as follows: For each calendar year beginning after 
December 31, 2002, the Index as of the previous September 30 will be 
divided by the Index as of September 30, 2001. The ratio so obtained 
will be multiplied by the original copayment amount of $7. The copayment 
amount for the new calendar year will be this result, rounded down to 
the whole dollar amount.

    Note to paragraph (b)(1): Example for determining copayment amount. 
If the ratio of the Prescription Drug component of the Medical Consumer 
Price Index for September 30, 2003, to the corresponding Index for 
September 30, 2001, is 1.2242, then this ratio multiplied by the 
original copayment amount of $7 would equal $8.57, and the copayment 
amount for calendar year 2004, rounded down to the whole dollar amount, 
would be $8.

    (2) The total amount of copayments in a calendar year for a veteran 
enrolled in one of the priority categories 2 through 6 of VA's health 
care system (see Sec. 17.36) shall not exceed the cap established for 
the calendar year. The cap for calendar year 2002 is $840. If the 
copayment amount increases after calendar year 2002, the cap of $840 
shall be increased by $120 for each $1 increase in the copayment amount.
    (c) Medication not subject to the copayment requirements. The 
following are exempt from the copayment requirements of this section:
    (1) Medication for a veteran who has a service-connected disability 
rated 50% or more based on a service-connected disability or 
unemployability;
    (2) Medication for a veteran's service-connected disability;
    (3) Medication for a veteran whose annual income (as determined 
under 38 U.S.C. 1503) does not exceed the maximum annual rate of VA 
pension which would be payable to such veteran if such veteran were 
eligible for pension under 38 U.S.C. 1521;
    (4) Medication authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1710(e) for Vietnam-era 
herbicide-exposed veterans, radiation-exposed veterans, Persian Gulf War 
veterans, or post-Persian Gulf War combat-exposed veterans;
    (5) Medication for treatment of sexual trauma as authorized under 38 
U.S.C. 1720D;
    (6) Medication for treatment of cancer of the head or neck 
authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1720E; and
    (7) Medications provided as part of a VA approved research project 
authorized by 38 U.S.C. 7303.

<R05>
Sec. 17.111  Copayments for extended care services.

    (a) General. This section sets forth requirements regarding 
copayments for extended care services provided to veterans by VA (either 
directly by VA or paid for by VA).
    (b) Copayments. (1) Unless exempted under paragraph (f) of this 
section, as a condition of receiving extended care services from VA, a 
veteran must agree to pay VA and is obligated to pay VA a copayment as 
specified by this section. A veteran has no obligation to pay a 
copayment for the first 21 days of extended care services that VA 
provided the veteran in any 12-month period (the 12-month period begins 
on the date that VA first provided extended care services to the 
veteran). However, for each day that extended care services are provided 
beyond the first 21 days, a veteran is obligated to pay VA

[[Page 702]]

the copayment amount set forth below to the extent the veteran has 
available resources. Available resources are based on monthly 
calculations, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section. The 
following sets forth the extended care services provided by VA and the 
corresponding copayment amount per day:
    (i) Adult day health care--$15.
    (ii) Domiciliary care--$5.
    (iii) Institutional respite care--$97.
    (iv) Institutional geriatric evaluation--$97.
    (v) Non-institutional geriatric evaluation--$15.
    (vi) Non-institutional respite care--$15.
    (vii) Nursing home care--$97.
    (2) For purposes of counting the number of days for which a veteran 
is obligated to make a copayment under this section, VA will count each 
day that adult day health care, non-institutional geriatric evaluation, 
and non-institutional respite care are provided and will count each full 
day and partial day for each inpatient stay except for the day of 
discharge.
    (c) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Adult day health care is a therapeutic outpatient care program 
that provides medical services, rehabilitation, therapeutic activities, 
socialization, nutrition and transportation services to disabled 
veterans in a congregate setting.
    (2) Domiciliary care is defined in Sec. 17.30(b).
    (3) Extended care services means adult day health care, domiciliary 
care, institutional geriatric evaluation, noninstitutional geriatric 
evaluation, nursing home care, institutional respite care, and 
noninstitutional respite care.
    (4) Geriatric evaluation is a specialized, diagnostic/consultative 
service provided by an interdisciplinary team that is for the purpose of 
providing a comprehensive assessment, care plan, and extended care 
service recommendations.
    (5) Institutional means a setting in a hospital, domiciliary, or 
nursing home of overnight stays of one or more days.
    (6) Noninstitutional means a service that does not include an 
overnight stay.
    (7) Nursing home care means the accommodation of convalescents or 
other persons who are not acutely ill and not in need of hospital care, 
but who require nursing care and related medical services, if such 
nursing care and medical services are prescribed by, or are performed 
under the general direction of, persons duly licensed to provide such 
care (nursing services must be provided 24 hours a day). Such term 
includes services furnished in skilled nursing care facilities. Such 
term excludes hospice care.
    (8) Respite care means care which is of limited duration, is 
furnished on an intermittent basis to a veteran who is suffering from a 
chronic illness and who resides primarily at home, and is furnished for 
the purpose of helping the veteran to continue residing primarily at 
home. (Respite providers temporarily replace the caregivers to provide 
services ranging from supervision to skilled care needs.)
    (d) Effect of the veteran's financial resources on obligation to pay 
copayment. (1) A veteran is obligated to pay the copayment to the extent 
the veteran and the veteran's spouse have available resources. For 
veterans who have been receiving extended care services for 180 days or 
less, their available resources are the sum of the income of the veteran 
and the veteran's spouse, minus the sum of the veterans allowance, the 
spousal allowance, and expenses. For veterans who have been receiving 
extended care services for 181 days or more, their available resources 
are the sum of the value of the liquid assets, the fixed assets, and the 
income of the veteran and the veteran's spouse, minus the sum of the 
veterans allowance, the spousal allowance, the spousal resource 
protection amount, and (but only if the veteran--has a spouse or 
dependents residing in the community who is not institutionalized) 
expenses. When a veteran is legally separated from a spouse, available 
resources do not include spousal income, expenses, and assets or a 
spousal allowance.
    (2) For purposes of determining available resources under this 
section:

from VA or any other Federal programs, and any other income). The amount 
of current income will be stated in frequency of receipt, e.g., per 
week, per month.
    (ii) Expenses means basic subsistence expenses, including current 
expenses for the following: rent/mortgage for primary residence; vehicle 
payment for one vehicle; food for veteran, veteran's spouse, and 
veteran's dependents; education for veteran, veteran's spouse, and

spouse (e.g., alimony, child-support); and including the average monthly 
expenses during the past year for the following: utilities and insurance 
for the primary residence; out-of-pocket medical care costs not 
otherwise covered by health insurance; health insurance premiums for the 
veteran, veteran's spouse, and veteran's dependents; and taxes paid on 
income and personal property.
    (iii) Fixed Assets means:

dependents (if the veteran does not have a spouse) if the veteran is 
receiving institutional extended care service.
    (3) A vehicle if the vehicle is:
    (i) The vehicle of the veteran and the veteran is receiving only 
noninstitutional extended care service; or
    (ii) The vehicle of the veteran's spouse or the veteran's dependents

401K's and other tax deferred annuities, bonds, mutual funds, retirement 
accounts (e.g., IRA, 401Ks, annuities), art, rare coins, stamp 
collections, and collectibles of the veteran, spouse, and dependents. 
This includes household and personal items (e.g., furniture, clothing, 
and jewelry) except when the veteran's spouse or dependents are living 
in the community.
    (v) Spousal allowance is an allowance of $20 per day that is 
included only if the spouse resides in the community (not 
institutionalized).
    (vi) Spousal resource protection amount means the value of liquid 
assets but not to exceed $89,280 if the spouse is residing in the 
community (not institutionalized).
    (vii) Veterans allowance is an allowance of $20 per day.
    (3) The maximum amount of a copayment for any month equals the 
copayment amount specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
multiplied by the number of days in the month. The copayment for any 
month may be less than the amount specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section if the veteran provides information in accordance with this 
section to establish that the copayment should be reduced or eliminated.
    (e) Requirement to submit information. (1) Unless exempted under 
paragraph (f) of this section, a veteran must submit to a VA medical 
facility a completed VA Form 10-10EC and documentation requested by the 
Form at the following times:

in provision of extended care services for more than 30 days; and
    (iii) Each year at the time of submission to VA of VA Form 10-10EZ.
    (2) When there are changes that might change the copayment 
obligation (i.e., changes regarding marital status, fixed assets, liquid 
assets, expenses, income (when received), or

[[Page 704]]

whether the veteran has a spouse or dependents residing in the 
community), the veteran must report those changes to a VA medical 
facility within 10 days of the change.
    (f) Veterans and care that are not subject to the copayment 
requirements. The following veterans and care are not subject to the 
copayment requirements of this section:
    (1) A veteran with a compensable service-connected disability;
    (2) A veteran whose annual income (determined under 38 U.S.C. 1503) 
is less than the amount in effect under 38 U.S.C. 1521(b);

<R05>
Sec. 17.112  Services or ceremonies on Department of Veterans Affairs hospital or center reservations.

    (a) Services or ceremonies on Department of Veterans Affairs 
hospital or center reservations are subject to the following 
limitations:
    (1) All activities must be conducted with proper decorum, and not 
interfere with the care and treatment of patients. Organizations must 
provide assurance that their members will obey all rules in effect at 
the hospital or center involved, and act in a dignified and proper 
manner;
    (2) Partisan activities are inappropriate and all activities must be 
nonpartisan in nature. An activity will be considered partisan and 
therefore inappropriate if it includes commentary in support of, or in 
opposition to, or attempts to influence, any current policy of the 
Government of the United States or any State of the United States. If 
the activity is closely related to partisan activities being conducted 
outside the hospital or center reservations, it will be considered 
partisan and therefore inappropriate.
    (b) Requests for permission to hold services or ceremonies will be 
addressed to the Secretary, or the Director of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs hospital or center involved. Such applications will 
describe the proposed activity in sufficient detail to enable a

Reimbursement or payment as provided in this paragraph will be made in a 
fair and reasonable amount, taking into consideration the condition and 
reasonable value of the article at the time it was damaged or destroyed.

                          Previously Authorized


<R05>
Sec. 17.120  Payment or reimbursement of the expenses of hospital care and other medical services not previously authorized.

    To the extent allowable, payment or reimbursement of the expenses of 
care, not previously authorized, in a private or public (or Federal) 
hospital not operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or of any 
medical services not previously authorized including transportation 
(except prosthetic appliances, similar devices, and repairs) may be paid 
on the basis of a claim timely filed, under the following circumstances:
    (a) For veterans with service connected disabilities. Care or 
services not previously authorized were rendered to a veteran in need of 
such care or services:
    (1) For an adjudicated service-connected disability;
    (2) For nonservice-connected disabilities associated with and held 
to be aggravating an adjudicated service-connected disability;
    (3) For any disability of a veteran who has a total disability 
permanent in nature resulting from a service-connected disability (does 
not apply outside of the States, Territories, and possessions of the 
United State, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico);

[[Page 710]]

    (4) For any illness, injury or dental condition in the case of a 
veteran who is participating in a rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. 
ch. 31 and who is medically determined to be in need of hospital care or 
medical services for any of the reasons enumerated in Sec. 17.48(j); 
and


(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1724, 1728)

    (b) In a medical emergency. Care and services not previously 
authorized were rendered in a medical emergency of such nature that 
delay would have been hazardous to life or health, and
    (c) When Federal facilities are unavailable. VA or other Federal 
facilities were not feasibly available, and an attempt to use them 
beforehand or obtain prior VA authorization for the services required 
would not have been reasonable, sound, wise, or practicable, or 
treatment had been or would have been refused.

    Claims for payment or reimbursement of the costs of emergency 
hospital care or medical services not previously authorized will not be 
approved for any period beyond the date on which the medical emergency 
ended. For the purpose of payment or reimbursement of the expense of 
emergency hospital care or medical services not previously authorized, 
an emergency shall be deemed to have ended at that point when a VA 
physician has determined that, based on sound medical judgment, a 
veteran:
    (a) Who received emergency hospital care could have been transferred 
from the non-VA facility to a VA medical center for continuation of 
treatment for the disability, or
    (b) Who received emergency medical services, could have reported to 
a VA medical center for continuation of treatment for the disability.

From that point on, no additional care in a non-VA facility will be 
approved for payment by VA.

the extent the costs were deemed reasonable and disallowed as to the 
remainder. In no circumstances will any claim for repairs be allowed to 
the extent the costs exceed $125.

                    Reconsideration of Denied Claims


<R05>
Sec. 17.133  Procedures.

    (a) Scope. This section sets forth reconsideration procedures 
regarding claims for benefits administered by the Veterans Health 
Administration (VHA). These procedures apply to claims for VHA benefits 
regarding decisions that are appealable to the Board of Veterans' 
Appeals (e.g., reimbursement for non-VA care not authorized in

[[Page 713]]

advance, reimbursement for beneficiary travel expenses, reimbursement 
for home improvements or structural alterations, etc.). These procedures 
do not apply when other regulations providing reconsideration procedures 
do apply (this includes CHAMPVA (38 CFR 17.270 through 17.278) and spina 
bifida (38 CFR 17.904) and any other regulations that contain 
reconsideration procedures). Also, these procedures do not apply to 
decisions made outside of VHA, such as decisions made by the Veterans 
Benefits Administration and adopted by VHA for decisionmaking. These 
procedures are not mandatory, and a claimant may choose to appeal the 
denied claim to the Board of Veterans' Appeals pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 
7105 without utilizing the provisions of this section. Submitting a 
request for reconsideration shall constitute a notice of disagreement 
for purposes of filing a timely notice of disagreement under 38 U.S.C. 
7105(b).
    (b) Process. An individual who disagrees with the initial decision 
denying the claim in whole or in part may obtain reconsideration under 
this section by submitting a reconsideration request in writing to the 
Director of the healthcare facility of jurisdiction within one year of 
the date of the initial decision. The reconsideration decision will be 
made by the immediate supervisor of the initial VA decision-maker. The 
request must state why it is concluded that the decision is in error and 
must include any new and relevant information not previously considered. 
Any request for reconsideration that does not identify the reason for 
the dispute will be returned to the sender without further 
consideration. The request for reconsideration may include a request for 
a meeting with the immediate supervisor of the initial VA decision-
maker, the claimant, and the claimant's representative (if the claimant 
wishes to have a representative present). Such a meeting shall only be 
for the purpose of discussing the issues and shall not include formal 
procedures (e.g., presentation, cross-examination of witnesses, etc.). 
The meeting will be taped and transcribed by VA if requested by the 
claimant and a copy of the transcription shall be provided to the 
claimant. After reviewing the matter, the immediate supervisor of the 
initial VA decision-maker shall issue a written decision that affirms, 
reverses, or modifies the initial decision.

    Note to Sec. 17.133: The final decision of the immediate supervisor 
of the initial VA decision-maker will inform the claimant of further 
appellate rights for an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

level. Such approval, however, will not be necessary in the case of any 
purchase order or individual authorization for which authority has been 
delegated in Sec. 17.99. All such contracts and agreements will be

automatic transmissions, power brakes, power steering and other 
automotive options.
    (c) For those items where specific Department of Veterans Affairs 
standards of safety and quality have not as yet been developed, or where 
such standards are otherwise provided as with custom-designed or factory 
option items, authorization of suitable adaptive equipment will not be 
delayed. Approval of such adaptive equipment, however, shall be subject

implicit standards of safety and quality adopted by the industry or as 
later developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Sec. 17.170  Autopsies.

    (a) Except as provided in this section, no autopsy will be performed 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs unless there is no known surviving 
spouse or known next of kin; or without the consent of the surviving 
spouse or, in a proper case, the next of kin, unless the patient or 
domiciled person was abandoned by the spouse, if any, or, if no spouse, 
by the next of kin for a period

[[Page 724]]

of not less than 6 months next preceding death. Where no inquiry has 
been made for or in regard to the decedent for a period of 6 months next 
preceding his death, he or she shall be deemed to have been abandoned.
    (b) If there is no known surviving spouse or known next of kin, or 
if the decedent shall have been abandoned or if the request is sent and 
the spouse or, in proper cases, the next of kin fails to reply within 
the reasonable time stated in such request of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs for permission to perform the autopsy, the Director is hereby 
authorized to cause an autopsy to be performed if in the Director's 
discretion he or she concludes that such autopsy is reasonably required 
for any necessary purpose of the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
including the completion of official records and advancement of medical 
knowledge.
    (c) If it is suspected that death resulted from crime and if the 
United States has jurisdiction over the area where the body is found, 
the Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs facility will inform 
the Office of Inspector General of the known facts concerning the death. 
Thereupon the Office of Inspector General will transmit all such 
information to the United States Attorney for such action as may be 
deemed appropriate and will inquire whether the United States Attorney 
objects to an autopsy if otherwise it be appropriate. If the United 
States Attorney has no objection, the procedure as to autopsy will be 
the same as if the death had not been reported to him or her.
    (d) If the United States does not have exclusive jurisdiction over 
the area where the body is found the local medical examiner/coroner will 
be informed. If the local medical examiner/coroner declines to assume 
jurisdiction the procedure will be the same as is provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section. If a Federal crime is indicated by the evidence, 
the procedure of paragraph (c) of this section will also be followed.
    (e) The laws of the decedent's domicile are determinative as to 
whether the spouse or the next of kin is the proper person to grant 
permission to perform an autopsy and of the question as to the order of 
preference among such persons. Usually the spouse is first entitled, 
except in some situations of separation; followed by children, parents, 
brothers and sisters, etc. When the next of kin as defined by the laws 
of decedent's domicile consists of a number of persons as children, 
parents, brothers and sisters, etc., permission to perform an autopsy 
may be accepted when granted by the person in the appropriate class who 
assumes the right and duty of burial.
    (f) The Director of a Department of Veterans Affairs facility is 
authorized to cause an autopsy to be performed on a veteran who dies 
outside of a Department of Veterans Affairs facility while undergoing 
post-hospital care under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1712 and 38 CFR 
17.93, if the Director determines such autopsy is reasonably required 
for any necessary purpose of the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
including the completion of official records and advancement of medical 
knowledge. Such authority also encompasses the furnishing of 
transportation of the body at Department of Veterans Affairs expense to 
the Department of Veterans Affairs facility and return of the body. 
Consent for the autopsy will be obtained as provided for in paragraph 
(e) of this section.

limitations determined by the Under Secretary for Health, provided:
    (a) The agreement will achieve one of the following purposes: (1) It 
will secure the use of a specialized medical resource which otherwise 
might not be feasibly available by providing for the mutual use or 
exchange of use of specialized medical resources when such an agreement 
will obviate the need for a similar resource to be installed or provided 
at a facility operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or

specialized medical resources by providing for the mutual use, or 
exchange of use, of specialized medical resources in a facility operated 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which have been justified on the 
basis of veterans' care, but which are not utilized to their maximum 
effective capacity; and
    (b) The agreement is determined to be in the best interest of the 
prevailing standards of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical 
Program; and

Sec. 17.241  Sharing medical information services.

    (a) Agreements for exchange of information. Subject to such terms 
and conditions as the Under Secretary for Health shall prescribe, 
Directors of Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, may enter 
into agreements with medical schools, Federal, State or local, public or 
private hospitals, research centers, and individual members of the 
medical profession, under which medical information and techniques will 
be freely exchanged and the medical information services of all parties 
to the agreement will be available for use by any party to the agreement 
under conditions specified in the agreement.
    (b) Purpose of sharing agreements. Agreements for the exchange of 
information shall be used to the maximum extent practicable to create at 
each Department of Veterans Affairs medical center which has entered 
into such an agreement, an environment of academic medicine which will 
help the hospital attract and retain highly trained and qualified 
members of the medical profession.
    (c) Use of electronic equipment. Recent developments in electronic 
equipment shall be utilized under information sharing programs to 
provide a close educational, scientific, and professional link between 
Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers and major medical 
centers.
    (d) Furnishing information services on a fee basis. The educational 
facilities and programs established at Department of Veterans Affairs 
Medical Centers and the electronic link to medical centers shall be made 
available for use by medical entities in the surrounding medical 
community which have not entered into sharing agreements with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, in order to bring about utilization of 
all medical information in the surrounding medical community, 
particularly in remote areas, and to foster and encourage the widest 
possible cooperation and consultation among all members of the medical 
profession in the surrounding medical community.
    (e) Establishing fees for information services. Subject to such 
terms and conditions as the Under Secretary for Health shall prescribe, 
Directors of Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers shall charge 
for information and educational facilities and services made available 
under paragraph (d) of this section. The fee may be on an annual or 
other periodic basis, at rates determined, after appropriate study, to 
be fair and equitable. The financial status of any user of such services 
shall be taken into consideration in establishing the amount of the fee 
to be paid.

Sec. 17.263  Suspension and termination procedures.

    Termination of a grant means the cancellation of Department of 
Veterans Affairs sponsorship, in whole or in part, under an agreement at 
any time prior to the date of completion. Suspension of a grant is an 
action by the Department of Veterans Affairs which temporarily suspends 
Department of Veterans Affairs sponsorship under the grant pending 
corrective action by the grantee or pending a decision to terminate the 
grant by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (a) Posttermination appeal. The following procedures are applicable 
for reviewing postaward disputes which may arise in the administration 
of or carrying out of the Exchange of Medical Information Grant Program.
    (1) Reviewable decisions. The Department of Veterans Affairs 
reserves the right to terminate any grant in whole or in part at any 
time before the date of completion, whenever it determines that the 
grantee has failed to comply with conditions of the agreement, or 
otherwise failed to comply with any law, regulation, assurance, term, or 
condition applicable to the grant.
    (2) Notice. The Department of Veterans Affairs shall promptly notify 
the

[[Page 732]]

grantee in writing of the determination. The notice shall set forth the 
reason for the determination in sufficient detail to enable the grantee 
to respond, and shall inform the grantee of his or her opportunity for 
review by the Assistant Chief Medical Director as provided in this 
section.
    (3) Request for appeal. A grantee with respect to whom a 
determination described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section has been 
made, and who desires review, may file with the Assistant Chief Medical 
Director for Academic Affairs an application for review of such 
determination. The grantee's application for review must be post-marked 
no later than 30 days after the postmarked date of notification provided 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) Contents of request. The application for review must clearly 
identify the question or questions in dispute, contain a full statement 
of the grantee's position in respect to such question or questions, and 
provide pertinent facts and reasons in support of his or her position. 
The Assistant Chief Medical Director for Academic Affairs will promptly 
send a copy of the grantee's application to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs official responsible for the determination which is to be 
reviewed.
    (5) Effect of submission. When an application for review has been 
filed no action may be taken by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
pursuant to such determination until such application has been disposed 
of, except that the filing of the application shall not affect the 
authority which the constituent agency may have to suspend the system 
under a grant during proceedings under this section or otherwise to 
withhold or defer payments under the grant.
    (6) Consideration of request. When an application for review has 
been filed with the Assistant Chief Medical Director for Academic 
Affairs, and it has been determined that the application meets the 
requirements stated in this paragraph, all background material of the 
issues shall be reviewed. If the application does not meet the 
requirements, the grantee shall be notified of the deficiencies.
    (7) Presentation of case. If the Assistant Chief Medical Director 
for Academic Affairs believes there is no dispute as to material fact, 
the resolution of which would be materially assisted by oral testimony, 
both parties shall be notified of the issues to be considered, and take 
steps to afford both parties the opportunity for presenting their cases, 
at the option of the Assistant Chief Medical Director for Academic 
Affairs, in whole or in part in writing, or in an informal conference. 
Where it is concluded that oral testimony is required to resolve a 
dispute over a material fact, both parties shall be afforded an 
opportunity to present and cross-examine witnesses at a hearing.
    (8) Decision. After both parties have presented their cases, the 
Assistant Chief Medical Director for Academic Affairs shall prepare an 
initial written decision which shall include findings of fact and 
conclusions based thereon. Copies of the decision shall be mailed 
promptly to each of the parties together with a notice informing them of 
their right to appeal the decision of the Secretary, or to the officer 
or employee to whom the Secretary has delegated such authority, by 
submitting written comments thereon within a specified reasonable time.
    (9) Final decision. Upon filing comments with the Secretary, or 
designated officer or employee, the review of the initial decision shall 
be conducted on the basis of the decision, the hearing record, if any, 
and written comments submitted by both parties. The decision shall be 
final.
    (10) Participation by a party. Either party may participate in 
person, or by counsel pursuant to the procedure set forth in this 
section.
    (b) Termination for convenience. The Department of Veterans Affairs 
or the grantee may terminate a grant in whole or in part when both 
parties agree that the continuation of the project would not produce 
beneficial results commensurate with the further expenditure of funds. 
The two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including 
the effective date and, in the case of partial terminations, the portion 
to be terminated. The grantee shall not incur new obligations for the 
terminated portion after

[[Page 733]]

the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as 
possible. The Department of Veterans Affairs shall allow full credit to 
the grantee for the Department of Veterans Affairs share of the 
noncancellable obligations, properly incurred by the grantee prior to 
termination.
    (c) Suspension procedures. When a grantee has failed to comply with 
the terms of the grant agreement and conditions or standards, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs may, on reasonable notice to the grantee, 
suspend the grant and withhold further payments, prohibit the grantee 
from incurring additional obligations of funds, pending corrective 
action by the grantee, or make a decision to terminate as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The Department of Veterans Affairs shall 
allow all necessary and proper costs that the grantee could not 
reasonably avoid during the period of suspension provided that they meet 
the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles.

Sec. 17.264  Recoupments and releases.

    In any case where the Department of Veterans Affairs or a grantee's 
obligations under an exchange of information agreement implemented by 
grant funds are terminated, or where grant-financed equipment or 
facilities cease to be used for the purposes for which grant support was 
given, or when grant-financed property is transferred, the grantee shall 
return the proportionate value of such equipment or facility as was 
financed by the grant. When it is determined the Department of Veterans 
Affairs equitable interest is greater that proportionate value, then a 
claim in such greater amount shall be asserted. If it is determined an 
amount less than proportionate value or less than the Department of 
Veterans Affairs equitable interest should be recouped, or that the 
Department of Veterans Affairs should execute any releases, then a 
proposal concerning such a settlement or releases complete with 
explanations and justifications shall be submitted to the Assistant 
Chief Medical Director for Academic Affairs for a final determination.

<R05>
Sec. 17.265  Payments.

    Payments of grant funds are made to grantees through a letter-of-
credit, an advance by Treasury check, or a reimbursement by Treasury 
check, as appropriate. A letter-of-credit is an instrument certified by 
an authorized official of the Department of Veterans Affairs which 
authorizes the grantee to draw funds when needed from the Treasury, 
through a Federal Reserve bank and the grantee's commercial bank and 
shall be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs where all the 
following conditions exist:
    (a) When there is or will be a continuing relationship between the 
grantee and the Department of Veterans Affairs for at least a 12-month 
period and the total amount of advance payments expected to be received 
within that period is $250,000, or more;
    (b) When the grantee has established or demonstrated the willingness 
and ability to maintain procedures that will minimize the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds and their disbursement by the grantee; and
    (c) When the grantee's financial management meets the standards for 
fund control and accountability. An advance by Treasury check is a 
payment made to a grantee upon its request before outlays are made by 
the grantee, or through use of predetermined payment schedules and shall 
be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs when the grantee meets all 
of the above requirements of this section except that advances will be 
less than $250,000, or for a period less than 12 months. Reimbursement 
by Treasury check is a payment made to a grantee upon request for 
reimbursement from the grantee and shall be the preferred method when 
the grantee does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section. This method may be used on any construction agreement, or 
if the major portion of the program is accomplished through private 
market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance 
constitutes a minor portion

[[Page 734]]

of the program. When the reimbursement method is used, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the 
billing, unless billing is improper. Unless otherwise required by law, 
payments shall not be withheld for proper charges at any time during the 
grant period unless a grantee has failed to comply with the program 
objectives, award conditions, or Federal reporting requirements; or the 
grantee is indebted.

patentable inventions or discoveries, the United States Government shall 
have the right to use such publications or inventions on a royalty-free 
basis.

Sec. 17.272  Benefits limitations/exclusions.

    (a) Benefits cover allowable expenses for medical services and 
supplies that are medically necessary and appropriate for the treatment 
of a condition and that are not specifically excluded from program 
coverage. Covered benefits may have limitations. The fact that a 
physician may prescribe, order, recommend, or approve a service or 
supply does not, of itself, make it medically necessary or make the 
charge an allowable expense, even though it is not listed specifically 
as an exclusion. The following are specifically excluded from program 
coverage:
    (1) Services, procedures or supplies for which the beneficiary has 
no legal obligation to pay, or for which no charge would be made in the 
absence of coverage under a health benefits plan.

    (3) Services and supplies that are paid directly or indirectly by a

including admission of emotionally disturbed children and adolescents to

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1713)


<R05>
Sec. 17.274  Cost sharing.

    (a) With the exception of services obtained through VA facilities, 
CHAMPVA is a cost-sharing program in which the cost of covered services 
is shared with the beneficiary. CHAMPVA pays the CHAMPVA-determined 
allowable amount less the deductible, if applicable, and less the 
beneficiary cost share.
    (b) In addition to the beneficiary cost share, an annual (calendar 
year) outpatient deductible requirement ($50 per beneficiary or $100 per 
family) must be satisfied prior to the payment of outpatient benefits. 
There is no deductible requirement for inpatient services or for 
services provided through VA facilities.
    (c) To provide financial protection against the impact of a long-
term illness or injury, a calendar year cost limit or ``catastrophic 
cap'' has been placed on the beneficiary cost-share amount for covered 
services and supplies. Credits to the annual catastrophic cap are 
limited to the applied annual deductible(s) and the beneficiary cost-
share amount. Costs above the CHAMPVA-allowable amount, as well as costs 
associated with non-covered services are not credited to the 
catastrophic cap computation. After a family has paid the maximum cost-
share and deductible amounts for a calendar year, CHAMPVA will pay 
allowable amounts for the remaining covered services through the end of 
that calendar year.
    (i) Through December 31, 2001, the annual cap on cost sharing is 
$7,500 per CHAMPVA-eligible family.
    (ii) Effective January 1, 2002, the cap on cost sharing is $3,000 
per CHAMPVA-eligible family.
    (d) If the CHAMPVA benefit payment is under $1.00, payment will not 
be

[[Page 741]]

issued. Catastrophic cap and deductible will, however, be credited.

Sec. 17.275  Claim filing deadline.

    (a) Unless an exception is granted under paragraph (b) of this 
section, claims for medical services and supplies must be filed with the 
Center no later than:
    (1) One year after the date of service; or
    (2) In the case of inpatient care, one year after the date of 
discharge; or
    (3) In the case of retroactive approval for medical services/
supplies, 180 days following beneficiary notification of authorization; 
or
    (4) In the case of retroactive approval of CHAMPVA eligibility, 180 
days following notification to the beneficiary of authorization for 
services occurring on or after the date of first eligibility.
    (b) Requests for an exception to the claim filing deadline must be 
submitted, in writing, to the Center and include a complete explanation 
of the circumstances resulting in late filing along with all available 
supporting documentation. Each request for an exception to the claim 
filing deadline will be reviewed individually and considered on its own 
merit. The Center Director may grant exceptions to the requirements in 
paragraph (a) if he or she determines that there was good cause for 
missing the filing deadline. For example, when dual coverage exists 
CHAMPVA payment, if any, cannot be determined until after the primary 
insurance carrier has adjudicated the claim. In such circumstances an 
exception may be granted provided that the delay on the part of the 
primary insurance carrier is not attributable to the beneficiary. Delays 
due to provider billing procedures do not constitute a valid basis for 
an exception.


<R05>
Sec. 17.276  Appeal/review process.

    Notice of the initial determination regarding payment of CHAMPVA 
benefits will be provided to the beneficiary on a CHAMPVA Explanation of 
Benefits (EOB) form. The EOB form is generated by the CHAMPVA automated 
payment processing system. If a beneficiary disagrees with the 
determination concerning covered services or calculation of benefits, he 
or she may request reconsideration. Such requests must be submitted to 
the Center in writing within one year of the date of the initial 
determination. The request must state why the beneficiary believes the 
decision is in error and must include any new and relevant information 
not previously considered. Any request for reconsideration that does not 
identify the reason for dispute will be returned to the claimant without 
further consideration. After reviewing the claim and any relevant 
supporting documentation, a CHAMPVA benefits advisor will issue a 
written determination to the beneficiary that affirms, reverses or 
modifies the previous decision. If the beneficiary is still 
dissatisfied, within 90 days of the date of the decision he or she may 
make a written request for review by the Center Director. The Director 
will review the claim, and any relevant supporting documentation, and 
issue a decision in writing that affirms, reverses or modifies the 
previous decision. The decision of the Director with respect to benefit 
coverage and computation of benefits is final.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1713)

    Note to Sec. 17.276: Denial of CHAMPVA benefits based on legal 
eligibility requirements may be appealed to the Board of Veterans' 
Appeals in accordance with 38 CFR part 20. Medical determinations are 
not appealable to the Board. 20 CFR 20.101.

    The Center will actively pursue third-party liability/medical care 
cost recovery in accordance with applicable law.

such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. Among such 
terms and conditions to which the grants will be subject, will be 
advance approval by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs of equipment 
purchases, maintenance or repair projects. The awarding of such grants 
is further subject to the limitations on available funds in Sec.

Sec. 17.352  Amounts and use of grant funds for the replacement and upgrading of equipment.

    Grants awarded under Sec. 17.351 shall not exceed the amounts 
provided by the appropriation acts of the Congress of the United States 
for the purpose. Funds appropriated for the upgrading and replacement of 
equipment at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, or for rehabilitating 
its equipment, shall remain available in consecutive fiscal years until 
expanded, but in no event shall exceed the amount of $500,000 per year. 
It is not intended that such funds will be utilized to expand the 
medical center facilities. Upgrading of equipment, however, would permit 
purchase of new and additional equipment not now possessed by the 
medical center.

    Upon request of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, 
payment for medical and nursing home services provided to eligible 
United States veterans may consist in whole or in part, of available 
medicines, medical supplies, or equipment furnished by the Department of

Sec. 17.364  Eligibility determinations.

    Determinations of legal eligibility and medical need for 
hospitalization of United States veterans for treatment rest exclusively 
with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Determinations as 
to various factors upon which eligibility may depend shall be made as 
follows:
    (a) Determinations of service connection. For the purpose of meeting 
any requirement in 38 U.S.C. 1724 and 1732, and 38 CFR 17.36 through 
17.37 for service-connected disability, the United States Department of 
Veterans Affairs shall determine that under laws it administers the 
disability in question was incurred in or aggravated by service, and
    (b) Determinations of valid service. For the purpose of determining 
the necessary prerequisite service, determinations by the Department of 
Defense of the United States as to military service shall be accepted. 
In those cases in which the United States Department of Veterans Affairs 
shall have information which it deems reliable and in conflict with the 
information upon which the Department of Defense determination was made, 
the conflicting information shall be referred to the Department of 
Defense for reconsideration and redetermination. Such determinations and 
redeterminations as to military service shall be conclusive.

shall make determinations as to whether any patient should be admitted 
in emergency circumstances before the U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs has made a legal determination of eligibility, except that 
liability for payment will not accrue to the United States until such 
eligibility determination has been made. Eligibility determinations will 
be given effect retroactively to the date of admission when the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs has been notified by telephone, telegram, 
letter, or other communication of the emergency admission within 72 
hours of the hour of admission. The Clinic Director of the VA Regional 
Office, Manila, may make an exception to the 72-hour limitation when it 
is determined that the delay in notification was fully justified. When 
any authorization cannot be made effective retroactively to the date of 
admission, it shall be effective from the date of receipt of 
notification.

     Confidentiality of Healthcare Quality Assurance Review Records

    Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5705.

    Source: 59 FR 53355, Oct. 24, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 17.500  General.

    (a) Section 5705, title 38, United States Code was enacted to 
protect the integrity of the VA's medical quality assurance program by 
making confidential and privileged certain records and documents 
generated by this program and information contained therein. Disclosure 
of quality assurance records and documents made confidential and 
privileged by 38 U.S.C. 5705 and the regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 
through 17.511 may only be made in accordance with the provisions of 38 
U.S.C. 5705 and those regulations.
    (b) The purpose of the regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 
17.511 is to specify and provide for the limited disclosure of those 
quality assurance documents which are confidential under the provisions 
of 38 U.S.C. 5705.
    (c) For purposes of the regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 
17.511, the VA's medical quality assurance program consists of 
systematic healthcare reviews carried out by or for VA for the purpose 
of improving the quality of medical care or improving the utilization of 
healthcare resources in VA medical facilities. These review activities 
may involve continuous or periodic data collection and may relate to 
either the structure, process, or outcome of health care provided in the 
VA.
    (d) Nothing in the regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 17.511 
shall be construed as authority to withhold any record or document from 
a committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress or any joint 
committee or subcommittee of Congress, if such record or document 
pertains to any matter within the jurisdiction of such committee or 
joint committee.
    (e) The regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 17.511 do not waive 
the sovereign immunity of the United States, and do not waive the 
confidentiality provisions and disclosure restrictions of 38 U.S.C. 
5705.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5705)


<R05>
Sec. 17.501  Confidential and privileged documents.

    (a) Documents and parts of documents are considered confidential and 
privileged if they were produced by or for the VA in the process of 
conducting systematic healthcare reviews for the purpose of improving 
the quality of health care or improving the utilization of healthcare 
resources in VA healthcare facilities and meet the criteria in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The four classes of healthcare 
quality assurance reviews with examples are:
    (1) Monitoring and evaluation reviews conducted by a facility:
    (i) Medical records reviews,
    (ii) Drug usage evaluations,
    (iii) Blood usage reviews,
    (iv) Surgical case/invasive procedure reviews,
    (v) Service and program monitoring including monitoring performed by 
individual services or programs, several

[[Page 745]]

services or programs working together, or individuals from several 
services or programs working together as a team,
    (vi) Mortality and morbidity reviews,
    (vii) Infection control review and surveillance,
    (viii) Occurrence screening,
    (ix) Tort claims peer reviews (except reviews performed to satisfy 
the requirements of a governmental body or a professional health care 
organization which is licensing practitioners or monitoring their 
professional performance),
    (x) Admission and continued stay reviews,
    (xi) Diagnostic studies utilization reviews,
    (xii) Reports of special incidents (VA Form 10-2633 or similar 
forms) and follow-up documents unless developed during or as a result of 
a Board of Investigation;
    (2) Focused reviews which address specific issues or incidents and 
which are designated by the reviewing office at the outset of the review 
as protected by 38 U.S.C. 5705 and the regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 
through 17.511; focused reviews may be either:
    (i) Facility focused reviews;
    (ii) VA Central Office or Regional focused reviews;
    (3) VA Central Office or Regional general oversight reviews to 
assess facility compliance with VA program requirements if the reviews 
are designated by the reviewing office at the outset of the review as 
protected by 38 U.S.C. 5705 and the regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 
through 17.511; and
    (4) Contracted external reviews of care, specifically designated in 
the contract or agreement as reviews protected by 38 U.S.C. 5705 and the 
regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 17.511.
    (b) The Under Secretary for Health, Regional Director or facility 
Director will describe in advance in writing those quality assurance 
activities included under the classes of healthcare quality assurance 
reviews listed in paragraph (a) of this section. Only documents and 
parts of documents resulting from those activities which have been so 
described are protected by 38 U.S.C. 5705 and the regulations in 
Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 17.511. If an activity is not described in a 
VA Central Office or Regional policy document, this requirement may be 
satisfied at the facility level by description in advance of the 
activity and its designation as protected in the facility quality 
assurance plan or other policy document.
    (c) Documents and parts of documents generated by activities which 
meet the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be 
confidential and privileged only if they:
    (1) Identify, either implicitly or explicitly, individual 
practitioners, patients, or reviewers except as provided in paragraph 
(g)(6) of this section; or
    (2) Contain discussions relating to the quality of VA medical care 
or utilization of VA medical resources by healthcare evaluators during 
the course of a review of quality assurance information or data, even if 
they do not identify practitioners, patients, or reviewers; or
    (3) Are individual committee, service, or study team minutes, notes, 
reports, memoranda, or other documents either produced by healthcare 
evaluators in deliberating on the findings of healthcare reviews, or 
prepared for purposes of discussion or consideration by healthcare 
evaluators during a quality assurance review; or
    (4) Are memoranda, letters, or other documents from the medical 
facility to the Regional Director or VA Central Office which contain 
information generated by a quality assurance activity meeting the

    (5) Are memoranda, letters, or other documents produced by the 
Regional Director or VA Central Office which either respond to or 
contain information generated by a quality assurance activity meeting 
the criteria in Sec. 17.501 (a) and (b).
    (d) Documents which meet the criteria in this section are 
confidential and privileged whether they are produced at the medical 
facility, Regional or VA Central Office levels, or by external 
contractors performing healthcare quality assurance reviews.
    (e) Documents which are confidential and privileged may be in 
written, computer, electronic, photographic or any other form.
    (f) Documents which contain confidential and privileged material in 
one

[[Page 746]]

part, but not in others, such as Clinical Executive Board minutes, 
should be filed and maintained as if the entire document was protected 
by 38 U.S.C. 5705. This is not required if the confidential and 
privileged material is deleted.
    (g) The following records and documents and parts of records and 
documents are not confidential even if they meet the criteria in 
paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section:
    (1) Statistical information regarding VA healthcare programs or 
activities that does not implicitly or explicitly identify individual VA 
patients or VA employees or individuals involved in the quality 
assurance process;
    (2) Summary documents or records which only identify study topics, 
the period of time covered by the study, criteria, norms, and/or major 
overall findings, but which do not identify individual healthcare 
practitioners, even by implication;
    (3) The contents of Credentialing and Privileging folders as 
described in VACO policy documents (38 U.S.C. 5705-protected records 
shall not be filed in Credentialing and Privileging folders);
    (4) Records and documents developed during or as a result of Boards 
of Investigations;
    (5) Completed patient satisfaction survey questionnaires and 
findings from patient satisfaction surveys;
    (6) Records and documents which only indicate the number of patients 
treated by a practitioner, either by diagnosis or in aggregate, or 
number of procedures performed by a practitioner, either by procedure or 
in aggregate;
    (7) Records and documents developed during or as a result of reviews 
performed to satisfy the requirements of a governmental body or a 
professional healthcare organization which is licensing practitioners or 
monitoring their professional performance, e.g., National Practitioner 
Data Bank, Federation of State Medical Boards, and National Council of 
State Boards of Nursing;
    (8) Documents and reports developed during or as a result of site 
visits by the Office of the Medical Inspector except to the extent that 
the documents and reports contain information that meets the criteria 
described in this section and are produced by or for VA by other than 
the Office of Medical Inspector;
    (9) External reviews conducted by VA Central Office or a Region 
other than those designated by the reviewing office under paragraph 
(a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section as protected by 38 U.S.C. 5705 and the 
regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 17.511;
    (10) Documents and reports of Professional Standards Boards, 
Credentialing Committees, Executive Committees of Medical Staff, and 
similar bodies, insofar as the documents relate to the credentialing and 
privileging of practitioners;

occupational health monitoring;
    (13) Documents and reports developed during or as a result of safety 
monitoring not directly related to the care of specified individual 
patients;
    (14) Documents and reports developed during or as a result of 
resource management activities not directly related to the care of 
specified individual patients; and
    (15) Information and records derived from patient medical records or 
facility administrative records, which are not protected by 38 U.S.C. 
5705 and the regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 17.511, may be 
sent or communicated to a third party payor who has asked for this 
information in response to a VA request for reimbursement based on 
Public Law 99-272 and Public Law 101-508. Reviews conducted at the 
request of the third party payor do not generate records protected by 38 
U.S.C. 5705 and the regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 17.511 
since the reviews are not undertaken as part of the VA's quality 
assurance program.

not confidential and privileged under 38 U.S.C. 5705 and the 
confidentiality regulations in Sec. Sec. 17.500 through 17.511 will be 
governed by the provisions of the

[[Page 747]]

Freedom of Information Act, and, if applicable, the Privacy Act and any 
other VA or federal confidentiality statutes.
    (b) When included in a quality assurance review, confidential 
records protected by other confidentiality statutes such as 5 U.S.C. 
552a (the Privacy Act), 38 U.S.C. 7332 (drug and alcohol abuse, sickle 
cell anemia, HIV infection), and 38 U.S.C. 5701 (veterans' names and 
addresses) retain whatever confidentiality protection they have under 
these laws and applicable regulations and will be handled accordingly. 
To the extent that information protected by 38 U.S.C. 5701 or 7332 or 
the Privacy Act is incorporated into quality assurance records, the 
information in the quality assurance records is still protected by these 
statutes.

7613(b).
    (4) In the case of a part-time student who is a part-time employee, 
the maximum stipend, if more than a nominal stipend is paid, will be

    (7) A participant's eligibility for a stipend ends at the close of 
the month in which degree requirements are met.
    (b) Leave-of-absence, repeated course work. The Secretary may 
suspend scholarship payments to or on behalf of a participant if the

course work for which the Secretary previously has made payments under 
the Scholarship Program. Additional costs relating to the repeated 
course work will not be paid under this program. Any scholarship 
payments suspended under this section will be resumed by the Secretary 
upon notification by the school that the participant has returned from 
the leave-of-absense or has satisfactorily completed the repeated course 
work and is proceeding as a full-time student in the course of study for 
which the scholarship was awarded.

health care provider or agent for the health care provider may not 
impose any additional charge for any services for which payment is made 
by VA.
    (d) Explanation of benefits (EOB)--(1) When a claim under the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 17.900 through 17.905 is adjudicated, an EOB

provides, at a minimum, the following information:
    (i) Name and address of recipient,
    (ii) Description of services and/or supplies provided,
    (iii) Dates of services or supplies provided,
    (iv) Amount billed,

Sec. 17.904  Review and appeal process.

    For purposes of Sec. Sec. 17.900 through 17.905, if a health care 
provider, child, or representative disagrees with a determination 
concerning provision of health care or with a determination concerning 
payment, the person or entity may request reconsideration. Such request 
must be submitted in writing (by facsimile, mail, or hand delivery) 
within one year of the date of the initial determination to the Health 
Administration Center (Attention: Chief, Benefit and Provider Services). 
The request must state why it is believed that the decision is in error 
and must include any new and relevant information not previously 
considered. Any request for reconsideration that does not identify the 
reason for dispute will be returned to the sender without further 
consideration. After reviewing the matter, including any relevant 
supporting documentation, a benefits advisor will issue a written 
determination (with a statement of findings and reasons) to the person 
or entity seeking reconsideration that affirms, reverses, or modifies 
the previous decision. If the person or entity seeking reconsideration 
is still dissatisfied, within 90 days of the date of the decision he or 
she may submit in writing (by facsimile, mail, or hand delivery) to the 
Health Administration Center (Attention: Director) a request for review 
by the Director, Health Administration Center. The Director will review 
the claim and any relevant supporting documentation and issue a decision 
in writing (with a statement of findings and reasons) that affirms, 
reverses, or modifies the previous decision. An appeal under this 
section would be considered as filed at the time it was delivered to the 
VA or at the time it was released for submission to the VA (for example, 
this could be evidenced by the postmark, if mailed).


[[Page 764]]


    Note to Sec. 17.904: The final decision of the Director will inform 
the claimant of further appellate rights for an appeal to the Board of 
Veterans' Appeals.

Sec. 17.905  Medical records.

    Copies of medical records generated outside VA that relate to 
activities for which VA is asked to provide payment or that VA 
determines are necessary to adjudicate claims under Sec. Sec. 17.900 
through 17.905 must be provided to VA at no cost.

Payment or Reimbursement for Emergency Services for Nonservice-Connected 
                     Conditions in Non-VA Facilities

    Source: 66 FR 36470, July 12, 2001, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 17.1000  Payment or reimbursement for emergency services for nonservice-connected conditions in non-VA facilities.

    Sections 17.1000 through 17.1008 constitute the requirements under 
38 U.S.C. 1725 that govern VA payment or reimbursement for non-VA 
emergency services furnished to a veteran for nonservice-connected 
conditions.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1725)

    Note to Sec. 17.1000: In cases where a patient is admitted for 
inpatient care, health care providers furnishing emergency treatment who 
believe they may have a basis for filing a claim with VA for payment 
under 38 U.S.C. 1725 should contact VA within 48-hours after admission 
for emergency treatment. Such contact is not a condition of VA payment. 
However, the contact will assist the provider in understanding the 
conditions for payment. The contact may also assist the provider in 
planning for transfer of the veteran after stabilization.

    (4) A workers' compensation law or plan described in section 38 
U.S.C. 1729(a)(2)(A); or
    (5) A law of a State or political subdivision described in 38 U.S.C. 
1729(a)(2)(B) (concerning motor vehicle accidents).

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1725)


<R05>
Sec. 17.1002  Substantive conditions for payment or reimbursement.

    Payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. 1725 for emergency services 
may

[[Page 765]]

be made only if all of the following conditions are met:
    (a) The emergency services were provided in a hospital emergency 
department or a similar facility held out as providing emergency care to 
the public;
    (b) The claim for payment or reimbursement for the initial 
evaluation and treatment is for a condition of such a nature that a 
prudent layperson would have reasonably expected that delay in seeking 
immediate medical attention would have been hazardous to life or health 
(this standard would be met if there were an emergency medical condition 
manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including 
severe pain) that a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge 
of health and medicine could reasonably expect the absence of immediate 
medical attention to result in placing the health of the individual in 
serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious 
dysfunction of any bodily organ or part);
    (c) A VA or other Federal facility/provider was not feasibly 
available and an attempt to use them beforehand would not have been 
considered reasonable by a prudent layperson (as an example, these 
conditions would be met by evidence establishing that a veteran was 
brought to a hospital in an ambulance and the ambulance personnel 
determined that the nearest available appropriate level of care was at a 
non-VA medical center);
    (d) The claim for payment or reimbursement for any medical care 
beyond the initial emergency evaluation and treatment is for a continued 
medical emergency of such a nature that the veteran could not have been 
safely discharged or transferred to a VA or other Federal facility (the 
medical emergency lasts only until the time the veteran becomes 
stabilized);
    (e) At the time the emergency treatment was furnished, the veteran 
was enrolled in the VA health care system and had received medical 
services under authority of 38 U.S.C. chapter 17 within the 24-month 
period preceding the furnishing of such emergency treatment;
    (f) The veteran is financially liable to the provider of emergency 
treatment for that treatment;
    (g) The veteran has no coverage under a health-plan contract for 
payment or reimbursement, in whole or in part, for the emergency 
treatment (this condition cannot be met if the veteran has coverage 
under a health-plan contract but payment is barred because of a failure 
by the veteran or the provider to comply with the provisions of that 
health-plan contract, e.g., failure to submit a bill or medical records 
within specified time limits, or failure to exhaust appeals of the 
denial of payment);
    (h) If the condition for which the emergency treatment was furnished 
was caused by an accident or work-related injury, the claimant has 
exhausted without success all claims and remedies reasonably available 
to the veteran or provider against a third party for payment of such 
treatment; and the veteran has no contractual or legal recourse against 
a third party that could reasonably be pursued for the purpose of 
extinguishing, in whole or in part, the veteran's liability to the 
provider; and
    (i) The veteran is not eligible for reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. 
1728 for the emergency treatment provided (38 U.S.C. 1728 authorizes VA 
payment or reimbursement for emergency treatment to a limited group of 
veterans, primarily those who receive emergency treatment for a service-
connected disability).

Sec. 17.1003  Emergency transportation.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 17.1002, payment or 
reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. 1725 for ambulance services, including air 
ambulance services, may be made for transporting a veteran to a facility 
only if the following conditions are met:
    (a) Payment or reimbursement is authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1725 for 
emergency treatment provided at such facility (or payment or 
reimbursement could have been authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1725 for 
emergency treatment if

[[Page 766]]

death had not occurred before emergency treatment could be provided);
    (b) The veteran is financially liable to the provider of the 
emergency transportation;
    (c) The veteran has no coverage under a health-plan contract for 
reimbursement or payment, in whole or in part, for the emergency 
transportation or any emergency treatment authorized under 38 U.S.C. 
1728 (this condition is not met if the veteran has coverage under a 
health-plan contract but payment is barred because of a failure by the 
veteran or the provider to comply with the provisions of that health-
plan contract); and
    (d) If the condition for which the emergency transportation was 
furnished was caused by an accident or work-related injury, the claimant 
has exhausted without success all claims and remedies reasonably 
available to the veteran or provider against a third party for payment 
of such transportation; and the veteran has no contractual or legal 
recourse against a third party that could reasonably be pursued for the 
purpose of extinguishing, in whole or in part, the veteran's liability 
to the provider.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1725)


<R05>
Sec. 17.1004  Filing claims.

    (a) A claimant for payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. 1725 
must be the entity that furnished the treatment, the veteran who paid 
for the treatment, or the person or organization that paid for such 
treatment on behalf of the veteran.
    (b) To obtain payment or reimbursement for emergency treatment under 
38 U.S.C. 1725, a claimant must submit to the VA medical facility of 
jurisdiction a completed standard billing form (such as a UB92 or a HCFA 
1500). Where the form used does not contain a false claims notice, the 
completed form must also be accompanied by a signed, written statement 
declaring that ``I hereby certify that this claim meets all of the 
conditions for payment by VA for emergency medical services under 38 CFR 
17.1002 (except for paragraph (e)) and 17.1003. I am aware that 38 
U.S.C. 6102(b) provides that one who obtains payment without being 
entitled to it and with intent to defraud the United States shall be 
fined in accordance with title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not 
more than one year, or both.''

    Note to Sec. 17.1004(b): These regulations regarding payment or 
reimbursement for emergency services for nonservice-connected conditions 
in non-VA facilities also can be found on the internet at http://
www.va.gov/health/elig.

    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
no specific form is required for a claimant (or duly authorized 
representative) to claim payment or reimbursement for emergency 
transportation charges under 38 U.S.C. 1725. The claimant need only 
submit a signed and dated request for such payment or reimbursement to 
the VA medical facility of jurisdiction, together with a bill showing 
the services provided and charges for which the veteran is personally 
liable and a signed statement explaining who requested such 
transportation services and why they were necessary.
    (d) To receive payment or reimbursement for emergency services, a 
claimant must file a claim within 90 days after the latest of the 
following:
    (1) July 19, 2001.
    (2) The date that the veteran was discharged from the facility that 
furnished the emergency treatment;
    (3) The date of death, but only if the death occurred during 
transportation to a facility for emergency treatment or if the death 
occurred during the stay in the facility that included the provision of 
the emergency treatment; or
    (4) The date the veteran finally exhausted, without success, action 
to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party.
    (e) If after reviewing a claim the decisionmaker determines that 
additional information is needed to make a determination regarding the 
claim, such official will contact the claimant in writing and request 
additional information. The additional information must be submitted to 
the decisionmaker within 30 days of receipt of the request or the claim 
will be treated as abandoned, except that if the claimant within the 30-
day period requests in writing additional time, the time period for 
submission of the information

[[Page 767]]

may be extended as reasonably necessary for the requested information to 
be obtained.

<R05>
Sec. 17.1005  Payment limitations.

    (a) Payment or reimbursement for emergency treatment under 38 U.S.C. 
1725 shall be the lesser of the amount for which the veteran is 
personally liable or 70 percent of the amount under the applicable 
Medicare fee schedule for such treatment.
    (b) Reimbursement or payment for emergency treatment may be made 
only for the period from the beginning of the initial evaluation 
treatment until such time as the veteran could be safely discharged or 
transferred to a VA facility or other Federal facility. For purposes of 
payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. 1725, VA deems it safe for the 
veteran to be transferred once the veteran has become stabilized.

<R05>
Sec. 17.1006  Decisionmakers.

    The Chief of the Health Administration Service or an equivalent 
official at the VA medical facility of jurisdiction will make all 
determinations regarding payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. 1725, 
except that the Fee Service Review Physician or equivalent officer at 
the VA medical facility of jurisdiction will make determinations 
regarding Sec. 17.1002(b), (c), and (d). Any decision denying a benefit 
must be in writing and inform the claimant of VA reconsideration and 
appeal rights.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1725)


<R05>
Sec. 17.1007  Independent right of recovery.

    (a) VA has the right to recover its payment under this section when, 
and to the extent that, a third party makes payment for all or part of 
the same emergency treatment for which VA reimbursed or made payment 
under this section.
    (1) Under 38 U.S.C. 1725(d)(4), the veteran (or the veteran's 
personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) or 
claimant shall ensure that the Secretary is promptly notified of any 
payment received from any third party for emergency treatment furnished 
to the veteran. The veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, 
successor, dependents, or survivors) or claimant shall immediately 
forward all documents relating to such payment, cooperate with the 
Secretary in the investigation of such payment and assist the Secretary 
in enforcing the United States' right to recover any payment made and 
accepted under this section. The required notification and submission of 
documentation must be provided by the veteran or claimant to the VA 
medical facility of jurisdiction within three working days of receipt of 
notice of the duplicate payment.
    (2) If the Chief Financial Officer or equivalent official at the VA 
medical facility of jurisdiction concludes that payment from a third 
party was made for all or part of the same emergency treatment for which 
VA reimbursed or made payment under this section, such VA official 
shall, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, initiate 
action to collect or recover the amount of the duplicate payment in the 
same manner as for any other debt owed the United States.
    (b)(1) Any amount paid by the United States to the veteran (or the 
veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) 
or to any other person or organization paying for such treatment shall 
constitute a lien in favor of the United States against any recovery the 
payee subsequently receives from a third party for the same treatment.
    (2) Any amount paid by the United States, and accepted by the 
provider that furnished the veteran's emergency treatment, shall 
constitute a lien against any subsequent amount the provider receives 
from a third party for the same emergency treatment for which the United 
States made payment.
    (c) If it is determined that a duplicate payment was made, the Chief 
Financial Officer or equivalent official at the VA medical facility of 
jurisdiction may waive recovery of a VA payment made under this section 
to a veteran

[[Page 768]]

upon determining that the veteran has substantially complied with the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that actions to 
recover the payment would not be cost-effective or would conflict with 
other litigative interests of the United States.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1725)


<R05>
Sec. 17.1008  Balance billing prohibited.

    Payment by VA under 38 U.S.C. 1725 on behalf of a veteran to a 
provider of emergency treatment shall, unless rejected and refunded by 
the provider within 30 days of receipt, extinguish all liability on the 
part of the veteran for that emergency treatment. Neither the absence of 
a contract or agreement between VA and the provider nor any provision of 
a contract, agreement, or assignment to the contrary shall operate to 
modify, limit, or negate this requirement.
