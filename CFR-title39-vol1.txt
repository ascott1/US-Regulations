              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2011), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 1.1  Establishment of the U.S. Postal Service.

    The U.S. Postal Service is established under the provisions of the 
Postal Reorganization Act (the Reorganization Act) of 1970, Public Law 
91-375, 84 Stat. 719, as amended by the Postal Accountability and 
Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), Public Law 109-435, 120 Stat. 3198, as 
an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government 
of the United States, under the direction of a Board of Governors, with 
the Postmaster General as its chief executive officer. The Board of 
Governors of the Postal Service (the Board) directs the exercise of its 
powers through management that is expected to be honest, efficient, 
economical, and mindful of the competitive business environment in which 
the Postal Service operates. The Board consists of nine Governors 
appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate, to represent the public interest generally, together with the 
Postmaster General and Deputy Postmaster General.


<R05>
Sec. 1.2  Delegation of authority.

    Except for powers, duties, or obligations specifically vested in the 
Governors by law, the Board may delegate its authority to the Postmaster 
General under such terms, conditions, and limitations, including the 
power of redelegation, as it finds desirable. The bylaws of the Board 
are the framework of the system through which the Board monitors the 
exercise of the authority it has delegated, measures progress toward the 
goals it has set, and shapes the policies to guide the future 
development of the Postal Service. Delegations of authority do not 
relieve the Board of full responsibility for carrying out its duties and 
functions, and are revocable by the Governors in their exclusive 
judgment.

<R05>
Sec. 6.1  Regular meetings, annual meeting.

    The Board shall meet regularly on a schedule established by the 
Board. The first regular meeting of each calendar year is designated as 
the annual meeting. Consistent with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 6.6 and 
7.5 of these bylaws, the time or place of a regular or annual meeting 
may be varied by recorded vote, with the earliest practicable notice to 
the Secretary. The Secretary shall distribute to the members an agenda 
setting forth the proposed subject matter for any regular or annual 
meeting in advance of the meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 6.2  Special meetings.

    Consistent with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 6.6 and 7.5 of these 
bylaws, the Chairman may call a special meeting of the Board at any 
place in the United States, with the earliest practicable notice to the 
other members of the Board and to the Secretary, specifying the time, 
date, place, and subject matter of the meeting. Consistent with the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 6.6 and 7.5 of these bylaws, by recorded vote a 
majority of the members of the Board may call a special meeting of the 
Board at any place in the United States, with the earliest practicable 
notice to the other members of the Board and to the Secretary, 
specifying the time, date, place and subject matter of the meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 6.3  Notice of meetings.

    The Chairman or the members of the Board may give the notice 
required under Sec. 6.1 or Sec. 6.2 of these bylaws in oral, written, 
or e-mail form. Oral notice to a member may be delivered by telephone 
and is sufficient if made to the member personally or to a responsible 
person in the member's home or office. Any oral notice to a member must 
be subsequently confirmed by written or e-mail notice. Written notice to 
a member may be delivered by mail addressed to the member's mailing 
address of record filed with the Secretary. Notice by e-mail may be 
addressed to the member's e-mail address of record filed with the 
Secretary. Except for written or e-mail notice confirming a previous 
oral notice, a written or e-mail notice must be sent in sufficient time 
to reach the address of

[[Page 17]]

record at least 2 days before the meeting date under normal delivery 
conditions. A member waives notice of any meeting by attending the 
meeting, and may otherwise waive notice of any meeting at any time. No 
notice--whether oral, written, or e-mail--to the Secretary is sufficient 
until actually received by the Secretary. The Secretary may not waive 
notice of any meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 6.4  Attendance by conference telephone call.

    For regularly scheduled meetings of the Board, members are expected 
to attend in person. Unless prohibited by law or by these bylaws, 
however, a member of the Board, under exceptional circumstances, may 
participate in a meeting of the Board by conference telephone or similar 
communications equipment which enables all persons participating in the 
meeting to hear each other and which permits full compliance with the 
provisions of these bylaws concerning public observation of meetings. 
Attendance at a meeting by this method constitutes presence at the 
meeting and a member of the Board may be paid for his or her 
participation provided such meeting addresses substantive, as opposed to 
procedural or administrative, matters on which the Board has 
decisionmaking authority.


<R05>
Sec. 6.5  Minutes of meetings.

    The Secretary shall preserve the minutes of Board meetings prepared 
under Sec. 4.6 of these bylaws. After the minutes of any meeting are

the public, in the Corporate Communications Department at Postal Service 
Headquarters, or in another place easily accessible to the public, 
copies of the minutes, except for those portions which contain 
information inappropriate for public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) or 
39 U.S.C. 410(c).


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 7.1  Definitions.

    For purposes of Sec. Sec. 7.2 through 7.8 of these bylaws:
    (a) The term Board means the Board of Governors, and any subdivision 
or committee of the Board authorized to take action on behalf of the 
Board.
    (b) The term meeting means the deliberations of at least the number 
of individual members required to take action on behalf of the Board 
under Sec. 5.2 or Sec. 6.6 of these bylaws, where such deliberations 
determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of the official 
business of the Board. The term ``meeting'' does not include any 
procedural deliberations required or permitted by Sec. Sec. 6.1, 6.2, 
7.4, or 7.5 of these bylaws.


<R05>
Sec. 7.2  Open meetings.

    (a) It is the policy of the United States, established in section 2 
of the Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law 94-409, 90 Stat. 1241, 
that the public is entitled to the fullest practicable information 
regarding the decisionmaking processes of the Federal Government. The 
Postal Service is charged to provide the public with this information 
while protecting the rights of individuals and the ability of the 
Government to carry out its responsibilities. Accordingly, except as 
specifically permitted by statute, every portion of every meeting of the 
Board of Governors is open to public observation.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 7.3 of these bylaws, every portion 
of every meeting of the Board is open to public observation. Members of 
the Board may not jointly conduct or dispose of business of the Board 
without complying with Sec. Sec. 7.2 through 7.8 of these bylaws. 
Members of the public may obtain access to documents considered at 
meetings to the extent provided in the regulations of the Postal Service 
concerning the release of information.
    (c) Without the permission of a majority of the Board, no person may 
participate in, film, televise, or broadcast any portion of any meeting 
of the Board. Any person may electronically record or photograph a 
meeting, as long as that action does not tend to impede or disturb the 
members of the Board in the performance of their duties, or members of 
the public while attempting to attend or observe a meeting of the Board. 
The rules and penalties of 39 CFR Part 232, concerning conduct on postal 
property, apply with regard to meetings of the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 7.3  Exceptions.

    Section 7.2 of these bylaws does not apply to a portion of a 
meeting, and Sec. Sec. 7.4 and 7.5 do not apply to information 
concerning the meeting which otherwise would be required to be disclosed 
to the public, if the Board properly determines that the public interest 
does not require otherwise, and that such portion of the meeting or the 
disclosure of such information is likely to:
    (a) Disclose matters that are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense 
or foreign policy, and
    (2) In fact properly classified under that Executive order;
    (b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Postal Service, including the Postal Service position in 
negotiations or consultations with employee organizations.
    (c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552), 
provided that the statute:
    (1) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or
    (2) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or

[[Page 19]]

confidential, such as market information pertinent to Postal Service 
borrowing or investments, technical or patent information related to 
postal mechanization, or commercial information related to purchases of 
real estate;
    (e) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring 
any person;
    (f) Disclose information of a personal nature, such as personal or 
medical data regarding any individual if disclosure would constitute a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, or information which if written would be contained in those 
records, but only to the extent that the production of those records or 
information would:
    (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
    (2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication,
    (3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
    (4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case 
of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source,
    (5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
    (6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel;
    (h) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, 
operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the 
use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of 
financial institutions;
    (i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely significantly to frustrate implementation of a proposed action of 
the Board, such as information relating to the negotiation of a labor 
contract or proposed Postal Service procurement activity, except that 
this provision does not apply in any instance where:
    (1) The Postal Service has already disclosed to the public the 
content or nature of the proposed action, or
    (2) The Postal Service is required by law to make such disclosure on 
its own initiative before taking final action on the proposal; or
    (j) Specifically concern the issuance of a subpoena by the Postal 
Service, or the participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or 
proceeding, such as a postal rate or classification proceeding, an 
action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, 
or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Postal Service of a 
particular case of formal adjudication under the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 
554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after 
opportunity for a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 7.4  Procedure for closing a meeting.

    (a) A majority of the entire membership of the Board may vote to 
close a portion of a meeting or to withhold information concerning a 
meeting under the provisions of Sec. 7.3 of these bylaws. The members 
shall take a separate vote with respect to each meeting a portion of 
which is proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any 
information which is proposed to be withheld, and shall make every 
reasonable effort to take any such vote at least 8 days before the date 
of the meeting involved. The members may take a single vote with respect 
to a series of meetings, portions of which are proposed to be closed to 
the public, or with respect to information concerning the series, so 
long as each portion of a meeting in the series involves the same 
particular matters, and no portion of any meeting is scheduled to be 
held more than 30 days after the initial portion of the first meeting in 
the series.
    (b) Whenever any person whose interest may be directly affected by a 
portion of a meeting requests that the Board close that portion to the 
public for any of the reasons referred to in Sec. 7.3(e), (f), or (g) 
of these bylaws, upon request of any one of its members the Board shall 
vote by recorded vote whether to close that portion of the meeting.
    (c) The Secretary shall record the vote of each member participating 
in a vote under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. Within 1 day of 
any vote under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the

[[Page 20]]

Secretary shall make publicly available a written copy of the vote 
showing the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a 
meeting is to be closed to the public, the Secretary shall, within 1 day 
of the vote, make publicly available a full written explanation of the 
action closing the portion, together with a list of all persons expected 
to attend the meeting and their affiliation.


<R05>
Sec. 7.5  Public notice of meetings, subsequent changes.

    (a) At least one week before any meeting of the Board, the Secretary 
shall publicly announce the time, date, place, and subject matter of the 
meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to the public, and the name 
and phone number of the official designated by the Board to respond to 
requests for information about the meeting.
    (b) By a recorded vote, a majority of the members of the Board may 
determine that the business of the Board requires a meeting to be called 
with less than a week's notice. At the earliest practicable time, the 
Secretary shall publicly announce the time, date, place, and subject 
matter of the meeting, and whether it is to be open or closed to the 
public.
    (c) Following the public announcement required by paragraphs (a) or 
(b) of this section:
    (1) As provided in Sec. 6.1 of these bylaws, the Board may change 
the time or place of a meeting. At the earliest practicable time, the 
Secretary shall publicly announce the change.
    (2) A majority of the entire membership of the Board may change the 
subject matter of a meeting, or the determination to open or close a 
meeting to the public, if it determines by a recorded vote that the 
change is required by the business of the Board and that no earlier 
announcement of the change was possible. At the earliest practicable 
time, the Secretary shall publicly announce the change, and the vote of 
each member upon the change.
    (d) Immediately following each public announcement required under 
paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the Secretary shall submit 
for publication in the Federal Register a notice of the time, date, 
place, and subject matter of the meeting, whether the meeting is open or 
closed, any change in the preceding, and the name and phone number of 
the official designated by the Board to respond to requests for 
information about the meeting. The Secretary shall also submit the 
announcement and information to the Corporate Communications Department 
for dissemination to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 7.6  Certification and transcripts of closed meetings.

    (a) At the beginning of every meeting or portion of a meeting closed 
under Sec. 7.3(a) through (j) of these bylaws, the General Counsel 
shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting or 
portion of the meeting may be closed to the public, stating each 
relevant exemptive provision. The Secretary shall retain this 
certification, together with a statement from the officer presiding at 
the meeting which sets forth the time and place of the meeting, and the 
persons present.
    (b) The Secretary shall arrange for a complete transcript or 
electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings to be made 
of each meeting or portion of a meeting of the Board which is closed to 
the public. The Secretary shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the 
transcript, or a complete electronic recording of each meeting or 
portion of a meeting closed to the public for at least 2 years after the 
meeting, or for 1 year after the conclusion of any Postal Service 
proceeding with respect to which the meeting was held, whichever occurs 
later.
    (c) Except for those items of discussion or testimony which the 
Board, by a majority vote of those members who are present, determines 
to contain information which may be withheld under Sec. 7.3 of these 
bylaws, the Secretary shall promptly make available to the public, in 
the Corporate Communications Department at Postal Service Headquarters, 
or in another place easily accessible to the public, the transcript or 
electronic recording of a closed meeting, including the testimony of any 
witnesses received at the meeting. The Secretary shall furnish a copy of 
this transcript, or a transcription of this electronic recording

cost of duplication or transcription.


<R05>
Sec. 7.7  Enforcement.

    (a) Under 5 U.S.C. 552b(g), any person may bring a proceeding in the 
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to set aside 
any provisions of these bylaws which are not in accord with the 
requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552b (a)-(f) and to require the promulgation of 
provisions that are in accord with those requirements.
    (b) Under 5 U.S.C. 552b(h) any person may bring a civil action 
against the Board in an appropriate U.S. District Court to obtain 
judicial review of the alleged failure of the Board to comply with 5 
U.S.C. 552b(a)-(f). The burden is on the Board to sustain its action. 
The court may grant appropriate equitable relief, including enjoining 
future violations, or ordering the Board to make public information 
improperly withheld from the public.
    (c) Under 5 U.S.C. 552b(i) the court may assess against any party 
reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred 
by any other party who substantially prevails, except that the court may 
assess costs against the plaintiff only if the court finds that he 
initiated the suit primarily for frivolous or dilatory purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 7.8  Open meetings, Freedom of Information, and Privacy of Information.

    The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) (1)-(10), enacted by Public Law

request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, to copy or

the individual may otherwise have access under 5 U.S.C. 552a, enacted by

    Governors are subject to the restrictions on the post-employment 
activities of special Government employees imposed by 18 U.S.C. 207. 
Guidance concerning post-employment restrictions applicable to Governors 
may be obtained in accordance with section 10.2(b).


<R05>
Sec. 10.4  Financial disclosure reports.

    (a) Requirement of submission of reports. At the time of their 
nomination, Governors complete a financial disclosure report which, 
under the practice of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, is kept 
confidential. Because the Director of the Office of Government Ethics 
has ruled that Governors who do not perform the duties of their office 
for more than 60 days in any calendar year are not required to file 
financial disclosure reports that are open to the public, Governors file 
non-public reports annually, in accordance with this section. A Governor 
who performs the duties of his or her office for more than 60 days in a 
particular calendar year is required to file a public report in 
accordance with 5 CFR 2634.204(c).
    (b) Person with whom reports should be filed and time for filing. 
(1) A Governor shall file a financial disclosure report with the General 
Counsel on or before May 15 of each year when the Governor has been in 
office for more than 60 consecutive calendar days during the previous 
year.
    (2) The General Counsel may, for good cause shown, grant to a 
Governor an extension of up to 45 days. An additional extension of up to 
45 days may be granted by the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics for good cause shown.
    (c) Information required to be reported. Each report shall be a full 
and complete statement, on the form prescribed by the General Counsel 
and the Office of Government Ethics and in accordance with instructions 
issued by him or her. The form currently in use is Standard Form 278.
    (d) Reviewing reports. (1) Financial disclosure reports filed in 
accordance with the provisions of this section shall, within 60 days 
after the date of filing, be reviewed by the General Counsel who shall 
either approve the report, or make an initial determination that a 
conflict or appearance thereof exists. If the General Counsel determines 
initially that a conflict or the appearance of a conflict exists, he or 
she shall inform the Governor of his determination.
    (2) If the General Counsel considers that additional information is 
needed to complete the report or to allow an adequate review to be 
conducted, he or she shall request the reporting Governor to furnish 
that information by a specified date.
    (3) The General Counsel shall refer to the Chairman of the Board of 
Governors or the Vice Chairman the name of any Governor he or she has 
reasonable cause to believe has wrongfully failed to file a report or 
has falsified or wrongfully failed to report required information.
    (e) Custody of and public access to reports. (1) Retention of 
reports. Each report filed with the General Counsel shall be retained by 
him or her for a period of six years. After the six-year period, the 
report shall be destroyed unless needed in connection with an 
investigation then pending.
    (2) Confidentiality of reports. Unless a public report is required 
by this section, the financial disclosure reports filed by Governors 
shall not be made public.

if sufficient customer need exists [the destination SCF receives at 
least 1.5 percent of the total annual First-Class Mail volume 
originating from the origin Processing & Distribution Center/Facility 
(OPDC/F)], and if operational and transportation feasibility permit.
    (b) A 2-day service standard is established for all domestic First-
Class Mail pieces properly accepted before the day-zero Critical Entry 
Time at origin if a 1-day service standard is not required, and if the 
origin PDC/F to Area Distribution Center surface transportation drive 
time is 12 hours or less, unless the origin and destination are within

separately in the territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands; or if the mail is intra-SCF and originating from or destinating 
to one of the following 3-digit ZIP Code areas in Alaska or designated 
portions thereof: 995 (5-digit ZIP Code areas 99540 through 99591), 996, 
997, 998, and 999.
    (c) A 3-day service standard is established for all remaining 
domestic First-Class Mail pieces properly accepted before the day-zero 
Critical Entry Time at origin, if neither a 1-day nor a 2-day service 
standard is required and
    (1) Both the origin SCF and the delivery address are within the 
contiguous 48 states;

dealing with and applicable to postal officers and employees immediately 
prior to the commencement of operations of the Postal Service continue

any agency other than the Postal Service or Post Office Department shall 
be deemed to require such action by the Postal Service, unless by 
agreement with the Postal Service the other agency involved consents to 
the continuation of its action.
    (d) Effect of Collective Bargaining on Certain Regulations. All 
rules and regulations continued or established by paragraphs (a) through 
(c) of this section which establish fringe benefits as defined in title 
39, U.S.C. 1005(f) of employees for whom there is a collective 
bargaining representative continue to apply until modified by a 
collective bargaining agreement concluded pursuant to the Postal

and conditions of employment encompassed by section 8(d) of the National 
Labor Relations Act, as amended, shall continue to apply to such 
employees until such collective bargaining agreement has been concluded, 
and, unless specifically continued by such agreement, shall apply 
thereafter until modified or repealed by the Postal Service pursuant to 
its authority under title 39, U.S.C. 1001(e) and other pertinent

occurs which shall excuse the Postal Service from continuing 
negotiations prior to the parties thereto concluding an agreement in 
accordance with the Postal Reorganization Act, the Postal Service 
reserves the right in accordance with the reorganization measures 
mandated by the Congress and consistent with the provisions of the Act, 
and any collective bargaining agreements in existence at that time, 
insofar as they do not unduly impede such reorganization measures, to 
continue, discontinue, or revise all compensation, benefits, and terms 
and conditions of employment of such employees of the Postal Service.

duties.
    (c) Authority to function as notaries public. (1) Postmasters in 
Alaska have the authority to administer oaths and affirmations, take 
acknowledgments and make and execute certificates thereof, and perform 
all other functions of a notary public within Alaska when a 
certification is necessary to meet any Act of Congress or the 
Legislature of Alaska. No fees may be charged for notarial services.
    (2) An officer or employee who is a notary public shall not charge

regulations under which it is made and contain such specific limiting 
conditions as may be appropriate.
    (e) Further delegation. Authority may be further delegated unless 
prohibited by law, a regulation that expressly prohibits further 
delegation, or terms of the delegation.

regulations in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 230.19  What criteria will the authorizing official use to determine whether to authorize testimony or production of documents?

    (1) Statutory restrictions, as well as any legal objection, 
exemption, or privilege that may apply;
    (2) Relevant legal standards for disclosure of nonpublic information 
and documents;
    (3) Office of Inspector General rules and regulations;

    (b) Permission to testify or to release documents in all cases will 
be limited to matters outlined in the affidavit or declaration described 
in section 230.24 of this part or to such matters as deemed appropriate 
by the authorizing official. If the authorizing official allows the 
release of documents or testimony to be given by an employee, 
arrangements shall be made for the taking of testimony or receipt of 
documents by the method least disruptive to the employee's official 
duties. Testimony may, for example, be provided by affidavits, answers 
to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed, 
recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law.

[[Page 46]]

    (c) Upon issuance of an unfavorable final determination by the 
authorizing official, the party or the party's counsel seeking testimony 
or documents may consult or negotiate with the authorizing official to 
refine and limit the demand.
    (d) The Office of Inspector General will offer all possible 
assistance to the courts, but the question of disclosing information for 
which an exemption may be claimed is a matter of discretion that rests 
with the authorizing official. If in the opinion of the authorizing 
official the documents should not be released or testimony should not be 
furnished, that determination will be final.


<R05>
Sec. 230.20  What records will not be released?

    Generally, any record demanded by a subpoena duces tecum or 
appropriate court order can be released by a properly authorized Office 
of Inspector General employee, except for the following:
    (a) Records required to remain confidential by the Freedom of 
Information Act, the Privacy Act, and parts 230 and 262 of this chapter,
    (b) Records containing information relating to an employee's 
security or loyalty;
    (c) Original records;
    (d) Office of Inspector General criminal investigative reports,

    (e) The Office of Inspector General Manual and other operating 
instructions issued to Office of Inspector General employees, unless 
there is specific authorization by an authorizing official, after 
consultation with the General Counsel to the Inspector General. If the 
requested information relates to confidential investigative techniques, 
confidential sources of information, or information that must be kept 
confidential under the Inspector General Act, 5 U.S.C. app. 3, because 
release of the information would adversely affect the duties and 
obligations or law enforcement mission of the Office of Inspector 
General, the subpoenaed official, through the Inspector General, or an 
authorizing official, may request an in camera, ex parte conference to 
determine the necessity for the release of the information.


<R05>
Sec. 230.21  May the General Counsel to the Inspector General and/or a U.S. Department of Justice attorney represent the employee in any appearance?

General may also request assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice 
in representing and assisting the employee in any appearance.


<R05>
Sec. 230.22  May another employee be substituted for the employee requested to appear?

another Office of Inspector General employee to respond to a request for

    No, an Office of Inspector General employee may not testify as an 
expert or opinion witness with regard to any matter arising out of the 
employee's duties or functions at the Office of Inspector General for 
any party other than the United States, except that in extraordinary 
circumstances, and where the anticipated testimony will not be adverse 
to the interest of the United States, the authorizing official may 
approve such testimony in private litigation. A litigant must first 
obtain the permission of an authorizing official designated by the 
Inspector General before designating an Office of Inspector General 
employee as an expert or opinion witness.


<R05>
Sec. 230.24  How is a demand for employee documents or testimony made to the Office of Inspector General?

    (a) All demands for the production of nonpublic documents or 
testimony of Office of Inspector General employees concerning matters 
relating to their official duties and subject to the conditions set 
forth in Sec. 230.10(b) shall be

necessary for defending or prosecuting the case at issue.

<R05>
Sec. 230.25  Who pays the costs incurred when the Office of Inspector General responds to a demand for documents or testimony?

    (a) Unless determined by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statute, 
the costs of providing testimony, including the cost of transcripts,

discretion of the Chief Postal Inspector or his delegate and the 
submission of information or a claim for a reward shall not establish a 
contractual right to receive any reward. The reward shall not exceed 
one-half of the amount collected by the Postal Service as a result of 
civil or criminal proceedings to recover losses or penalties as a result 
of false or fraudulent claims or statements submitted to the Postal 
Service. Postal employees assigned to the Postal Inspection Service or 
the Law Department are not eligible to receive a reward under this 
section for information obtained while so employed. The Chief Inspector 
may establish such procedures and forms as may be desirable to give 
effect to this section including procedures to protect the identity of 
persons claiming rewards under this section.

mail cover order issued by the Chief Postal Inspector or designee, or as 
directed by a postal inspector under the circumstances described in 
Sec. 233.3(f).
    (5) Except for mail covers ordered upon fugitives or subjects 
engaged, or suspected to be engaged, in any activity against the 
national security, no mail cover order shall remain in effect for more 
than 30 days, unless adequate justification is provided by the 
requesting authority. At the expiration of the mail cover order period, 
or prior thereto, the requesting authority may be granted additional 30-

original request. The requesting authority must provide a statement of 
the investigative benefit of the mail cover and anticipated benefits to

the matter for which the mail cover is requested. If the subject is 
under investigation for further criminal violations, or a mail cover is

be deemed within the custody of the Chief Postal Inspector. However, the 
physical storage of this data shall be at the discretion of the Chief 
Postal Inspector.
    (2) If the Chief Postal Inspector, or his designee, determines a 
mail cover was improperly ordered, all data acquired while the cover was

duly ordered, authorization may be delegated to any employee in the 
Postal Inspection Service to transmit mail cover reports directly to the 
requesting authority.
    (j) Review. (1) The Chief Postal Inspector, or his designee at 
Inspection Service Headquarters shall periodically review mail cover 
orders issued by the Manager, Inspection Service Operations Support

Sec. 233.4  Withdrawal of mail privileges.

    (a) False representation and lottery orders--(1) Issuance. Pursuant 
to 39 U.S.C. 3005, the Judicial Officer of the Postal Service, acting 
upon a satisfactory evidentiary basis, may issue a mail-stop order 
against anyone seeking mailed remittance of money or property by means 
of a false-representation or lottery scheme. Such orders provide for 
return of mail and refund of postal money orders to remitters.
    (2) Enforcement. Notice of these orders, including any necessary 
instructions on enforcement responsibilities and procedures, is 
published in the Postal Bulletin. Generally, an order against a domestic 
enterprise is enforced only by the post office designated in the order.

orders against foreign enterprises by forwarding mail addressed to such 
enterprises to designated post offices.
    (b) Fictitious name or address and not residents of the place of 
address orders--(1) Issuance. Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3003, 3004, when 
there is satisfactory evidence that mail is addressed to a fictitious 
name, title, or address used for any unlawful business, and no one has 
established a right to have the mail delivered to him, or that mail is 
addressed to places not the residence or regular business address of the 
person for whom they are intended to enable the person to escape 
identification, the Judicial Officer may, pursuant to Part 964, order 
that the mail be returned to the sender.
    (2) Notice. (i) The Chief Postal Inspector or his delegate must give 
notice to

[[Page 58]]

the addressee of mail withheld from delivery pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3003, 
3004 that such action has been taken and advise him that he may:
    (A) Obtain such mail upon presenting proof of his identity and right 
to receive such mail, or
    (B) Petition the Judicial Officer for the return of such mail. (ii) 
The notice must be in writing and served by personal service upon the 
addressee or by Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested) and by First 
Class Mail.
    (3) Enforcement. Notice of any order issued pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 
3003, 3004, and any necessary implementing instructions, are published 
in the Postal Bulletin.

<R05>
Sec. 233.7  Forfeiture authority and procedures.

    (a) Designation of officials having forfeiture authority. The Chief 
Postal Inspector is authorized to perform all duties and 
responsibilities necessary on behalf of the Postal Service and the 
Office of Inspector General to enforce 18 U.S.C. 981, 2254, and 21 
U.S.C. 881, to delegate all or any part of this authority to Deputy 
Chief Inspectors, Inspectors in Charge, and Inspectors of the Postal 
Inspection Service, and to issue such instructions as may be necessary 
to carry out this authority.
    (b) Administrative forfeiture authority. The Chief Postal Inspector 
is authorized to conduct administrative forfeitures under the statutes 
identified in paragraph (a) of this section, following, where 
applicable, the procedures provided by the customs laws of the United 
States (19 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.), and to pay valid liens and mortgages 
against property that has been so forfeited.
    (c) Inventory. An inventory of all property seized for forfeiture 
under the statutes identified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
prepared and maintained by the Postal Inspection Service. The inventory 
should occur within seven days of the seizure. The inventory must, at a 
minimum, identify all property seized, state the exact location of the 
property at the time of its seizure, and describe in detail the 
condition of the property. A written receipt containing such information 
and identifying the Postal Inspector who conducted the seizure must be 
provided

[[Page 60]]

to the party from whom the property was seized, or the party's agent or 
representative, at the time of the seizure or as soon thereafter as is 
practicable.
    (d) Custody. Custody of all property seized for forfeiture under the 
statutes identified in paragraph (a) of this section is maintained by 
the U.S. Marshals Service, except property held for evidentiary 
purposes; retained for official use upon forfeiture; subject to 
equitable transfer to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies; 
or subject to civil administrative forfeiture.
    (e) Appraisal. The Postal Inspection Service must promptly obtain or 
complete an appraisal of all seized property. The appraisal value is the 
fair market value of the property, which is the highest price, in terms 
of money, which a property will bring in a competitive and open market.
    (f) Quick-release. Property subject to administrative forfeiture 
may, prior to forfeiture, be released by the Postal Inspection Service 
to the owner of the property having an immediate right to possession of 
the property when the Postal Inspection Service concludes that release 
of the property is in the best interest of justice. An agreement to hold 
harmless the United States, the Postal Inspection Service, and all other 
involved entities should be obtained from the owner. A decision for 
quick release of the property should be made within five days of the 
seizure.
    (g) Judicial forfeiture. If the appraised value of property seized 
exceeds $500,000, with the exception of: (1) Monetary instruments within 
the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(3), or (2) any conveyance which was 
used to import, export, transport, or store any controlled substance or 
if a claim and satisfactory bond have been received for property 
appraised at $500,000 or less, or for any monetary instruments within 
the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(3) or any conveyance which was used to 
import, export, transport, or store any controlled substance the Postal 
Inspection Service must transmit the claim and bond to the U.S. Attorney 
for the judicial district in which the seizure was made and request that 
the U.S. Attorney promptly institute a judicial forfeiture proceeding 
against the property. The Postal Inspection Service must provide the 
U.S. Attorney a complete written description of the property, a 
statement of the facts and circumstances leading to the seizure of the 
property, including all facts and documentation leading to the 
conclusion that the seized property is subject to forfeiture, and such 
additional information as the U.S. Attorney may require for the purpose 
of instituting a judicial forfeiture action.
    (h) Notice of seizure for property having a value of $500,000 or 
less, or for monetary instruments or for conveyances which were used to 
transport or store any controlled substance; advertisement; declaration 
of forfeiture. (1) The Postal Inspection Service must cause written 
notice of the seizure of all property subject to civil administrative 
forfeiture to be sent to each known party that may have a possessory or 
ownership interest in the seized property. The notice must describe the 
property seized; state the date, place, and cause for seizure; and 
inform the party of the intent of the Postal Inspection Service to 
forfeit the property. In addition, the notice must state that any person 
desiring a judicial determination of forfeiture must file a claim and 
bond (see paragraph 2 of this subsection) with a designated official of 
the Postal Inspection Service, within twenty days from the date of the 
first publication of the notice of seizure (see paragraph (4) of this 
subsection), or of the date of the letter of personal notice required by 
this paragraph, whichever is later. Any claim submitted pursuant to this 
paragraph is invalid unless accompanied by a bond meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (2), or a completed PS Form 1518, Petition to 
Proceed in Forma Pauperis.
    (2) A bond in the amount of $5,000 or ten percent of the value of 
the claimed property, whichever is lower, but in no event less than 
$250, must accompany any claim submitted pursuant to paragraph (1). The 
bond may be in the form of a cashier's check, certified check, or money 
order made payable to the United States of America, or satisfactory 
sureties. If a claimant is financially unable to post the bond because 
of indigency, such a person may request a waiver of the bond by 
completion of PS Form 1518, Petition to Proceed in Forma Pauperis.

[[Page 61]]

    (3) Upon receipt of the claim and bond, the Postal Inspection 
Service must, upon determining that the documents are in proper form and 
the sureties satisfactory, transmit the documents to the appropriate 
U.S. Attorney as provided in subsection (g). If the documents are not 
satisfactory, the Postal Inspection Service must notify the party making 
the claim and may allow a reasonable time for correction. If correction 
is not made within the time allowed for that purpose, the administrative 
forfeiture must proceed as though the claim and bond had not been 
tendered.
    (4) Notice of administrative forfeiture proceedings containing the 
information required by subsection (h)(1) must be published once each 
week for at least three successive weeks in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the judicial district in which the property was seized. 
If a claim and satisfactory bond is not filed within the time allowed, 
the Postal Inspection Service may declare the property forfeited.
    (i) Disposition of forfeited property. (1) Whenever property is 
forfeited administratively, the Postal Inspection Service may:
    (i) Retain the property for official use;
    (ii) Transfer ownership of the property to any federal, state or 
local law enforcement agency that participated in the investigation 
leading to the forfeiture;
    (iii) Sell any property which is not required to be destroyed by law 
and which is not harmful to the public;
    (iv) Destroy the property; or
    (v) Dispose of the property as otherwise permitted by law.
    (2) If the laws of a state in which an article of forfeited property 
is located prohibit the sale or possession of such property or if the 
Postal Service and the Marshals Service are of the opinion that it would 
be more advantageous to sell the forfeited property in another district, 
the property may be moved to and sold in such other district.
    (3) If, after an administrative forfeiture of property is completed, 
it appears that the proceeds of sale will not be sufficient to pay the 
costs of sale or the proceeds will be insignificant in relation to the 
expenses involved in the forfeiture, then the Postal Service or the 
Marshals Service may order destruction or other disposition of the 
property including alteration of the property into an article that is 
not prohibited.
    (j) Remission or mitigation of administrative, civil, and criminal 
forfeitures--(1) Authority, purpose, and scope--(i) Purpose. This 
section sets forth the procedures for Postal Inspection Service 
officials to follow when considering remission or mitigation of 
administrative forfeitures under the jurisdiction of the Postal Service. 
The purpose of these regulations is to provide a basis for ameliorating 
the effects of forfeiture through the partial or total remission of 
forfeiture for individuals who have an interest in the forfeited 
property but who did not participate in, or have knowledge of, the 
conduct that resulted in the property being subject to forfeiture and, 
where required, took all reasonable steps under the circumstances to 
ensure that such property would not be used, acquired, or disposed of 
contrary to law. Additionally, these regulations provide for partial or 
total mitigation of the forfeiture and imposition of alternative 
conditions in appropriate circumstances.
    (ii) Authority to grant remission and mitigation. (A) Remission and 
mitigation functions in administrative forfeitures are performed by the 
agency seizing the property. Within the Postal Inspection Service, 
authority to grant remission and mitigation is delegated to the 
Independent Counsel, Office of the Chief Inspector, Washington, DC.
    (B) Remission and mitigation functions in judicial cases are within 
the jurisdiction of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. 
Within the Criminal Division, authority to grant remission and 
mitigation has been delegated to the Chief, Asset Forfeiture and Money 
Laundering Section.
    (C) The powers and responsibilities within these regulations may be 
redelegated to attorneys or managers working under the supervision of 
the designated officials.
    (D) The time periods and internal requirements established in these 
regulations are designed to guide the orderly administration of the 
remission and

[[Page 62]]

mitigation process and are not intended to create rights or entitlements 
in favor of individuals seeking remission or mitigation. These 
regulations will apply to all decisions on petitions for remission or 
mitigation made on or after July 1, 1997. These regulations will apply 
to decisions on requests for reconsideration of a denial of a petition 
under paragraphs (j)(3)(x) and (3)(xi) of this section only if the 
initial decision on the petition was made under the provisions of this 
part effective July 1, 1997.
    (E) This section governs any petition for remission or mitigation 
filed with the Chief Postal Inspector and supersedes any Postal Service 
regulation governing petitions for remission or mitigation to the extent 
such regulation is inconsistent with this section.
    (2) Definitions. As used in this part:
    (i) The term administrative forfeiture means the process by which 
property may be forfeited by an investigative agency rather than through 
judicial proceedings.
    (ii) The term appraised value means the estimated market value of an 
asset at the time and place of seizure if such or similar property was 
freely offered for sale between a willing seller and a willing buyer.
    (iii) The term Attorney General means the Attorney General of the 
United States or his or her designee.
    (iv) The term beneficial owner means a person with actual use of, as 
well as an interest in, the property subject to forfeiture.
    (v) The term general creditor means one whose claim or debt is not 
secured by a specific right to obtain satisfaction against the 
particular property subject to forfeiture.
    (vi) The term judgment creditor means one who has obtained a 
judgment against the debtor but has not yet received full satisfaction 
of the judgment.
    (vii) The term judicial forfeiture means either a civil or criminal 
proceeding in a United States District Court that may result in a final 
judgment and order of forfeiture.
    (viii) The term lienholder means a creditor whose claim or debt is 
secured by a specific right to obtain satisfaction against the 
particular property subject to forfeiture. A lien creditor qualifies as 
a lienholder if the lien:
    (A) Was established by operation of law or contract;
    (B) Was created as a result of an exchange of money, goods, or 
services; and
    (C) Is perfected against the specific property forfeited for which 
remission or mitigation is sought (e.g., a real estate mortgage, a 
mechanic's lien).
    (ix) The term net equity means the amount of a lienholder's monetary 
interest in property subject to forfeiture. Net equity shall be computed 
by determining the amount of unpaid principal and unpaid interest at the 
time of seizure, and by adding to that sum unpaid interest calculated 
from the date of seizure through the last full month prior to the date 
of the decision on the petition. Where a rate of interest is set forth 
in a security agreement, the rate of interest to be used in this 
computation will be the annual percentage rate so specified in the 
security agreement that is the basis of the lienholder's interest. In 
this computation, however, there shall be no allowances for attorneys' 
fees, accelerated or enhanced interest charges, amounts set by contract 
as damages, unearned extended warranty fees, insurance, service contract 
charges incurred after the date of seizure, allowances for dealer's 
reserve, or any other similar charges.
    (x) The term owner means the person in whom primary title is vested 
or whose interest is manifested by the actual and beneficial use of the 
property, even though the title is vested in another. A victim of an 
offense as defined in paragraph (j) (2)(xxi) of this section may also be 
an owner if he or she has a present legally cognizable ownership 
interest in the property forfeited. A nominal owner of property will not 
be treated as its true owner if he or she is not its beneficial owner.
    (xi) The term person means an individual, partnership, corporation, 
joint business enterprise, estate, or other legal entity capable of 
owning property.
    (xii) The term petition means a petition for remission or mitigation 
of forfeiture under these regulations. This

[[Page 63]]

definition includes a petition for restoration of the proceeds of sale 
of forfeited property and a petition for the value of forfeited property 
placed into official use.
    (xiii) The term petitioner means the person applying for remission, 
mitigation, restoration of the proceeds of sale, or for the appraised 
value of forfeited property under these regulations. A petitioner may be 
an owner of forfeited property as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(x) of this 
section; a lienholder as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(viii) of this 
section; or a victim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(xxi) of this section 
subject to the limitations of paragraph (j)(8) of this section.
    (xiv) The term Postal Service Fund means the United States Postal 
Fund established under 39 U.S.C. 2003.
    (xv) The term property means real or personal property of any kind 
capable of being owned or possessed.
    (xvi) The term record means a series of arrests for related crimes, 
unless the arrestee was acquitted or the charges were dismissed for lack 
of evidence; a conviction for a related crime or completion of sentence 
within ten years of the acquisition of the property subject to 
forfeiture; or two convictions for a related crime at any time in the 
past.
    (xvii) The term related crime as used in paragraphs (j)(2)(xvi) and 
(6)(v) of this section means any crime similar in nature to that which 
gives rise to the seizure of property for forfeiture. For example, where 
property is seized for a violation of the federal laws dealing with 
drugs, a related crime would be any offense involving a violation of the 
federal laws relating to drugs or the laws of any state or political 
subdivision thereof relating to drugs.
    (xviii) The term related offense as used in paragraph (j)(8) of this 
section means:
    (A) Any predicate offense charged in a Federal Racketeer Influenced 
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) count for which forfeiture was 
ordered; or
    (B) An offense committed as part of the same scheme or design, or 
pursuant to the same conspiracy, as was involved in the offense for 
which the forfeiture was ordered.
    (xix) The term Ruling Official means any official to whom decision 
making authority has been delegated pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of 
this section.
    (xx) The term seizing agency means the federal agency that seized 
the property or adopted the seizure of another agency for federal 
forfeiture.
    (xxi) The term victim means a person who has incurred a pecuniary 
loss as a direct result of the commission of the offense underlying a 
forfeiture. A drug user is not considered a victim of a drug trafficking 
offense under this definition. A victim does not include one who 
acquires a right to sue the perpetrator of the criminal offense for any 
loss by assignment, subrogation, inheritance, or otherwise from the 
actual victim, unless that person has acquired an actual ownership 
interest in the forfeited property.
    (xxii) The term violator means the person whose use or acquisition 
of the property in violation of the law subjected such property to 
seizure for forfeiture.
    (3) Petitions in administrative forfeiture cases--(i) Notice of 
seizure. The notice of seizure and intent to forfeit the property shall 
advise any persons who may have a present ownership interest in the 
property to submit their petitions for remission or mitigation within 
thirty (30) days of the date they receive the notice in order to 
facilitate processing. Petitions shall be considered any time after 
notice until the forfeited property is placed into official use, sold, 
or otherwise disposed of according to law, except in cases involving 
petitions to restore the proceeds from the sale of forfeited property. A 
notice of seizure shall include the title of the seizing agency, the 
Ruling Official, the mailing and street address of the official to whom 
petitions should be sent, and an asset identifier number.
    (ii) Persons who may file. A petition for remission or mitigation 
must be filed by a petitioner as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(xiii) of 
this section or as prescribed in paragraphs (j)(9) (vii) and (viii) of 
this section.
    (iii) Contents of petition. (A) All petitions must include the 
following information in clear and concise terms:
    (1) The name, address, and social security or other taxpayer 
identification

[[Page 64]]

number of the person claiming an interest in the seized property who is 
seeking remission or mitigation;
    (2) The name of the seizing agency, the asset identifier number, and 
the date and place of seizure;
    (3) A complete description of the property including make, model, 
and serial numbers, if any; and
    (4) A description of the petitioner's interest in the property as 
owner, lienholder, or otherwise, supported by original or certified 
bills of sale, contracts, deeds, mortgages, or other documentary 
evidence.
    (B) Any factual recitation or documentation of any type in a 
petition must be supported by a sworn affidavit.
    (iv) Releases. In addition to the contents of the petition for 
remission or mitigation set forth in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this 
section, upon request, the petitioner shall also furnish the agency with 
an instrument executed by the titled or registered owner and any other 
known claimant of an interest in the property releasing interest in such 
property.
    (v) Filing petition with agency. (A) A petition for remission or 
mitigation of an administrative forfeiture by the Postal Inspection 
Service shall be sent to the Chief Postal Inspector, United States 
Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, DC 20260-2100.
    (B) The petition shall be sworn to by the petitioner or by the 
petitioner's attorney upon information and belief, supported by the 
client's sworn notice of representation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, as 
set out in paragraph (j)(9)(vii) of this section.
    (vi) Agency investigation. Upon receipt of a petition, the Postal 
Inspection Service shall investigate the merits of the petition and 
prepare a written report containing the results of that investigation. 
This report shall be submitted to the Ruling Official for review and 
consideration.
    (vii) Ruling. Upon receipt of the petition and the agency report, 
the Ruling Official shall review the petition and the report, and shall 
rule on the merits of the petition. No hearing shall be held.
    (viii) Petitions granted. If the Ruling Official grants a remission 
or mitigation of the forfeiture, a copy of the decision shall be sent by 
certified mail to the petitioner, or, if represented by an attorney, to 
the petitioner's attorney. A copy of the decision shall also be sent to 
the U.S. Marshals Service or other property custodian. The written 
decision shall include the terms and conditions, if any, upon which the 
remission or mitigation is granted and the procedures the petitioner 
must follow to obtain release of the property or the monetary interest 
therein.
    (ix) Petitions denied. If the Ruling Official denies a petition, a 
copy of the decision shall be sent by certified mail to the petitioner, 
or, if represented by an attorney, to the petitioner's attorney of 
record. A copy of the decision shall also be sent to the U.S. Marshals 
Service or other property custodian. The written decision shall specify 
the reason that the petition was denied. The decision shall advise the 
petitioner that a request for reconsideration of the denial of the 
petition may be submitted to the Ruling Official in accordance with 
paragraph (j)(3)(x) of this section.
    (x) Request for reconsideration. (A) A request for reconsideration 
of the denial of the petition shall be considered if:
    (1) It is postmarked or received by the office of the Ruling 
Official within ten (10) days from the receipt of the notice of the 
denial of the petition by the petitioner; and
    (2) The request is based on information or evidence not previously 
considered that is material to the basis for the denial or presents a 
basis clearly demonstrating that the denial was erroneous.
    (B) In no event shall a request for reconsideration be decided by 
the same Ruling Official who ruled on the original petition.
    (C) Only one request for reconsideration of a denial of a petition 
shall be considered.
    (xi) Restoration of proceeds from sale. (A) A petition for 
restoration of the proceeds from the sale of forfeited property, or for 
the appraised value of forfeited property when the forfeited property 
has been retained by or delivered to a government agency for official 
use, may be submitted by an owner

[[Page 65]]

or lienholder in cases in which the petitioner:
    (1) Did not know of the seizure prior to the entry of a declaration 
of forfeiture; and
    (2) Could not reasonably have known of the seizure prior to the 
entry of a declaration of forfeiture.
    (B) Such a petition shall be submitted pursuant to paragraphs 
(j)(3)(ii) through (v) of this section within ninety (90) days from the 
date the property is sold or otherwise disposed of.
    (4) Petitions in judicial forfeiture cases--(i) Procedure for filing 
petition. If the forfeiture proceedings are judicial, a petition for 
remission or mitigation of a judicial forfeiture shall be addressed to 
the Attorney General; shall be sworn to by the petitioner or by the 
petitioner's attorney upon information and belief, supported by the 
client's sworn notice of representation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746; and 
shall be submitted to the United States Attorney for the district in 
which the judicial forfeiture proceedings are brought. A petitioner also 
shall submit a copy of the petition to the Chief Postal Inspector if the 
Postal Inspection Service was the seizing agency.
    (ii) Ruling. Department of Justice regulations on petitions for 
remission or mitigation in judicial forfeiture cases are stated in 29 
CFR 9.4.
    (5) Criteria governing administrative remission and mitigation--(i) 
Remission. (A) The Ruling Official shall not grant remission of a 
forfeiture unless the petitioner establishes that:
    (1) The petitioner has a valid, good faith and legally cognizable 
interest in the seized property as owner or lienholder as defined in 
these regulations; and
    (2) The petitioner is innocent within the meaning of the innocent 
owner provisions of the applicable civil forfeiture statute, is a bona 
fide purchaser for value without cause to believe that the property was 
subject to forfeiture at the time of the purchase, or is one who held a 
legally cognizable interest in the seized property at the time of the 
violation underlying the forfeiture superior to that of the defendant 
within the meaning of the applicable criminal forfeiture statute, and is 
thereby entitled to recover his or her interest in the forfeited 
property by statute. (If the applicable civil forfeiture statute 
contains no innocent owner defense, the innocent owner provisions 
applicable to 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(4) shall apply.) Unless otherwise 
provided by statute, in the case of petitioners who acquired their 
interest in the property after the time of the violation underlying the 
forfeiture, the question of whether the petitioner had knowledge of the 
violation shall be determined as of the point in time when the interest 
in the property was acquired.
    (B) The knowledge and responsibilities of petitioner's 
representative, agent, or employee in paragraph (j)(5)(i)(A)(2) of this 
section are imputed to the petitioner where the representative, agent, 
or employee was acting in the course of his or her employment and in 
furtherance of the petitioner's business.
    (C) The petitioner has the burden of establishing the basis for 
granting a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeited property, a 
restoration of proceeds of sale or appraised value of forfeited 
property, or a reconsideration of a denial of such a petition. Failure 
to provide information or documents and to submit to interviews, as 
requested, may result in a denial of the petition.
    (D) The Ruling Official shall presume a valid forfeiture and shall 
not consider whether the evidence is sufficient to support the 
forfeiture.
    (E) Willful, materially false statements or information, made or 
furnished by the petitioner in support of a petition for remission or 
mitigation of forfeited property, the restoration of proceeds or 
appraised value of forfeited property, or the reconsideration of a 
denial of any such petition, shall be grounds for denial of such 
petition and possible prosecution for the filing of false statements.
    (ii) Mitigation. (A) The Ruling Official may grant mitigation to a 
party not involved in the commission of the offense underlying 
forfeiture:
    (1) Where the petitioner has not met the minimum conditions for 
remission, but the Ruling Official finds that some relief should be 
granted to avoid extreme hardship and that return of the property 
combined with imposition of monetary and/or other conditions of

[[Page 66]]

mitigation in lieu of a complete forfeiture will promote the interest of 
justice and will not diminish the deterrent effect of the law. 
Extenuating circumstances justifying such a finding include those 
circumstances that reduce the responsibility of the petitioner for 
knowledge of the illegal activity, knowledge of the criminal record of a 
user of the property, or failure to take reasonable steps to prevent the 
illegal use or acquisition by another for some reason, such as a 
reasonable fear of reprisal; or
    (2) Where the minimum standards for remission have been satisfied 
but the overall circumstances are such that, in the opinion of the 
Ruling Official, complete relief is not warranted.
    (B) The Ruling Official may in his or her discretion grant 
mitigation to a party involved in the commission of the offense 
underlying the forfeiture where certain mitigating factors exist, 
including, but not limited to: The lack of a prior record or evidence of 
similar criminal conduct; if the violation does not include drug 
distribution, manufacturing, or importation, the fact that the violator 
has taken steps, such as drug treatment, to prevent further criminal 
conduct; the fact that the violation was minimal and was not part of a 
larger criminal scheme; the fact that the violator has cooperated with 
federal, state, or local investigations relating to the criminal conduct 
underlying the forfeiture; or the fact that complete forfeiture of an 
asset is not necessary to achieve the legitimate purposes of forfeiture.
    (C) Mitigation may take the form of a monetary condition or the 
imposition of other conditions relating to the continued use of the 
property, and the return of the property, in addition to the imposition 
of any other costs that would be chargeable as a condition to remission. 
This monetary condition is considered as an item of cost payable by the 
petitioner, and shall be deposited into the Postal Service Fund as an 
amount realized from forfeiture in accordance with the applicable 
statute. If the petitioner fails to accept the Ruling Official's 
mitigation decision or any of its conditions, or fails to pay the 
monetary amount within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the decision, 
the property shall be sold, and the monetary amount imposed and other 
costs chargeable as a condition to mitigation shall be subtracted from 
the proceeds of the sale before transmitting the remainder to the 
petitioner.
    (6) Special rules for specific petitioners--(i) General creditors. A 
general creditor may not be granted remission or mitigation of 
forfeiture unless he or she otherwise qualifies as a petitioner under 
these regulations.
    (ii) Rival claimants. If the beneficial owner of the forfeited 
property and the owner of a security interest in the same property each 
file a petition, and if both petitions are found to be meritorious, the 
claim of the beneficial owner shall take precedence.
    (iii) Voluntary bailments. A petitioner who allows another to use 
his or her property without cost, and who is not in the business of 
lending money secured by property or of leasing or renting property for 
profit, shall be granted remission or mitigation of forfeiture in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (j)(5) of this section.
    (iv) Lessors. A person engaged in the business of leasing or renting 
real or personal property on a long-term basis with the right to 
sublease shall not be entitled to remission or mitigation of a 
forfeiture of such property unless the lessor can demonstrate compliance 
with all the requirements of paragraph (j)(5) of this section.
    (v) Straw owners. A petition by any person who has acquired a 
property interest recognizable under these regulations and who knew or 
had reason to believe that the interest was conveyed by the previous 
owner for the purpose of circumventing seizure, forfeiture, or these 
regulations, shall be denied. A petition by a person who purchases or 
owns property for another who has a record for related crimes as defined 
in paragraph (j)(2)(xvii) of this section, or a petition by a lienholder 
who knows or has reason to believe that the purchaser or owner of record 
is not the real purchaser or owner, shall be denied unless both the 
purchaser of record and the real purchaser or owner meet the 
requirements of paragraph (j)(5) of this section.

[[Page 67]]

    (vi) Judgment creditors. (A) A judgment creditor will be recognized 
as a lienholder if:
    (1) The judgment was duly recorded before the seizure of the 
property for forfeiture;
    (2) Under applicable state or other local law, the judgment 
constitutes a valid lien on the property that attached to it before the 
seizure of the property for forfeiture; and
    (3) The petitioner had no knowledge of the commission of any act or 
acts giving rise to the forfeiture at the time the judgment became a 
lien on the forfeited property.
    (B) A judgment creditor will not be recognized as a lienholder if 
the property in question is not property of which the judgment debtor is 
entitled to claim ownership under applicable state or other local law 
(e.g., stolen property). A judgment creditor is entitled under these 
regulations to no more than the amount of the judgment, exclusive of any 
interest, costs, or other fees including attorney's fees associated with 
the action that led to the judgment or its collection.
    (C) A judgment creditor's lien must be registered in the district 
where the property is located if the judgment was obtained outside the 
district.
    (7) Terms and conditions of remission and mitigation--(i) Owners. 
(A) An owner's interest in property that has been forfeited is 
represented by the property itself or by a monetary interest equivalent 
to that interest at the time of seizure. Whether the property or a 
monetary equivalent will be remitted to an owner shall be determined at 
the discretion of the Ruling Official.
    (B) If a civil judicial forfeiture action against the property is 
pending, release of the property must await an appropriate court order.
    (C) Where the government sells or disposes of the property prior to 
the grant of the remission, the owner shall receive the proceeds of that 
sale, less any costs incurred by the government in the sale. The Ruling 
Official, at his or her discretion, may waive the deduction of costs and 
expenses incident to the forfeiture.
    (D) Where the owner does not comply with the conditions imposed upon 
release of the property by the Ruling Official, the property shall be 
sold. Following the sale, the proceeds shall be used to pay all costs of 
the forfeiture and disposition of the property, in addition to any 
monetary conditions imposed. The remaining balance shall be paid to the 
owner.
    (ii) Lienholders. (A) When the forfeited property is to be retained 
for official use or transferred to a state or local law enforcement 
agency or foreign government pursuant to law, and remission or 
mitigation has been granted to a lienholder, the recipient of the 
property shall assure that:
    (1) In the case of remission, the lien is satisfied as determined 
through the petition process; or
    (2) In the case of mitigation, an amount equal to the net equity, 
less any monetary conditions imposed, is paid to the lienholder prior to 
the release of the property to the recipient agency or foreign 
government.
    (B) When the forfeited property is not retained for official use or 
transferred to another agency or foreign country pursuant to law, the 
lienholder shall be notified by the Ruling Official of the right to 
select either of the following alternatives:
    (1) Return of property. The lienholder may obtain possession of the 
property after paying the United States, through the Ruling Official, 
the costs and expenses incident to the forfeiture, the amount, if any, 
by which the appraised value of the property exceeds the lienholder's 
net equity in the property, and any amount specified in the Ruling 
Official's decision as a condition to remit the property. The Ruling 
Official, at his or her discretion, may waive costs and expenses 
incident to the forfeiture. The Ruling Official shall forward a copy of 
the decision, a memorandum of disposition, and the original releases to 
the U.S. Marshals Service or other property custodian who shall 
thereafter release the property to the lienholder; or
    (2) Sale of Property and Payment to Lienholder--Subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (j)(9)(i) of this section, upon sale of the 
property, the lienholder may receive the payment of a monetary amount up 
to the sum of the

[[Page 68]]

lienholder's net equity, less the expenses and costs incident to the 
forfeiture and sale of the property, and any other monetary conditions 
imposed. The Ruling Official, at his or her discretion, may waive costs 
and expenses incident to the forfeiture.
    (iii) If the lienholder does not notify the Ruling Official of the 
selection of one of the two options set forth above in paragraph 
(j)(7)(ii)(B) of this section within twenty (20) days of the receipt of 
such notification, the Ruling Official shall direct the U.S. Marshal or 
other property custodian to sell the property and pay the lienholder an 
amount up to the net equity, less the costs and expenses incurred 
incident to the forfeiture and sale, and any monetary conditions 
imposed. In the event a lienholder subsequently receives a payment of 
any kind on the debt owed for which he or she has already received 
payment as a result of the granting of remission or mitigation, the 
lienholder shall reimburse the Postal Service Fund to the extent of the 
payment received.
    (iv) Where the lienholder does not comply with the conditions 
imposed upon the release of the property, the property shall be sold 
after forfeiture. From the proceeds of the sale, all costs incident to 
the forfeiture and sale shall first be deducted, and the balance up to 
the net equity, less any monetary conditions, shall be paid to the 
lienholder.
    (8) Provisions applicable to victims. The provisions of this section 
apply to victims of an offense underlying the forfeiture of property, or 
of a related offense, who do not have a present ownership interest in 
the forfeited property (or, in the case of multiple victims of an 
offense, who do not have a present ownership interest in the forfeited 
property that is clearly superior to that of other petitioner victims). 
The provisions of this section apply only with respect to property 
forfeited pursuant to statutes that explicitly authorize restoration or 
remission of forfeited property to victims. Victims who have a superior 
present legally cognizable ownership interest in forfeited property may 
file petitions as other owners, subject to the regulations set forth in 
paragraph (j)(7)(i) of this section. The claims of such owner victims, 
like those of any other owners, shall have priority over the claims of 
any non-owner victims whose claims are recognized pursuant to this 
section.
    (i) Qualifications to file. A victim, as defined in paragraph 
(j)(2)(xxi) of this section, of an offense that was the underlying basis 
for the criminal, civil, or administrative forfeiture of specific 
property, or a victim of a related offense, may be granted remission of 
the forfeiture of that property, if in addition to complying with the 
other applicable provisions of this section, the victim satisfactorily 
demonstrates that:
    (A) A pecuniary loss of a specific amount has been directly caused 
by the criminal offense, or related offense, that resulted in the 
forfeiture, or by a related offense, and that the loss is supported by 
documentary evidence including invoices and receipts;
    (B) The pecuniary loss is the direct result of the illegal acts and 
is not the result of otherwise lawful acts which were committed in the 
course of a criminal offense;
    (C) The victim did not knowingly contribute to, participate in, 
benefit from, or act in a willfully blind manner towards the commission 
of the offense, or related offense, that was the underlying basis of the 
forfeiture;
    (D) The victim has not in fact been compensated for the wrongful 
loss of the property by the perpetrator or others; and
    (E) The victim does not have recourse reasonably available to other 
assets from which to obtain compensation for the wrongful loss of the 
property.
    (ii) Pecuniary loss. The amount of the pecuniary loss suffered by a 
victim for which remission may be granted is limited to the fair market 
value of the property of which the petitioner was deprived as of the 
date of the occurrence of the loss. No allowance shall be made for 
interest foregone or for collateral expenses incurred to recover lost 
property or to seek other recompense.
    (iii) Torts. A tort associated with illegal activity that formed the 
basis for the forfeiture shall not be a basis for

[[Page 69]]

remission, unless it constitutes the illegal activity itself, nor shall 
remission be granted for physical injuries to a petitioner or for damage 
to a petitioner's property.
    (iv) Denial of petition. In the exercise of his or her discretion, 
the Ruling Official may decline to grant remission where:
    (A) There is substantial difficulty in calculating the pecuniary 
loss incurred by the victim or victims;
    (B) The amount of the remission, if granted, would be small compared 
with the amount of expenses incurred by the government in determining 
whether to grant remission; or
    (C) The total number of victims is large and the monetary amount of 
the remission so small as to make its granting impractical.
    (v) Pro rata basis. In granting remission to multiple victims 
pursuant to this section, the Ruling Official should generally grant 
remission on a pro rata basis to recognized victims when petitions 
cannot be granted in full due to the limited value of the forfeited 
property. However, the Ruling Official may consider, among others, the 
following factors in establishing appropriate priorities in individual 
cases:
    (A) The specificity and reliability of the evidence establishing a 
loss;
    (B) The fact that a particular victim is suffering an extreme 
financial hardship;
    (C) The fact that a particular victim has cooperated with the 
government in the investigation related to the forfeiture or to a 
related prosecution or civil action; and
    (D) In the case of petitions filed by multiple victims of related 
offenses, the fact that a particular victim is a victim of the offense 
underlying the forfeiture.
    (vi) Reimbursement. Any petitioner granted remission pursuant to 
this section shall reimburse the Postal Service Fund for the amount 
received to the extent the individual later receives compensation for 
the loss of the property from any other source. The petitioner shall 
surrender the reimbursement upon payment from any secondary source.
    (vii) Claims of financial institution regulatory agencies. In cases 
involving property forfeitable under 18 U.S.C. 981(a)(1)(C) or 
(a)(1)(D), the Ruling Official may decline to grant a petition filed by 
a petitioner in whole or in part due to the lack of sufficient 
forfeitable funds to satisfy both the petition and claims of the 
financial institution regulatory agencies pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981 
(e)(3) or (7). Generally, claims of financial regulatory agencies 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(e)(3) or (7) shall take priority over claims 
of victims.
    (9) Miscellaneous Provisions--(i) Priority of payment. Except where 
otherwise provided in this section, costs incurred by the Postal 
Inspection Service and other agencies participating in the forfeiture 
that were incident to the forfeiture, sale, or other disposition of the 
property shall be deducted from the amount available for remission or 
mitigation. Such costs include, but are not limited to, court costs, 
storage costs, brokerage and other sales-related costs, the amount of 
any liens and associated costs paid by the government on the property, 
costs incurred in paying the ordinary and necessary expenses of a 
business seized for forfeiture, awards for information as authorized by 
statute, expenses of trustees or other assistants pursuant to paragraph 
(j)(9)(iii) of this section, investigative or prosecutive costs 
specially incurred incident to the particular forfeiture, and costs 
incurred incident to the processing of the petition(s) for remission or 
mitigation. The remaining balance shall be available for remission or 
mitigation. The Ruling Official shall direct the distribution of the 
remaining balance in the following order of priority, except that he or 
she may exercise discretion in determining the priority between 
petitioners belonging to classes described in paragraphs (j)(9)(iii) and 
(9)(iv) of this section in exceptional circumstances:
    (A) Owners;
    (B) Lienholders;
    (C) Federal financial institution regulatory agencies (pursuant to 
paragraph (j)(9)(vi) of this section, not constituting owners or 
lienholders); and
    (D) Victims not constituting owners or lienholders (pursuant to 
paragraph (j)(8) of this section).

[[Page 70]]

    (ii) Sale or disposition of property prior to ruling. If forfeited 
property has been sold or otherwise disposed of prior to a ruling, the 
Ruling Official may grant relief in the form of a monetary amount. The 
amount realized by the sale of the property is presumed to be the value 
of the property. Monetary relief shall not be greater than the appraised 
value of the property at the time of seizure and shall not exceed the 
amount realized from the sale or other disposition. The proceeds of the 
sale shall be distributed as follows:
    (A) Payment of the government's expenses incurred incident to the 
forfeiture and sale, including court costs and storage charges, if any;
    (B) Payment to the petitioner of an amount up to his or her interest 
in the property;
    (C) Payment to the Postal Service Fund of all other costs and 
expenses incident to the forfeiture;
    (D) In the case of victims, payment of any amount up to the amount 
of his or her loss; and
    (E) Payment of the balance remaining, if any, to the Postal Service 
Fund.
    (iii) Trustees and other assistants. In the exercise of his or her 
discretion, the Ruling Official may use the services of a trustee, other 
government official, or appointed contractors to notify potential 
petitioners, process petitions, and make recommendations to the Ruling 
Official on the distribution of property to petitioners. The expense for 
such assistance shall be paid out of the forfeited funds.
    (iv) Other agencies of the United States. Where another agency of 
the United States is entitled to remission or mitigation of forfeited 
assets because of an interest that is recognizable under these 
regulations, or is eligible for such transfer pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
981(e)(6), such agency shall request the transfer in writing, in 
addition to complying with the provisions of paragraphs (j)(3) through 
(5) of this section. The decision to make such transfer shall be made in 
writing by the Ruling Official.
    (v) Financial institution regulatory agencies. A Ruling Official may 
direct the transfer of property under 18 U.S.C. 981(e) to certain 
federal financial institution regulatory agencies or an entity acting in 
their behalf, upon receipt of a written request, in lieu of ruling on a 
petition for remission or mitigation.
    (vi) Transfers to foreign governments. A Ruling Official may decline 
to grant remission to any petitioner other than an owner or lienholder 
so that forfeited assets may be transferred to a foreign government 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(i)(1), 19 U.S.C. 1616a(c)(2), or 21 U.S.C. 
881(e)(1)(E).
    (vii) Filing by attorneys. (A) A petition for remission or 
mitigation may be filed by a petitioner or by his or her attorney or 
legal guardian. If an attorney files on behalf of the petitioner, the 
petition must include a signed and sworn statement by the client-
petitioner stating that:
    (1) The attorney has the authority to represent the petitioner in 
this proceeding;
    (2) The petitioner has fully reviewed the petition; and
    (3) The petition is truthful and accurate in every respect.
    (B) Verbal notification of representation is not acceptable. 
Responses and notification of rulings shall not be sent to an attorney 
claiming to represent a petitioner unless a written notice of 
representation is filed. No extensions of time shall be granted due to 
delays in submission of the notice of representation.
    (viii) Consolidated petitions. At the discretion of the Ruling 
Official in individual cases, a petition may be filed by one petitioner 
on behalf of other petitioners, provided the petitions are based on 
similar underlying facts, and the petitioner who files the petition has 
written authority to do so on behalf of the other petitioners. This 
authority must be either expressed in documents giving the petitioner 
the authority to file petitions for remission, or reasonably implied 
from documents giving the petitioner express authority to file claims or 
lawsuits related to the course of conduct in question on behalf of these 
other petitioners. An insurer or an administrator of an employee benefit 
plan, for example, which itself has standing to file a petition as a 
``victim'' within the meaning of paragraph (j)(2)(xxi) of this section, 
may also file a petition on behalf of all its insured or plan 
beneficiaries for any claims they may have based on

[[Page 71]]

co-payments made to the perpetrator of the offense underlying the 
forfeiture or the perpetrator of a ``related offense'' within the 
meaning of paragraph (j)(2)(xviii) of this section, if the authority to 
file claims or lawsuits is contained in the document or documents 
establishing the plan. Where such a petition is filed, any amounts 
granted as a remission must be transferred to the other petitioners, not 
the party filing the petition; although, in his or her discretion, the 
Ruling Official may use the actual petitioner as an intermediary for 
transferring the amounts authorized as a remission to the other 
petitioners.

Sec. 233.8  Expedited forfeiture proceedings for property seized for administrative

forfeiture involving controlled substances in personal use quantities.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have 
the meanings specified:
    (1) Appraised Value means the estimated domestic price at the time 
of seizure at which such or similar property is freely offered for sale.
    (2) Controlled Substance has the meaning given in 21 U.S.C. 802.
    (3) Legal and Factual Basis of the Seizure means a statement of the 
applicable law under which the property is seized, and a written 
statement of the circumstances of the seizure sufficiently precise to 
enable an owner or other interested party to identify the date, place, 
and use or acquisition which makes the property subject to forfeiture.
    (4) Owner means one having a legal and possessory interest in the 
property seized for forfeiture. Even though one may hold primary and 
direct title to the property seized, such person may not have sufficient 
actual beneficial interest in the property to support a petition as 
owner if the facts indicate that another person had dominion and control 
over the property.
    (5) Personal Use Quantities means possession of a controlled 
substance in circumstances where there is not other evidence of an 
intent to distribute, or to facilitate the manufacturing, compounding, 
processing, delivering, importing, or exporting of any controlled 
substance. Evidence of personal use quantities does not include 
sweepings or other evidence of possession of quantities of a controlled 
substance for other than personal use.
    (i) Such other evidence includes:
    (A) Evidence, such as drug scales, drug distribution paraphernalia, 
drug records, drug packaging material, method of drug packaging, drug 
``cutting'' agents and other equipment, that indicates an intent to 
process, package or distribute a controlled substance;
    (B) Information from reliable sources indicating possession of a 
controlled substance with intent to distribute;
    (C) The arrest and/or conviction record of the person or persons in 
actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance for 
offenses under Federal, State or local law that indicates an intent to 
distribute a controlled substance;
    (D) Relationship of the controlled substance to large amounts of 
cash or any amount of prerecorded government funds;
    (E) Possession of the controlled substance under circumstances that 
indicate the substance is a sample intended for distribution in 
anticipation of a transaction involving large quantities, or is part of 
a larger delivery; or
    (F) Statements by the possessor, or otherwise attributable to the 
possessor, including statements of conspirators, that indicate 
possession with intent to distribute.
    (ii) Possession of a controlled substance is presumed to be for 
personal use when there are no indicia of illicit drug trafficking or 
distribution such as, but not limited to, the factors listed in Sec. 
233.8(a)(5)(i), and the amounts do not exceed the following quantities:
    (A) One gram of a mixture of substance containing a detectable 
amount of heroin;
    (B) One gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable 
amount of:

[[Page 72]]

    (1) Coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from 
which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivations of ecgonine or their salts have 
been removed;
    (2) Cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of 
isomers;
    (3) Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of 
isomers; or
    (4) Any compound, mixture or preparation which contains any quantity 
of any of the substances referred to in Sec. 233.8(a)(5) (ii)(B)(1)-
(3);
    (5) \1/10\th gram of a mixture or substance described in Sec. 
233.8(a)(5)(ii) which contains cocaine base;
    (6) \1/10\ gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable 
amount of phencyclidine (PCP);
    (7) 500 micrograms of a mixture or substance containing a detectable 
amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD);
    (8) One ounce of a mixture of substance containing a detectable 
amount of marihuana;
    (9) One gram of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of 
its isomers, or one gram of a mixture or substance containing a 
detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of 
its isomer.
    (iii) The possession of a narcotic, a depressant, a stimulant, a 
hallucinogen or cannabis-controlled substance will be considered in 
excess of personal use quantities if the dosage unit amount possessed 
provides the same or greater equivalent efficacy as described in Sec. 
233.8(a)(5)(ii).
    (6) Property means property subject to forfeiture under title 21, 
U.S.C., Sections 881(a)(4), (6), and (7).
    (7) Statutory Rights or Defenses to the Forfeiture means all legal 
and equitable rights and remedies available to a claimant of property 
seized for forfeiture.
    (8) Sworn to as used in Sec. 233.8(b)(4)(ii) refers to the oath as 
provided by 28 U.S.C. 1746.
    (b) Petition for expedited release in an administrative forfeiture 
action. (1) Where property is seized for administrative forfeiture 
involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, the owner 
may petition the Postal Inspection Service for expedited release of the 
property.
    (2) The owner filing the petition for expedited release must 
establish the following:
    (i) The owner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized 
property as owner or otherwise;
    (ii) The owner reasonably attempted to ascertain the use of the 
property in a normal and customary manner; and
    (iii) The owner did not know or consent to the illegal use of the 
property, or in the event that the owner knew or should have known of 
the illegal use, the owner did what reasonably could be expected to 
prevent the violation.
    (3) In addition to those factors listed in Sec. 233.8(b)(2), if an 
owner can demonstrate that he has other statutory rights or defenses 
that would cause him to prevail on the issue of forfeiture, such factors 
must also be considered in ruling on the petition for expedited release.
    (4) A petition for expedited release must be:
    (i) Filed in a timely manner to be considered; in order to be filed 
in a timely manner, the petition must be received by the Postal 
Inspection Service within 20 days from the date of the first publication 
of the notice of seizure.
    (ii) Executed and sworn to by the owner and both the envelope and 
the request must be clearly marked ``PETITION FOR EXPEDITED RELEASE'';
    (iii) Filed in accordance with the notice of seizure; and
    (iv) Addressed to the Chief Postal Inspector, Postal Inspection 
Service.
    (5) The petition must include the following:
    (i) A complete description of the property, including identification 
numbers, if any, and the date and place of seizure;
    (ii) The petitioner's interest in the property, which must be 
supported by title documentation, bills of sale, contracts, mortgages, 
or other satisfactory documentary evidence; and
    (iii) A statement of the facts and circumstances, to be established 
by satisfactory proof, relied upon by the petitioner to justify 
expedited release of the seized property.
    (c) Ruling on petition for expedited release in an administrative 
forfeiture action involving personal use quantities of a

[[Page 73]]

controlled substance. (1) Upon receipt of a petition for expedited 
release filed pursuant to Sec. 233.8(b), the Postal Inspection Service 
must determine first whether a final administrative determination of the 
case, without regard to the provisions of this section, can be made 
within 21 days of the seizure. If such a final administrative 
determination is made within 21 days, no further action need be taken 
under this section.
    (2) If no such final administrative determination is made within 21 
days of the seizure, the following procedure applies:
    (i) The Postal Inspection Service, within 20 days after the receipt 
of the petition for expedited release, determines whether the petition 
filed by the owner has established the factors listed in Sec. 
233.8(b)(2); and
    (ii) If the Postal Inspection Service determines that those factors 
have been established, it terminates the administrative proceedings and 
returns the property to the owner except where it is evidence of a 
violation of law; or
    (iii) If the Postal Inspection Service determines that those factors 
have not been established, it proceeds with the administrative 
forfeiture.
    (d) Posting of substitute res. (1) Where property is seized for 
administrative forfeiture involving controlled substances in personal 
use quantities, the owner may obtain release of the property by posting 
a substitute res with the Postal Service. The property will be released 
to the owner upon the payment of an amount equal to the appraised value 
of the property if it is not evidence of a violation of law or has 
design or other characteristics that particularly suit it for use in 
illegal activities. This payment must be in the form of a traveler's 
check, a money order, a cashier's check or an irrevocable letter of 
credit made payable to the Postal Service. A bond in the form of a 
cashier's check will be considered as paid once the check has been 
accepted for payment by the financial institution which issued the 
check.
    (2) If a substitute res is posted and the property is 
administratively forfeited, the Postal Inspection Service will forfeit 
the substitute res in lieu of the property.

Sec. 233.9  Expedited release of conveyances being forfeited 

in a judicial forfeiture proceeding for a drug-related offense.

    (a) Petition for expedited release of conveyance. Where a conveyance 
has been seized and is being forfeited in a judicial proceeding for a 
drug-related offense, the owner may petition the United States Attorney 
for an expedited release of the conveyance in accordance with the 
regulations of the Department of Justice (21 CFR part 1316).
    (b) Petition filed in timely manner. A petition for expedited 
release must be filed in a timely manner in order to be considered by 
the United States Attorney. To be considered as filed in a timely 
manner, in accordance with 21 CFR part 1316, the petition must be 
received by the appropriate United States Attorney within 20 days from 
the date of the first publication of the notice of the action and arrest 
of the property, or within 30 days after filing of the claim, whichever 
occurs later.
    (c) Obtaining release of the property by filing a substitute res 
bond. Where a conveyance is being forfeited in a judicial proceeding for 
a drug-related offense, the owner may obtain release of the property by 
filing a substitute res bond with the Postal Inspection Service. The 
conveyance will be released to the owner upon the payment of a bond in 
the amount of the appraised value of the conveyance if it is not 
evidence of a violation of law or has design or other characteristics 
that particularly suit it for use in illegal activities. This bond must 
be in the form of a traveler's check, a money order, a cashier's check 
or an irrevocable letter of credit made payable to the United States 
Postal Service. A bond in the form of a cashier's check will be 
considered as paid once the check has been accepted for payment by the 
financial institution which issued the check.
    (d) Forfeiture of the bond. If a substitute res bond is filed and 
the conveyance is judicially forfeited, the court

[[Page 74]]

will forfeit the bond in lieu of the property.

defined in Sec. 233.8(b) for violations involving the possession of 
personal use quantities of a controlled substance, written notice will

<R05>
Sec. 233.11  Mail reasonably suspected of being dangerous to persons or property.

    (a) Screening of mail. When the Chief Postal Inspector determines 
that there is a credible threat that certain mail may contain a bomb, 
explosives, or other material that would endanger life or property, 
including firearms which are not mailable under Section C024 of the 
Domestic Mail Manual, the Chief Postal Inspector may, without a search 
warrant or the sender's or addressee's consent, authorize the screening 
of such mail by any means capable of identifying explosives, nonmailable 
firearms, or other dangerous contents in the mails. The screening must 
be within the limits of this section and without opening mail that is 
sealed against inspection or revealing the contents of correspondence 
within mail that is sealed against inspection. The screening is 
conducted according to these requirements.
    (1) Screening of mail authorized by paragraph (a) of this section 
must be limited to the least quantity of mail necessary to respond to 
the threat.
    (2) Such screening must be done in a manner that does not avoidably 
delay the screened mail.
    (3) The Chief Postal Inspector may authorize screening of mail by 
postal employees and by persons not employed by the Postal Service under 
such instruction that require compliance with this part and protect the 
security of the mail. No information obtained from such screening may be 
disclosed unless authorized by this part.
    (4) Mail of insufficient weight to pose a hazard to air or surface 
transportation, or to contain firearms which are not mailable under 
Section C024 of the Domestic Mail Manual, and international transit mail 
must be excluded from such screening.
    (5) After screening conducted under paragraph (a) of this section, 
mail that is reasonably suspected of posing an immediate and substantial 
danger to life or limb, or an immediate and substantial danger to 
property, may be treated by postal employees as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (6) After screening, mail sealed against inspection that presents 
doubts about whether its contents are hazardous, that cannot be resolved 
without opening, must be reported to the Postal Inspection Service. Such 
mail must be disposed of under instructions promptly furnished by the 
Inspection Service.
    (b) Threatening pieces of mail. Mail, sealed or unsealed, reasonably 
suspected of posing an immediate danger to life or limb or an immediate 
and substantial danger to property may, without a search warrant, be 
detained, opened, removed from postal custody, and processed or treated, 
but only to the extent necessary to determine and eliminate the danger 
and only if a complete written and sworn statement of the detention, 
opening, removal, or treatment, and the circumstances that prompted it, 
signed by the person purporting to act under this section, is promptly 
forwarded to the Chief Postal Inspector.
    (c) Reports. Any person purporting to act under this section who 
does not report his or her action to the Chief Postal Inspector under 
the requirements of this section, or whose action is determined after 
investigation not to have been authorized, is subject to

[[Page 75]]

disciplinary action or criminal prosecution or both.

mailing of matter which is nonmailable, or engaged in conducting a 
lottery, gift enterprise, or scheme for the distribution of money or of 
real or personal property, by lottery, chance, or drawing of any kind.
    (b) Enforcement. Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3012, any person:
    (1) Who, through the use of the mail, evades or attempts to evade 
the effect of an order issued under 39 U.S.C. 3005(a)(1) or 3005(a)(2);
    (2) Who fails to comply with an order issued under 39 U.S.C.

actual knowledge of any such order, is in privity with any person 
described by paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section, and engages in 
conduct to assist any such person to evade, attempt to evade, or fail to 
comply with such order, as the case may be, through the use of the mail;

Shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty in an amount 
not to exceed $11,000 for each day that such person engages in conduct 
described by this paragraph (b). A separate penalty may be assessed 
under this paragraph (b) with respect to the conduct described by 
paragraphs (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section.

    (a) Description. (1) Stations are established within the corporate 
limits or boundary, and branches are established outside the corporate 
limits or boundary of the city, town, or village in which the main post 
office is located. Stations and branches may be designated by number, 
letter or name. As a general rule, branches are named.
    (2) Stations and branches transact registry and money order 
business, sell postage supplies, and accept matter for mailing. Delivery 
service, post office boxes, and other services may be provided when

<R05>
Sec. 241.3  Discontinuance of post offices.

    (a) Introduction--(1) Coverage. This section establishes the rules 
governing the Postal Service's consideration of whether an existing post 
office should

[[Page 77]]

be discontinued. The rules cover any proposal to replace a post office 
with a community post office, station or branch, consolidation with 
another post office, and any proposal to discontinue a post office 
without providing a replacement facility.
    (2) Legal requirements. Under 39 U.S.C. 404(b), any decision to 
close or consolidate a post office must be based on certain criteria. 
These include the effect on the community served; the effect on 
employees of the post office; compliance with government policy 
established by law that the Postal Service must provide a maximum degree 
of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, 
and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining; the economic 
savings to the Postal Service; and any other factors the Postal Service 
determines necessary. In addition, certain mandatory procedures apply as 
follows:
    (i) The public must be given 60 days' notice of a proposed action to 
enable the persons served by a post office to evaluate the proposal and 
provide comments.
    (ii) After public comments are received and taken into account, any 
final determination to close or consolidate a post office must be made 
in writing and must include findings covering all the required 
considerations.
    (iii) The written determination must be made available to persons 
served by the post office at least 60 days before the discontinuance 
takes effect.
    (iv) Within the first 30 days after the written determination is 
made available, any person regularly served by the affected post office 
may appeal the decision to the Postal Rate Commission.
    (v) The Commission may only affirm the Postal Service determination 
or return the matter for further consideration but may not modify the 
determination.
    (vi) The Commission is required by 39 U.S.C. 404(b)(5) to make a 
determination on the appeal no later than 120 days after receiving the 
appeal.
    (vii) The following is a summary table of the notice and appeal 
periods under the statute for these regulations.

[[Page 78]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09JN94.001

    (3) Additional requirements. This section also includes:
    (i) Rules to ensure that the community's identity as a postal 
address is preserved.
    (ii) Rules for consideration of a proposed discontinuance and for 
its implementation, if approved. These rules are designed to ensure that 
the reasons leading a district manager, Customer Service and Sales, to 
propose the discontinuance of a particular post office are fully 
articulated and disclosed at a stage that enables customer participation 
to make a helpful contribution toward the final decision.
    (b) Preservation of community address--(1) Policy. The Postal 
Service permits the use of a community's separate address to the extent 
practicable.
    (2) ZIP Code assignment. The ZIP Code for each address formerly 
served from the discontinued post office should be kept, wherever 
practical. In some cases, the ZIP Code originally assigned to the 
discontinued post office may be changed if the responsible district 
manager, Customer Service and Sales, submits a request with 
justification to his or her vice president, Area Operations, before the 
proposal to discontinue the post office is posted.
    (i) In a consolidation, the ZIP Code for the replacement community 
post office, station, or branch is the ZIP Code originally assigned to 
the discontinued post office.
    (ii) If the ZIP Code is changed and the parent post office covers 
several ZIP Codes, the ZIP Code must be that of the delivery area within 
which the facility is located.
    (3) Post office name in address. If all the delivery addresses using 
the name of the post office to be discontinued are assigned the same ZIP 
Code, customers

[[Page 79]]

may continue to use the discontinued post office name in their 
addresses, instead of the new delivering post office name.
    (4) Name of facility established by consolidation. If a post office 
to be discontinued is consolidated with one or more other post offices 
by establishing in its place a community post office, classified or 
contract station, or branch affiliated with another post office involved 
in the consolidation, the replacement unit is given the same name of the 
discontinued post office.
    (5) List of discontinued post offices. Publication 65, National 
Five-Digit ZIP Code and Post Office Directory, lists all post offices 
discontinued after March 14, 1977, for mailing address purposes only if 
they are used in addresses. The ZIP Codes listed for discontinued 
offices are those assigned under this subsection.
    (c) Initial proposal--(1) In general. If a district manager, 
Customer Service and Sales, believes that the discontinuance of a post 
office within his or her responsibility may be warranted, the manager:
    (i) Must use the standards and procedures in Sec. 241.3 (c) and 
(d).
    (ii) Must investigate the situation.
    (iii) May propose the post office be discontinued.
    (2) Consolidation. The proposed action may include a consolidation 
of post offices to substitute a community post office or a classified or 
contract station or branch for the discontinued post office if:
    (i) The communities served by two or more post offices are being 
merged into a single incorporated village, town, or city; or
    (ii) A replacement facility is necessary for regular and effective 
service to the area served by the post office considered for 
discontinuance.
    (3) Views of postmasters. Whether the discontinuance under 
consideration involves a consolidation or not, the district manager, 
Customer Service and Sales, must discuss the matter with the postmaster 
(or the officer in charge) of the post office considered for 
discontinuance, and with the postmaster of any other post office 
affected by the change. The manager should make sure that these 
officials submit written comments and suggestions as part of the record 
when the proposal is reviewed.
    (4) Preparation of written proposal. The district manager, Customer 
Service and Sales, must gather and preserve for the record all 
documentation used to assess the proposed change. If the manager thinks 
the proposed action is warranted, he or she must prepare a document 
titled ``Proposal to (Close) (Consolidate) the (Name) Post Office.'' 
This document must describe, analyze, and justify in sufficient detail 
to Postal Service management and affected customers the proposed service 
change. The written proposal must address each of the following matters 
in separate sections:
    (i) Responsiveness to community postal needs. It is the policy of 
the Government, as established by law, that the Postal Service will 
provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to 
rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not 
self-sustaining. The proposal should (A) contrast the services available 
before and after the proposed change; (B) describe how the changes 
respond to the postal needs of the affected customers; and (C) highlight 
particular aspects of customer service that might be less advantageous 
as well as more advantageous.
    (ii) Effect on community. The proposal must include an analysis of 
the effect the proposed discontinuance might have on the community 
served, and discuss the application of the requirements in Sec. 
241.3(b).
    (iii) Effect on employees. The written proposal must summarize the 
possible effects of the change on the postmaster, supervisors, and other 
employees of the post office considered for discontinuance. (The 
district manager, Customer Service and Sales, must suggest measures to 
comply with personnel regulations related to post office discontinuance 
and consolidation.)
    (iv) Savings. The proposal must include an analysis of the economic 
savings to the Postal Service from the proposed action, including the 
cost or savings expected from each major factor contributing to the 
overall estimate.

[[Page 80]]

    (v) Other factors. The proposal should include an analysis of other 
factors that the district manager, Customer Service and Sales, 
determines are necessary for a complete evaluation of the proposed 
change, whether favorable or unfavorable.
    (vi) Summary. The proposal must include a summary that explains why 
the proposed action is necessary, and assesses how the factors 
supporting the proposed change outweigh any negative factors. In taking 
competing considerations into account, the need to provide regular and 
effective service is paramount.
    (vii) Notice. The proposal must include the following notice: ``This 
Is A Proposal. It Is Not A Final Determination To (Close) (Consolidate) 
This Post Office.''
    (A) If a final determination is made to close or consolidate this 
post office, after public comments on this proposal are received and 
taken into account, a notice of that final determination must be posted 
in this post office.
    (B) The final determination must contain instructions on how 
affected customers may appeal that decision to the Postal Rate 
Commission. Any such appeal must be received by the Commission within 30 
days of the posting of the final determination.
    (d) Notice, public comment, and record--(1) Posting proposal and 
comment notice. A copy of the written proposal and a signed invitation 
for comments must be posted prominently in each affected post office. 
The invitation for comments must:
    (i) Ask interested persons to provide written comments within 60 
days, to a stated address, offering specific opinions and information, 
favorable or unfavorable, on the potential effect of the proposed change 
on postal services and the community.
    (ii) State that copies of the proposal with attached optional 
comment forms are available in the affected post offices.
    (iii) Provide a name and telephone number to call for information.
    (2) Proposal and comment notice. The following is a sample format 
that may be used for the proposal and comment notice.

[[Page 81]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09JN94.002

    (3) Other steps. In addition to providing notice and inviting 
comment, the district manager, Customer Service and Sales, must take any 
other steps necessary to ensure that the persons served by the affected 
post office understand the nature and implications of the proposed 
action (e.g., meeting with community groups and following up on comments 
received that seem to be based on incorrect assumptions or information).
    (i) If oral contacts develop views or information not previously 
documented, whether favorable or unfavorable to the proposal, the 
district manager, Customer Service and Sales, should encourage persons 
offering the views or information to provide written comments to 
preserve them for the record.
    (ii) As a factor in making his or her decision, the district 
manager, Customer Service and Sales, may not rely

[[Page 82]]

on communications received from anyone unless submitted in writing for 
the record.
    (4) Record. The district manager, Customer Service and Sales, must 
keep as part of the record for his or her consideration and for review 
by the vice president, Delivery and Retail, all the documentation 
gathered about the proposed change.
    (i) The record must include all information that the district 
manager, Customer Service and Sales, considered, and the decision must 
stand on the record. No information or views submitted by customers may 
be excluded.
    (ii) The docket number assigned to the proposal must be the ZIP Code 
of the office proposed for closing or consolidation.
    (iii) The record must include a chronological index in which each 
document contained is identified and numbered as filed.
    (iv) As written communications are received in response to the 
public notice and invitation for comments, they are included in the 
record.
    (v) A complete copy of the record must be available for public 
inspection during normal office hours at the post office proposed for 
discontinuance or at the post office providing alternative service, if 
the office to be discontinued was temporarily suspended, beginning no 
later than the date on which notice is posted and extending through the 
comment period.
    (vi) Copies of documents in the record (except the proposal and 
comment form) are provided on request and on payment of fees as noted in 
the Administrative Support Manual (ASM) Sec. 352.6.
    (e) Consideration of public comments and final local 
recommendation--(1) Analysis of comments. After waiting not less than 60 
days after notice is posted under Sec. 241.3(d)(1) the district 
manager, Customer Service and Sales, must prepare an analysis of the 
public comments received for consideration and inclusion in the record. 
If possible, comments subsequently received should also be included in 
the analysis. The analysis should list and briefly describe each point 
favorable to the proposal and each point unfavorable to the proposal. 
The analysis should identify to the extent possible how many comments 
support each point listed.
    (2) Re-evaluation of proposal. After completing the analysis, the 
district manager, Customer Service and Sales, must review the proposal 
and re-evaluate all the tentative conclusions previously made in light 
of additional customer information and views in the record.
    (i) Discontinuance not warranted. If the district manager, Customer 
Service and Sales, decides against the proposed discontinuance, he or 
she must post, in the post office considered for discontinuance, a 
notice stating that the proposed closing or consolidation is not 
warranted.
    (ii) Discontinuance warranted. If the district manager, Customer 
Service and Sales, decides that the proposed discontinuance is 
justified, the appropriate sections of the proposal must be revised, 
taking into account the comments received from the public. After making 
necessary revisions, the manager must:
    (A) Forward the revised proposal and the entire record to the vice 
president, Delivery and Retail.
    (B) Attach a certificate that all documents in the record are 
originals or true and correct copies.
    (f) Postal Service decision--(1) In general. The vice president, 
Delivery and Retail, or a designee must review the proposal of the 
district manager, Customer Service and Sales. This review and the 
decision on the proposal must be based on and supported by the record 
developed by the district manager, Customer Service and Sales. The vice 
president, Delivery and Retail, can instruct the district manager to 
provide more information to supplement the record. Each instruction and 
the response must be added to the record. The decision on the proposal 
of the district manager, which must also be added to the record, may 
approve or disapprove the proposal, or return it for further action as 
set forth in this paragraph (f).
    (2) Approval. The vice president, Delivery and Retail or a designee 
may approve the proposal of the district manager, Customer Service and 
Sales, with or without further revisions. If approved, the term ``Final 
Determination''

[[Page 83]]

is substituted for ``Proposal'' in the title. A copy of the Final 
Determination must be provided to the district manager. The Final 
Determination constitutes the Postal Service determination for the 
purposes of 39 U.S.C. 404(b). The Final Determination must include the 
following notices:
    (i) Supporting materials. ``Copies of all materials on which this 
Final Determination is based are available for public inspection at the 
(Name) Post Office during normal office hours.''
    (ii) Appeal rights. ``This Final Determination to (close) 
(consolidate) the (name) Post Office may be appealed by any person 
served by that office to the Postal Rate Commission. Any appeal must be 
received by the Commission within 30 days of the date this Final 
Determination was posted. If an appeal is filed, copies of appeal 
documents prepared by the Postal Rate Commission, or the parties to the 
appeal, must be made available for public inspection at the (name) Post 
Office during normal office hours.''
    (3) Disapproval. The vice president, Delivery and Retail, or a 
designee may disapprove the proposal of the district manager, Customer 
Service and Sales, and return it and the record to the manager with 
written reasons for disapproval. The manager must post a notice in each 
affected post office that the proposed closing or consolidation has been 
determined to be unwarranted.
    (4) Return for further action. The vice president, Delivery and 
Retail, or a designee may return the proposal of the district manager, 
Customer Service and Sales, with written instructions to give additional 
consideration to matters in the record, or to obtain additional 
information. Such instructions must be placed in the record.
    (5) Public file. Copies of each Final Determination and each 
disapproval of a proposal by the vice president, Delivery and Retail, 
must be placed on file in the Postal Service Headquarters library.
    (g) Implementation of final determination--(1) Notice of final 
determination to discontinue post office. The district manager, Customer 
Service and Sales, must:
    (i) Provide notice of the Final Determination by posting a copy 
prominently in the affected post office or offices. The date of posting 
must be noted on the first page of the posted copy as follows: ``Date of 
posting:'' The district manager, Customer Service and Sales, must notify 
the vice president, Delivery and Retail, of the date of posting.
    (ii) Ensure that a copy of the completed record is available for 
public inspection during normal business hours at each post office where 
the Final Determination is posted for 30 days from the posting date.
    (iii) Provide copies of documents in the record on request and 
payment of fees as noted in the ASM 352.6.
    (2) Implementation of determinations not appealed. If no appeal is 
filed pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 404(b)(5), the official closing date of the 
office must be published in the Postal Bulletin, effective the first 
Saturday 90 days after the Final Determination was posted. A district 
manager, Customer Service and Sales, may request a different date for 
official discontinuance in the Post Office Change Announcement document 
submitted to the vice president, Delivery and Retail. However, the post 
office may not be discontinued sooner than 60 days after the posting of 
the notice required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (3) Actions during appeal--(i) Implementation of discontinuance. If 
an appeal is filed, only the vice president, Delivery and Retail, may 
direct a discontinuance before disposition of the appeal. However, the 
post office may not be discontinued sooner than 60 days after the 
posting of notice required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Display of appeal documents. Legal Policy and Ratemaking Law, 
Postal Service General Counsel, must provide the district manager, 
Customer Service and Sales, with copies of all pleadings, notices, 
orders, briefs, and opinions filed in the appeal proceeding.
    (A) The district manager must ensure that copies of all these 
documents are prominently displayed and available for public inspection 
in the post office to be discontinued. If the operation of that post 
office has been suspended, the

[[Page 84]]

manager must display copies in the affected post offices.
    (B) All documents except the Postal Rate Commission's final order 
and opinion must be displayed until the final order and opinion are 
issued. The final order and opinion must be displayed for 30 days.
    (4) Actions following appeal decision--(i) Determination affirmed. 
If the Commission dismisses the appeal or affirms the Postal Service's 
determination, the official closing date of the office must be published 
in the Postal Bulletin, effective the first Saturday 90 days after the 
Commission renders its opinion, if not previously implemented under 
Sec. 241.3(g)(3)(i). However, the post office may not be discontinued 
sooner than 60 days after the posting of the notice required under Sec. 
241.3(g)(1).
    (ii) Determination returned for further consideration. If the 
Commission returns the matter for further consideration, the vice 
president, Delivery and Retail, must direct that either:
    (A) Notice be provided under paragraph (f)(3) of this section that 
the proposed discontinuance is determined not to be warranted or
    (B) The matter be returned to an appropriate stage under this 
section for further consideration following such instructions as the 
vice president, Delivery and Retail, may provide.

<R05>
Sec. 241.4  Expansion, relocation, and construction of post offices.

    (a) Application. (1) This section applies when the USPS contemplates 
any one of the following projects with respect to a customer service 
facility: expansion, relocation to another existing building, or new 
construction, except when the project is to meet an emergency 
requirement or for temporary use. Emergency situations include, but are 
not limited to, earthquakes, floods, fire, lease terminations, safety 
factors, environmental causes, or any other actions that would force an 
immediate relocation from an existing facility. Temporary relocation of 
space is used for, but not limited to, holidays, special events, or for 
overflow business. Use of emergency and temporary space will be limited 
to 180 days in duration. Any additional incremental time periods of up 
to 180 days each must be approved by the Vice President, Facilities.
    (2) This section does not apply when the project under consideration 
is limited to repair and alterations, such as--
    (i) Painting;
    (ii) Repairs;
    (iii) Replacement or upgrade of structural or functional elements of 
a postal building or of its equipment;
    (iv) Paving, striping, or other repair of parking areas;
    (v) Landscaping.
    (b) Purpose. The purpose of the procedures required by this section 
is to assure increased opportunities for members of the communities who 
may be affected by certain USPS facility projects, along with local 
officials, to convey their views concerning the contemplated project and 
have them considered prior to any final decision to expand, relocate to 
another existing building, or construct a new building that is owned or 
leased.
    (c) Expansion, relocation, new construction. When a need is 
identified that will require the expansion, relocation, or new 
construction of a customer service facility, postal representatives 
responsible for the project will take the following steps in accordance 
with the time schedule shown:
    (1) Personally visit one or more of the highest ranking local public 
officials (generally individuals holding elective office). During the 
visit, the postal representatives will--
    (i) Identify the need and fully describe the project that is under 
consideration to meet it, explain the process by which the Postal 
Service will solicit and consider input from the affected community, and 
solicit a working partnership with the community officials for the 
success of the project.
    (ii) Emphasize that in meeting a need for increased space, the first 
priority is to expand the existing facility; the second priority is to 
find an existing building in the same area as the current facility; and 
the third option is to build on a new site; all within the downtown 
area, if possible.
    (iii) Ask that a Postal Service presentation of the project be 
placed on the

[[Page 85]]

regular agenda of a public meeting or hearing. If no such meeting is 
planned within the next 60 days or the agenda of a planned meeting 
cannot accommodate the project, the USPS will schedule its own public 
hearing concerning the project, and will advertise the meeting or 
hearing in a local general circulation newspaper.
    (iv) Give the local officials a letter describing the intended 
project.
    (2) Notify the lessor of the affected facility of the project, in 
writing.
    (3) Send an initial news release to local communications media.
    (4)(i) Post in the public lobby of the affected post offices a copy 
of the letter given to local officials, or the news release, or, space 
permitting, both. If such information is available at the time, include 
in the posting a public notice of the date, time, and location of a 
public meeting or hearing at least 7 days prior to the meeting or 
hearing.
    (ii) Except as provided in this paragraph, attend, or conduct, one 
or more public hearings to describe the project to the community, invite 
questions, solicit written comment, and describe the process by which 
community input will be considered. If it is believed at the time that 
the existing facility is not able to be expanded or that expansion is 
impracticable, disclose that fact and the reasons supporting that 
belief. If, during the public meeting or hearing process, a new 
development should occur to allow for an expansion of the existing 
facility, the Postal Service will make a good faith effort in pursuing 
this alternative. Under exceptional circumstances that would prevent 
postal representatives from attending a public meeting or conducting a 
postal hearing on the planned project within a reasonable time, and 
subject to approval of the Vice President, Facilities, the Postal 
Service may distribute a notification card to all affected customers, 
seeking their comments or other feedback. An example of exceptional 
circumstances would be a project in a sparsely populated area remote 
from the seat of local government or any forum where a postal conducted 
meeting could be held.
    (iii) At any public meeting or hearing, advise local officials and 
the community of their appeal rights and the process by which an appeal 
can be made. Information provided must include time limitations and an 
address for the appeal.
    (5) Review comments and notify local officials of decision. Not less 
than 15 days after the date of the most recent public meeting, or after 
receipt of notification cards, make a decision that takes into account 
community input and is consistent with postal objectives (e.g., 
expansion, relocation to another building, or construction of a new 
owned or leased facility), and notify local officials in writing. This 
notification must include information on the availability and terms of 
review under paragraph (c)(6) of this section. At the same time, post a 
copy of the notification letter in the local post office for the 
community. Take no action on the decision for at least 30 days following 
notification of local officials and the community.
    (6) Within the time period identified in paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section, any person may request in writing that the decision be reviewed 
by the Vice President, Facilities, at Postal Service Headquarters. No 
particular format is required for requesting review, but the request 
must be in writing and identify the post office or location affected; 
and should identify the decision objected to, and state the reasons for 
the objection. The Vice President, Facilities, will obtain the views of 
the decision maker, review relevant parts of the project file, and if 
necessary request more information from the appellant. Upon review of 
the facts, the Vice President, or a representative, will issue a written 
determination, if possible, within 15 days. In no event will the Postal 
Service take action on the decision being reviewed until 15 days 
following issuance of the final review determination. If the 
determination on review is to set aside the decision, the project 
process will return to the public hearing stage of paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section.
    (7) Advertise for sites and existing buildings, in accordance with 
existing postal procedures.
    (d) Discontinuance of post offices; historic preservation. (1) It is 
the policy of the Postal Service, by virtue of Board of Governors 
Resolution No. 82-7, to

[[Page 86]]

comply with Section 106 of the general provisions of the National 
Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470, et seq., Executive Order 
12072, and Executive Order 13006. Therefore, any facility project that 
will have an effect on cultural resources will be undertaken in 
accordance with that policy.
    (2) Any action involving the closing or other discontinuance of a 
post office shall be undertaken only in accordance with 39 U.S.C. 404(b) 
and 39 CFR 243.1. In the event a facility action is subject to both this 
section, and either the NHPA or the post office discontinuance 
requirements, all comment periods and other public participation matters 
shall be governed by those statutes.
    (e) Site selection. (1) When the decision is to advertise for sites 
and existing buildings, and after such sites have been identified, 
advise local officials in writing of all contending sites, and with 
respect to all sites not selected, provide an explanation. This notice 
will advise local officials, and the community, that no decision to 
select a site will be made for a minimum of 30 days, and that comments 
or discussions of all sites are solicited. Post a copy of this letter in 
the lobby of the affected post office for public notice.
    (2) Once a specific site is then selected, notify local officials in 
writing of the selection decision.
    (3) Take no final action to acquire or lease the selected site for 
30 days following the notification in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (f) Planning, zoning, building codes. In carrying out customer 
service facilities projects, it is the policy of the Postal Service to 
comply with local planning and zoning requirements and building codes 
consistent with prudent business practices and unique postal 
requirements. In order to promote a partnership with local officials and 
assure conformance with local building codes, plans and drawings will be 
sent to the appropriate building department or other officials for 
review. Where payment of fees is normally required of private entities, 
the Postal Service will pay a reasonable fee for the review. The Postal 
Service will give local public officials written notice of any timely, 
written objections or recommendations that it does not plan to adopt or 
implement.
    (g) Continuing communication. During construction, whether 
renovation or new construction, the postmaster should keep local 
officials and the community informed via letters and news releases. The 
postmaster and other postal officials should plan, conduct and invite 
the community and local officials to any ``grand opening'', as 
appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 254.1  Adoption of U.S. Access Board Standards as Postal Service 

Standards of Facility Accessibility.

    (a) The United States Postal Service adopts as its Architectural 
Barriers Act (ABA) ``Standards for Facility Accessibility,'' the 
following sections of 36 CFR part 1191:
    Appendix A to Part 1191, Table of Contents for apps. C, D, and E.
    Appendix C to Part 1191, Architectural Barriers Act, Scoping (which 
contains ABA Chapter 1, Application and Administration, and ABA Chapter 
2, Scoping requirements); pertinent parts of Appendix D to Part 1191, 
Technical (which includes Chapters 3 through 10).
    Appendix E to Part 1191, List of Figures and Index.
    (b) These sections listed in paragraph (a) of this section are 
adopted verbatim, with the exception of the Advisory Notes, which are 
expressly excluded.

[[Page 88]]


<R05>
Sec. 254.2  Definition of primary function area and criteria used to determine

whether an alteration has an effect on an area containing a primary function 
          that is disproportionate to the overall alterations.

    (a) Terminology. The new accessibility guidelines require that 
certain terms be defined by the participating federal agencies. In the 
U.S. Access Board's 36 CFR part 1191, Appendix C, ABA chapter 2, section 
F202.6.2 requires that ``primary function areas'' be defined and Section 
F202.4 contains requirements for alterations affecting ``primary 
function areas'' stating, ``* * *an alteration that affects or could 
affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary 
function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent 
feasible, the path of travel to the altered area, including the rest 
rooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are 
readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, 
unless such alterations are disproportionate to the overall alterations 
in terms of cost and scope as determined under criteria established by 
the Administrator of * * * the United States Postal Service.''
    (b) Primary function areas. For purposes of this part, the primary 
function of the Postal Service is to provide mail service for its 
customers, that is to accept, distribute, transport and deliver the 
mail. Two essential facilities for fulfilling these functions are 
customer lobby areas where customers conduct their retail transactions, 
access mail depositories and post office boxes and work room areas where 
postal employees distribute the mail and perform other core postal 
operations. Therefore, for purposes of the accessibility guidelines 
applicable to the Postal Service under the Architectural Barriers Act, 
two primary function areas are identified: Customer Lobbies and Workroom 
Areas.
    (c) Disproportionality. (1) According to Section F202.6.2, 
``alteration'' of elements in a primary function area can trigger a 
requirement to make accessibility improvements along the path of travel 
to the area and improvements to rest rooms, telephones, and drinking 
fountains that serve the altered area if the alteration ``affects or 
could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary 
function.'' It is conceivable that almost any repair or alteration 
project in a ``primary function area'' could affect the usability of the 
area. Therefore a literal interpretation of this provision could require 
an expansion of the scope of virtually any alteration in a primary 
function area, regardless of the size and scope of the original project. 
According to Section F202.6.2, accessibility improvements must be made 
to the path of travel to the altered area and to rest rooms, telephones, 
and drinking fountains that serve the altered area ``unless such 
alterations are disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of 
cost and scope''.
    (2) For purposes of the accessibility guidelines applicable to the 
Postal Service under the Architectural Barriers Act, two criteria must 
be considered in making a determination whether accessibility 
improvements are disproportionate to the cost and scope of the original 
alteration: a magnitude threshold for the original alteration and a 
maximum ``percentage threshold'' for the accessibility alteration.
    (d) Magnitude threshold. It is anticipated that, in most cases, a 
significant additional effort would be required to assess physical 
conditions along the path of travel and for rest rooms, telephones, and 
drinking fountains that serve the altered area, and to determine the 
scope, budget and appropriate design requirements for any corrective 
alterations. Unless the original alteration is of substantial magnitude, 
a disproportionate effort would be devoted to such investigation, 
design, and administration leaving few, if any funds to accomplish 
corrective work. Accordingly, a ``magnitude threshold'' is established 
such that no accessibility improvements to the path of travel, nor to 
any associated facilities, shall be required under F202.6.2 for 
alterations that have an estimated total cost less than 20 percent of 
the fair market value of the facility.
    (e) Percentage threshold. For alterations subject to F202.6.2 that 
meet or exceed the ``magnitude threshold,'' the

[[Page 89]]

maximum cost for accessibility improvements to the path of travel, 
including all costs for accessibility improvements to rest rooms, 
telephones, and drinking fountains that serve the altered area, shall 
not exceed 20 percent of the total cost of the original alteration. 
Costs for accessibility improvements in excess of the 20 percent 
threshold shall be deemed ``disproportionate.''

to achieve a level of accomplishment, an individual with a disability 
who meets the essential eligibility requirements and who can achieve the 
purpose of the program or activity without modifications in the program 
or activity that the agency can demonstrate would result in a 
fundamental alteration in its nature; or
    (2) With respect to any other program or activity, except for 
employment, an individual with a disability who meets the essential 
eligibility requirements for participation in, or receipt of benefits 
from, that program or activity; or
    (3) With respect to employment, an individual with a disability who 
can perform the essential functions of the job in question with or 
without reasonable accommodation.
    (i) Section 501 means section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
as amended. Section 501 is codified at 29 U.S.C. 791.

her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or 
activity conducted by the Postal Service.


<R05>
Sec. 255.4  Accessibility to electronic and information technology.

    (a) In accordance with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, the 
Postal Service shall ensure, absent an undue burden, that the electronic 
and information technology the agency procures allows--
    (1) Individuals with disabilities who are Postal Service employees 
or applicants to have access to and use of information and data that is 
comparable to the access to and use of information and data by Postal 
Service employees or applicants who are not individuals with 
disabilities; and
    (2) Individuals with disabilities who are members of the public 
seeking information or services from the Postal Service to have access 
to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to 
and use of information and data by members of the public who are not 
individuals with disabilities.
    (b) When procurement of electronic and information technology that 
meets the standards published by the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board would pose an undue burden, the Postal Service 
shall provide individuals with disabilities covered by paragraph (a) of 
this section with the information and data by an alternative means of 
access that allows the individuals to use the information and data.


<R05>
Sec. 255.5  Employment.

    No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of 
disability, be subjected to discrimination in employment with the Postal 
Service. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of

[[Page 91]]

501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 791. In 
accordance with 29 CFR part 1614, the Postal Service has established 
procedures for processing complaints of alleged employment 
discrimination, based upon disability, in the agency's handbook, Equal 
Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.
    (b) Section 504 complaints, members of the public. The procedures of 
this part shall apply to section 504 complaints alleging disability 
discrimination in any program or activity of the Postal Service and 
brought by members of the public.
    (c) Section 508 complaints, members of the public, employees, and 
applicants. The procedures of this part shall apply to section 508 
complaints alleging failure to provide access to electronic and 
information technology and brought by members of the public or by 
employees or applicants. Section 508 complaints shall be processed to 
provide the remedies required by section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.
    (d) Complaint Procedures. Any individual with a disability who 
believes that he or she has been subjected to discrimination prohibited 
by this part or by the alleged failure of the agency to provide access 
to electronic and information technology may file a complaint by 
following the procedures described herein. A complainant shall first 
exhaust informal administrative procedures before filing a formal 
complaint.
    (1) Informal complaints relating to Postal Service programs or 
activities and to EIT. (i) A complainant initiates the informal process 
by informing the responsible postal manager orally or in writing of the 
alleged discrimination or inaccessibility of Postal Service programs, 
activities, or EIT. Postal managers or employees who receive informal 
complaints that they lack the authority to resolve must promptly refer 
any such informal complaint to the appropriate postal manager, and at 
the same time must notify the complainant of the name, address, and 
telephone number of the person handling the complaint.
    (ii) Resolution of the informal complaint and time limits. Within 15 
days of receipt of the informal complaint, the responsible postal 
manager must send the complainant a written acknowledgement of the 
informal complaint. The written acknowledgment will include the date the 
complaint was filed and a description of the issue(s). If the matter 
cannot be resolved within 30 days of its receipt, the complainant must 
be sent a written interim report which explains the status of the 
informal complaint and the proposed resolution of the matter. On or 
before the 60th day from the agency's receipt of the informal complaint, 
the appropriate area/functional vice president within the Postal Service 
shall send a written decision to the complainant detailing the final 
disposition of the informal complaint and the reasons for that 
disposition. The decision shall contain the notice that the complainant 
may challenge an informal decision which denies relief either by 
proceeding in any other appropriate forum or by filing a formal 
complaint with the Vice President and Consumer Advocate. The notice will 
give the address of the Vice President and Consumer Advocate. The notice 
shall also state that if the complainant chooses to file a formal 
complaint, the complainant shall exhaust the formal complaint procedures 
before filing suit in any other forum.
    (iii) Automatic review. The responsible postal manager's proposed 
disposition of the informal complaint shall be submitted to the 
appropriate district/program manager for review. The district/program 
manager shall forward the proposed disposition to the area/functional 
vice president for review and issuance of the written decision. This 
automatic review process shall be completed such that the written 
decision of the area/functional vice president shall be sent to the 
complainant no later than the 60th day from the agency's receipt of the 
informal complaint.
    (2) Formal complaints. If an informal complaint filed under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section denies relief, the complainant may seek 
relief in any other appropriate forum, including the right to file a 
formal complaint with the Vice President and Consumer Advocate in 
accordance with the following procedures. If the complainant files a 
formal complaint with the Vice President and

[[Page 92]]

Consumer Advocate, the complainant shall exhaust the formal complaint 
procedures before filing suit in any other forum.
    (i) Where to file. Formal complaints relating to programs or 
activities conducted by the Postal Service or to access of Postal 
Service EIT may be filed with the Vice President and Consumer Advocate, 
United States Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW., Washington, DC 
20260.
    (ii) When to file. A formal complaint shall be filed within 30 days 
of the date the complainant receives the decision of the area/functional 
vice president to deny relief. For purposes of determining when a formal 
complaint is timely filed under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a 
formal complaint mailed to the agency shall be deemed filed on the date 
it is postmarked. Any other formal complaint shall be deemed filed on 
the date it is received by the Vice President and Consumer Advocate.
    (iii) Acceptance of the formal complaint. The Vice President and 
Consumer Advocate shall accept a timely filed formal complaint that 
meets the requirements of Sec. 255.2(d), that is filed after fulfilling 
the informal exhaustion procedures of Sec. 255.6(d)(1), and over which 
the agency has jurisdiction. The Vice President and Consumer Advocate 
shall notify the complainant of receipt and acceptance of the formal 
complaint within 15 days of the date the Vice President and Consumer 
Advocate received the formal complaint.
    (iv) Resolution of the formal complaint. Within 180 days of receipt 
and acceptance of a formal complaint over which the agency has 
jurisdiction, the Vice President and Consumer Advocate shall notify the 
complainant of the results of the investigation of the formal complaint. 
The notice shall be a written decision stating whether or not relief is 
being granted and the reasons for granting or denying relief. The notice 
shall state that it is the final decision of the Postal Service on the 
formal complaint.
    (e) No retaliation. No person shall be subject to retaliation for 
opposing any practice made unlawful by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
as amended, 29 U.S.C. 791, or for participating in any stage of 
administrative or judicial proceedings under the statute.


<R05>
Sec. 255.7  Special arrangements for postal services.

    Members of the public who are unable to use or who have difficulty 
using certain postal services may be eligible under postal regulations 
for special arrangements. Some of the special arrangements that the 
Postal Service has authorized are listed below. No one is required to 
use any special arrangement offered by the Postal Service, but an 
individual's refusal to make use of a particular special arrangement 
does not require the Postal Service to offer other special arrangements 
to that individual.
    (a) The Postal Operations Manual offers information on special 
arrangements for the following postal services:
    (1) Carrier delivery services and programs.
    (2) Postal retail services and programs.
    (i) Stamps by mail or phone.
    (ii) Retail service from rural carriers.
    (iii) Self-service postal centers. Self-service postal centers 
contain vending equipment for the sale of stamps and stamp items, and 
deposit boxes for parcels and letter mail. Many centers are accessible 
to individuals in wheelchairs. Information regarding the location of the 
nearest center may be obtained from a local post office.
    (b) The Domestic Mail Manual, the Administrative Support Manual, and 
the International Mail Manual contain information regarding postage-free 
mailing for mailings that qualify.
    (c) Inquiries and requests. Members of the public wishing further 
information about special arrangements for particular postal services 
may contact their local postal manager.
    (d) Response to a request or complaint regarding a special 
arrangement for postal services. A local postal manager receiving a 
request or complaint about a special arrangement for postal services 
must provide any arrangement as required by postal regulations. If no 
special arrangements are required by postal regulations, the local 
postal manager, in consultation with the district manager or area 
manager, as needed, may provide a special arrangement or

[[Page 93]]

take any action that will accommodate an individual with a disability as 
required by section 504 or by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 255.8  Access to postal facilities.

    (a) Legal requirements and policy--(1) ABA Standards. Where the 
design standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) of 1968, 42 
U.S.C. 4151 et seq., do not apply, the Postal Service may perform a 
discretionary retrofit to a facility in accordance with this part to 
accommodate individuals with disabilities.
    (2) Discretionary modifications. The Postal Service may modify 
facilities not legally required to conform to ABA standards when it 
determines that doing so would be consistent with efficient postal 
operations. In determining whether modifications not legally required 
should be made, due regard is to be given to:
    (i) The cost of the discretionary modification;
    (ii) The number of individuals to be benefited by the modification;
    (iii) The inconvenience, if any, to the general public;
    (iv) The anticipated useful life of the modification to the Postal 
Service;
    (v) Any requirement to restore a leased premises to its original 
condition at the expiration of the lease, and the cost of such 
restoration;
    (vi) The historic or architectural significance of the property in 
accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 16 
U.S.C. 470 et seq.;
    (vii) The availability of other options to foster service 
accessibility; and
    (viii) Any other factor that is relevant and appropriate to the 
decision.
    (b) Inquiries and requests. (1) Inquiries concerning access to 
postal facilities, and requests for discretionary alterations of postal 
facilities not covered by the design standards of the ABA, may be made 
to the local postal manager of the facility involved.
    (2) The local postal manager's response to a request or complaint 
regarding an alteration to a facility will be made after consultation 
with the district manager or the area manager. If the determination is 
made that modification to meet ABA design standards is not required, a 
discretionary alteration may be made on a case-by-case basis in 
accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 
If a discretionary alteration is not made, the local postal manager 
should determine if a special arrangement for postal services under 
Sec. 255.7 can be provided.


<R05>
Sec. 255.9  Other postal regulations; authority of postal managers and employees.

    This part supplements all other postal regulations. Nothing in this 
part is intended either to repeal, modify, or amend any other postal 
regulation, to authorize any postal manager or employee to violate or 
exceed any regulatory limit, or to confer any budgetary authority on any 
postal official or employee outside normal budgetary procedures.

    (b) Reimbursement. The Postal Service establishes reasonable fees 
and charges for nonpostal services performed for agencies of the Federal 
as well as State governments. In establishing such fees and charges, the 
Postal Service considers the value of time of the personnel directly 
involved in the performance of the service, including direct supervision 
and supporting functions, plus the cost of materials and supplies 
specifically sold, used or consumed. Also included is an element 
representing a reasonable share of Postal Service general overhead costs 
which are not attributable or assignable specifically to any product or 
service. The establishment of such fees and charges shall be reasonably 
consistent with the methods employed in establishing rates and fees for 
postal services then in effect.

[[Page 94]]

    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, 
arrangements for Postal Service participation in special surveys, 
censuses, and other activities must be made between the national 
headquarters of the requesting agencies and the Customer Services 
Department, U.S. Postal Service, Washington, DC 20260. Refer all 
requests to the Regional Postmaster General for forwarding to 
Headquarters. Authority to perform services for Government agencies is 
announced in the Postal Bulletin or by individual letters to the offices 
involved.
    (d) Housing Vacancy Surveys--(1) General. An interagency agreement 
between the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and the Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board (FHLBB) establishes the terms and conditions and reimbursement 
rates under which USPS will conduct Housing Vacancy Surveys in City 
Delivery offices when requested by FHLBB.
    (2) Restrictions. The Agreement only authorizes the disclosure of 
aggregate statistical data. Postal managers must not permit the name or 
address of any past or present postal patron, or any other person to be 
disclosed unless such disclosure is authorized in writing by USPS 
Regions or Headquarters and is not in violation of 39 U.S.C. 412.
    (3) Postmaster's Responsibility. (i) A postmaster will receive 
notification from FHLBB when his office has been selected to conduct a 
Housing Vacancy Survey. Normally, written notification will be mailed to 
the postmaster 30 days in advance of the date FHLBB would like USPS to 
conduct the survey, since USPS is under no obligation to use overtime or 
auxiliary assistance to conduct these surveys. The postmaster or his 
designee will schedule the survey on or near the date requested and will 
promptly reply to FHLBB so that the necessary forms will be provided on 
time.
    (ii) All necessary forms and instructions will be supplied directly 
to each post office to be surveyed. Postmasters will designate a manager 
in each delivery unit to coordinate the survey within the unit and to 
review completed survey forms for accuracy.
    (iii) FHLBB may request USPS to perform special or emergency surveys 
with less than 30 days advance notice. Since FHLBB has agreed to 
reimburse USPS at twice the normal rates for promptly performing such 
surveys, every reasonable effort should be made to accommodate such 
requests in a timely manner.
    (iv) Housing Vacancy Surveys will not be conducted during the month 
of December of any year.
    (v) Postmasters will notify the Office of Delivery and Collection, 
Washington, DC 20260, of the number of each type survey form completed 
for FHLBB. FHLBB will then remit payment directly to Headquarters, USPS.
    (vi) USPS will not release or publish any survey results except in 
response to a court order, subpoena, or as required by the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    (e) Unauthorized projects prohibited. Do not conduct special surveys 
or otherwise participate in any cooperative projects without the 
authorization in paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 259.2  Red Cross.

    (a) General. The Postal Service and the Red Cross cooperate to 
maintain communication between the individual and the community during 
times of disaster. This applies only to natural disasters such as those 
caused by floods, tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, explosions, 
etc., and not to those caused by enemy action.
    (b) Role of Postal Service. The Postal Service and the Red Cross 
will share information on the whereabouts of persons displaced by 
disasters, and otherwise cooperate with each other, as follows:
    (1) The Red Cross will use Form 3575, Change of Address Order, as a 
standard item in Red Cross disaster relief. It will urge disaster 
victims displaced from their homes to obtain and complete the forms, it 
will distribute the forms to disaster victims who need them, and it will 
collect from the victims and turn over to the Postal Service any 
completed forms received.

[[Page 95]]

    (2) The Postal Service will provide the Red Cross the blank forms 
needed.
    (3) During each disaster and subsequent disaster relief efforts, the 
Postal Service will establish a separate file of change of address forms 
completed by disaster victims, and will make available to the Red Cross 
information in the file. This information will be used by the Red Cross 
only to locate individuals and families, to answer inquiries from 
relatives and friends concerning the whereabouts and welfare of the 
disaster victims, or to make contact with disaster victims who have 
applied for assistance from the Red Cross but who cannot be located 
because of a change of address.
    (4) The Postal Service and the Red Cross will encourage appropriate 
local postal officials and Red Cross chapters to maintain contact with 
each other and to participate in local and community planning for 
disasters.
    (5) When appropriate, the Postal Service and the Red Cross will meet 
and exchange information at the national headquarters level concerning 
the effectiveness of their joint efforts for disaster relief.
    (6) Regional Postmasters General and Postal Inspectors in Charge are 
responsible for seeing that post offices implement these cooperative 
arrangements in disaster situations.
    (7) The instructions in Sec. 259.2 serve as a broad framework 
within which field officials of both agencies may coordinate their 
facilities and resources. However, postal officials shall cooperate with 
Red Cross officials to the maximum feasible degree during times of 
natural disasters.

records available to the public to the maximum extent consistent with 
the public interest. This policy requires a practice of full disclosure 
subject only to the specific exemptions required or authorized by law.
    (b) The exemptions from mandatory disclosure provided by section 
552(b) of title 5, and section 410(c) of title 39, U.S.C., for various 
types of records, reflect the fact that under some circumstances the 
public interest may be better served by leaving the disclosure of 
particular records to the discretion of the Postal Service than by 
requiring their disclosure. As to those records the disclosure of which 
is not prohibited by statute, Executive Order, or regulation, the 
discretion vested in the Postal Service is exercised after giving 
consideration to the following: The effect of non-disclosure on the 
public's right to know about a particular matter; the effect of 
disclosure on the right of privacy of any affected individuals; the 
effect of disclosure on the public interest in the economical, 
efficient, and orderly operation of the nation's mail system; and any 
other factors that may be relevant under the circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 265.6  Availability of records.

    (a) Records available to the public on request--(1) General. Postal 
Service records are available for inspection or copying at the request 
of any person, in accordance with the provisions of this part, except as 
otherwise provided by law or regulations, including but not limited to 
paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. Certain categories of 
records of particular interest are available on a continuing basis as 
provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (3), and (4) of this section and are 
listed in a public index as provided in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of 
this section. Access to other records may be requested on an individual 
basis in accordance with the procedures provided in Sec. 265.7. 
Official records which are maintained on an electronic storage medium 
will normally be made available, in accordance with this part, as an 
exact duplicate of the requested original in a form readable by the 
human eye, such as a computer print-out. On request, records will be 
provided in a different form or format if they are maintained in the 
requested form or format or if they can be readily reproduced in the 
requested form or format.
    (2) Opinions. All final opinions and orders made in the adjudication 
of cases by the Judicial Officer and Administrative Law Judges, all 
final determinations pursuant to section 404(b) of title 39, United 
States Code, to close or consolidate a post office, or to disapprove a 
proposed closing or consolidation, all advisory opinions concerning the 
private express statutes issued pursuant to 39 CFR 310.6, and all bid 
protest decisions are on file and available for inspection and copying

1996, also at the Postal Service's world wide web site identified at 
Sec. 265.5.
    (3) Administrative manuals and instructions to staff. The manuals, 
instructions, and other publications of the Postal Service that affect 
members of the public are available through the Headquarters Library and 
at many post offices and other postal facilities. Those which are 
available to the public but are not listed for sale may be inspected in 
the Headquarters Library, at any postal facility which maintains a

[[Page 102]]

copy, or, if created on or after November 1, 1996, through the world 
wide web site identified at Sec. 265.5. Copies of publications which 
are not listed as for sale or as available free of charge may be 
obtained by paying a fee in accordance with Sec. 265.9.
    (4) Previously released records. Records processed and disclosed 
after March 31, 1997, in response to a Freedom of Information Act 
request, which the Postal Service determines have become or are likely 
to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same 
records, are available for inspection and copying at the Headquarters 
Library. Any such records created by the Postal Service on or after 
November 1, 1996, also will be available at the Postal Service's world 
wide web site identified at Sec. 265.5. Records described in this 
paragraph that were not created by, or on behalf of, the Postal Service 
generally will not be available at the world wide web site. Records will 
be available in the form in which they were originally disclosed, except 
to the extent that they contain information that is not appropriate for 
public disclosure and may be withheld pursuant to this section. Any 
deleted material will be marked and the applicable exemption(s) 
indicated in accordance with Sec. 265.7(d)(3). A general index of the 
records described in this paragraph is available for inspection and 
copying at the Headquarters Library. [Beginning on or before December 
31, 1999, the index also will be available at the Postal Service's world 
wide web site.]
    (5) Public index. (i) A public index is maintained in the 
Headquarters Library and at the world wide web site of all final 
opinions and orders made by the Postal Service in the adjudication of 
cases, Postal Service policy statements which may be relied on as 
precedents in the disposition of cases, administrative staff manuals and 
instructions that affect the public, and other materials which the 
Postal Service elects to index and make available to the public on 
request in the manner set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) The index contains references to matters issued after July 4, 
1967, and may reference matters issued prior to that date.
    (iii) Any person may arrange for the inspection of any matter in the 
public index in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 265.7.
    (iv) Copies of the public index and of matters listed in the public 
index may be purchased through the Headquarters Library with payment of 
fees as listed in the index or as provided in Sec. 265.9.
    (v) Materials listed in the public index that were created on or 
after November 1, 1996, will also be available in electronic format at 
the Postal Service's world wide web site at http://www.usps.gov.
    (6) Listings of employees' names. Upon written request, the Postal 
Service will, to the extent required by law, provide a listing of postal 
employees working at a particular postal facility.
    (b) Records not subject to mandatory public disclosure. Certain 
classes of records are exempt from mandatory disclosure under exemptions 
contained in the Freedom of Information Act and in section 410(c) of 
title 39, U.S.C. The Postal Service will exercise its discretion, in 
accordance with the policy stated in Sec. 265.2, as implemented by 
instructions issued by the Records Office with the approval of the 
General Counsel in determining whether the public interest is served by 
the inspection or copying of records that are:
    (1) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Postal Service.
    (2) Trade secrets, or privileged or confidential commercial or 
financial information, obtained from any person.
    (3) Information of a commercial nature, including trade secrets, 
whether or not obtained from a person outside the Postal Service, which 
under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed. This class 
includes, but is not limited to:
    (i) Information pertaining to methods of handling valuable 
registered mail.
    (ii) Records of money orders, except as provided in R900 of the 
Domestic Mail Manual (DMM).
    (iii) Technical information concerning postage meters and prototypes 
submitted for Postal Service approval prior to leasing to mailers.

[[Page 103]]

    (iv) Reports of market surveys conducted by or under contract in 
behalf of the Postal Service.
    (v) Records indicating rural carrier lines of travel.
    (vi) Records compiled within the Postal Service which would be of 
potential benefit to persons or firms in economic competition with the 
Postal Service.
    (vii) Information which, if publicly disclosed, could materially 
increase procurement costs.
    (viii) Information which, if publicly disclosed, could compromise 
testing or examination materials.
    (4) Interagency or internal memoranda or letters that would not be 
available by law to a private party in litigation with the Postal 
Service.
    (5) Reports and memoranda of consultants or independent contractors, 
except to the extent they would be required to be disclosed if prepared 
within the Postal Service.
    (6) Files personal in nature, including medical and personnel files, 
the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion 
of personal privacy.
    (7) Information prepared for use in connection with proceedings 
under chapter 36 of title 39, U.S.C., relating to rate, classification, 
and service changes.
    (8) Information prepared for use in connection with the negotiation 
of collective bargaining agreements under chapter 12 of title 39, 
U.S.C., or minutes of, or notes kept during, negotiating sessions 
conducted under such chapter.
    (9) Other matter specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.
    (c) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes. 
(1) Investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes, whether 
or not considered closed, are exempt by statute from mandatory 
disclosure except to the extent otherwise available by law to a party 
other than the Postal Service, 39 U.S.C. 410(c)(6). As a matter of 
policy, however, the Postal Service will normally make records or 
information compiled for law enforcement purposes available upon request 
unless the production of these records:
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority (such as the Postal Inspection 
Service) in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency 
conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, 
information furnished by a confidential source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.
    (2) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records 
described in Sec. 265.6(c)(1)(i), and
    (i) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of 
criminal law; and
    (ii) There is reason to believe that,
    (A) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of 
its pendency, and
    (B) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be 
expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the Postal Service 
may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the 
records as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information 
Act.
    (3) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law 
enforcement agency (such as the Postal Inspection Service) under an 
informant's name or personal identifier are requested by a third party 
according to

[[Page 104]]

the informant's name or personal identifier, the records may be treated 
as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act 
unless the informant's status as an informant has been officially 
confirmed.
    (4) Authority to disclose records or information compiled for law 
enforcement purposes to persons outside the Postal Service must be 
obtained from the Chief Postal Inspector, U.S. Postal Service, 
Washington, DC 20260-2100, or designee.
    (d) Disclosure of names and addresses of customers. Upon request, 
the names and addresses of specifically identified Postal Service 
customers will be made available only as follows:
    (1) Change of address. The new address of any specific customer who 
has filed a permanent or temporary change of address order (by 
submitting PS Form 3575, a hand-written order, or an electronically 
communicated order) will be furnished to any person, except that the new 
address of a specific customer who has indicated on the order that the 
address change is for an individual or an entire family will be 
furnished only in those circumstances stated at paragraph (d)(5) of this 
section. Disclosure will be limited to the address of the specifically 
identified individual about whom the information is requested (not other 
family members or individuals whose names may also appear on the change 
of address order). The Postal Service reserves the right not to disclose 
the address of an individual for the protection of the individual's 
personal safety. Other information on PS Form 3575 or copies of the form 
will not be furnished except in those circumstances stated at paragraphs 
(d)(5)(i), (d)(5)(iii), or (d)(5)(iv) of this section.
    (2) Name and address of permit holder. The name and address of the 
holder of a particular bulk mail permit, permit imprint or similar 
permit (but not including postage meter licenses), and the name of any 
person applying for a permit in behalf of a holder will be furnished to 
any person upon the payment of any fees authorized by paragraph (b) of 
Sec. 265.9. For the name and address of a postage meter license holder, 
see paragraph (d)(3) of this section. (Lists of permit holders may not 
be disclosed to members of the public. See paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) Name and address of postage evidencing user. The name and 
address of an authorized user of a postage meter or PC Postage product 
(postage evidencing systems) printing a specified indicium will be 
furnished to any person upon the payment of any fees authorized by 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 265.9, provided the user is using the postage 
meter or PC Postage product for business purposes. The request for this 
information must be sent to the manager of Postage Technology 
Management, Postal Service Headquarters. The request must include the 
original or a photocopy of the envelope or wrapper on which the postage 
meter or PC postage indicium in question is printed, and a copy or 
description of the contents to support that the sender is a business or 
firm and not an individual. (Lists of authorized users of postage meters 
or PC Postage products may not be disclosed to members of the public.)
    (4) Post Office boxholder information. Information from PS Form 
1093, Application for Post Office Box or Caller Service, will be 
provided as follows:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, the 
boxholder applicant name and address from PS Form 1093 will be provided 
only in those circumstances stated in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through 
(d)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, 
the names of persons listed as receiving mail, other than the boxholder 
applicant, will be furnished from PS Form 1093 only in those 
circumstances stated in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (d)(5)(iii) of this 
section.
    (iii) When a copy of a protective order has been filed with the 
postmaster, information from PS Form 1093 will not be disclosed except 
pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (5) Exceptions. Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, 
names or addresses of Postal Service customers will be furnished only as 
follows:
    (i) To a federal, state or local government agency upon prior 
written certification that the information is required

[[Page 105]]

for the performance of its duties. The Postal Service requires 
government agencies to use the format appearing at the end of this 
section when requesting the verification of a customer's current address 
or a customer's new mailing address. If the request lacks any of the 
required information or a proper signature, the postmaster will return 
the request to the agency, specifying the deficiency in the space marked 
`OTHER'. A copy of PS Form 1093 may be provided.
    (ii) To a person empowered by law to serve legal process, or the 
attorney for a party in whose behalf service will be made, or a party 
who is acting pro se, upon receipt of written information that 
specifically includes all of the following: (A) A certification that the 
name or address is needed and will be used solely for service of legal 
process in connection with actual or prospective litigation; (B) a 
citation to the statute or regulation that empowers the requester to 
serve process, if the requester is other than the attorney for a party 
in whose behalf service will be made, or a party who is acting pro se; 
(C) the names of all known parties to the litigation; (D) the court in 
which the case has been or will be commenced; (E) the docket or other 
identifying number, if one has been issued; and (F) the capacity in 
which the boxholder is to be served, e.g., defendant or witness. By 
submitting such information, the requester certifies that it is true. 
The address of an individual who files with the postmaster a copy of a 
protective court order will not be disclosed except as provided under 
paragraphs (d)(5)(i), (d)(5)(iii), or (d)(5)(iv) of this section. A copy 
of Form 1093 will not be provided.
    The Postal Service suggests use of the standard format appearing at 
the end of this section when requesting information under this 
paragraph. When using the standard format on the submitter's own 
letterhead, the standard format must be used in its entirety. The 
warning statement and certification specifically must be included 
immediately before the signature block. If the request lacks any of the 
required information or a proper signature, the postmaster will return 
it to the requester specifying the deficiency.

    Note: The term pro se means that a party is not represented by an 
attorney but by himself or herself.

    (iii) In compliance with a subpoena or court order, except that 
change of address or boxholder information which is not otherwise 
subject to disclosure under these regulations may be disclosed only 
pursuant to a court order.
    (iv) To a law enforcement agency, for oral requests made through the 
Inspection Service, but only after the Inspection Service has confirmed 
that the information is needed in the course of a criminal 
investigation. (All other requests from law enforcement agencies should 
be submitted in writing to the postmaster as in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of 
this section.)
    (6) Jury service. The mailing address of any customer sought in 
connection with jury service, if known, will be furnished without charge 
upon prior written request to a court official, such as a judge, court 
clerk or jury commissioner.
    (7) Address verification. The address of a postal customer will be 
verified at the request of a Federal, State, or local government agency 
upon written certification that the information is required for the 
performance of the agency's duties. ``Verification'' means advising such 
an agency whether or not its address for a postal customer is one at 
which mail for that customer is currently being delivered. 
``Verification'' neither means nor implies knowledge on the part of the 
Postal Service as to the actual residence of the customer or as to the 
actual receipt by the customer of mail delivered to that address. The 
Postal Service requires government agencies to use the format appearing 
at the end of this section when requesting the verification of a 
customer's current address or a customer's new mailing address. If the 
request lacks any of the required information or a proper signature, the 
postmaster will return the request to the agency, specifying the 
deficiency in the space marked ``OTHER''.
    (8) Business/Residence location. If the location of a residence or a 
place of business is known to a Postal Service employee, whether as a 
result of official duties or otherwise, the employee

[[Page 106]]

may, but need not, disclose the location or give directions to it. No 
fee is charged for such information.
    (9) Private mailbox information. Information from PS Form 1583, 
Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent, will be provided as 
follows:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(9)(iii) of this section, 
information from PS Form 1583 will be provided only in the circumstance 
stated in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) To the public only for the purpose of identifying a particular 
address as an address of an agent to whom mail is delivered on behalf of 
other persons. No other information, including, but not limited to, the 
identities of persons on whose behalf agents receive mail, may be 
disclosed to the public from PS Form 1583.
    (iii) Information concerning an individual who has filed a 
protective court order with the postmaster will not be disclosed except 
pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (e) Information not available for public disclosure. (1) Except as 
provided by paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the Postal Service and its 
officers and employees shall not make available to the public by any 
means or for any purpose any mailing list or other list of names or 
addresses (past or present) of postal patrons or other persons.
    (2) Records or other documents which are classified or otherwise 
specifically authorized by Executive Order 12356 and implementing 
regulations to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or 
foreign policy are not subject to disclosure pursuant to this part.
    (3) Records consisting of trade secrets or confidential financial 
data, the disclosure of which is prohibited by section 1905 of title 18, 
U.S.C., are not subject to disclosure pursuant to this part.
    (4) Other records, the disclosure of which is prohibited by statute, 
are not subject to disclosure pursuant to this part.
    (f) Protection of the right of privacy. If any record required or 
permitted by this part to be disclosed contains the name of, or other 
identifying details concerning, any person, including an employee of the 
Postal Service, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the name or other identifying 
details shall be deleted before the record is disclosed and the 
requester so informed.
    (g) Disclosure in part of otherwise exempt record. Any reasonably 
segregable portion of a record shall be provided after deleting the 
information which is neither subject to mandatory disclosure nor 
available as a matter of discretion.

<R05>
Sec. 265.7  Procedure for inspection and copying of records.

    (a) Submission of requests--(1) Form and content of request. To 
permit expeditious handling and timely response in accordance with the 
provisions of this part, a request to inspect or to obtain a copy of an 
identifiable Postal Service record shall be in writing and bear the 
caption ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' or otherwise be clearly 
and prominently identified as a request for records pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act. A request shall be clearly and prominently 
identified as such on the envelope or other cover. Other requests for 
information will be considered informal requests and will be handled as 
expeditiously as practicable but not necessarily within the

[[Page 109]]

time limitations set forth in Sec. 265.7(b). An informal request will 
be granted or denied according to the substantive rules in Sec. 265.6, 
if found to be a request for a record. A Freedom of Information Act 
request shall identify the record sought as completely as possible, by 
name, description, or subject matter, and be sufficient to permit the 
custodian to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. The request 
may state the maximum amount of fees for which the requester is willing 
to accept liability without prior notice. See paragraph (f)(2) of Sec. 
265.8. If no amount is stated, the requester will be deemed willing to 
accept liability for fees not to exceed $25.
    (2) To whom submitted. A request shall be submitted to the custodian 
of the requested record. If the location of the record is not known, 
inquiry should be directed to the Manager, Records Office, U.S. Postal 
Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW., Washington, DC 20260, telephone (202) 
268-2608. If a request is submitted to a facility other than that at 
which the record is maintained, it shall be promptly transmitted to the 
appropriate custodian with a copy of the transmittal furnished to the 
requester. A request which is not initially submitted to the appropriate 
custodian shall be deemed to have been received by the Postal Service 
for purposes of computing the time for response is accordance with Sec. 
265.7(b) at the time that it is actually received by the appropriate 
custodian. If a request seeks records maintained at two or more 
facilities, the custodian shall be deemed to be the next senior common 
supervisor of the heads of the facilities, e.g., district manager, area 
vice president. The Records Office is deemed to be the custodian, for 
purposes of this part, in all instances in which a request is for a 
listing of postal employees. See Sec. 265.6(a)(6).
    (3) Reasons for request. In view of the possibility that some or all 
of the records may be exempt from mandatory disclosure, the requester 
may state any reasons why the record should nevertheless be made 
available to him even if exempt.
    (4) Request for waiver of fees. The requester may ask that fees or 
the advance payment of fees be waived in whole or in part. A fee waiver 
request shall indicate how the information will be used; to whom it will 
be provided; whether the requester intends to use the information for 
resale at a fee above actual cost; any personal or commercial benefit 
that the requester expects as a result of disclosure; in what manner the 
general public will benefit from disclosure; and information as to the 
intended user's identity, qualifications, expertise in the subject area, 
and ability and intention to disseminate the information to the public. 
(See Sec. 265.9(g)(3).)
    (5) Categorical requests. A request for all or substantially all of 
the records within a specific category will be deemed a reasonable 
description of those records only if it is possible, without further 
information, to determine which particular records are sought. See 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section concerning the providing of additional 
information.
    (6) Request for records located at numerous facilities. A request 
for records which are, or may be, located at all or a substantial number 
of post offices or other postal facilities will be deemed to be a 
reasonable description only of such of those records as are maintained 
at the post office or other facility to which the request is submitted, 
and of those records maintained at any other post offices or facilities 
specifically identified in the request. See paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section concerning the custodian of records of two or more facilities.
    (b) Responsibilities of the custodian. (1) The custodian of the 
requested record is the person responsible for determining whether to 
comply with or to deny the request. A custodian who is not an Officer as 
defined in Sec. 221.8 of this chapter, however, should not deny a 
request until he has obtained the advice of Chief Field Counsel. If 
denial of a request appears necessary, the custodian should seek advice 
as soon as possible after receipt of the request so as to provide 
adequate time for legal review. Denial must be made in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) The custodian shall make the determination whether to release or 
deny the record(s) within 20 working days (i.e., exclusive of Saturdays, 
Sundays,

[[Page 110]]

and holidays) of receiving the request, and more rapidly if feasible. 
The custodian and the requester may, by mutual agreement, preferably in 
writing, establish a different response period.
    (3) If a requested record cannot be located from the information 
supplied, the requester should be given an opportunity to supply 
additional information and, if feasible, to confer with the custodian or 
his/her representative, in an attempt to provide a reasonable 
description of the records sought. If additional information is 
furnished, the request will be deemed to have been received by the 
custodian when sufficient additional information to identify and locate 
the record with a reasonable amount of effort has been received.
    (4) The custodian shall make reasonable efforts to search for the 
records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would 
significantly interfere with the operation of the automated information 
system.
    (5) The 20 working day response period allowed in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section may be extended by the custodian, after consultation 
with Chief Field Counsel or with the General Counsel if the custodian is 
at Headquarters, for a period not to exceed an additional 10 working 
days, except as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, when, and 
to the extent, reasonably necessary to permit the proper processing of a 
particular request, under one or more of the following unusual 
circumstances:
    (i) The request requires a search for and collection of records from 
a facility other than that processing the request.
    (ii) The request requires the search for, and collection and 
appropriate examination of, a voluminous amount of separate and distinct 
records.
    (iii) The request requires consultation:
    (A) With another agency having a substantial interest in the 
determination of whether to comply with the request or
    (B) Among two or more components of the Postal Service having 
substantial subject matter interest in the determination of whether to 
comply with the request.
    (6) When the custodian finds that the additional time is required, 
he shall acknowledge the request in writing within the initial 20-day 
response period, state the reason for the delay, and indicate the date 
on which a decision as to disclosure is expected.
    (7) If a request cannot be processed within the additional time 
provided by paragraph (b)(5) of this section, in spite of the exercise 
of due diligence, the custodian shall notify the requester of the 
exceptional circumstances preventing timely compliance and of the date 
by which it is expected that the determination will be made. The 
custodian also shall provide the requester an opportunity to limit the 
scope of the request so that it may be processed within the extended 
time limit, or an opportunity to arrange with the custodian an 
alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. 
The custodian shall nonetheless make a determination on the request as 
promptly as possible.
    (8) If a requested record is known to have been destroyed, disposed 
of, or otherwise not to exist, the requester shall be so notified.
    (c) Compliance with request upon affirmative determination by 
custodian. (1) When a requested record has been identified and is to be 
disclosed in whole or in part, the custodian shall ensure that the 
record is made available promptly and shall immediately notify the 
requester where and when and under what reasonable conditions, if any, 
including the payment of fees, the record will be available for 
inspection or copies will be available. Postal Service records will 
normally be available for inspection and copying during regular business 
hours at the postal facilities at which they are maintained. The 
custodian may, however, designate other reasonable locations and times 
for inspection and copying of some or all of the records within his 
custody.
    (2) Any fees authorized or required to be paid in advance by Sec. 
265.9(f)(3) shall be paid by the requester before the record is made 
available or a copy is furnished unless payment is waived or deferred 
pursuant to Sec. 265.9(g).
    (3) A custodian complying with a request may designate a 
representative to monitor any inspection or copying.

[[Page 111]]

    (d) Denial of request. (1) A reply denying a request in whole or in 
part shall be in writing, signed by the custodian or his designee, and 
shall include:
    (i) A statement of the reason for, or justification of, the denial 
(e.g., records personal in nature), including, if applicable, a 
reference to the provision or provisions of Sec. 265.6 authorizing the 
withholding of the record and a brief explanation of how each provision 
applies to the records requested.
    (ii) If entire records or pages are withheld, a reasonable estimate 
of the number of records or pages, unless providing such estimate would 
harm an interest protected by the exemption relied upon.
    (iii) A statement of the right to appeal and of the appeal procedure 
within the Postal Service (described in paragraph (e) of this section).
    (2) The custodian is ordinarily the person responsible for the 
denial of the request. If the denial of a particular request has been 
directed by higher authority, however, the name and title or position of 
the person directing the denial shall be given in the reply to the 
requester in place of the custodian as the person responsible for the 
denial, and a copy of the denial shall be sent to that person.
    (3) When information is deleted from a record that is disclosed in 
part, the custodian shall indicate, on the released portion of the 
record, the amount of information deleted, unless including that 
indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption relied on. 
The indication must appear, if technically feasible, at the place in the 
record where such deletion is made.
    (e) Appeal procedure. (1) If a request to inspect or to copy a 
record, or a request for expedited processing of the request, is denied, 
in whole or in part, if no determination is made within the period 
prescribed by this section, or if a request for waiver of fees is not 
granted, the requester may appeal to the General Counsel, U.S. Postal 
Service, Washington, DC 20260-1100.
    (2) The requester shall submit his appeal in writing within 30 days 
of the date of the denial or of the other action complained of, or 
within a reasonable time if the appeal is from a failure of the 
custodian to act. The General Counsel may, in his discretion, consider 
late appeals.
    (3) In the event of the denial of a request or of other action or 
failure to act on the part of a custodian from which no appeal is taken, 
the General Counsel may, if he considers that there is doubt as to the 
correctness of the custodian's action or failure to act, review the 
action or failure to act as though an appeal pursuant to this section 
had been taken.
    (4) A letter of appeal should include, as applicable:
    (i) A copy of the request, of any notification of denial or other 
action, and of any other related correspondence;
    (ii) A statement of the action, or failure to act, from which the 
appeal is taken;
    (iii) A statement of the reasons why the requester believes the 
action or failure to act is erroneous; and
    (iv) A statement of the relief sought.
    (f) Action on appeals. (1) The decision of the General Counsel or 
his designee constitutes the final decision of the Postal Service on the 
right of the requester to inspect or copy a record, or to expedited 
processing of the request, as appropriate. The General Counsel will give 
prompt consideration to an appeal for expedited processing of a request. 
All other decisions normally will be made within 20 working days from 
the time of the receipt by the General Counsel. The 20-day response 
period may be extended by the General Counsel or his designee for a 
period not to exceed an additional 10 working days when reasonably 
necessary to permit the proper consideration of an appeal, under one or 
more of the unusual circumstances set forth in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section. The aggregate number of additional working days utilized 
pursuant to this paragraph (f)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section, 
however, may not exceed 10.
    (2) The decision on the appeal shall be in writing. If the decision 
sustains a denial of a record, in whole or in part, or if it denies 
expedited processing, it shall state the justification therefor and 
shall inform the requester of his right to judicial review. In the case 
of records withheld, the decision also shall specify any exemption or 
exemptions relied on and the manner in

[[Page 112]]

which they apply to the record, or portion thereof, withheld.
    (3) If not prohibited by or under law, the General Counsel or his 
designee may direct the disclosure of a record even though its 
disclosure is not required by law or regulation.
    (g) Expedited processing--(1) Criteria. A request for expedited 
processing of a request for records shall be granted when the requester 
demonstrates compelling need. For purposes of this paragraph, 
``compelling need'' exists if:
    (i) Failure of the requester to obtain the records on an expedited 
basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the 
life or physical safety of an individual or;
    (ii) In the case of a request made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information, there is an urgency to inform the public 
concerning actual or alleged federal government activity.
    (2) Request. A request for expedited processing shall be directed in 
writing to the records custodian. The requester must provide information 
in sufficient detail to demonstrate compelling need for the records and 
certify this statement to be true and correct to the best of the 
requester's knowledge and belief. The custodian may waive the formality 
of certification when deemed appropriate.
    (3) Determination. The records custodian shall make a determination 
of whether to provide expedited processing and notify the requester 
within ten days after the date of the request for expedited processing. 
If the request is granted, the records custodian shall process the 
request for records as soon as practicable. If the request for expedited 
processing is denied, the written response will include the procedures 
at paragraph (d) of this section for appealing the denial.

Sec. 265.8  Business information; procedures for predisclosure notification to submitters.

    (a) In general. This section provides a procedure by which persons 
submitting business information to the Postal Service can request that 
the information not be disclosed pursuant to a request under the Freedom 
of Information Act. This section does not affect the Postal Service's 
right, authority, or obligation to disclose information in any other 
context, nor is it intended to create any right or benefit, substantive 
or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the Postal Service, 
its officers, or any person. Existing rights of submitters are also 
unaffected. For purposes of this section, the following definitions 
apply:
    (1) Business information means commercial or financial information 
provided directly or indirectly to the Postal Service by a submitter 
that arguably is protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), which is restated in 
Sec. 265.6(b)(2).
    (2) Submitter means any person or entity who provides business 
information, directly or indirectly, to the Postal Service. The term 
includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and 
foreign governments.
    (b) Notice to submitters. (1) The custodian shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a 
Freedom of Information Act request for the submitter's business 
information whenever required under paragraph (c) of this section, 
except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in order to afford 
the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure pursuant to 
paragraph (f) of this section. Such written notice shall either describe 
the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies 
of the records or portions of records containing the business 
information. In the case of an administrative appeal, the General 
Counsel shall be responsible for providing such notification as may be 
appropriate under this section.
    (2) When notice is given to a submitter under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, the requester also shall be notified that notice and an 
opportunity

[[Page 113]]

to object are being provided to the submitter pursuant to this section.
    (c) When notice is required. Notice shall be given to a submitter 
whenever:
    (1) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as 
information deemed protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, in 
accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (e) of this 
section; or
    (2) In the opinion of the custodian, or of the General Counsel in 
the case of an administrative appeal, it is likely that disclosure of 
the information would result in competitive harm to the submitter.
    (d) Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply if:
    (1) The Postal Service determines without reference to the submitter 
that the information will not be disclosed;
    (2) The information lawfully has been published or has been 
officially made available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552); or
    (4) Disclosure of the particular kind of information is required by 
a Postal Service regulation, except that, in such case, advance written 
notice of a decision to disclose shall be provided to the submitter if 
the submitter had provided written justification for protection of the 
information under Exemption 4 at the time of submission or a reasonable 
time thereafter.
    (e) Procedure for designating business information at the time of 
its submission. (1) Submitters of business information shall use good-
faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time 
of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of 
their submissions which they deem to be protected from disclosure under 
Exemption 4. Each record, or portion thereof, to be so designated, shall 
be clearly marked with a suitable legend such as Privileged Business 
Information--Do Not Release. When the designated records contain some 
information for which an exemption is not claimed, the submitter shall 
clearly indicate the portions for which protection is sought.
    (2) At the time a designation is made pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section, the submitter shall furnish the Postal Service with the 
name, title, address and telephone number of the person or persons to be 
contacted for the purpose of the notification described in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (3) Submitters who provide to a postal facility business information 
on a recurring basis and in substantially identical form may use the 
following simplified process: The first submission will provide in full 
the information required in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section; 
shall identify the type of information, e.g., PS Form 3602, to which it 
is intended to apply; and shall state that it is intended to serve as a 
designation for all of the information of this type that is submitted to 
the particular facility. Thereafter when providing this type of 
information, the submitter need only mark a submission with a reference 
to the designation, e.g., Privileged: see letter of 4-1-91. By written 
agreement with the head of the facility, even this marking may be 
dispensed with if it is not necessary to alert postal employees at that 
facility of the claim of exemption.
    (4) A designation made pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section 
shall be deemed to have expired ten years after the date the records 
were submitted unless the submitter requests, and provides reasonable 
justification for, a designation period of greater duration.
    (5) The Postal Service will not determine the validity of any 
request for confidential treatment until a request for disclosure of the 
information is received.
    (f) Opportunity to object to disclosure. Through the notice 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, the submitter shall be 
afforded a reasonable period of time within which to provide the Postal 
Service with a detailed written statement of any objection to 
disclosure. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any 
of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act 
and, in the case of Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information 
is contended to be a trade secret or commercial or financial information 
that is privileged or confidential. Whenever possible, the

[[Page 114]]

submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement 
or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the 
submitter that the information in question is in fact confidential, has 
not been disclosed to the public by the submitter, and is not routinely 
available to the public from other sources. Information provided by a 
submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure 
under the FOIA.
    (g) Determination that confidential treatment is warranted. If the 
custodian determines that confidential treatment is warranted for any 
part of the requested records, he shall inform the requester in writing 
in accordance with the procedures set out in Sec. 265.7(d) of this 
chapter, and shall advise the requester of the right to appeal. A copy 
of the letter of denial shall also be provided to the submitter of the 
records in any case in which the submitter had been notified of the 
request pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (h) Notice of intent to disclose. The custodian, in the case of an 
initial request, or the General Counsel, in the case of an appeal, shall 
consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for 
nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose business 
information. In the event of a decision to disclose business information 
over the objection of the submitter, the submitter shall be furnished a 
written notice which shall include:
    (1) A description of the business information to be disclosed;
    (2) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure 
objections were not sustained; and
    (3) The specific date upon which disclosure will occur. Such notice 
of intent to disclose shall be forwarded to the submitter a reasonable 
number of days prior to the specified disclosure date and the requester 
shall be notified likewise.
    (i) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings suit seeking 
to compel disclosure of business information, the General Counsel shall 
promptly notify the submitter.

[56 FR 56934, Nov. 7, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 265.9  Schedule of fees.

    (a) Policy. The purpose of this section is to establish fair and 
equitable fees to permit the furnishing of records to members of the 
public while recovering the full allowable direct costs incurred by the 
Postal Service. The Postal Service will use the most efficient and least 
costly methods available to it when complying with requests for records.
    (b) Standard rates--(1) Record retrieval. Searches may be done 
manually or by computer using existing programming.
    (i) Manual search. The fee for a manual search is $32 per hour 
(fractions of an hour are rounded to the nearest half hour).
    (ii) Computer search. The fee for retrieving data by computer is the 
actual direct cost of the retrieval, including computer search time, and 
personnel cost in effect at the time that the retrieval services are 
performed. The fees are subject to periodic revision. A copy of the fees 
are included within the public index. (See appendix A.)
    (2) Duplication. (i) Except where otherwise specifically provided in 
postal regulations, the fee for duplicating any record or publication is 
$.15 per page.
    (ii) The Postal Service may at its discretion make coin-operated 
copy machines available at any location or otherwise give the requester 
the opportunity to make copies of Postal Service records at his own 
expense. Unless authorized by the Records Office, however, no off-site 
copying shall be permitted of records which, if lost, could not be 
replaced without inconvenience to the Postal Service.
    (iii) The Postal Service will normally furnish only one copy of any 
record. If duplicate copies are furnished at the request of the 
requester, the $.15 per-page fee shall be charged for each copy of each 
duplicate page without regard to whether the requester is eligible for 
free copies pursuant to paragraph (c) or (g) of this section. At his or 
her discretion, when it is reasonably necessary because of a lack of 
adequate copying facilities or other circumstances, the custodian may 
make the requested record available to the requester for inspection 
under reasonable conditions and need not furnish a copy thereof.

[[Page 115]]

    (3) Review. The fee for reviewing records located in response to a 
commercial use request is $32 per hour (fractions of an hour are rounded 
to the nearest half hour). Only requesters who are seeking documents for 
commercial use may be charged for review. ``Review'' is defined in 
paragraph (h)(4) of this section; ``commercial use'' is defined in 
paragraph (h)(5) of this section.
    (4) Micrographics. Paragraphs (b) (1), (2) and (3) of this section 
also apply to information stored within micrographic systems.
    (c) Four categories of fees to be charged. For the purpose of 
assessing fees under this section, a requester shall be classified into 
one of four categories: commercial use requesters; educational and 
noncommercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news 
media; and all other requesters. Requesters in each category must 
reasonably describe the records sought. Fees shall be charged requesters 
in each category in accordance with the following.
    (1) Commercial use requesters. Fees shall be charged to recover the 
full direct costs of search, review and duplication in accordance with 
the rates prescribed in paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section, 
subject only to the general waiver set out in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section. The term ``commercial use request'' is defined in paragraph 
(h)(5).
    (2) Educational and noncommercial scientific institutions. Fees 
shall be charged only for duplication in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, except that the first 100 pages furnished in 
response to a particular request shall be furnished without charge. (See 
also the general waiver provision in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.) 
To be eligible for the reduction of fees applicable to this category, 
the requester must show that the request is being made as authorized by 
and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records 
are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of 
scholarly or scientific research. These institutions are defined in 
paragraphs (h)(6) and (h)(7) of this section, respectively.
    (3) Representatives of the news media. Fees shall be charged only 
for duplication in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
except that the first 100 pages furnished in response to a particular 
request shall be furnished without charge. (See also the general waiver 
provision in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.) To be eligible for the 
reduction of fees applicable to this category, the requester must meet 
the criteria in paragraph (h)(8) of this section, and the request must 
not be made for a commercial use.
    (4) All other requesters. Fees shall be charged for search and 
duplication in accordance with paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this 
section, except that the first 100 pages of duplication and the first 
two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. (See also 
paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.)
    (d) Aggregating requests. When the custodian reasonably believes 
that a requester is attempting to break a request down into a series of 
requests in order to evade the assessment of fees, the custodian may 
aggregate the requests and charge accordingly. The custodian shall not 
aggregate multiple requests when the requests pertain to unrelated 
subject matter. Requests made by more than one requester may be 
aggregated only when the custodian has a concrete basis on which to 
conclude that the requesters are acting in concert specifically to avoid 
payment of fees.
    (e) Other costs--(1) Publications. Publications and other printed 
materials may, to the extent that they are available in sufficient 
quantity, be made available at the established price, if any, or at cost 
to the Postal Service. Fees established for printed materials pursuant 
to laws, other than the Freedom of Information Act, that specifically 
provide for the setting of fees for particular types of records are not 
subject to waiver or reduction under this section.
    (2) Other charges. When a response to a request requires services or 
materials other than the common one listed in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the direct cost of such services or materials to the Postal 
Service may be charged, but only if the requester has been notified of 
the nature and estimated amount of such cost before it is incurred.

[[Page 116]]

    (f) Advance notice and payment of fees--(1) Liability and payment. 
The requester is responsible, subject to limitations on liability 
provided by this section, for the payment of all fees for services 
resulting from his request, even if responsive records are not located 
or are determined to be exempt from disclosure. Checks in payment of 
fees should be made payable to ``U.S. Postal Service.''
    (2) Advance notice. To protect members of the public from 
unwittingly incurring liability for unexpectedly large fees, the 
custodian shall notify the requester if the estimated cost is expected 
to exceed $25. When search fees are expected to exceed $25, but it 
cannot be determined in advance whether any records will be located or 
made available, the custodian shall notify the requester of the 
estimated amount and of the responsibility to pay search fees even 
through records are not located or are determined to be exempt from 
disclosure. The notification shall be transmitted as soon as possible 
after physical receipt of the request, giving the best estimate then 
available. It shall include a brief explanatory statement of the nature 
and extent of the services upon which the estimate is based and shall 
offer the requester an opportunity to confer with the custodian or his 
representative in an attempt to reformulate the request so as to meet 
his needs at lower cost. The time period for responding to the request 
shall not run during the interval between the date such notification is 
transmitted and the date of receipt of the requester's agreement to bear 
the cost. No notification is required if the request specifically states 
that whatever cost is involved is acceptable or is acceptable up to a 
specified amount that covers estimated costs or if payment of all fees 
in excess of $25 has been waived.
    (3) Advance payment. Advance payment of fees shall not be required, 
except: (i) When it is estimated that the fees chargeable under this 
section are likely to exceed $250. If the requester has a history of 
prompt payment of FOIA fees, the custodian shall notify the requester of 
the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment before 
commencing work on the request. If the requester has no history of 
payment, the custodian may require an advance payment of an amount up to 
the full estimated charge before commencing work on the request.
    (ii) When a requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely 
fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), the requester 
shall be required to pay the full amount owed, and to make an advance 
payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before processing will 
begin on a new or pending request.
    (iii) When advance payment is required under paragraphs (f)(3)(i) or 
(ii) of this section, the time periods for responding to the initial 
request or to an appeal shall not run during the interval between the 
date that notice of the requirement is transmitted and the date that the 
required payment or assurance of payment is received.
    (g) Restrictions on assessing fees--(1) General waiver. No fees 
shall be charged to any requester if they would amount, in the 
aggregate, for a request or a series of related requests, to $10 or 
less. When the fees for the first 100 pages or the first two hours of 
search time are excludable under paragraph (c) of this section, 
additional costs will not be assessed unless they exceed $10.
    (2) Certain fees not charged--(i) All requests except those for 
commercial use. Fees shall not be charged for the first 100 pages of 
duplication and the first two hours of search time except when the 
request is for a commercial use as defined in paragraph (h)(5) of this 
section. When search is done by computer, the fees to be excluded for 
the first two hours of search time shall be determined on the basis of 
fee for computer searches then in effect. (See appendix A.) Assessment 
of search fees will begin at the point when the cost of the search 
(including the cost of personnel and computer processing time) reaches 
the equivalent dollar amount of personnel fees for 2 hours.
    (ii) Requests of educational and noncommercial scientific 
institutions, and representatives of the news media. Fees shall not be 
charged for time spent searching for records in response to requests 
submitted by educational and noncommercial scientific institutions or 
representatives of the news media.

[[Page 117]]

    (3) Public interest waiver. The custodian shall waive a fee, in 
whole or in part, and any requirement for advance payment of such a fee, 
when he determines that furnishing the records is deemed to be in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of the federal 
government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the 
requester. This waiver may be granted notwithstanding the applicability 
of other fee reductions prescribed by this section for requesters in 
certain categories. In determining whether disclosure is in the public 
interest for the purposes of this waiver, the following factors may be 
considered:
    (i) The relation of the records to the operations or activities of 
the Postal Services;
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed;
    (iii) Any contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure;
    (iv) The significance of that contribution to the public 
understanding of the subject;
    (v) The nature of the requester's personal interest, if any, in the 
disclosure requested; and
    (vi) Whether the disclosure would be primarily in the requester's 
commercial interest.
    (4) Waiver by officer. Any officer of the Postal Service, as defined 
in Sec. 221.8, his designee, or the Manager, Records Office may waive 
in whole or in part any fee required by this part or the requirement for 
advance payment of any fee.
    (5) Fee for other services. Waivers do not apply for fees for 
address correction services performed in accordance with section R900 of 
the Domestic Mail Manual.
    (h) Definitions. As used in this section, the term:
    (1) Direct costs include expenditures actually incurred in searching 
for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, 
reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, 
for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate 
of pay for the employee plus a factor to cover benefits) and the cost of 
operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are 
overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the 
facility in which the records are stored.
    (2) Search includes all time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents. Searches may be done 
manually or by computer using existing programming. A line-by-line 
search will be conducted only when necessary to determine whether the 
document contains responsive information and will not be employed in 
those instances in which duplication of the entire document would be the 
less expensive and quicker method of complying with a request. Search 
does not include review of material to determine whether the material is 
exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (h)(4) of this section).
    (3) Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document 
necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of 
paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable 
documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy 
provided must be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.
    (4) Review refers to the process of examining documents located in 
response to a request that is for a commercial use (see paragraph (h)(5) 
of this section) to determine whether any portion of any document 
located is exempt from mandatory disclosure. It also includes processing 
any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to 
excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not 
include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding 
the application of exemptions. Charges may be assessed only for the 
initial review, i.e., the first time the applicability of a specific 
exemption is analyzed. Costs for a subsequent review are properly 
assessable only when a record or portion of a record withheld solely on 
the basis of an exemption later determined not to apply must be reviewed 
again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously 
considered.

[[Page 118]]

    (5) Commercial use request refers to a request from or on behalf of 
one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the 
commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on 
whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a request 
properly belongs in this category, the Postal Service will look to the 
use to which the requester will put the documents requested. If the use 
is not clear from the request itself, or if there is reasonable cause to 
doubt the requester's stated use, the custodian shall seek additional 
clarification from the requester before assigning the request to this 
category.
    (6) Educational institution refers to a pre-school, a public or 
private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate 
higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational 
education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
    (7) Noncommercial scientific institution refers to an institution 
that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is defined 
in paragraph (h)(5) of this section, and which is operated solely for 
the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are 
not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (8) Representative of the news media refers to any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Requests by news organizations for information that will be used 
for the furtherance of the organization's commercial interests, rather 
than for the dissemination of news to the public, shall be considered 
commercial use requests. Examples of news media entities include 
television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and 
publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can 
qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available 
for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are 
not intended to be all-inclusive. A ``freelance'' journalist will be 
regarded as a representative of the news media if he can demonstrate a 
solid basis for expecting publication through a news organization, even 
though not actually employed by it. This may be demonstrated either by a 
publication contract with the news organization or by the past 
publication record of the requester.

    (a) Compliance with subpoena duces tecum. (1) Except as required by 
Part 262, produce other records of the Postal Service only in compliance 
with a subpoena duces tecum or appropriate court order.
    (2) Time, leave, and payroll records of postal employees are subject 
to production when a subpoena duces tecum or appropriate court order has 
been properly served. The custodian of the records may designate a 
postal employee to present the records. The presentation by a designee 
rather than the employee named in the subpoena or

[[Page 119]]

court order must meet with the approval of the attorneys for each side. 
In addition, such records may be released if authorized in writing by 
the employee.
    (3) If the subpoena involves a job-connected injury, the records are 
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Office of Workers' Compensation 
Programs, Department of Labor. Requests for authorization to produce 
these records shall be addressed to: Office of Workers' Compensation 
Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210-0001. Also 
notify the attorney responsible for the issuance of the subpoena or 
court order.
    (4) Employee medical records are primarily under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the U.S. Civil Service Commission. The Commission has 
delegated authority to the Postal Service and to the Commission's 
Regional Directors to release medical information, in response to proper 
requests and upon competent medical advice, in accordance with the 
following criteria:
    (i) Except in response to a subpoena or court order, do not release 
any medical information about an employee to any non-Federal entity or 
individual without authorization from the employee.
    (ii) With authorization from the employee, the Area, Information 
Systems Service Center, or Chief Field Counsel will respond as follows 
to a request from a non-Federal source for medical information:
    (a) If, in the opinion of a Federal medical officer, the medical 
information indicates the existence of a malignancy, a mental condition, 
or other condition about which a prudent physician would hesitate to 
inform a person suffering from such a condition as to its exact nature 
and probable outcome, do not release the medical information to the 
employee or to any individual designated by him, except to a physician, 
designated by the employee in writing. If a subpoena or court order was 
issued, the responding official shall caution the moving party as to the 
possible dangers involved if the medical information is divulged.
    (b) If, in the opinion of a Federal medical officer, the medical 
information does not indicate the presence of any condition which would 
cause a prudent physician to hesitate to inform a person of the exact 
nature and probable outcome of his condition, release it in response to 
a subpoena or court order, or to the employee or to any person, firm, or 
organization he authorizes in writing.
    (c) If a Federal medical officer is not available, refer the request 
to the Civil Service Commission regional office with the medical 
certificates or other medical reports concerned.
    (5) Do not release any records containing information as to the 
employee's security or loyalty.
    (6) Honor subpoenas or court orders only when disclosure is 
authorized.
    (7) When authorized to comply with a subpoena duces tecum, do not 
leave the original records with the court.
    (b) [Reserved]

Chief Field Counsel and request instructions.
    (2) An employee may not give testimony or produce records without 
the prior authorization of the General Counsel.
    (3)(i) The General Counsel may allow an employee to testify or 
produce records if the General Counsel determines that granting 
permission:
    (A) Would be appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the 
matter in which the demand arises and other applicable laws, privileges, 
rules, authority, and regulations; and
    (B) Would not be contrary to the interest of the United States. The 
interest of the United States includes, but is not limited to, 
furthering a public interest of the Postal Service and protecting the 
human and financial resources of the United States.
    (ii) An employee's testimony shall be limited to the information set 
forth in the statement described at paragraph (c)(2) of this section or 
to such portions thereof as the General Counsel determines are not 
subject to objection. An employee's testimony shall be limited to facts 
within the personal knowledge of the employee. A Postal Service employee 
authorized to give testimony under this rule is prohibited from giving 
expert or opinion testimony, answering hypothetical or speculative 
questions, or giving testimony with respect to privileged subject 
matter. The General Counsel may waive the prohibition of expert 
testimony under this paragraph only upon application and showing of 
exceptional circumstances and the request substantially meets the 
requirements of this section.
    (4) The General Counsel may establish conditions under which the 
employee may testify. If the General Counsel authorizes the testimony of 
an employee, the party seeking testimony shall make arrangements for the 
taking of testimony by those methods that, in the General Counsel's 
view, will least disrupt the employee's official duties. For example, at 
the General Counsel's discretion, testimony may be provided by 
affidavits, answers to interrogatories, written depositions, or 
depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by any other means 
allowable by law.
    (5) If a response to a demand for testimony or records is required 
before the General Counsel determines whether to allow an employee to 
testify, the employee or counsel for the employee shall do the 
following:
    (i) Inform the court or other authority of the regulations in this 
section; and
    (ii) Request that the demand be stayed pending the employee's 
receipt of the General Counsel's instructions.
    (6) If the court or other authority declines the request for a stay, 
or rules that the employee must comply with the demand regardless of the 
General Counsel's instructions, the employee or counsel for the employee 
shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citing United 
States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951), and the regulations 
in this section.
    (7) The General Counsel may request the assistance of the Department 
of Justice or a U.S. Attorney where necessary to represent the interests 
of the Postal Service and the employee.

[[Page 122]]

    (8) At his or her discretion, the General Counsel may grant a waiver 
of any procedure described by this section, where waiver is considered 
necessary to promote a significant interest of the United States or for 
other good cause.
    (9) If it otherwise is permissible, the records custodian may 
authenticate, upon the request of the party seeking disclosure, copies 
of the records. No employee of the Postal Service shall respond in 
strict compliance with the terms of a subpoena duces tecum unless 
specifically authorized by the General Counsel.
    (e) Postal Service employees as expert witnesses. No Postal Service 
employee may testify as an expert or opinion witness, with regard to any 
matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of 
the Postal Service, for any party other than the United States, except 
that in extraordinary circumstances, the General Counsel may approve 
such expert testimony in private litigation. A Postal Service employee 
may not testify as such an expert witness without the express 
authorization of the General Counsel. A litigant must obtain 
authorization of the General Counsel before designating a Postal Service 
employee as an expert witness.
    (f) Substitution of Postal Service employees. Although a demand for 
testimony may be directed to a named Postal Service employee, the 
General Counsel, where appropriate, may designate another Postal Service 
employee to give testimony. Upon request and for good cause shown (for 
example, when a particular Postal Service employee has direct knowledge 
of a material fact not known to the substitute employee designated by 
the Postal Service), the General Counsel may permit testimony by a named 
Postal Service employee.
    (g) Fees and costs. (1) The Postal Service may charge fees, not to 
exceed actual costs, to private litigants seeking testimony or records 
by request or demand. The fees, which are to be calculated to reimburse 
fully the Postal Service for processing the demand and providing the 
witness or records, may include, among others:
    (i) Costs of time spent by employees, including attorneys, of the 
Postal Service to process and respond to the demand;
    (ii) Costs of attendance of the employee and agency attorney at any 
deposition, hearing, or trial;
    (iii) Travel costs of the employee and agency attorney;
    (iv) Costs of materials and equipment used to search for, process, 
and make available information.
    (2) All costs for employee time shall be calculated on the hourly 
pay of the employee (including all pay, allowance, and benefits) and 
shall include the hourly fee for each hour, or portion of each hour, 
when the employee is in travel, in attendance at a deposition, hearing, 
or trial, or is processing or responding to a request or demand.
    (3) At the discretion of the Postal Service, where appropriate, 
costs may be estimated and collected before testimony is given.
    (h) Acceptance of service. This section does not in any way abrogate 
or modify the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 
U.S.C. Appendix) regarding service of process.

[[Page 124]]

Service legal counsel that no legal objection, privilege, or exemption 
applies to such testimony or production of documents.
    (ii) The Chief Postal Inspector or designee for Headquarters 
employees and records, after that official has determined through

Service legal counsel, may request an in camera, ex parte conference to 
determine the necessity for the release of the information. The entire 
Manual should not be given to any party.
    (7) Notes, memoranda, reports, transcriptions, whether written or 
recorded and made pursuant to an official investigation conducted by a 
member of the Inspection Service, are the property of the Inspection 
Service and are part of the official case file, whether stored with the 
official file.
    (f) Compliance with summonses and subpoenas ad testificandum. (1) If 
an Inspection Service employee is served with a third-party summons or a 
subpoena requiring an appearance in court, contact should be made with 
Inspection Service legal counsel to determine whether and which 
exemptions or restrictions apply to proposed testimony. Inspection 
Service employees are directed to comply with summonses, subpoenas, and 
court orders, as to appearance, but may not testify without 
authorization.
    (2) Postal Inspector reports or records will not be presented during 
testimony, in either state or federal courts in which the United States, 
the Postal Service, or another federal agency is not a party in 
interest, unless authorized by the Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal 
Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division, who will make the 
decision after consulting with Inspection Service legal counsel. If an 
attempt is made to compel production, through testimony, the employee is 
directed to decline to produce the information or matter and to state 
that it may be exempted and may not be disclosed or produced without the 
specific approval of the Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector 
in Charge of the affected field Division. The Postal Service will offer 
all possible assistance to the courts, but the question of disclosing 
information for which an exemption may be

[[Page 125]]

claimed is a matter of discretion that rests with the appropriate 
official. Paragraph (e) of this section covers the release of Inspection 
Service documents in cases where the Postal Service or the United States 
is not a party.
    (g) General procedures for obtaining Inspection Service documents 
and testimony from Inspection Service employees. (1) To facilitate the 
orderly response to demands for the testimony of Inspection Service 
employees and production of documents in cases where the United States, 
the Postal Service, or another federal agency is not a party, all 
demands for the production of nonpublic documents or testimony of 
Inspection Service employees concerning matters relating to their 
official duties and not subject to the exemptions set forth in paragraph 
(a) of this section shall be in writing and conform to the requirements 
outlined in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section.
    (2) Before or simultaneously with service of a demand described in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the requesting party shall serve on 
the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, 475 L'Enfant Plaza 
SW., Washington, DC 20260-2181, an affidavit or declaration containing 
the following information:
    (i) The title of the case and the forum where it will be heard;
    (ii) The party's interest in the case;
    (iii) The reasons for the demand;
    (iv) A showing that the requested information is available, by law, 
to a party outside the Postal Service;
    (v) If testimony is sought, a summary of the anticipated testimony;
    (vi) If testimony is sought, a showing that Inspection Service 
records could not be provided and used in place of the requested 
testimony;
    (vii) The intended use of the documents or testimony; and
    (viii) An affirmative statement that the documents or testimony is 
necessary for defending or prosecuting the case at issue.
    (3) The Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, shall act as 
agent for the receipt of legal process for demands for production of 
records or testimony of Inspection Service employees where the United 
States, the Postal Service, or any other federal agency is not a party. 
A subpoena for testimony or for the production of documents from an 
Inspection Service employee concerning official matters shall be served 
in accordance with the applicable rules of civil procedure. A copy of 
the subpoena and affidavit or declaration, if not previously furnished, 
shall also be sent to the Chief Postal Inspector or the appropriate 
Postal Inspector in Charge.
    (4) Any Inspection Service employee who is served with a demand 
shall promptly inform the Chief Postal Inspector, or the appropriate 
Postal Inspector in Charge, of the nature of the documents or testimony 
sought and all relevant facts and circumstances.
    (h) Authorization of testimony or production of documents. (1) The 
Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected 
field Division, after consulting with Inspection Service legal counsel, 
shall determine whether testimony or the production of documents will be 
authorized.
    (2) Before authorizing the requested testimony or the production of 
documents, the Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge 
of the affected field Division shall consider the following factors:
    (i) Statutory restrictions, as well as any legal objection, 
exemption, or privilege that may apply;
    (ii) Relevant legal standards for disclosure of nonpublic 
information and documents;
    (iii) Inspection Service rules and regulations and the public 
interest;
    (iv) Conservation of employee time; and
    (v) Prevention of expenditures of government time and resources 
solely for private purposes.
    (3) If, in the opinion of the authorizing official, the documents 
should not be released or testimony should not be furnished, that 
official's decision is final.
    (4) Inspection Service legal counsel may consult or negotiate with 
the party or the party's counsel seeking testimony or documents to 
refine and limit the demand, so that compliance is less burdensome, or 
obtain information necessary to make the determination whether the 
documents or testimony will be authorized. If the party

[[Page 126]]

or party's counsel seeking the documents or testimony fails to cooperate 
in good faith, preventing Inspection Service legal counsel from making 
an informed recommendation to the authorizing official, that failure may 
be presented to the court or other body conducting the proceeding as a 
basis for objection.
    (5) Permission to testify or to release documents in all cases will 
be limited to matters outlined in the affidavit or declaration described 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or to such parts as deemed 
appropriate by the authorizing official.
    (6) If the authorizing official allows the release of documents or 
testimony to be given by an employee, arrangements shall be made for the 
taking of testimony or receipt of documents by the least disruptive 
methods to the employee's official duties. Testimony may, for example, 
be provided by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, written 
depositions, or depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by any 
other means allowable by law.

the authorizing official, be represented by Inspection Service legal 
counsel.

documents, the employee may seek the assistance of Inspection Service 
legal counsel.

employee shall respectfully decline to produce the requested documents, 
testify, or, otherwise, disclose the requested information.
    (8) If the authorization is denied or not received by the return 
date, the employee, together with counsel, where appropriate, shall 
appear at the stated time and place, produce a copy of this section, and 
respectfully decline to testify or produce any document on the basis of 
the regulations in this section.
    (9) The employee shall appear as ordered by the subpoena, summons, 
or other appropriate court order, unless:
    (i) Legal counsel has advised the employee that an appearance is 
inappropriate, as in cases where the subpoena, summons, or other court 
order was not properly issued or served, has been withdrawn, discovery 
has been stayed; or
    (ii) Where the Postal Service will present a legal objection to 
furnishing the requested information or testimony.
    (i) Inspection Service employees as expert or opinion witnesses. No 
Inspection Service employee may testify as an expert or opinion witness, 
with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's duties or 
functions at the Postal Service, for any party other than the United 
States, except that in extraordinary circumstances, the Counsel, Office 
of the Chief Postal Inspector, may approve such testimony in private 
litigation. An Inspection Service employee may not testify as such an 
expert or opinion witness without the express authorization of the 
Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector. A litigant must first 
obtain authorization of the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal 
Inspector, before designating an Inspection Service employee as an 
expert or opinion witness.
    (j) Postal liability. This section is intended to provide 
instructions to Inspection Service employees and does not create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party 
against the Postal Service.
    (k) Fees. (1) Unless determined by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other 
applicable statute, the costs of providing testimony, including 
transcripts, shall be borne by the requesting party.
    (2) Unless limited by statute, such costs shall also include 
reimbursement to the Postal Service for the usual and ordinary expenses 
attendant upon the employee's absence from his or her official duties in 
connection with the case or matter, including the employee's salary and 
applicable overhead charges, and any necessary travel expenses as 
follows:
    (i) The Inspection Service is authorized to charge reasonable fees 
to parties demanding documents or information. Such fees, calculated to 
reimburse the Postal Service for the cost of responding to a demand, may 
include the costs of time expended by Inspection Service employees, 
including attorneys, to process and respond to the demand; attorney time 
for reviewing

[[Page 127]]

the demand and for legal work in connection with the demand; expenses 
generated by equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the 
requested information; travel costs of the employee and the agency 
attorney, including lodging and per diem where appropriate. Such fees 
shall be assessed at the rates and in the manner specified in Sec. 
265.9.
    (ii) At the discretion of the Inspection Service where appropriate, 
fees and costs may be estimated and collected before testimony is given.
    (iii) The provisions in this section do not affect rights and 
procedures governing public access to official documents pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C 552a.
    (l) Acceptance of service. The rules in this section in no way 
modify the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 
U.S.C. Appendix) regarding service of process.

Sec. 266.5  Notification.

    (a) Notification of Systems. Upon written request, the Postal

266.6 for suggested form of request.
    (b) Notification of Disclosure. The Postal Service shall make

information on such individual is made available to any person under 
compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public 
record.
    (c) Notification of Amendment. (See Sec. 266.6(c)(1) relating to 
amendment of records upon request.)

Sec. 266.6  Procedures for requesting inspection, copying, or amendment of records.

    The purpose of this section is to provide procedures by which an 
individual may have access and request amendment to personal information 
within a Privacy Act System of Records.
    (a) Submission of Requests--(1) Manner of submission. Inquiries 
regarding the contents of records systems or access or amendment to 
personal information should be submitted in writing to the custodian of 
the official record, if known, or to the Manager, Records Office, U.S. 
Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260, telephone 
(202) 268-2608. Requests submitted to the Office of Inspector General 
should be submitted to the Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Officer, 
Office of Inspector General, 1735 North Lynn Street, Arlington, 
Virginia, 22209-2020. Inquiries should be clearly marked, ``Privacy Act 
Request''. Any inquiry concerning a specific system of records should 
provide the Postal Service with the information contained under 
``Notification'' for that system as published in the Federal Register. 
If the information supplied is insufficient to locate or identify the 
record, the requester will be notified promptly and, if possible, 
informed of additional information required. If the requester is not a 
Postal Service employee, he should designate the post office at which he 
wishes to review or obtain copies of records. Amendment requests contest 
the relevance, accuracy, timeliness or completeness of the record and 
will include a statement of the amendment requested.
    (2) Third party inquiries. Anyone desiring to review or copy records 
pertaining to another person must have the written consent of that 
person.
    (3) Period for response by custodian. Upon receipt of an inquiry, 
the custodian will respond with an acknowledgement of receipt within ten 
(10) days. If the inquiry requires the custodian to determine whether a 
particular record exists, the inquirer shall be informed of this 
determination as a part of the acknowledgement letter.
    (b) Compliance with Request for Access--(1) Notification of time and 
place for inspection. When a requested record has been identified and is 
to be disclosed, the custodian shall ensure that the record is made 
available promptly and shall immediately notify the requester where and 
when the record will be available for inspection or copying. Postal 
Service records will normally be available for inspection and copying 
during regular business hours at the postal facilities at which they are 
maintained. The custodian may, however, designate other reasonable 
locations and times for inspection and copying of some or all of the 
records within his custody.
    (2) Identification of requester. The requester must present personal 
identification sufficient to satisfy the custodian as to his identity 
prior to record review. Examples of sufficient identification are a 
valid driver's license, Medicare card, and employee identification 
cards.
    (3) Responsibilities of requester. The requester shall assume the 
following responsibilities regarding the review of official personal 
records:
    (i) Requester must agree not to leave Postal Services premises with 
official records unless specifically given a copy for that purpose by 
the custodian or his representative.
    (ii) Requester must sign a statement indicating he has reviewed a 
specific record(s) or category of record.
    (iii) Requester may be accompanied by a person he so chooses to aid 
in the inspection of information; however, requester must furnish the 
Postal Service with written authorization for such review in that 
person's presence.
    (4) Special rules for medical records. A medical record shall be 
disclosed to the requester to whom it pertains unless, in the judgment 
of the medical officer, access to such record could have an adverse 
effect upon such individual. When the medical officer determines that 
the disclosure of medical information

[[Page 132]]

could have an adverse effect upon the individual to whom it pertains, 
the medical officer will transmit such information to a medical doctor 
named by the requesting individual.
    (5) Limitations on access. Nothing in this section shall allow an 
individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation 
of a civil action or proceeding. Other limitations on access are those 
specifically addressed in Sec. Sec. 266.6(b)(4) and 266.9.
    (6) Response when compliance is not possible. A reply denying a 
written request to review a record shall be in writing signed by the 
custodian or other appropriate official and shall be made only if such a 
record does not exist or does not contain personal information relating 
to the requester, or is exempt from disclosure. This reply shall include 
a statement regarding the determining factors of denial, and the right 
to appeal to denial to the General Counsel.
    (c) Compliance With Request for Amendment. (1) Correct or eliminate 
any information that is found to be incomplete, inaccurate, not relevant 
to a statutory purpose of the Postal Service, or not timely and notify 
the requester when this action is complete, or
    (2) Not later than thirty (30) working days after receipt of a 
request to amend, notify the requester of a determination not to amend 
and of the requester's right to appeal, or to submit, in lieu of an 
appeal, a statement of reasonable length setting forth a position 
regarding the disputed information to be attached to the contested 
personal record.
    (d) Availability of Assistance in Exercising Rights. The Manager, 
Records Office is available to provide an individual with assistance in 
exercising rights pursuant to this part.

Sec. 266.7  Appeal procedure.

    (a) Appeal Procedure. (1) If a request to inspect, copy, or amend a 
record is denied, in whole or in part, or if no determination is made 
within the period prescribed by this part, the requester shall appeal to 
the General Counsel, U.S. Postal Service, Washington, DC 20260-1100.
    (2) The requester should submit his appeal in writing within thirty 
(30) days of the date of denial, or within ninety (90) days of such 
request if the appeal is from a failure of the custodian to make a 
determination. The letter of appeal should include, as applicable:
    (i) Reasonable identification of the record access to which or the 
amendment of which was requested.
    (ii) A statement of the Postal Service action or failure to act and 
of the relief sought.
    (iii) A copy of the request, of the notification of denial and of 
any other related correspondence.
    (3) Any record found on appeal to be incomplete, inaccurate, not 
relevant, or not timely, shall within thirty (30) working days of the 
date of such findings be appropriately amended.
    (4) The decision of the General Counsel, constitutes the final 
decision of the Postal Service on the right of the requester to inspect, 
copy, change, or update a record. The decision on the appeal shall be in 
writing and in the event of a denial shall set forth the reasons for 
such denial and state the individual's right to obtain judicial review 
in a district court. An indexed file of decisions on appeals shall be 
maintained by the General Counsel.
    (b) Submission of Statement of Disagreement. If the final decision 
concerning a request for the amendment of a record does not satisfy the 
requester, any statement of reasonable length provided by that 
individual setting forth a position regarding the disputed information 
will be accepted and attached to the relevant personal record.

Sec. 266.8  Schedule of fees.

    (a) Policy. The purpose of this section is to establish fair and 
equitable fees to permit duplication of records for subject individuals 
(or authorized representatives) while recovering the full

[[Page 133]]

allowable direct costs incurred by the Postal Service.
    (b) Duplication. (1) For duplicating any paper or micrographic 
record or publication or computer report, the fee is $.15 per page, 
except that the first 100 pages furnished in response to a particular 
request shall be furnished without charge. See paragraph (d) of this 
section for fee limitations.
    (2) The Postal Service may at its discretion make coin-operated copy 
machines available at any location. In that event, requesters will be 
given the opportunity to make copies at their own expense.
    (3) The Postal Service normally will not furnish more than one copy 
of any record. If duplicate copies are furnished at the request of the 
requester, $.15 per page fee is charged for each copy of each duplicate 
page without regard to whether the requester is eligible for free copies 
pursuant to Sec. 266.8(b)(1).
    (c) Aggregating requests. When the custodian reasonably believes 
that a requester is attempting to break a request for similar types of 
records down into a series of requests in order to evade the assessment 
of fees, the custodian may aggregate the requests and charge 
accordingly.
    (d) Limitations. No fee will be charged an individual for the 
process of retrieving, reviewing, or amending a record pertaining to 
that individual.
    (e) The Postal Service may, at its discretion, require reimbursement 
of its costs as a condition of participation in a computer matching 
program or activity with another agency. The agency to be charged is 
notified in writing of the approximate costs before they are incurred. 
Costs are calculated in accordance with the schedule of fees at Sec. 
265.9.

Sec. 266.9  Exemptions.

    (a) Subsections 552a(j) and (k) of 5 U.S.C. 552a empower the 
Postmaster General to exempt systems of records meeting certain criteria 
from various other subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a. With respect to systems 
of records so exempted, nothing in this part shall require compliance 
with provisions hereof implementing any subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a 
from which those systems have been exempted.
    (b) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section contains a summary of 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a for which exemption is claimed for some 
systems of records pursuant to, and to the extent permitted by, 
subsections 552a(j) and (k) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. Paragraphs (b)(2) through 
(5) of this section identify the exempted systems of records, the 
exemptions applied to each, and the reasons for the exemptions:
    (1) Explanation of provisions under 5 U.S.C. 552a for which an 
exemption is claimed in the systems discussed below. (i) Subsection 
(c)(3) requires an agency to make available to the individual named in 
the records an accounting of each disclosure of records.
    (ii) Subsection (c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or 
other agency to which a record has been disclosed of any correction or 
notation of dispute the agency has made to the record in accordance with 
5 U.S.C. 552a(d).
    (iii) Subsections (d)(1) through (4) require an agency to permit an 
individual to gain access to records about the individual, to request 
amendment of such records, to request a review of an agency decision not 
to amend such records, and to provide a statement of disagreement about 
a disputed record to be filed and disclosed with the disputed record.
    (iv) Subsection (e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its records 
only such information about an individual that is relevant and necessary 
to accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive order of the 
President.
    (v) Subsection (e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to 
the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual 
when the information may result in adverse determinations about an 
individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under federal programs.
    (vi) Subsection (e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whom 
it asks to supply information of the authority under which the 
information is sought, the purposes for which the information will be 
used, the routine

[[Page 134]]

uses that may be made of the information, whether disclosure is 
mandatory or voluntary, and the effects of not providing the 
information.
    (vii) Subsection (e)(4)(G) and (H) requires an agency to publish a 
Federal Register notice of its procedures whereby an individual can be 
notified upon request whether the system of records contains information 
about the individual, how to gain access to any record about the 
individual contained in the system, and how to contest its content.
    (viii) Subsection (e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records 
with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is 
reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the individual in making any 
determination about the individual.
    (ix) Subsection (e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable efforts 
to serve notice on an individual when any record on such individual is 
made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such 
process becomes a matter of public record.
    (x) Subsection (f) requires an agency to establish procedures 
whereby an individual can be notified upon request if any system of 
records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to the 
individual, obtain access to the record, and request amendment.
    (xi) Subsection (g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails 
to comply with the access and amendment provisions of subsections (d)(1) 
and (d)(3), and with other provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, or any rule 
promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an 
individual.
    (xii) Subsection (m) requires an agency to cause the requirements of 
5 U.S.C. 552a to be applied to a contractor operating a system of 
records to accomplish an agency function.
    (2) Pursuant to subsection 552a(j)(2), Emergency Management Records, 
USPS 500.300; Inspection Service Investigative File System, USPS 
700.000; Mail Cover Program Records, USPS 700.100; and Inspector General 
Investigative Records, USPS 700.300, are exempt from subsections 552a 
(c)(3), (c)(4), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1)-(3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5), 
(e)(8), (f), (g), and (m) because the systems contain information 
pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. The reasons for 
exemption follow:
    (i) Disclosure to the record subject pursuant to subsections (c)(3), 
(c)(4), or (d)(1)-(4) could:
    (A) Alert subjects that they are targets of an investigation or mail 
cover by the Postal Inspection Service or an investigation by the Office 
of Inspector General;
    (B) Alert subjects of the nature and scope of the investigation and 
of evidence obtained;
    (C) Enable the subject of an investigation to avoid detection or 
apprehension;
    (D) Subject confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement 
personnel to harassment or intimidation if their identities were 
released to the target of an investigation;
    (E) Constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of 
third parties who are involved in a certain investigation;
    (F) Intimidate potential witnesses and cause them to be reluctant to 
offer information;
    (G) Lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction 
or alteration of evidence yet to be discovered, the fabrication of 
testimony, or the compromising of classified material; and
    (H) Seriously impede or compromise law enforcement, mail cover, or 
background investigations that might involve law enforcement aspects as 
a result of the above.
    (ii) Application of subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) is impractical 
because the relevance, necessity, or correctness of specific information 
might be established only after considerable analysis and as the 
investigation progresses. As to relevance (subsection (e)(1)), effective 
law enforcement requires the keeping of information not relevant to a 
specific Postal Inspection Service investigation or Office of Inspector 
General investigation. Such information may be kept to provide leads for 
appropriate law enforcement and to establish patterns of activity that 
might relate to the jurisdiction of the Office of Inspector General, 
Postal Inspection Service, and/or other agencies. As to

[[Page 135]]

accuracy (subsection (e)(5)), the correctness of records sometimes can 
be established only in a court of law.
    (iii) Application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would require 
collection of information directly from the subject of a potential or 
ongoing investigation. The subject would be put on alert that he or she 
is a target of an investigation by the Office of Inspector General, or 
an investigation or mail cover by the Postal Inspection Service, 
enabling avoidance of detection or apprehension, thereby seriously 
compromising law enforcement, mail cover, or background investigations 
involving law enforcement aspects. Moreover, in certain circumstances 
the subject of an investigation is not required to provide information 
to investigators, and information must be collected from other sources.
    (iv) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do 
not apply because this system is exempt from the provisions of 
subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of 
its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is 
appropriate in some cases.
    (v) Application of subsection (e)(8) could prematurely reveal an 
ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation.
    (vi) The provisions of subsection (g) do not apply because exemption 
from the provisions of subsection (d) renders the provisions on suits to 
enforce subsection (d) inapplicable.
    (vii) If one of these systems of records is operated in whole or in 
part by a contractor, the exemptions claimed herein shall remain 
applicable to it (subsection (m)).
    (3) Pursuant to subsection 552a(k)(2), Labor Relations Records, USPS 
200.000; Emergency Management Records, USPS 500.300; Inspection Service 
Investigative File System, USPS 700.000; Mail Cover Program Records, 
USPS 700.100; Inspector General Investigative Records, USPS 700.300; and 
Financial Transactions, USPS 860.000, are exempt from certain 
subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a because the systems contain investigatory 
material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material 
within the scope of subsection 552a(j)(2).
    (i) Emergency Management Records, USPS 500.300; Inspection Service 
Investigative File System, USPS 700.000; Mail Cover Program Records, 
USPS 700.100; and Inspector General Investigative Records, USPS 700.300, 
are exempt from subsections 552a(c)(3), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) 
and (H), and (f) for the same reasons as stated in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (ii) Labor Relations Records, USPS 200.000, is exempt from 
subsections 552a(d)(1)-(4), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) for the following 
reasons:
    (A) Application of the requirements at subsections (d)(1)-(4) would 
cause disruption of enforcement of the laws relating to equal employment 
opportunity (EEO). It is essential to the integrity of the EEO complaint 
system that information collected in the investigative process not be 
prematurely disclosed and that witnesses be free from restraint, 
interference, coercion, or reprisal.
    (B) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do 
not apply for the same reasons described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this 
section.
    (iii) Financial Transactions, USPS 860.000, is exempt from 
subsections 552a(c)(3), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) 
for the following reasons:
    (A) Disclosure to the record subject pursuant to subsections (c)(3) 
and (d)(1)-(4) would violate the non-notification provision of the Bank 
Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), under which the Postal Service is 
prohibited from notifying a transaction participant that a suspicious 
transaction report has been made. In addition, the access provisions of 
subsections (c)(3) and (d)(1)-(4) would alert individuals that they have 
been identified as suspects or possible subjects of investigation and 
thus seriously hinder the law enforcement purposes underlying the 
suspicious transaction reports.
    (B) This system is in compliance with subsection (e)(1) because 
maintenance of the records is required by law. Strict application of the 
relevance and necessity requirements of subsection (e)(1) to suspicious 
transactions would be impractical, however, because the relevance or 
necessity of specific information can often be established only after

[[Page 136]]

considerable analysis and as an investigation progresses.
    (C) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do 
not apply because this system is exempt from the provisions of 
subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of 
its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is 
appropriate in some cases.
    (4) Pursuant to subsection 552a(k)(5), Recruiting, Examining, and 
Placement Records, USPS 100.100; Labor Relations Records, USPS 200.000; 
Inspection Service Investigative File System, USPS 700.000; and 
Inspector General Investigative Records, USPS 700.300 are exempt from 
certain subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a because the systems contain 
investigatory material compiled for the purpose of determining 
suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment, contracts, 
or access to classified information.
    (i) Recruiting, Examining, and Placement Records, USPS 100.100, is 
exempt from subsections 552a(d)(1)-(4) and (e)(1) for the following 
reasons:
    (A) During its investigation and evaluation of an applicant for a 
position, the Postal Service contacts individuals who, without an 
assurance of anonymity, would refuse to provide information concerning 
the subject of the investigation. If a record subject were given access 
pursuant to subsection (d)(1)-(4), the promised confidentiality would be 
breached and the confidential source would be identified. The result 
would be restriction of the free flow of information vital to a 
determination of an individual's qualifications and suitability for 
appointment to or continued occupancy of his or her position.
    (B) In collecting information for investigative and evaluative 
purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information 
might be of assistance in determining the qualifications and suitability 
of an individual for appointment. Information that seems irrelevant, 
when linked with other information, can sometimes provide a composite 
picture of an individual that assists in determining whether that 
individual should be appointed to or retained in a position. For this 
reason, exemption from subsection (e)(1) is claimed.
    (C) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do 
not apply because this system is exempt from the provisions of 
subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of 
its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is 
appropriate in some cases.
    (ii) Labor Relations Records, USPS 200.000, is exempt from 
subsections 552a(d)(1)-(4), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) for the following 
reasons:
    (A) Application of the provisions at subsection (d)(1)-(4) would 
reveal to the EEO complainant the identity of individuals who supplied 
information under a promise of anonymity. It is essential to the 
integrity of the EEO complaint system that information collected in the 
investigative process not be prematurely disclosed and that witnesses be 
free from restraint, interference, coercion, or reprisal.
    (B) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do 
not apply because this system is exempt from the provisions of 
subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of 
its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is 
appropriate in some cases.
    (iii) Inspection Service Investigative File System, USPS 700.000; 
and Inspector General Investigative Records, USPS 700.300, are exempt 
from subsections 552a(c)(3), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and 
(f) for the same reasons as stated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (5) Pursuant to subsection 552a(k)(6), Employee Development and 
Training Records, USPS 100.300; Personnel Research Records, 100.600; and 
Emergency Management Records, USPS 500.300 are exempt from subsections 
552a(d)(1)-(4), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) because the systems contain 
testing or examination material the disclosure of which would compromise 
the objectivity or fairness of the material. The reasons for exemption 
follow:
    (i) These systems contain questions and answers to standard testing 
materials, the disclosure of which would compromise the fairness of the 
future use of these materials. It is not feasible to develop entirely 
new examinations after each administration as would be necessary if 
questions or answers were

[[Page 137]]

available for inspection and copying. Consequently, exemption from 
subsection (d) is claimed.
    (ii) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do 
not apply because this system is exempt from the provisions of 
subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of 
its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is 
appropriate in some cases.

Sec. 266.10  Computer matching.

    (a) General. Any agency or Postal Service component that wishes to 
use records from a Postal Service automated system of records in a 
computerized comparison with other postal or non-postal records must 
submit its proposal to the Postal Service Manager Records Office. 
Computer matching programs as defined in paragraph (c) of Sec. 262.5 
must be conducted in accordance with the Privacy Act, implementing 
guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget and these 
regulations. Records may not be exchanged for a matching program until 
all procedural requirements of the Act and these regulations have been 
met. Other matching activities must be conducted in accordance with the 
Privacy Act and with the approval of the Manager, Records Office. See 
paragraph (b)(6) of Sec. 266.4.
    (b) Procedure for submission of matching proposals. A proposal must 
include information required for the matching agreement discussed in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The Inspection Service must submit its 
proposals for matching programs and other matching activities to the 
Postal Service Manager Records Office through: Independent Counsel, 
Inspection Service, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Rm 3417, 
Washington, DC 20260-2181. All other matching proposals, whether from 
postal organizations or other government agencies, must be mailed 
directly to: Manager, Records Office, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant 
Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260.
    (c) Lead time. Proposals must be submitted to the Postal Service 
Manager Records Office at least 3 months in advance of the anticipated 
starting date to allow time to meet Privacy Act publication and review 
requirements.
    (d) Matching agreements. The participants in a computer matching 
program must enter into a written agreement specifying the terms under 
which the matching program is to be conducted. The Manager, Records 
Office may require similar written agreements for other matching 
activities.
    (1) Content. Agreements must specify:
    (i) The purpose and legal authority for conducting the matching 
program;
    (ii) The justification for the program and the anticipated results, 
including, when appropriate, a specific estimate of any savings in terms 
of expected costs and benefits, in sufficient detail for the Data 
Integrity Board to make an informed decision;
    (iii) A description of the records that are to be matched, including 
the data elements to be used, the number of records, and the approximate 
dates of the matching program;
    (iv) Procedures for providing notice to individuals who supply 
information that the information may be subject to verification through 
computer matching programs;
    (v) Procedures for verifying information produced in a matching 
program and for providing individuals an opportunity to contest the 
findings in accordance with the requirement that an agency may not take 
adverse action against an individual as a result of information produced 
by a matching program until the agency has independently verified the 
information and provided the individual with due process;
    (vi) Procedures for ensuring the administrative, technical, and 
physical security of the records matched; for the retention and timely 
destruction of records created by the matching program; and for the use 
and return or destruction of records used in the program;
    (vii) Prohibitions concerning duplication and redisclosure of 
records exchanged, except where required by law or essential to the 
conduct of the matching program;
    (viii) Assessments of the accuracy of the records to be used in the 
matching program; and
    (ix) A statement that the Comptroller General may have access to all

[[Page 138]]

records of the participant agencies in order to monitor compliance with 
the agreement.
    (2) Approval. Before the Postal Service may participate in a 
computer matching program or other computer matching activity that 
involves both USPS and non-USPS records, the Data Integrity Board must 
have evaluated the proposed match and approved the terms of the matching 
agreement. To be effective, the matching agreement must receive approval 
by each member of the Board. Votes are collected by the Postal Service 
Manager Records Office. Agreements are signed on behalf of the Board by 
the Chairman. If a matching agreement is disapproved by the Board, any 
party may appeal the disapproval in writing to the Director, Office of 
Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503-0001, within 30 days 
following the Board's written disapproval.
    (3) Effective dates. No matching agreement is effective until 40 
days after the date on which a copy is sent to Congress. The agreement 
remains in effect only as long as necessary to accomplish the specific 
matching purpose, but no longer than 18 months, at which time the 
agreement expires unless extended. The Data Integrity Board may extend 
an agreement for one additional year, without further review, if within 
3 months prior to expiration of the 18-month period it finds that the 
matching program is to be conducted without change, and each party to 
the agreement certifies that the program has been conducted in 
compliance with the matching agreement. Renewal of a continuing matching 
program that has run for the full 30-month period requires a new 
agreement that has received Data Integrity Board approval.

Sec. 268.1  General principles.

    In order to conduct its business, the Postal Service has the need to 
collect various types of personally identifiable information about its 
customers, employees and other individuals. Information of this nature 
has been entrusted to the Postal Service, and employees handling it have 
a legal and ethical obligation to hold it in confidence and to actively 
protect it from uses other than those compatible with the purpose for 
which the information was collected. This obligation is legally imposed 
by the Privacy Act of 1974, which places specific requirements upon all 
Federal agencies, including the Postal Service, and their employees. In 
implementation of these requirements, the following rules of conduct 
apply:
    (a) Except as specifically authorized in Sec. 266.4(b)(2) of this 
chapter, no employee shall disclose, directly or indirectly, the 
contents of any record about another individual to any person or 
organization. Managers are to provide guidance in this regard to all 
employees who must handle such information.
    (b) No employee will maintain a secret system of records about 
individuals. All records systems containing personally identifiable 
information about individuals must be reported to the Manager, Records 
Office.
    (c) All employees shall adhere strictly to the procedures 
established by the U.S. Postal Service to ensure the confidentiality and 
integrity of information about individuals that is collected, maintained 
and used for official Postal Service business. Employees shall be held 
responsible for any violation of these procedures.

<R05>
Sec. 268.2  Consequences of non-compliance.

    (a) The Privacy Act authorizes any individual, whether or not an 
employee, to bring a civil action in U.S. District Court to obtain 
judicial review of the failure of the Postal Service to comply with the 
requirements of the Act or its implementing regulations. In certain 
instances of willful or intentional non-compliance, the plaintiff may 
recover damages from the Postal Service in the minimum amount of $1,000 
together with costs of the action and attorney fees.
    (b) The Act provides criminal sanctions for individuals, including 
employees, who violate certain of its provisions.
    (1) Any officer or employee who, by virtue of his employment or 
position, has possession of, or access to, official records which 
contain individually identifiable information and who, knowing that 
disclosure of the specific material is prohibited by Postal Service 
regulations, willfully discloses the material to a person or agency not 
entitled to receive it, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not 
more than $5,000.
    (2) Any officer or employee who willfully maintains a system of 
records without meeting the notice requirements set forth in Postal 
Service regulations shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more 
than $5,000.
    (3) Any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any 
record concerning another individual from the Postal Service under false 
pretense shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than 
$5,000.
    (c) In addition to the criminal sanctions, any employee violating 
any provisions of these rules of conduct is subject to disciplinary 
action which may

[[Page 142]]

result in dismissal from the Postal Service.

U.S.C. 3802, and, if so, whether prosecution would likely result in the 
imposition and collection of civil penalties and applicable assessments.
    (b) If the Reviewing Official determines that a case has merit and

to the Reviewing Official's written notice described in Sec. 273.6 
within 90 days. The Reviewing Official may refer allegations of 
liability to the Judicial Officer only if the Attorney General or his

[[Page 146]]

    (2) That the initiation of a proceeding under the Program Fraud 
Civil Remedies Act is appropriate.
    (b) If at any time after the Attorney General approves the referral 
of a case to the Judicial Officer, the Attorney General or his designee 
transmits to the Postmaster General a written finding that the 
continuation of any proceeding under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies 
Act with respect to a claim or statement may adversely affect any 
pending or potential criminal or civil action related to such claim or 
statement, such proceeding shall be immediately stayed and may be 
resumed only upon written authorization of the Attorney General.

section, a Complaint, which:
    (1) Specifies the allegations of liability against the Respondent,

962 of this title; and
    (7) Notifies the Respondent that his or her failure to request a 
hearing on the issues raised by the Complaint within 30 days of its 
receipt may result in the imposition of the proposed penalty and 
assessments pursuant to Sec. Sec. 962.4(a) and 962.15(d) of this title.
    (b) Service of a Complaint issued under paragraph (a) of this 
section must be effected by registered or certified mail, return-receipt 
requested, or by personal delivery. In the case of personal service, the 
person making service shall, if possible, secure from the person sought

    Source: 39 FR 33211, Sept. 16, 1974, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 310.1  Definitions.

    (a) Letter is a message directed to a specific person or address and 
recorded in or on a tangible object, subject to the following:
    (1) Tangible objects used for letters include, but are not limited 
to, paper (including paper in sheet or card form), recording disks, and 
magnetic tapes. Tangible objects used for letters do not include (i) 
objects the material or shape and design of which make them valuable or 
useful for purposes other than as media for long-distance 
communications, unless they are actually used as media for personal and 
business correspondence, and (ii) outsized, rigid objects not capable of 
enclosure in envelopes, sacks, boxes or other containers commonly used 
to transmit letters or packets of letters.
    (2) Message means any information or intelligence that can be 
recorded as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (3) A message is directed to a ``specific person or address'' when, 
for example, it, or the container in which it is carried, singly or with 
other messages, identical or different, is marked for delivery to a 
specific person or place, or is delivered to a specific person or place 
in accordance with a selective delivery plan. Selective delivery plans 
include delivery to particular persons or addresses by use of detached 
address labels or cards; address lists; memorized groups of addresses; 
or ``piggy-backed'' delivery with addressed articles of merchandise, 
publications, or other items. Selective delivery plans do not include 
distributions of materials without written addresses to passersby on a 
particular street corner, or to all residents or randomly selected 
residents of an area. A message bearing the name or address of a 
specific person or place is a letter even if it is intended by the 
sender to be read or otherwise used by some person or persons other than 
or in addition to the addressee.
    (4) Methods by which messages are recorded on tangible objects 
include, but are not limited to, the use of written or printed 
characters, drawing, holes, or orientations of magnetic particles in a 
manner having a predetermined significance.
    (5) Whether a tangible object bears a message is to be determined on 
an objective basis without regard to the intended or actual use made of 
the object sent.
    (6) Identical messages directed to more than one specific person or 
address or separately directed to the same person or address constitute 
separate letters.
    (7) The following are not letters within the meaning of these 
regulations: \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Several of the items enumerated in this paragraph (a)(7) do not 
self-evidently lie outside of the definition of ``letter''. To the 
extent, however, that there is any question whether these items may 
properly be excluded by definition, the Postal Service has determined by 
adoption of these regulations that the restrictions of the Private 
Express Statutes are suspended pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 601(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Telegrams.
    (ii) Checks, drafts, promissory notes, bonds, other negotiable and 
nonnegotiable financial instruments, stock certificates, other 
securities, insurance policies, and title policies when shipped to, 
from, or between financial institutions.
    (A) As used above, checks and drafts include documents intrinsically 
related to and regularly accompanying the movement of checks or drafts 
within

[[Page 149]]

the banking system. ``Checks'' do not include materials accompanying the 
movement of checks to financial institutions from persons who are not 
financial institutions, or vice versa, except such materials as would 
qualify under Sec. 310.3(a) if ``checks'' were treated as cargo. 
Specifically, for example, ``checks'' do not include bank statements 
sent to depositors showing deposits, debits, and account balances.
    (B) As used above, financial institutions means:
    (1) As to checks and drafts: banks, savings banks, savings and loan 
institutions, credit unions, and their offices, affiliates, and 
facilities.
    (2) As to other instruments: institutions performing functions 
involving the bulk generation, clearance, and transfer of such 
instruments.
    (iii) Abstracts of title, mortgages and other liens, deeds, leases, 
releases, articles of incorporation, papers filed in lawsuits or formal 
quasi-judicial proceedings, and orders of courts and of quasi-judicial 
bodies.
    (iv) Newspapers and periodicals.
    (v) Books and catalogs consisting of 24 or more bound pages with at 
least 22 printed, and telephone directories. Separate letters of less 
than 24 bound and 22 printed pages bound to other material do not 
qualify for this exclusion. In determining whether separate letters have 
been bound to other material, the following factors will be considered, 
along with any other relevant factors: Whether the parts are visually 
similar; whether the parts were printed and bound together at the same 
time and by the same process; whether the binding serves an important 
purpose and has been a longstanding practice; and whether the same 
individual reads all parts of the bound document. Ordinarily, books and 
catalogs deal with matters of interest to, and are intended for, a 
substantial number of recipients. In addition, books generally contain a 
substantial number of pages. Accordingly, this exclusion will not apply 
when the nature of the message conveyed, the limited numbers of 
published copies and of recipients, the limited number of pages, or 
other relevant factors suggest that it is not appropriate to treat the 
material as a book or catalog. An item distributed privately, or 
privately and by mail, to fewer than 25 separate persons or places will 
generally not be treated as a book or catalog falling within this 
exclusion.
    (vi) Matter sent from a printer, stationer, or similar source, to a 
person ordering such matter for use as his letters. This exclusion 
applies whether or not the printer, stationer, or similar source is 
owned by or affiliated with the person who orders such matter for use as 
his letters.
    (vii) Letters sent to a records storage center exclusively for 
storage, letters sent exclusively for destruction, letters retrieved 
from a records storage center, and letters sent as part of a household 
or business relocation.
    (viii) Tags, labels, stickers, signs or posters the type-size, 
layout or physical characteristics of which indicate they are primarily 
intended to be attached to other objects for reading.
    (ix) Photographic material being sent by a person to a processor and 
processed photographic material being returned from the processor to the 
person sending the material for processing.
    (x) Copy sent from a person to an independent or company-owned 
printer or compositor, or between printers and compositors, and proofs 
or printed matter returned from the printer or compositor to the office 
of the person who initially sent the copy.
    (xi) Sound recordings, films, and packets of identical printed 
letters containing messages all or the overwhelming bulk of which are to 
be disseminated to the public. The ``public'' does not include 
individuals residing at the place of address; individuals employed by 
the organization doing business at the place of address (whether or not 
the actual place of employment is the place of address); individuals who 
are members of an organization, if an organization is located at the 
place of address; or other individuals who, individually or as members 
of a group, are reasonably identifiable to the sender.
    (xii) Computer programs recorded on media suitable for direct input. 
For the conditions under which the Private Express Statutes are 
suspended for data processing materials, see Sec. 320.2.

[[Page 150]]

    (b) Packet means two or more letters, identical or different, or two 
or more packets of letters, under one cover or otherwise bound together. 
As used in these regulations, unless the context otherwise requires, 
``letter'' or ``letters'' includes ``packet'' or ``packets''.
    (c) Person means an individual, corporation, association, 
partnership, governmental agency, or other organization or entity.
    (d) Post routes are routes on which mail is carried by the Postal 
Service, and includes post roads as defined in 39 U.S.C. 5003, as 
follows:
    (1) The waters of the United States, during the time the mail is 
carried thereon;
    (2) Railroads or parts of railroads and air routes in operation;
    (3) Canals, during the time the mail is carried thereon;
    (4) Public roads, highways, and toll roads during the time the mail 
is carried thereon; and
    (5) Letter-carrier routes established for the collection and 
delivery of mail.
    (e) Private carriage, private carrier, and terms of similar import 
used in connection with the Private Express Statutes or these 
regulations mean carriage by anyone other than the Postal Service, 
regardless of any meaning ascribed to similar terms under other bodies 
of law or regulation.
    (f) The Private Express Statutes are set forth in 18 U.S.C. 1693-
1699 and 39 U.S.C. 601-606 (1970).
    (g) The term identical printed letters includes letters that differ 
only in name, address or serial number.

<R05>
Sec. 310.2  Unlawful carriage of letters.

    (a) It is generally unlawful under the Private Express Statutes for 
any person other than the Postal Service in any manner to send or carry 
a letter on a post route or in any manner to cause or assist such 
activity. Violation may result in injunction, fine or imprisonment or 
both and payment of postage lost as a result of the illegal activity 
(see Sec. 310.5).
    (b) Activity described in paragraph (a) of this section is lawful 
with respect to a letter if:
    (1)(i) The letter is enclosed in an envelope or other suitable 
cover;
    (ii) The amount of postage which would have been charged on the 
letter if it had been sent through the Postal Service is paid by stamps, 
or postage meter stamps, on the cover or by other methods approved by 
the Postal Service;
    (iii) The name and address of the person for whom the letter is 
intended appear on the cover;
    (iv) The cover is so sealed that the letter cannot be taken from it 
without defacing the cover;
    (v) Any stamps on the cover are canceled in ink by the sender; and
    (vi) The date of the letter, or of its transmission or receipt by 
the carrier, is endorsed on the cover in ink by the sender or carrier, 
as appropriate; or
    (2)(i) The activity is in accordance with the terms of a written 
agreement between the shipper or the carrier of the letter and the 
Postal Service. Such an agreement may include some or all of the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or it may change them, 
but it must:
    (A) Adequately ensure payment of an amount equal to the postage to 
which the Postal Service would have been entitled had the letters been 
carried in the mail;
    (B) Remain in effect for a specified period (subject to renewals); 
and
    (C) Provide for periodic review, audit, and inspection.
    (ii) Possible alternative arrangements may include but are not 
limited to:
    (A) Payment of a fixed sum at specified intervals based on the 
shipper's projected shipment of letters for a given period, as verified 
by the Postal Service; or
    (B) Utilization of a computer record to determine the volume of 
letters shipped during an interval and the applicable postage to be 
remitted to the Postal Service.
    (c) The Postal Service may suspend the operation of any part of 
paragraph (b) of this section where the public interest requires the 
suspension.

[[Page 151]]

    (d) Activity described in paragraph (a) of this section is permitted 
with respect to letters which:
    (1) Relate to some part of the cargo of, or to some article carried 
at the same time by, the conveyance carrying it (see Sec. 310.3(a));
    (2) Are sent by or addressed to the carrier (see Sec. 310.3(b));
    (3) Are conveyed or transmitted without compensation (see Sec. 
310.3(c));
    (4) Are conveyed or transmitted by special messenger employed for 
the particular occasion only, provided that not more than twenty-five 
such letters are conveyed or transmitted by such special messenger (see 
Sec. 310.3(d)); or
    (5) Are carried prior or subsequent to mailing (see Sec. 310.3(e)).

[39 FR 33211, Sept. 16, 1974, as amended at 45 FR 77029, Nov. 21, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 310.3  Exceptions.

    (a) Cargo. The sending or carrying of letters is permissible if they 
accompany and relate in all substantial respects to some part of the 
cargo or to the ordering, shipping or delivering of the cargo.
    (b) Letters of the carrier. (1) The sending or carrying of letters 
is permissible if they are sent by or addressed to the person carrying 
them. If the individual actually carrying the letters is not the person 
sending the letters or to whom the letters are addressed, then such 
individual must be an officer or employee of such person (see Sec. 
310.3(b)(2)) and the letters must relate to the current business of such 
person.
    (2) The fact that the individual actually carrying the letters may 
be an officer or employee of the person sending the letters or to whom 
the letters are addressed for certain purposes does not necessarily mean 
that he is an officer or employee for purposes of this exception. The 
following factors bear on qualifications for the exception: the carrying 
employee is employed for a substantial time, if not fulltime (letters 
must not be privately carried by casual employees); the carrying 
employee carries no matter for other senders; the carrying employee is a 
regular salaried employee and shares in all privileges enjoyed by other 
regular employees (including employees not engaged primarily by the 
letter carrying function), including but not limited to salary, annual 
vacation time, absence allowed for illness, health benefits, workmen's 
compensation insurance, and retirement benefits.
    (3) Separately incorporated carriers are separate entities for 
purposes of this exception, regardless of any subsidiary, ownership, or 
leasing arrangement. When, however, two concerns jointly operate an 
enterprise with joint employees and share directly in its revenues and 
expenses, either of the concerns may carry the letters of the joint 
enterprise.
    (c) Private hands without compensation. The sending or carrying of 
letters without compensation is permitted. Compensation generally 
consists of a monetary payment for services rendered. Compensation may 
also consist, however, of non-monetary valuable consideration and of 
good will Thus, for example, when a business relationship exists or is 
sought between the carrier and its user, carriage by the carrier of the 
user's letter will ordinarily not fall under this exception; or, when a 
person is engaged in the transportation of goods or persons for hire, 
his carrying of letters ``free of charge'' for customers whom he does 
charge for the carriage of goods or persons does not fall under this 
exception.
    (d) Special messenger. (1) The use of a special messenger employed 
for the particular occasion only is permissible to transmit letters if 
not more than twenty-five letters are involved. The permission granted 
under this exception is restricted to use of messenger service on an 
infrequent, irregular basis by the sender or addressee of the message.
    (2) A special messenger is a person who, at the request of either 
the sender or the addressee, picks up a letter from the sender's home or 
place of business and carries it to the addressees home or place of 
business, but a messenger or carrier operating regularly between fixed 
points is not a special messenger.
    (e) Carriage prior or subsequent to mailing. (1) The private 
carriage of letters which enter the mail stream at some point between 
their origin and their destination is permissible. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section, however, the carriage of letters

[[Page 152]]

from a place where they have been opened, read, separated, or otherwise 
utilized, does not fall within this exception even though such letters 
had previously been in the mail stream. Similarly, the carriage of 
letters to a place where they will be consolidated or otherwise utilized 
does not fall within this exception even though they will subsequently 
enter the mail stream.
    (2) Examples of permitted activities are the pickup and carriage of 
letters which are delivered to post offices for mailing; the pickup and 
carriage of letters at post offices for delivery to addressees; and the 
bulk shipment of individually addressed letters ultimately carried by 
the Postal Service.
    (3) The private carriage of letters from branches of an organization 
to a location for preparation for mailing does not constitute a 
consolidation. The private carriage of letters from an organization's 
point of mail delivery to its branches in the locality does not 
constitute a separation.

<R05>
Sec. 310.4  Responsibility of carriers.

    Private carriers are cautioned to make sure that their carriage of 
matter is lawful within the definition, exceptions, suspension, and 
conditions contained in this part and in part 320 of this chapter. They 
should take reasonable measures to inform their customers of the 
contents of these regulations so that only proper matter is tendered to 
them for carriage. Carriers should desist from carrying any matter when 
the form of shipment, identity of sender or recipient, or any other 
information reasonably accessible to them indicates that matter tendered 
to them for carriage is not proper under these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 310.5  Payment of postage on violation.

    (a) Upon discovery of activity made unlawful by the Private Express 
Statutes, the Postal Service may require any person or persons who 
engage in, cause, or assist such activity to pay an amount or amounts 
not exceeding the total postage to which it would have been entitled had 
it carried the letters between their origin and destination.
    (b) The amount equal to postage will be due and payable not later 
than 15 days after receipt of formal demand from the Inspection Service 
or the Manager, Mailing Standards, USPS Headquarters, unless an appeal 
is taken to the Judicial Officer Department in accordance with rules of 
procedure set out in part 959 of this chapter.
    (c) Refusal to pay an unappealed demand or a demand that becomes 
final after appeal will subject the violator to civil suit by the Postal 
Service to collect the amount equal to postage.
    (d) The payment of amounts equal to postage on violation shall in no 
way limit other actions to enforce the Private Express Statutes by civil 
or criminal proceedings.

    The definitions in Sec. 310.1 apply to part 320 as well. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Several of the items enumerated in Sec. 310.1(a)(7) do not 
self-evidently lie outside of the definition of ``letter''. To the 
extent, however, that there is any question whether these items may 
properly be excluded by definition, the Postal Service has determined by 
adoption of these regulations that the restrictions of the Private 
Express Statutes are suspended pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 601(b).

Sec. 320.2  Suspension for certain data processing materials.

    (a) The operation of 39 U.S.C. 601(a) (1) through (6) and Sec. 
310.2(b) (1) through (6) of this chapter is suspended on all post routes 
for data processing materials defined in paragraph (c) of this section 
on the terms detailed in paragraph (b) of this section, subject to the 
operating requirements in Sec. 320.3.
    (b) The suspension referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is 
for data processing materials conveyed (1) to a data processing center, 
if carriage is completed within 12 hours or by noon of the addressee's 
next business day and if data processing work is commenced on such 
materials within 36 hours of their receipt at the center; or (2) back 
from the data processing center to the address of the office originating 
the incoming materials, if carriage is completed within 12 hours or by 
noon of the addressee's next business day, and if data processing work 
was commenced on the incoming materials within 36 hours of their receipt 
at the center. For purposes of the time limitations for completion of 
delivery referred to in the preceding sentence, delivery of shipments 
between a domestic point and a foreign point shall be deemed to begin at 
the time materials of foreign origin are received at the international 
gateway city or end at the time materials of domestic origin leave the 
international gateway city. This suspension does not apply to carriages 
from or to originating offices that are neither part of the firm owning 
the data processing center nor data processing customers of the firm 
owning the data processing center.
    (c) For purposes of this suspension, (1) ``addressee's next business 
day'' means the first calendar day, stated in his local time, on which 
he conducts business, following the calendar day of dispatch, stated in 
the sender's local time; (2) ``data processing'' means electro-
mechanical or electronic processing and includes the recording of data 
by electro-mechanical or electronic means for further processing; and 
(3) ``data processing materials'' means materials of all types that are 
sent exclusively for data processing and are ready for immediate data 
processing, but only if they are produced recurringly in the course of 
the normal business operations of the office originating them or 
receiving them back from the processing center. The performance of 
clerical work which is merely preparatory and incidental to the 
commencement of data processing is not, for purposes of this suspension, 
inconsistent with the requirement that the materials be sent exclusively 
for data processing and be ready for immediate data processing.

Sec. 320.3  Operations under suspension for certain data processing materials.

    (a) Carriers intending to establish or alter operations based on the 
suspension granted pursuant to Sec. 320.2 shall, as a condition to the 
right to operate under the suspension, notify the Manager, Mailing 
Standards, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Rm. 3436, 
Washington, DC 20260-3436, of their intention to establish such 
operations not later than the beginning of such operations. Such 
notification, on a form available from the office of Mailing Standards, 
shall include information on the identity and authority

[[Page 154]]

of the carrier and the scope of its proposed operations.
    (b) Carriers operating under the suspension granted pursuant to 
Sec. 320.2 are responsible for making sure that their carriage of 
matter under the suspension meets all conditions contained in Sec. 
320.2. (See Sec. 310.4.) The containers or covers of any matter carried 
under the suspension must be made available for examination upon request 
by a properly identified representative of Mailing Standards. Carrier 
records--either in the form of notations on the containers or covers of 
any matter carried under the suspension granted pursuant to Sec. 320.2 
or in the form of records kept by employees of the actual times they 
make delivery or pickup stops--must be sufficient to show that the 
delivery of such matter was completed within the applicable time 
limitation prescribed in Sec. 320.2. The provisions of this paragraph 
shall not restrict the Postal Service in the exercise of search powers 
conferred upon it by law.
    (c) The filing of notifications under this section does not relieve 
the operator of responsibility for assuring that its operations conform 
to applicable statutes and regulations.
    (d) Failure to comply with the notification requirements of this 
section and carriage of material or other action in violation of other 
provisions of this part and of part 310 are grounds for administrative 
revocation of the suspension as to a particular carrier for a period of 
not less than one year, in a proceeding instituted by the General 
Counsel, following a hearing by the Judicial Officer Department in 
accordance with the rules of procedure set out in part 959 of this 
chapter.

    Note: The form referred to in Sec. 320.3 is reproduced below.

Sec. 320.4  Suspension for certain letters of college and university organizations.

    The operation of 39 U.S.C. 601(a) (1) through (6) and Sec. 310.2(b) 
(1) through (6) of this chapter is suspended on all post routes to 
permit colleges and universities to carry in their internal mail systems 
the letters of their bona fide student or faculty organizations to 
campus destinations. This suspension does not cover the letters of 
faculty members, students, or organizations other than bona fide student 
or faculty organizations of the carrying college or university. Colleges 
and universities choosing to provide their student or faculty 
organizations access to their internal mail systems are responsible for 
assuring that only letters of bona fide student or faculty organizations 
addressed to campus destinations are carried. (See Sec. 310.4.) For 
purposes of this suspension, ``internal mail systems'' are those which 
carry letters on, between, and among the various campuses of a single 
college or university and which operate in accordance with

the Letters of the carrier exception in 39 CFR 310.3(b).

Sec. 320.5  Suspension for certain international-ocean carrier-related documents.

    The operation of 39 U.S.C. 601(a) (1) through (6) and Sec. 310.2(b) 
(1) through (6) of this chapter is suspended on all post routes for 
documents, sent by a shipper or an ocean carrier from a foreign origin 
to a United States ocean-carrier port city destination or from a United 
States ocean-carrier port city origin to a foreign destination, that 
would be excepted under Sec. 310.3(a) if the documents accompanied the 
cargo. This suspension covers only shipments to or from ports where the 
cargo to which the documents relate is actually loaded on, or unloaded 
from, an ocean vessel. For purposes of this suspension ``foreign 
origins'' or ``foreign destinations'' means origins or destinations 
outside the contiguous 48 states.

[44 FR 52835, Sept 11, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 320.6  Suspension for extremely urgent letters.

    (a) The operation of 39 U.S.C. 601(a) (1) through (6) and Sec. 
310.2(b) (1) through (6) of this chapter is suspended on all post routes 
for extremely urgent letters if the conditions of either paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section, and of the other paragraphs of this section, are 
met.
    (b)(1) For letters dispatched within 50 miles of the intended 
destination, delivery of those dispatched by noon must be completed 
within 6 hours or by the close of the addressee's normal business hours 
that day, whichever is later, and delivery of those dispatched after 
noon and before midnight must be completed by 10 A.M. of the addressee's 
next business day. For other letters, delivery must be completed within 
12 hours or by noon of the addressee's next business day. The suspension 
is available only if the value or usefulness of the letter would be lost 
or greatly diminished if it is not delivered within these time limits. 
For any part of a shipment of letters to qualify under this paragraph 
(b), each of the letters must be extremely urgent.
    (2) Letters sent from the 48 contiguous states of the United States 
to other jurisdictions of the United States or to other nations are 
deemed ``delivered'' when they are in the custody of the international 
or overseas carrier at its last scheduled point of departure from the 48 
contiguous states. Letters sent from other jurisdictions of the United 
States or from other nations into the 48 contiguous states are deemed 
``dispatched'' when they are in the custody of the domestic carrier, 
having been passed by United States Customs, if applicable, at the 
letters' point of arrival in the 48 contiguous states.
    (3) Except as provided in this paragraph (b)(3), the times and time 
limits specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not applicable 
to any locations outside the 48 contiguous states. The times and time 
limits specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are applicable to 
letters dispatched and delivered wholly within Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto 
Rico or a territory or possession of the United States. The regulations 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section relating to the delivery 
and dispatch of letters are applicable by analogy to letters shipped 
between these jurisdictions and other nations.
    (c) It will be conclusively presumed that a letter is extremely 
urgent and is covered by the suspension if the amount paid for private 
carriage of the letter is at least three dollars or twice the applicable 
U.S. postage for First-Class Mail (including priority mail) whichever is 
the greater. If a single shipment consists of a number of letters that 
are picked up together at a single origin and delivered together to a 
single destination, the applicable U.S. postage may be computed for 
purposes of this paragraph as though the shipment constituted a single 
letter of the weight of the shipment. If not actually charged on a 
letter-by-letter or shipment-by-shipment basis, the amount paid may be 
computed for purposes of this paragraph on the basis of the carrier's 
actual charge divided by a bona fide estimate of the average number of 
letters or shipments during the period covered by the carrier's actual 
charge.

[[Page 156]]

    (d) The sender must prominently mark the outside covers or 
containers of letters carried under this suspension with the words 
``Extremely Urgent'' or ``Private Carriage Authorized by Postal 
Regulations (39 CFR 320.6)'' or with a similar legend identifying the 
letters as carried pursuant to this suspension. In addition, each 
outside container or cover must show the name and address of the 
carrier, and the name and address of the addressee. Carrier records must 
be sufficient to show that the delivery of the letters was completed 
within the applicable time limitations, if carried under the authority 
of paragraph (b) of this section, and must be made available for 
inspection at the request of the Postal Service. The required records 
may be either in the form of notations on the containers or covers of 
any letters asserted to be carried under this suspension, or in the form 
of records kept by employees of the actual times they pick up and 
deliver such materials.
    (e) Violation by a shipper or carrier of the terms of this 
suspension is grounds for administrative revocation of the suspension as 
to such shipper or carrier for a period of one year in a proceeding 
instituted by the General Counsel, following a hearing by the Judicial 
Officer Department in accordance with the rules of procedure set out in 
Part 959 of this chapter. The period of the revocation may be reduced or 
be extended for not to exceed one additional year by the Judicial 
Officer, depending on such mitigating or aggravating factors as the 
extent of the postal revenue lost because of the violation and the 
presence or absence of good faith error or of previous violations. The 
failure of a shipper or carrier to cooperate with an authorized 
inspection or audit conducted by the Postal Inspection Service for the 
purpose of determining compliance with the terms of this suspension 
shall be deemed to create a presumption of a violation for the purpose 
of this paragraph (e) and shall shift to the shipper or carrier the 
burden of establishing the fact of compliance. Revocation of this 
suspension as to a shipper or carrier shall in no way limit other 
actions as to such shipper or carrier to enforce the Private Express 
Statutes by administrative proceedings for collection of postage (see 
Sec. 310.5) or by civil or criminal proceedings.
    (f) The following examples illustrate the application of this 
suspension.

    Example (1). The headquarters of a city police department each night 
compiles a list of the license plate numbers and descriptions of 
automobiles reported stolen within the metropolitan area during the 
previous 24 hours. This list is delivered by 7 a.m. the following day to 
each of the local precinct offices located throughout the city. By 9 
a.m. that day, the list is circulated for use by law enforcement units 
operating from each office. Effective police recovery of stolen vehicles 
depends upon having this information handed out in written form to all 
units on at least a daily basis. The private carriage of these lists 
would qualify under the test set in paragraph (b) of this section.
    Example (2). The same police department headquarters also from time 
to time distributes memoranda advising the local precinct officers on 
departmental policy and vacation schedules, and responding to inquiries 
from the local precinct offices. Nothing substantial turns on whether 
these memoranda arrive by midnight or by 10 a.m. of the next business 
day or whether their transmission takes a day or more longer to 
complete. The private carriage of these memoranda would not qualify 
under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.
    Example (3). A health maintenance organization (HMO) operating its 
own hospital, clinics, and medical laboratory daily sends test samples 
and specimens from the HMO's hospital and clinics to its medical 
laboratory in a different location for immediate analysis. In return, 
the HMO laboratory sends to the HMO's hospital and clinics the 
laboratory reports for these samples and specimens on the day the 
reports are completed. The reports are then promptly utilized by the 
hospital and clinics as part of regular diagnostic procedures. The 
private carriage of these reports would qualify under the loss-of-value 
test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.
    Example (4). The same HMO's hospital and clinics send requisitions 
and invoices to the HMO's central office as the need arises for the 
ordering of and payment for goods and services, which are handled 
centrally. Every other Friday, the central office sends to the hospital 
and clinics reports and memoranda on expenditures for personnel, 
supplies, utilities, and other goods and services. Nothing substantial 
turns on whether these materials arrive the same day or by 10 a.m. of 
the next business day or whether their transmission takes a day or more 
longer to complete. The private carriage of these materials would not 
qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 157]]

    Example (5). On Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings, the central 
office of a regional grocery store chain sends out to its various stores 
in the area inventory bulletins prepared over the previous 24 hours 
showing the current availability and prices of meat, produce, dairy 
products, breadstuffs, frozen foods and similar items. Early the 
following afternoon, each store must send these inventory bulletins back 
to the central office with a notation of the store's orders to assure 
that the central office can ship sufficient supplies of such items for 
sale by the store on its next business day. The private carriage of 
these bulletins would qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    Example (6). On Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings, the central 
office of a different regional grocery chain sends out to its various 
stores in the area inventory bulletins showing the current availability 
and prices of meat, produce, dairy products, breadstuffs, frozen foods 
and similar items. Early in the afternoon of the second day following 
receipt of the bulletins, each store sends the bulletins back to the 
central office so that supplies of such items may be shipped to the 
store four days later. Nothing substantial turns on whether these 
bulletins arrive within 12 hours or by noon of the next business day or 
whether their transmission takes a day or more longer to complete. The 
private carriage of these materials would not qualify under the test set 
out in paragraph (b) of this section.
    Example (7). The headquarters office of a large bank each business 
day prepares and sends to its branch offices lists showing current 
foreign exchange rates and similar information that must be updated and 
distributed to the branches on a daily basis in order for the bank to 
avoid the risk of serious financial loss. Within three hours of their 
receipt by each branch office, these lists are circulated and utilized 
by officials of the branch office in conducting regular banking 
procedures involving the use of such lists. The private carriage of 
these lists would qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    Example (8). The field office of an insurance company daily sends 
the insurance applications it has taken in that day to the company's 
central office. The applications are bound (i.e., constitute evidence of 
insurance) for 30 days, but may be canceled by the company. Few if any 
policies have been canceled by the company within 48 hours of their 
receipt at the central office, though the company normally begins 
processing the applications soon after their receipt. Nothing 
substantial turns on whether these bound applications arrive within 12 
hours or by noon of the next business day or whether their transmission 
takes a day or more longer to complete. The private carriage of these 
materials would not qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    Example (9). An organization of real estate brokers in a community 
issues periodic bulletins containing information about properties which 
have been listed for sale by the constituent brokers. Each broker is 
entitled to show the properties to prospective buyers. In order to 
provide each broker with substantially equal opportunity to secure a 
buyer, it is necessary that the bulletins be delivered on the same day 
and within the shortest time span within that day. The bulletins 
constitute the basic source of information for the brokers and delivery 
in the foregoing manner is a key element in the functioning of the 
brokers. The private carriage of the bulletins would therefore qualify 
under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.
    Example (10). The same organization distributes memoranda regarding 
speakers at real estate seminars, sales figures for a given period, and 
other information of significance and interest to real estate brokers 
but which does not affect their competitive positions. A failure to make 
simultaneous or near simultaneous delivery to the brokers, or a failure 
to make delivery within a specified period of time, has no material 
bearing upon the day-to-day operations of the brokers and private 
carriage of these materials would not qualify under the test set out in 
paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 320.7  Suspension for advertisements accompanying parcels or periodicals.

    (a) The operation of 39 U.S.C. 601(a) (1) through (6) and Sec. 
310.2(b) (1) through (6) of this chapter is suspended on all post routes 
for advertisements enclosed with merchandise in parcels or accompanying 
periodicals under the following circumstances:
    (1) The advertisements must not be marked with the names or 
addresses of the intended recipients.
    (2) The advertisements must be incidental to the shipment of the 
merchandise or the periodical.
    (i) An advertisement is incidental to the shipment of the 
accompanying merchandise or the periodical when the merchandise or the 
periodical has been ordered by or would otherwise be sent to the 
recipient even without the accompanying advertisement.
    (ii) Notwithstanding Sec. 320.7(a)(2)(i), an advertisement is not 
incidental to the merchandise when the pertinent circumstances, such as 
the nominal value

[[Page 158]]

of the merchandise, its shipment on an unsolicited basis, or its status 
as a sample, reasonably indicate that the shipper's primary purpose is 
the conveyance of the advertisement itself and that the merchandise is 
merely an adjunct to the advertisement.
    (b) An item is an advertisement if its primary purpose is to cause 
or induce the purchase of goods or services from the shipper or others.

Sec. 320.8  Suspension for international remailing.

    (a) The operation of 39 U.S.C. 601(a)(1) through (6) and Sec. 
310.2(b)(1) through (6) of this chapter is suspended on all post routes 
to permit the uninterrupted carriage of letters from a point within the 
United States to a foreign country for deposit in its domestic or 
international mails for delivery to an ultimate destination outside the 
United States.

    Example (1). The letters to overseas customers of commercial firm A 
in Chicago are carried by Carrier B to New York where they are delivered 
to Carrier C for carriage to Europe. Carrier C holds the letters in its 
distribution center overnight, then sorts them by country of destination 
and merges them with letters of other firms to those countries before 
starting the carriage to Europe in the morning. The carriage of firm A's 
letters is not interrupted. The suspension for international remailing 
applies to the carriage by Carrier B and by Carrier C.
    Example (2). The bills addressed to foreign customers of the Chicago 
branch office of commercial firm D are carried by Carrier E to New York 
where they are delivered to the accounting department of firm D's home 
office. The accounting department uses the information in the bills to 
prepare its reports of accounts receivable. The bills are then returned 
to Carrier E which carries them directly to Europe where they are 
entered into the mails of a foreign country. The carriage of the bills 
from Chicago to Europe is interrupted in New York by the delivery to 
firm D's home office. The suspension for international remailing does 
not apply to the carriage from Chicago to New York. It does apply to the 
subsequent carriage from New York to Europe.

    (b) This suspension shall not permit the shipment or carriage of a 
letter or letters out of the mails to any foreign country for subsequent 
delivery to an address within the United States.

    Example (1). A number of promotional letters originated by firm F in 
Los Angeles are carried by Carrier G to Europe for deposit in the mails 
of a foreign country. Some of the letters are addressed to persons in 
Europe, some to persons in the United States. The suspension for 
international remailing does not apply to the letters addressed to 
persons in the United States.

    (c) Violation by a shipper or carrier of the terms of this 
suspension is grounds for administrative revocation of the suspension as 
to such shipper or carrier for a period of one year in a proceeding 
instituted by the General Counsel in accordance with part 959 of this 
chapter. The failure of a shipper or carrier to cooperate with an 
inspection or audit authorized and conducted by the Postal Inspection 
Service for the purpose of determining compliance with the terms of this 
suspension shall be deemed to create a presumption of a violation for 
the purpose of this paragraph (c) and shall shift to the shipper or 
carrier the burden of establishing the fact of compliance. Revocation of 
this suspension as to a shipper or carrier shall in no way limit other 
actions as to such shipper or carrier to enforce the Private Express 
Statutes by administrative proceedings for collection of postage (see 
Sec. 310.5) or by civil or criminal proceedings.

Sec. 320.9  Revocation or amendment of suspensions.

    These suspensions may be revoked or amended in accordance with Sec. 
310.7. No revocation of the suspension provided in Sec. 320.2 will 
curtail operations of particular carriers existing at the time of the 
revocation to a level of operations (in dollar or volume terms, 
whichever is larger) lower than that antedating the revocation in a 
particular market served prior to the revocation. Should the suspension 
referred to in Sec. 320.2 be revoked, carriers, as a condition to 
continuing operations under this section, will be required to provide 
reasonably complete and accurate data to support estimates of past 
operating levels in particular markets.

<R05>
Sec. 447.21  Prohibited conduct.

    (a) An employee must not engage, either on a paid or unpaid basis, 
in teaching, lecturing, or writing for the purpose of the special 
preparation of a person or class of persons for an examination of the 
Office of Personnel Management or Board of Examiners for the Foreign 
Service, or for appointment in the U.S. Postal Service, when these 
activities are dependent on information obtained as a result of his or 
her employment with the Postal Service, except when that information has 
been made available to the general public, or will be made available on 
request, or when the Postmaster General gives written authorization that 
the use of nonpublic information is in the public interest.
    (b) No employee shall take sick leave to enable himself to engage in 
outside work.
    (c) No employee while acting in his official capacity shall directly 
or indirectly authorize, permit, or participate in any action, event or 
course of conduct which subjects any person to discrimination, or 
results in any person being discriminated against, on the

[[Page 160]]

basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age.
    (d) No employee shall engage in criminal, dishonest, notoriously 
disgraceful or immoral conduct, or other conduct prejudicial to the 
Postal Service. Conviction of a violation of any criminal statute may be 
grounds for disciplinary action by the Postal Service in addition to any 
other penalty imposed by or pursuant to statute.
    (e) No employee shall habitually use intoxicating beverages to 
excess. No employee shall drink beer, wine, or other intoxicating 
beverages while on duty. No employee shall begin work or return to duty 
while intoxicated. No employee shall drink intoxicating beverages in a 
public place while in uniform. Unless the Postmaster General 
specifically authorizes an exception (as in the case, for example, of an 
official reception) no employee shall have or bring any container of 
beer, wine, or other intoxicating beverage on premises occupied by a 
postal facility, whether or not the container has been opened.
    (f) Illegal use of drugs may be grounds for removal from the Postal 
Service.
    (g) No employee while on property owned or leased by the Postal 
Service or the United States or while on duty, shall participate in any 
gambling activity, including the operation of a gambling device, in 
conducting or acting as an agent for a lottery or pool, in conducting a 
game for money or property, or in selling or purchasing a numbers slip 
or ticket.
    Note: Paragraph (g) of this section does not prohibit participation 
in activities specified herein if participation is necessitated by an 
employee's law enforcement duties, or if participation is in accordance 
with section 7 of Executive Order No. 12353, of March 23, 1982, relating 
to agency-approved solicitations.

                               Activities


<R05>
Sec. 447.31  Advisory service.

    (a) The Ethical Conduct Officer is responsible for the 
administration of the ethics program of the Postal Service. In the 
exercise of that responsibility, the Ethical Conduct Officer shall 
coordinate the advisory service provided by this section, assure that 
authoritative interpretations of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for 
Employees of the Executive Branch (Standards) and Supplemental Postal 
Service Regulations (Supplemental Regulations) are available to the 
Associate Ethical Conduct Officers, and render final rulings on behalf 
of the Postal Service in appeals by employees from rulings under the 
Standards and Supplemental Regulations made by an agency designee. The 
Ethical Conduct Officer shall provide advice and guidance for the 
Postmaster General and all Associate Ethical Conduct Officers concerning 
questions arising under the Standards and Supplemental Regulations. The 
Ethical Conduct Officer may delegate to an Assistant Ethical Conduct 
Officer authority to perform any duty or function vested in him or her 
by this Section. The General Counsel is the Ethical Conduct Officer of 
the Postal Service and the Designated Agency Ethics Official for 
purposes of the Ethics in Government Act, as amended, and implementing 
regulations of the Office of Government Ethics, including 5 CFR part 
2638.
    (b) The Deputy Postmaster General is the Associate Ethical Conduct 
Officer for the Office of the Postmaster General and the Office of the 
Deputy Postmaster General. The Chief Operating Officer, Senior Vice 
Presidents, Vice Presidents, and such other persons as the Ethical 
Conduct Officer may designate are Associate Ethical Conduct Officers for 
their respective organizational elements. Each Associate Ethical Conduct 
Officer shall designate a suitable employee to coordinate the ethics 
program within his or her organization and to act as liaison with the 
Ethical Conduct Officer. Each Associate may designate other suitable 
employees to assist or act for him or

[[Page 161]]

her and shall ensure that there is an adequate number of Qualified 
Ethics Trainers to comply with the requirements of the annual ethics 
training program.
    (c) The Ethical Conduct Officer and, with his or her approval, 
Associate Ethical Conduct Officers, may delegate to additional persons 
or classes of persons the authority to make determinations, to give 
approval, or to take other action in accordance with the Standards of 
Ethical Conduct, as is contemplated by 5 CFR 2635.102(b), defining 
``agency designee.''
    (d) An employee may obtain advice and guidance on questions of 
conflicts of interest from the Ethical Conduct Officer or the Associate 
Ethical Conduct Officer having appropriate jurisdiction. In order to 
avoid undue interference with established grievance and disciplinary 
procedures, advisory service under this subpart will not normally be 
available in an instance in which a grievance is pending or disciplinary 
action has been initiated.
    (e) An employee may request any ruling provided for by the Standards 
and Supplemental Regulations by submitting a request in writing to the 
Senior Counsel, Ethics, or, in the field, to the Chief Field Counsel or 
Deputy Chief Field Counsel, General Law.
    (f) An employee may appeal to the Ethical Conduct Officer from a 
ruling made by an agency designee concerning matters covered by the 
Standards and Supplemental Regulations within 30 days from the date of 
the ruling. The appeal must be in writing and must contain a full 
statement of the relevant facts. It should be addressed to the Ethical 
Conduct Officer, U.S. Postal Service, Washington, DC 20260, and a copy 
thereof should be sent to the official whose ruling is being appealed.

however, from displaying a picture, including a personally autographed 
picture of a political figure in his office or place of work if it has 
no language in the nature of political campaigning;
    (2) Wear a political badge or button while in uniform or while on 
duty when that duty requires him to deal with the public or be in the 
view of the public;
    (3) Display a political picture or sticker on his private vehicle 
while that vehicle is being used for official postal purposes.

              Subpart E_Participation in Community Affairs


<R05>
Sec. 447.51  General.

    An employee is permitted to participate in community affairs to the 
extent consistent with the proper performance of his postal duties and

fraternal organization or of a civil nonpolitical organization which is 
supported by dues or contributions from its own members.

<R05>
Sec. 447.52  Holding of State or local office by Postal Service employees.

    (a) An employee may seek, accept, or hold a nonpartisan State or 
local office subject to the provisions of this Code and in particular 
this section. A ``nonpartisan'' office is one filled by a ``nonpartisan 
election'', which is an election at which none of the candidates are to 
be nominated or elected as representing a political party any of whose 
candidates for presidential elector received votes in the last preceding 
election at which presidential electors were selected.
    (b) An employee who wishes to seek, accept, or hold a nonpartisan 
State or local office is responsible for ascertaining:
    (1) Whether the office is ``nonpartisan'' within the definition in 
Sec. 447.62(a).
    (2) Whether State or local law permits a Postal Service employee to 
seek, accept, or hold the particular office.
    (3) Whether the duties of the office would result in a conflict with 
his Postal Service employment.
    (4) Whether the discharge of the duties of the office would 
interfere with the performance by the particular employee of his Postal 
Service duties in an acceptable manner or would interfere with the 
performance by other Postal Service employees of their respective duties 
in an acceptable manner.
    (c) An employee is encouraged to seek advice from his Associate 
Ethical Conduct Counselor prior to taking any action to seek, accept, or 
hold a State or local office. If, after the employee has entered upon 
the discharge of the duties of this non-postal office, his non-postal 
duties interfere with the proper discharge of postal duties, either by 
him or by other postal employees, the employee holding the non-postal 
office shall be advised by his superior to eliminate the interference, 
either by resignation from the non-postal office, or in such other 
manner as is appropriate under the circumstances. If the employee fails, 
refuses, or neglects to comply with the foregoing advice and the 
interference continues, he will be subject to disciplinary proceedings.

[[Page 163]]

    (d) Employees, other than postmasters or acting postmasters in a 
salary level of EAS-25 or higher, may be granted permission to campaign 
for a full-time State or local nonpartisan office while on annual leave 
or on authorized leave without pay during the campaign when:
    (1) The criteria in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section are 
met, and
    (2) The Vice President, Area Operations, determines that the 
employee's postal responsibilities are being conducted in a satisfactory 
manner and that the absence of the employee during the campaign period 
will not disrupt the operation of the facility where he or she is 
employed.

    Note: Requests shall be submitted through the postmaster or other 
installation head to the Vice President, Area Operations. If the 
employee is elected to and takes such a full-time office, he or she may 
either be separated from the Postal Service or granted leave without 
pay.

    (e) A postmaster or acting postmaster in salary level EAS-25 or 
higher shall not be authorized to take annual leave or leave without pay 
for the purpose of campaigning for a full-time State or local 
nonpartisan office.

<R05>
Sec. 447.61  General.

    (a) An employee shall report immediately to the General Counsel, 
U.S. Postal Service, Washington, DC 20260:
    (1) Any instance in which a person either within or outside the 
Postal Service uses or attempts to use a bribe, undue influence, or 
coercion to induce or attempt to induce the employee to act or neglect 
to act in regard to his official responsibilities; and
    (2) Any information that causes him to believe that there has been a 
violation of a Federal criminal statute or any law or regulation 
directly or indirectly related to the responsibilities of the Postal 
Service. A copy of a report made under this paragraph shall also be sent 
by the employee to the Chief Postal Inspector, Washington, DC 20260. The 
report shall be sent in a sealed envelope clearly marked ``Limited 
Official Use--To Be Opened by Addressee Only''.

    Source: 63 FR 67403, Dec. 7, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 491.1  Authorized Agent to receive service.

    Notwithstanding the designation, in Sec. 2.2 of this chapter, of 
the General Counsel as agent for the receipt of legal process against 
the Postal Service, the sole agent for service of garnishment process 
directed to the pay of Postal Service employees and employees of the 
Postal Rate Commission (``employees'') is the Manager, Payroll 
Processing Branch, 2825 Lone Oak Parkway, Eagan, MN 55121-9650 
(``Authorized Agent''). The Authorized Agent shall have sole authority 
to receive service of legal process in the nature of garnishment 
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``process'') arising under the law 
of any state, territory, or possession, or the order of a court of 
competent jurisdiction of any state, territory, or possession (including 
any order for child support and alimony or bankruptcy). The Authorized 
Agent may not receive or transmit service of process in a private legal 
matter on behalf of an employee. No process shall be effectively served 
until it is received by the Authorized Agent or his designee. No other 
employee shall have the authority to accept service of such

[[Page 164]]

process. Service of process in conformity with Rule 4(i) of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. Appendix) is not waived for any suit 
or action wherein the Postal Service, its officers, or employees are 
parties. Any Order, issued in bankruptcy, for the withholding of sums 
from pay due an employee and which is directed to the Postal Service for 
handling outside the voluntary allotment procedure, is legal process 
subject to the provisions of these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 491.2  Manner of service.

    Service of process on the Authorized Agent or his designee may be 
made in person or by certified or registered mail, with return receipt 
requested, at the address of the Authorized Agent. Service may also be 
made on the Authorized Agent by means of any private delivery service 
pursuant to its authority for the private carriage of letters under an 
exception to the Private Express Statutes, 39 U.S.C. 601-606, provided 
that the private delivery organization issues a receipt bearing the name 
and address of both the addressee and sender, as well as the date of 
delivery and the signature of the receiving agent. No garnishment is 
effectively served until it is received by the Authorized Agent or his 
designee regardless of the chosen mode of delivery. Process addressed 
to, delivered to, or in any manner given to any employee, other than the 
Authorized Agent or his designee, may, at the sole discretion of the 
employee, be returned to the issuing court marked ``Not Effectively 
Served.'' A copy of or reference to these regulations may be included. 
Employees are not authorized to redirect or forward garnishment process 
to the Authorized Agent. In the event that the address of the Authorized 
Agent is changed, mail may be forwarded from his last published address 
to his new official address until such time as these regulations are 
amended to reflect the new address.


<R05>
Sec. 491.3  Sufficient legal form.

    No document purporting to garnish employee wages shall be deemed 
sufficient unless it can be determined from the face of the document 
that it is legal process in the nature of garnishment; that it is issued 
by a court of competent jurisdiction or an authorized official pursuant 
to an order of such a court or pursuant to federal, state or local law, 
evidenced by a signature of the issuing person; and that it contains the 
name of the garnished party, with his or her social security number, 
orders the employing agency to withhold from pay a specific amount of 
money, specifically describes the judgment of debt or administrative 
action complete with statutory citation and contains specific advice as 
to where to send the funds as they are periodically withheld including 
the complete Zip Code (Zip + 4). When there is a suggestion that the 
employee is under the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy proceeding, the 
creditor must provide documentary evidence to prove that his legal 
process is not in violation of the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction 
before the creditor's garnishment may be processed. Documents deficient 
in any of these respects may be returned to the issuing court or 
authorized official inscribed ``Insufficient as to legal form.''


<R05>
Sec. 491.4  Identification of employees.

    Garnishments must be accompanied by sufficient information to permit 
prompt identification of the employee and the payments involved. 
Garnishment of an employee whose name and social security number is 
similar to but not identical with the name and social security number on 
the garnishment will not be processed. An exact match of both name and 
social security number is required in order to permit processing; 
otherwise, the garnishment will be returned marked ``Insufficient 
identifying information.'' Garnishments which are insufficient in regard 
to identifying information will not be held pending receipt of further 
information and must be served again when the proper information is 
obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 491.5  Costs.

    The Postal Service's administrative costs in executing the 
garnishment action shall be added to each garnishment and the costs 
recovered shall be retained as offsetting collections. The Postal 
Service reserves the right to redetermine the administrative cost of

[[Page 165]]

any garnishment if, in administering any garnishment, extra costs beyond 
those normally encountered are incurred, and add the extra cost to each 
garnishment. The extra costs recovered shall be retained as offsetting 
collections.


<R05>
Sec. 491.6  Response to process.

    (a) Within fifteen days after receipt of process that is sufficient 
for legal form and contains sufficient information to identify the 
employee, the Authorized Agent shall send written notice that 
garnishment process has been served, together with a copy thereof, to 
the affected employee at his or her duty station or last known address. 
The Authorized Agent shall respond, in writing, to the garnishment or 
interrogatories within thirty days of receipt of process. The Authorized 
Agent may respond within a longer period of time as may be prescribed by 
applicable state Law. Neither the Authorized Agent nor any employee 
shall be required to respond in person to any garnishment served 
according to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5520a and the regulations in 
this section. A sufficient response to legal process shall consist of 
any action of the Postal Service consistent with these regulations. The 
action shall be considered to be given under penalty of perjury and 
shall constitute a legally sufficient answer to any garnishment. The 
Postal Service may, in its sole discretion, answer or otherwise respond 
to documents purporting to be legal process which are insufficient as to 
the manner of service, insufficient as to the identification of the 
employee, insufficient as to legal form or insufficient for any other 
reason.
    (b) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example: Each periodic check with the accompanying Financial 
Institution Statement shall be considered to be a legally sufficient 
answer. Where legal process has been processed but no money was 
deducted, (for the reason of insufficient pay, prior garnishment in 
force, etc.) the mailing label or other written response shall be a 
sufficient answer. Where the Postal Service sends a check or mailing 
label, no further action will be required (such as a cumulative report 
or notarized statement.) Documents which are defective with respect to 
service, lack of legal sufficiency, failure to properly identify the 
employee, or other reason, do not require a response or an answer but if 
the Postal Service chooses to act in any way, such as to return the 
document, that act shall be a sufficient answer.


<R05>
Sec. 491.7  Release of information.

    (a) No employee whose duties include responding to interrogatories 
to garnishments shall release information in response to a garnishment 
until it is determined that sufficient information, as required in Sec. 
491.4, has been received in writing as part of the garnishment legal 
process. The Authorized Agent may, at his or her sole discretion, accept 
or initiate telephone or telefax inquiries concerning garnishments. No 
other employee may release any information about employees except in 
conformity with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the 
regulations in 39 CFR Part 266, ``Privacy of Information.''
    (b) The Authorized Agent's response to legal process is sufficient 
if it contains only that information not otherwise protected from 
release by any federal statute including the Privacy Act. Neither the 
Postal Service nor the Postal Rate Commission shall be required to 
provide formal answers to interrogatories received prior to the receipt 
of legal process. Employment verification may be obtained by accessing 
the Postal Service's employment verification system by dialing 1-(800) 
276-9850.


<R05>
Sec. 491.8  Execution of process.

    (a) All legal process in the nature of garnishment shall be date and 
time stamped by the Authorized Agent when received for the purpose of 
determining the order of receipt of process which is sufficient as to 
legal form and contains sufficient information for identification of the 
employee, the Authorized Agent's date and time stamp shall be conclusive 
evidence. Child support and alimony garnishments will be accorded 
priority over commercial garnishments under 5 U.S.C. 5520a as provided 
in 5 U.S.C. 5520a(h)(2). Garnishments shall be executed provided that 
the pay cycle is open for input or, if closed, will be held until the 
next cycle. In no event shall the Postal Service be required to

[[Page 166]]

vary its normal pay or disbursement cycles in order to comply with legal 
process of any kind. Garnishments shall be recalculated, if required, to 
fit within the normal postal pay cycles. The Postal Service shall not be 
required to withhold pay and hold the funds in escrow. The Postal 
Service, in its sole discretion, may process more than one garnishment 
at a time within the restrictions on garnishments in Section 491.9 of 
these regulations. The Postal Service may, in its sole discretion, 
accept and hold for processing garnishments received after the 
garnishment currently in force.
    (b) The Postal Service will only accept and effectuate legal process 
for a person who is currently employed. Upon cessation of employment, 
process relating to that individual will be terminated and not retained. 
The Postal Service shall not be required to establish an escrow account 
to comply with legal process even if the applicable law of the 
jurisdiction requires private employers to do so. Legal process must 
state on its face that the Postal Service withhold up to a specific 
total amount of money, the Postal Service will not calculate interest, 
charges, or any variable in processing a garnishment. The Postal Service 
may continue processing a garnishment if the garnishing attorney 
provides the adjusted total including the additional money owed, as 
determined from his calculation of the variable amounts. The attorney is 
deemed to certify on his professional responsibility that the 
calculations are correct and will indemnify the employee directly for 
any errors. All garnishments of periodic pay may be effectuated in 
accordance with the bi-weekly pay schedule. The Postal Service need not 
vary its pay and disbursement cycles to accommodate withholding on any 
other cycle.
    (c) Neither the Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission nor any 
disbursing officer shall be liable for any payment made from moneys due 
from, or payable by the Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission to 
any individual pursuant to legal process regular on its face.
    (d) The Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, any disbursing 
officer or any other employee shall not be liable to pay money damages 
for failure to comply with legal process.


<R05>
Sec. 491.9  Restrictions on garnishment.

    Garnishments under this section shall be subject to the restrictions 
in 15 U.S.C. 1671-1677, including limits on the amounts which can be 
withheld from an employee's pay and the priority of garnishments.

Sec. 501.1  Definitions.

    (a) Postage Evidencing Systems regulated by part 501 produce 
evidence of prepayment of postage by any method other than postage 
stamps and permit imprints. A Postage Evidencing System is a device or 
system of components that a customer uses to generate and print evidence 
that postage required for mailing has been paid. Postage Evidencing 
Systems print indicia, such as meter imprints or information-based 
indicia to indicate postage payment. They include but are not limited to 
postage meters and PC Postage systems.
    (b) A postage meter is a Postal Service-approved Postage Evidencing 
System that uses a device to account for postage purchased and printed. 
The term meter as used in this part refers to a postage meter.
    (c) PC Postage products are Postal Service-approved Postage 
Evidencing Systems that use a personal computer as an integral part of 
the system. PC Postage products may use the Internet to download postage 
to a mailer's computer from which the postage indicia may then be 
printed.
    (d) A provider is a person or entity authorized under this section 
to manufacture and/or distribute Postage Evidencing Systems to 
customers.
    (e) A manufacturer of postage meters produces postage meters.
    (f) A distributor of postage meters may be a manufacturer who leases 
postage meters directly to end-user customers or may be an independent 
entity who leases postage meters to end-user customers on behalf of the 
manufacturer.
    (g) A customer is a person or entity authorized by the Postal 
Service to use a Postage Evidencing System in accordance with Mailing 
Standards of the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual 
(DMM) 604 Postage Payment Methods, 4.0 Postage Meters and PC Postage 
Products (Postage Evidencing Systems).


<R05>
Sec. 501.2  Postage Evidencing System provider authorization.

    (a) The Postal Service considers Postage Evidencing Systems and 
their respective infrastructure to be essential to the exercise of its 
specific powers to prescribe postage and provide evidence of payment of 
postage under 39 U.S.C. 404(a)(2) and (4).
    (b) Due to the potential for adverse impact upon Postal Service 
revenue, the following activities may not be engaged in by any person or 
entity without prior, written approval of the Postal Service:

[[Page 168]]

    (1) Producing or distributing any Postage Evidencing System that 
generates U.S. postage.
    (2) Repairing, distributing, refurbishing, remanufacturing, 
modifying, or destroying any component of a Postage Evidencing System 
that accounts for or authorizes the printing of U.S. postage.

data for the production of U.S. postage, or accounts for U.S. postage 
purchased for distribution through a Postage Evidencing System.
    (4) Owning or operating an infrastructure that maintains operating 
data that is used to facilitate registration with the Postal Service of 
customers of a Postage Evidencing System.
    (c) Any person or entity seeking authorization to perform any 
activity described in paragraph (b) of this section, or to materially 
modify any activity previously approved by the Postal Service, must 
submit a request to the Postal Service in person or in writing. 
Decisions of the Postal Service upon such requests are effective only if 
in writing (including electronic mail).
    (d) Approval shall be based upon satisfactory evidence of the 
applicant's integrity and financial responsibility, commitment to the 
security of the Postage Evidencing System, and a determination that 
disclosure to the applicant of Postal Service customer, financial, or 
other data of a commercial nature necessary to perform the function for 
which approval is sought would be appropriate and consistent with good 
business practices within the meaning of 39 U.S.C. 410(c)(2). The Postal 
Service may condition its approval upon the applicant's agreement to 
undertakings that would give the Postal Service appropriate assurance of 
the applicant's ability to meet its obligations under this section, 
including but not limited to the method and manner of performing certain 
financial, security, and servicing functions and the need to maintain 
sufficient financial reserves to guarantee uninterrupted performance of 
not less than 3 months of operation.
    (e) Qualification and approval may be based upon additional 
conditions agreed to by the Postal Service and the applicant. The 
applicant is approved in writing to engage in the function(s) for which 
authorization was sought and approved.
    (f) To the extent that any provider manufactures and/or distributes 
any PC Postage product through any authorized Postage Evidencing System, 
such provider must adhere to the requirements of these regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 501.3  Postage Evidencing System provider qualification.

    Any person or entity seeking authorization to manufacture and/or 
distribute Postage Evidencing Systems must:
    (a) Satisfy the Postal Service of its integrity and financial 
responsibility.
    (b) Obtain Postal Service approval under this part of at least one 
Postage Evidencing System satisfying the requirements of Postal Service 
regulations.
    (c) As a condition of obtaining authorization under this section, 
the Postage Evidencing System provider's facilities used for the 
manufacture, distribution, storage, resetting, or destruction of postage 
meters and all facilities housing infrastructure supporting Postage 
Evidencing Systems will be subject to unannounced inspection by 
representatives of the Postal Service. If such facilities are outside 
the continental United States, the provider will be responsible for all 
reasonable and necessary travel-related costs incurred by the Postal 
Service to conduct the inspections. Travel-related costs are determined 
in accordance with Postal Service Handbook F-15, Travel and Relocation. 
At its discretion, the Postal Service may continue to fund routine 
inspections outside the

[[Page 169]]

continental United States as it has in the past, provided the costs are 
not associated with particular security issues related to a provider's 
Postage Evidencing System or supporting infrastructure, or with the 
start-up or implementation of a new plant or of a new or substantially 
changed manufacturing process.
    (1) When conducting an inspection outside the continental United 
States, the Postal Service will make every effort to combine the 
inspection with other inspections in the same general geographic area in 
order to enable affected providers to share the costs. The Postal 
Service team conducting such inspections will be limited to the minimum 
number necessary to conduct the inspection. All air travel will be 
contracted for at the rates for official government business, when 
available, under such rules respecting class of travel as apply to those 
Postal Service representatives inspecting the facility at the time the 
travel occurs.
    (2) If political or other impediments prevent the Postal Service 
from conducting security evaluations of Postage Evidencing System 
facilities in foreign countries, Postal Service approval of the 
activities conducted in such facilities may be suspended until such time 
as satisfactory inspections may be conducted.
    (d) Have, or establish, and keep under its active supervision and 
control adequate facilities for the control, distribution, and 
maintenance of Postage Evidencing Systems and their replacement or 
secure disposal or destruction when necessary and appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 501.4  Changes in ownership or control, bankruptcy, or insolvency.

    (a) Any person or entity authorized under Sec. 501.2 must promptly 
notify the Postal Service when it has a reasonable expectation that 
there may be a change in its ownership or control including changes in 
the ownership of an affiliate which exercises control over its Postage 
Evidencing System operations in the United States. A change of ownership 
or control within the meaning of this section includes entry into a 
strategic alliance or other agreement whereby a third party either has 
access to data related to the security of the system or is a competitor 
to the Postal Service. Any person or entity seeking to acquire ownership 
or control of a person or entity authorized under Sec. 501.2 must 
provide the Postal Service satisfactory evidence that upon completion of 
the contemplated transaction, it will satisfy the conditions for 
approval stated in Sec. 501.2. Early notification of a proposed change 
in ownership or control will facilitate expeditious review of an 
application to acquire ownership or control under this section.
    (b) Any person or entity authorized under Sec. 501.2 must promptly 
notify the Postal Service when it has a reasonable expectation that 
there may be a change in the status of its financial condition either 
through bankruptcy, insolvency, assignment for the benefit of creditors, 
or other similar financial action. Any person or entity authorized under 
Sec. 501.2 who experiences a change in the status of its financial 
condition may, at the discretion of the Postal Service, have its 
authorization under Sec. 501.2 modified or terminated.


<R05>
Sec. 501.5  Burden of proof standard.

    The burden of proof is on the Postal Service in administrative 
determinations of suspension and revocation under Sec. 501.6 and 
administrative sanctions under Sec. 501.12. Except as otherwise 
indicated in those sections, the standard of proof shall be the 
preponderance-of-evidence standard.


<R05>
Sec. 501.6  Suspension and revocation of authorization.

    (a) The Postal Service may suspend and/or revoke authorization to 
manufacture and/or distribute any or all of a provider's approved 
Postage Evidencing System(s) if the provider engages in any unlawful 
scheme or enterprise, fails to comply with any provision in this Part 
501, fails to implement instructions issued in accordance with any final 
decision issued by the Postal Service within its authority over Postage 
Evidencing Systems or if the Postage Evidencing System or infrastructure 
of the provider is determined to constitute an unacceptable risk to 
Postal Service revenues.

[[Page 170]]

    (b) The decision to suspend or revoke pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be based upon the nature and circumstances of the 
violation (e.g. whether the violation was willful, whether the provider 
voluntarily admitted to the violation, or cooperated with the Postal 
Service, whether the provider implemented successful remedial measures) 
and on the provider's performance history. Before determining that a 
provider's authorization to manufacture and/or distribute Postage 
Evidencing Systems should be suspended or revoked, the procedures in 
paragraph (c) of this section shall be followed.
    (c) Suspension or revocation procedures:
    (1) Upon determination by the Postal Service that a provider is in 
violation of provisions of this Part 501, or that its Postal Evidencing 
System poses an unreasonable risk to postal revenue, PTM, acting on 
behalf of the Postal Service shall issue a written notice of proposed 
suspension citing the specific conditions or deficiencies for which 
suspension of authorization to manufacture and/or distribute a specific 
Postage Evidencing System or class of Postage Evidencing Systems may be 
imposed. Except in cases of willful violation, the provider shall be 
given an opportunity to correct deficiencies and achieve compliance with 
all requirements within a time limit corresponding to the potential 
revenue risk to postal revenue.
    (2) In cases of willful violation, or if the Postal Service 
determines that the provider has failed to correct cited deficiencies 
within the specified time limit, PTM shall issue a written notice of 
suspension setting forth the facts and reasons for the decision to 
suspend and the effective date if a written defense is not presented as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) The notice shall also advise the provider of its right to file a 
response under paragraph (d) of this section. If a written response is 
not presented in a timely manner the suspension may go into effect. The 
suspension shall remain in effect for ninety (90) calendar days unless 
revoked or modified by PTM.
    (4) If, upon consideration of the defense as provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section, the Postal Service deems that the suspension is 
warranted, the suspension shall remain in effect for up to 90 days 
unless withdrawn by the Postal Service, as provided in paragraph 
(c)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (5) At the end of the ninety (90) day suspension, the Postal Service 
may:
    (i) Extend the suspension in order to allow more time for 
investigation or to allow the provider time to correct the problem.
    (ii) Make a determination to revoke authorization to manufacture 
and/or distribute a Postage Evidencing System in part or in whole.
    (iii) Withdraw the suspension based on identification and 
implementation of a satisfactory solution to the problem.
    (d) The provider may present the Postal Service with a written 
defense to any suspension or revocation determination within thirty (30) 
calendar days of receiving the written notice (unless a shorter period 
is deemed necessary). The defense must include all supporting evidence 
and state with specificity the reasons why the order should not be 
imposed.
    (e) After receipt and consideration of the defense, PTM shall advise 
the provider of its decision and the facts and reasons for it. The 
decision shall be effective on receipt unless provided otherwise. The 
decision shall also advise the provider that it may be appealed within 
thirty (30) calendar days of receipt (unless a shorter time frame is 
deemed necessary). If an appeal is not filed in a timely manner, the 
decision of PTM shall become a final decision of the Postal Service. The 
appeal may be filed with the Chief Marketing Officer of the Postal 
Service and must include all supporting evidence and state with 
specificity the reasons the provider believes that the decision is 
erroneous. The decision of the Chief Marketing Officer shall constitute 
a final decision of the Postal Service.
    (f) An order or final decision under this section does not preclude 
any other criminal or civil statutory, common law, or administrative 
remedy that is available by law to the Postal

[[Page 171]]

Service, the United States, or any other person or entity.

a potential security weakness, including, but not limited to, 
administrative and investigative costs and documented revenue losses 
that result from any Postage Evidencing System for which the provider 
failed to comply with any provision in Sec. 501.11. The Postal Service 
issues a written demand for reimbursement of any and all such costs and 
losses (net of any amount collected by the Postal Service from the 
customers) with interest. The demand shall set forth the facts and 
reasons on which it is based.
    (c) The provider may present the Postal Service with a written 
defense to the proposed action within thirty (30) calendar days of 
receipt. The defense must include all supporting evidence and state with 
specificity the reasons for which the sanction should not be imposed.

<R05>
Sec. 501.13  False representations of Postal Service actions.

    Providers, their agents, and employees must not intentionally 
misrepresent to customers of the Postal Service decisions, actions, or 
proposed actions of the Postal Service respecting its regulation of 
Postage Evidencing Systems. The Postal Service reserves the right to 
suspend and/or revoke the authorization to manufacture or distribute 
Postage Evidencing Systems throughout the United States or any part 
thereof pursuant to Sec. 501.6 when it determines that the provider, 
its agents, or employees failed to comply with this section.


<R05>
Sec. 501.14  Postage Evidencing System inventory control processes.

    (a) Each authorized provider of Postage Evidencing Systems must 
permanently hold title to all Postage Evidencing Systems which it 
manufactures or distributes except those purchased by the Postal Service 
or distributed outside the United States.
    (b) An authorized provider must maintain sufficient facilities for 
and records of the distribution, control, storage, maintenance, repair, 
replacement, and destruction or disposal of all Postage Evidencing 
Systems and their components to enable accurate accounting and location 
thereof throughout the entire life cycle of each Postage Evidencing 
System. A complete record shall entail a list by serial number of all 
Postage Evidencing Systems manufactured or distributed showing all 
movements of each system from the time that it is produced until it is 
scrapped, and the reading of the ascending register each time the system 
is checked into or out of service. These records must be available for 
inspection by Postal Service officials at any time during business 
hours.
    (c) To ensure adequate control over Postage Evidencing Systems, 
plans for the following processes must be submitted for prior approval, 
in writing, to PTM:
    (1) Check in to service procedures for all Postage Evidencing 
Systems--the procedures are to address the process to be used for new 
Postage Evidencing Systems as well as those previously leased to another 
customer.
    (2) Transportation and storage of meters--procedures that provide 
reasonable precautions to prevent use by unauthorized individuals. 
Providers must ship all meters by Postal Service Registered Mail unless 
given written permission by the Postal Service to use another carrier. 
The provider must demonstrate that the alternative delivery carrier 
employs security procedures equivalent to those for Registered Mail.
    (3) Postage meter examination/inspection procedures and schedule--
The provider is required to perform postage meter examinations or 
inspections based on an approved schedule. Failure to complete the meter 
examination or inspections by the due date may result in the Postal 
Service requiring the provider to disable the meter's resetting 
capability. If necessary, the Postal Service shall notify the customer 
that the meter is to be removed from service and the authorization to 
use a meter revoked, following the procedures for revocation specified 
by regulation. The Postal Service shall notify the provider to remove 
the meter from the customer's location.
    (4) Check out of service procedures for a non-faulty Postage 
Evidencing System when the system is to be removed from service for any 
reason.
    (5) Postage meter repair process--any physical or electronic access 
to the internal components of a postage meter, as well as any access to 
software or security parameters, must be conducted within an approved 
facility under the provider's direct control and active supervision. To 
prevent unauthorized use, the provider or any third party acting on its 
behalf must keep secure any equipment or other component that can be 
used to open or access the internal, electronic, or secure components of 
a meter.
    (6) Faulty meter handling procedures, including those that are 
inoperable, mis-registering, have unreadable registers, inaccurately 
reflect their current status, show any evidence of possible tampering or 
abuse, and those for which there is any indication that the meter has 
some mechanical or electrical malfunction of any critical security 
component, such as any component the improper operation of which

[[Page 175]]

could adversely affect Postal Service revenues, or of any memory 
component, or that affects the accuracy of the registers or the accuracy 
of the value printed.
    (7) Lost or stolen meter procedures--the provider must promptly 
report to the Postal Service the loss or theft of any meter or the 
recovery of any lost or stolen meter. Such notification to the Postal 
Service will be made by completing and filing a standardized lost and 
stolen meter incident report within ten (10) calendar days of the 
provider's determination of a meter loss, theft, or recovery.
    (8) Postage meter destruction, when required-the postage meter must 
be rendered completely inoperable by the destruction process and 
associated postage--printing dies and components must be destroyed. 
Manufacturers/distributors of meters must submit the proposed 
destruction method; a schedule listing the postage meters to be 
destroyed, by serial number and model; and the proposed time and place 
of destruction to PTM for approval prior to any meter destruction. 
Providers must record and retain the serial numbers of the meters to be 
destroyed and provide a list of such serial numbers in electronic form 
in accordance with Postal Service requirements for meter accounting and 
tracking systems. Providers must give sufficient advance notice of the 
destruction to allow PTM to schedule observation by its designated 
representative who shall verify that the destruction is performed in 
accordance with a Postal Service--approved method or process. To the 
extent that the Postal Service elects not to observe a particular 
destruction, the provider must submit a certification of destruction, 
including the serial number(s) to the Postal Service within five (5) 
calendar days of destruction. These requirements for meter destruction 
apply to all postage meters, Postage Evidencing Systems, and postal 
security devices included as a component of a Postage Evidencing System.
    (d) If the provider uses a third party to perform functions that may 
affect Postage Evidencing System security, including, but not limited to 
repair, maintenance, and disposal of Postage Evidencing Systems, PTM 
must be advised in advance of all aspects of the relationship, as they 
relate to the custody and control of Postage Evidencing Systems, and 
must specifically authorize in writing the proposed arrangement between 
the parties.
    (1) Postal Service authorization of a third party relationship to 
perform specific functions applies only to the functions stated in the 
written authorization but may be amended to embrace additional 
functions.
    (2) No third-party relationship shall compromise the security of the 
Postage Evidencing System, or its components, including, but not limited 
to, the hardware, software, communications, and security components, or 
of any security-related system with which it interfaces, including, but 
not limited to, the resetting system, reporting systems, and Postal 
Service support systems. The functions of the third party with respect 
to a Postage Evidencing System, its components, and the systems with 
which it interfaces are subject to the same scrutiny as the equivalent 
functions of the provider.
    (3) Any authorized third party must keep adequate facilities for and 
records of Postage Evidencing Systems and their components in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section. All such facilities and records are 
subject to inspection by Postal Service representatives, insofar as they 
are used to distribute, control, store, maintain, repair, replace, 
destroy, or dispose of Postage Evidencing Systems.
    (4) The provider must ensure that any party acting on its behalf in 
any of the functions described in paragraph (b) of this section 
maintains adequate facilities, records, and procedures for the security 
of the Postage Evidencing Systems. Deficiencies in the operations of a 
third party relating to the custody and control of Postage Evidencing 
Systems, unless corrected in a timely manner, can place at risk a 
provider's approval to manufacture and/or distribute Postage Evidencing 
Systems.
    (5) The Postal Service reserves the right to review all aspects of 
any third party relationship if it appears that the relationship poses a 
threat to Postage Evidencing System security and

[[Page 176]]

may require the provider to take appropriate corrective action.

Sec. 501.15  Computerized Meter Resetting System.

    (a) Description. The Computerized Meter Resetting System (CMRS) 
permits customers to reset their postage meters at their places of 
business. Authorized providers, who operate CMRS services, are known as 
resetting companies (RCs).
    (b) A customer is required to have funds available on deposit with 
the Postal Service before resetting a Postage Evidencing System or the 
provider may opt to provide a funds advance in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (c) If the RC chooses to offer advancement of funds to customers, 
the RC is required to maintain a deposit with the Postal Service equal 
to at least one (1) day's average funds advanced. The total amount of 
funds advanced to customers on any given day shall not exceed the amount 
the provider has on deposit with the Postal Service. The Postal Service 
shall not be liable for any payment made by the RC on behalf of a 
customer that is not reimbursed by the customer, since the RC is solely 
responsible for the collection of advances made by the RC.
    (d) The CMRS customer is permitted to make deposits in one of three 
ways: check, electronic funds transfer (or wire transfer), or automated 
clearinghouse (ACH) transfer. These deposits must be remitted to the 
Postal Service's designated bank account.
    (e) The RC must require each CMRS customer that requests a meter 
resetting to provide the meter serial number, the CMRS account number, 
and the meter's ascending and descending register readings. The RC must 
verify that there are sufficient funds in the customer's CMRS account to 
cover the postage setting requested before proceeding with the setting 
transaction (unless the RC opts to provide the customer a funds 
advance).
    (f) The Postal Service requires that the RC publicize to all CMRS 
customers the following payment options (listed in order of preference):
    (1) Automated clearinghouse (ACH) debits/credits.
    (2) Electronic funds transfers (wire transfers).
    (3) Checks.
    (g) Returned checks and ACH debits are the responsibility of the 
Postal Service. Upon notice from the Postal Service's designated bank, 
the provider will be required to immediately lock the customer account 
to prevent a meter reset until the Postal Service receives payment for 
the returned check or the provider is provided with valid ACH credit or 
wire information.
    (h) Refunds. The Postal Service will issue a refund in the amount 
remaining in a customer's Computerized Meter Resetting System account, 
after such time as the customer provides a written request to the 
provider, as long as the request meets the Postal Service approved 
minimum and time frame.
    (i) Security and Revenue Protection. To receive Postal Service 
approval to continue to operate systems in the CMRS environment, the RC 
must submit to a periodic examination of its CMRS system and any other 
applications and technology infrastructure that may have a material 
impact on Postal Service revenues, as determined by the Postal Service. 
The examination shall be performed by a qualified, independent audit 
firm and shall be conducted in accordance with the Statement on Auditing 
Standards (SAS) No. 70, Service Organizations, developed by the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), as amended or 
superseded. The examination shall include testing of the operating 
effectiveness of relevant RC internal controls (Type II SAS70 Report). 
If the service organization uses another service organization (sub-
service provider), Postal Service Management should consider the nature 
and materiality of the transactions processed by the sub-service 
organization and the contribution of the sub-service organization's 
processes and controls in the achievement of the Postal Service's 
information processing objectives. The Postal Service should have access 
to the sub-service organization's SAS 70 report. The control objectives 
to be covered by the SAS 70 report are subject to Postal Service review 
and approval and are to be provided to the

[[Page 177]]

Postal Service 30 days prior to the initiation of each examination 
period. As a result of the examination, the auditor shall provide the RC 
and the Postal Service with an opinion on the design and operating 
effectiveness of the RC's internal controls related to the CMRS system 
and any other applications and technology infrastructure considered 
material to the services provided to the Postal Service by the RC. Such 
examinations are to be conducted on no less than an annual basis, and 
are to be as of and for the twelve months ended June 30 of each year 
(except for the period ending June 30, 2010, for which the period of 
coverage will be no less than six months, and except for new contracts 
for which the examination period will be no less than the period from 
the contract date to the following June 30, unless otherwise agreed to 
by the Postal Service). The examination reports are to be provided to 
the Postal Service by August 15 of each year. To the extent that 
internal control weaknesses are identified in a Type II SAS 70 report, 
the Postal Service may require the remediation of such weaknesses and 
review working papers and engage in discussions about the work performed 
with the auditor. Postal Service requires that all remediation efforts 
(if applicable) are completed and reported by the RC prior to the Postal 
Service's fiscal year end (September 30). The RC will be responsible for 
all costs to conduct these examinations.
    (j) Inspection of records and facilities. The RC must make its 
facilities that handle the operation of the computerized resetting 
system and all records about the operation of the system available for 
inspection by representatives of the Postal Service at all reasonable 
times. At its discretion, the Postal Service may continue to fund 
inspections as it has in the past, provided the costs are not associated 
with a particular security issue related to the provider's CMRS or 
supporting infrastructure.
    (k) The RC is required to incorporate the following language into 
its meter rental agreements:

              Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement--Meters

    By signing this meter rental agreement, you the customer represent 
that you have read the Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement--Meters and 
are familiar with its terms. You agree that, upon execution of this 
agreement with the RC, you will also be bound by all terms and 
conditions of the Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement--Meters, as it 
may be amended from time to time.

Sec. 501.16  PC postage payment methodology.

    (a) The PC Postage customer is permitted to make payments for 
postage in one of two ways: Automated clearinghouse (ACH) transfer or 
credit card.
    (b) The provider must make payments on behalf of the customer to the 
Postal Service in accordance with contractual and/or regulatory 
responsibilities.
    (c) The Postal Service requires that the provider publicize to all 
PC Postage customers the following payment options (listed in order of 
preference):
    (1) Automated clearinghouse (ACH) debits/credits.
    (2) Credit cards.
    (d) Returned ACH debits are the responsibility of the Postal 
Service. The RC must lock the customer account immediately so that the 
customer is unable to reset the account until the Postal Service 
receives payment in full.
    (e) Refunds. The provider issues a refund to a customer for any 
unused postage in a Postage Evidencing System. After verification by the 
Postal Service, the provider will be reimbursed by the Postal Service 
for the individual refunds provided to customers by the provider.
    (f) Security and revenue protection. To receive Postal Service 
approval to continue to operate PC Postage systems, the provider must 
submit to a periodic examination of its PC Postage system and any other 
applications and technology infrastructure that may have a material 
impact on Postal Service revenues, as determined by the Postal Service. 
The examination shall be performed by a qualified, independent audit 
firm and shall be conducted in

[[Page 178]]

accordance with the Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 70, 
Service Organizations, developed by the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants (AICPA), as amended or superseded. The examination 
shall include testing of the operating effectiveness of relevant 
provider internal controls (Type II SAS 70 Report). If the service 
organization uses another service organization (sub-service provider), 
Postal Service Management should consider the nature and materiality of 
the transactions processed by the sub-service organization and the 
contribution of the sub-service organization's processes and controls in 
the achievement of the Postal Service's information processing 
objectives. The Postal Service should have access to the sub-service 
organization's SAS 70 report. The control objectives to be covered by 
the SAS 70 report are subject to Postal Service review and approval and 
are to be provided to the Postal Service 30 days prior to the initiation 
of each examination period. As a result of the examination, the auditor 
shall provide the provider, and the Postal Service, with an opinion on 
the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls related 
to the PC Postage system and any other applications and technology 
infrastructure considered material to the services provided to the 
Postal Service by the provider. Such examinations are to be conducted on 
no less than an annual basis, and are to be as of and for the twelve 
months ended June 30 of each year (except for the period ending June 30, 
2010 for which the period of coverage will be no less than six months, 
and except for new contracts for which the examination period will be no 
less than the period from the contract date to the following June 30, 
unless otherwise agreed to by the Postal Service). The examination 
reports are to be provided to the Postal Service by August 15 of each 
year. To the extent that internal control weaknesses are identified in a 
Type II SAS 70 report, the Postal Service may require the remediation of 
such weaknesses and review working papers and engage in discussions 
about the work performed with the auditor. The provider will be 
responsible for all costs to conduct these examinations.
    (g) Inspection of records and facilities. The provider must make its 
facilities, which handle the operation of the PC Postage system and all 
records about the operation of the system, available for inspection by 
representatives of the Postal Service at all reasonable times.
    (h) To the extent that the customer maintains funds on deposit for 
the payment of postage, the provider is required to incorporate the 
following language into its agreements with PC Postage customers:

            Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement--PC Postage

    By signing this agreement with the provider, you represent that you 
have read the Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement--PC Postage and are 
familiar with its terms. You agree that, upon execution of this 
agreement with the provider, you will also be bound by all terms and 
conditions of the Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement--PC Postage, as 
it may be amended from time to time.

Sec. 551.2  Semipostal stamps.

    Semipostal stamps are stamps that are sold for a price that exceeds 
the postage value of the stamp. The difference between the price and 
postage value of semipostal stamps, also known as the differential, less 
an offset for reasonable costs, as determined by the Postal Service, 
consists of a contribution to fund causes determined by the Postal 
Service to be in the national public interest and appropriate. Funds are 
to be transferred to selected recipient executive agencies, as defined 
under 5 U.S.C. 105. The office of Stamp Services determines the print 
quantities of semipostal stamps. The use of semipostal stamps shall be 
voluntary on the part of postal patrons.


<R05>
Sec. 551.3  Procedure for selection of causes and recipient executive agencies.

    The Postal Service is authorized to select causes and recipient 
executive agencies to receive funds raised through the sale of 
semipostal stamps. The procedure for selection of causes and recipient 
executive agencies is as follows:
    (a) In advance of the issuance of a semipostal stamp, the office of 
Stamp Services will publish a request for proposals in the Federal 
Register inviting interested persons to submit proposals for a cause and 
recipient executive agencies for a future semipostal stamp. The notice 
will specify the beginning and ending dates of the period during which 
proposals may be submitted. The notice will also specify the approximate 
period in which the semipostal stamp for which proposals are solicited 
is to be sold. The office of Stamp Services may publicize the request 
for proposals through other means, as it determines in its discretion.
    (b) Proposals will be received by the office of Stamp Services, 
which will review each proposal under Sec. 551.4.
    (c) Those proposals that the office of Stamp Services determines 
satisfy the requirements of Sec. 551.4 will be forwarded for 
consideration by the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, which is 
described in Administrative Support Manual (ASM) section 644.5. For 
availability of ASM 644.5, contact the Office of Stamp Services (202) 
268-2319.
    (d) The Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee will review eligible 
proposals forwarded by the office of Stamp Services. Based on the 
proposals submitted, the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee will make 
recommendations on a cause and eligible recipient executive agency(ies) 
to the postmaster general. If no eligible proposals are recommended, the 
Postal Service will solicit additional proposals through publication of 
a notice in the Federal Register and through other means as it 
determines in its discretion.
    (e) Meetings of the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee are closed, 
and deliberations of the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee are 
predecisional in nature.
    (f) The postmaster general will act on the recommendations of the 
Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee. The decision of the postmaster 
general shall consist of the final agency decision.
    (g) The office of Stamp Services will notify the executive 
agency(ies) in writing of a decision designating the agency(ies) as 
recipients of funds from a semipostal stamp.
    (h)(1) A proposal submission may designate one or two recipient 
executive agencies to receive funds, but if more than one executive 
agency is proposed, the proposal must specify the percentage shares of 
differential revenue, net of the Postal Service's reasonable costs, to 
be given to each agency. If percentage shares are not specified, it is 
presumed that the proposal intends that the funds be split evenly 
between the agencies. If more than two recipient executive agencies are 
proposed to

[[Page 182]]

receive funds and the proposal is selected, the proposal is treated as 
prescribed by paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
    (2) If more than one proposal is submitted for the same cause, and 
the proposals would have different executive agencies receiving funds, 
the funds would be evenly divided among the executive agencies, with no 
more than two agencies being designated to receive funds, as determined 
by the vice president and consumer advocate.
    (3) Within 10 days of receipt of a notice indicating that it has 
been selected to receive funds, a selected agency could request a 
proportionately larger share if it can demonstrate that its share of 
total funding of the cause from other sources (excluding any additional 
funds available as a result of the semipostal stamp) exceeds that of the 
other recipient executive agency. The request must be in writing and 
must be sent to the manager of Stamp Services. In those cases, the 
determination regarding the proportional share to be divided among the 
recipient executive agencies is made by the Postal Service's vice 
president and consumer advocate.
    (i) As either a separate matter, or in combination with 
recommendations on a cause and a recipient executive agency(ies), the 
Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee will recommend to the postmaster 
general a design (i.e., artwork) for the semipostal stamp. The 
postmaster general will make a final determination on the design to be 
featured.


<R05>
Sec. 551.4  Submission requirements and selection criteria.

request support for the following: Anniversaries; public works; people; 
specific organizations or associations; commercial enterprises or 
products; cities, towns, municipalities, counties, or secondary schools;

Sec. 551.5  Frequency and other limitations.

    (a) The Postal Service is authorized to issue semipostal stamps for 
a 10-year period beginning on the date on which semipostal stamps are 
first sold to the public under 39 U.S.C. 416. The 10-year period will 
commence after the sales period of the Breast Cancer Research stamp is 
concluded in accordance with the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act, and as 
amended by the Semipostal Authorization Act, the Breast Cancer Research 
Stamp Act of 2001, and Public Law 107-67, section 650, 115 Stat. 514. 
The Office of Stamp Services will determine the date of commencement of 
the 10-year period.
    (b) The Postal Service will offer only one semipostal stamp for sale 
at any given time during the 10-year period.
    (c) The sales period for any given semipostal stamp is limited to no 
more than 2 years, as determined by the office of Stamp Services.
    (d) Prior to or after the issuance of a given semipostal stamp, the 
Postal Service reserves the right to withdraw the semipostal stamp from 
sale, or to reduce the sales period, if, inter alia:
    (1) Its sales or revenue statistics are lower than expected,
    (2) The sales or revenue projections are lower than previously 
expected, or
    (3) The cause or recipient executive agency does not further, or 
comply with, the statutory purposes or requirements of the Semipostal 
Authorization Act. The decision to withdraw a semipostal stamp is to be 
made by the postmaster general, after review of supporting documentation 
prepared by the office of Stamp Services.

<R05>
Sec. 551.6  Pricing.

    (a) The Semipostal Authorization Act, as amended by Public Law 107-
67, section 652, 115 Stat. 514 (2001), prescribes that the price of a 
semipostal stamp is the rate of postage that would otherwise regularly 
apply, plus a differential of not less than 15 percent. The price of a 
semipostal stamp shall be an amount that is evenly divisible by five. 
For purposes of this provision, the First-Class Mail <SUP>[reg]</SUP> 
single-piece first-ounce rate of postage will be considered the rate of 
postage that would otherwise regularly apply.
    (b) The prices of semipostal stamps are determined by the Governors 
of the United States Postal Service in accordance with the requirements 
of 39 U.S.C. 416.

<R05>
Sec. 551.7  Calculation of funds for recipient executive agencies.

    (a) The Postal Service is to determine its reasonable costs in 
executing its responsibilities pursuant to the Semipostal Authorization 
Act, as specified in Sec. 551.8. These costs are offset against the 
revenue received through sale of each semipostal stamp in excess of the 
First-Class Mail single-piece first-ounce rate in effect at the time of 
purchase.
    (b) Any reasonable costs offset by the Postal Service shall be 
retained by it, along with revenue from the sale of the semipostal 
stamps, as recorded by sales units through the use of a specially 
designated account.
    (c) The Postal Service is to pay designated recipient executive 
agency(ies) the remainder of the differential revenue less an amount to 
recover the reasonable costs of the Postal Service, as determined under 
Sec. 551.8.
    (d) The amounts for recipient executive agencies are transferred in 
a manner and frequency determined by mutual agreement, consistent with 
the requirements of 39 U.S.C. 416.

[[Page 184]]


<R05>
Sec. 551.8  Cost offset policy.

    (a) Postal Service policy is to recover from the differential 
revenue for each semipostal stamp those costs that are determined to be 
attributable to the semipostal stamp and that would not normally be 
incurred for stamps having similar sales; physical characteristics; and 
marketing, promotional, and public relations activities (hereinafter 
``comparable stamps'').
    (b) Overall responsibility for tracking costs associated with 
semipostal stamps will rest with the Office of Accounting, Finance, 
Controller. Individual organizational units incurring costs will provide 
supporting documentation to the Office of Accounting, Finance, 
Controller.
    (c) For each semipostal stamp, the Office of Stamp Services, in 
coordination with the Office of Accounting, Finance, Controller, shall, 
based on judgment and available information, identify the comparable 
stamp(s) and create a profile of the typical cost characteristics of the 
comparable stamp(s) (e.g., manufacturing process, gum type), thereby 
establishing a baseline for cost comparison purposes. The determination 
of comparable stamps may change during or after the sales period, and 
different comparable stamp(s) may be used for specific cost comparisons.
    (d) Except as specified, all costs associated with semipostal stamps 
will be tracked by the Office of Accounting, Finance, Controller. Costs 
that will not be tracked include:
    (1) Costs that the Postal Service determines to be inconsequentially 
small, which include those cost items which are less than $3,000 per 
invoice and are not specifically charged to a semipostal finance number.
    (2) Costs for which the cost of tracking or estimation would be 
burdensome (e.g., costs for which the cost of tracking exceeds the cost 
to be tracked);
    (3) Costs attributable to mail to which semipostal stamps are 
affixed (which are attributable to the appropriate class and/or subclass 
of mail); and
    (4) Administrative and support costs that the Postal Service would 
have incurred whether or not the Semipostal Stamp Program had been 
established.
    (e) Cost items recoverable from the differential revenue include, 
but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Packaging costs in excess of the cost to package comparable 
stamps;
    (2) Printing costs of flyers and special receipts;
    (3) Costs of changes to equipment;
    (4) Costs of developing and executing marketing and promotional 
plans in excess of the cost for comparable stamps;
    (5) Other costs specific to the semipostal stamp that would not 
normally have been incurred for comparable stamps; and
    (6) Costs in paragraph (g) of this section that materially exceed 
those that would normally have been incurred for comparable stamps.
    (f) The Semipostal Stamp Program incorporates the following 
provisions that are intended to maximize differential revenues available 
to the selected causes. These include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
    (1) Avoiding, to the extent practicable, promotional costs that 
exceed those of comparable stamps;
    (2) Establishing restrictions on the number of concurrently issued 
semipostal stamps; and
    (3) Making financial and retail system changes in conjunction with 
regularly scheduled revisions.
    (g) Other costs attributable to semipostals but which would normally 
be incurred for comparable stamps would be recovered through the postage 
component of the semipostal stamp price. Such costs are not recovered, 
unless they materially exceed the costs of comparable stamps. These 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Costs of stamp design (including market research);
    (2) Costs of stamp production and printing;
    (3) Costs of stamp shipping and distribution;
    (4) Estimated training costs for field staff, except for special 
training associated with semipostal stamps;
    (5) Costs of stamp sales (including employee salaries and benefits);
    (6) Costs associated with the withdrawal of the stamp issue from 
sale;
    (7) Costs associated with the destruction of unsold stamps; and

[[Page 185]]

    (8) Costs associated with the incorporation of semipostal stamp 
images into advertising for the Postal Service as an entity.

    The Postal Service acquires property and services pursuant to the 
authority of 39 U.S.C. 410.


<R05>
Sec. 601.101  Effective date.

<R05>
Sec. 601.102  Revocation of prior purchasing regulations.

    All previous postal purchasing regulations, including the Postal 
Contracting Manual, Procurement Manual, the Purchasing Manual (Issues 1, 
2 and 3), and procurement handbooks, circulars, and instructions, are 
revoked and are superseded by the regulations contained in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 601.103  Applicability and coverage.

    The regulations contained in this part apply to all Postal Service 
acquisition of property (except real property) and services.


<R05>
Sec. 601.104  Postal purchasing authority.

    Only the Postmaster General/CEO; the Postal Service's vice 
president, Supply Management; contracting officers with written 
statements of specific authority; and others designated in writing or 
listed in this part have the authority to bind the Postal Service with 
respect to entering into, modifying, or terminating any contract 
regarding the acquisition of property, services, and related purchasing 
matters. The Postal Service's vice president, Supply Management, or his 
or her designee, may also delegate in writing local buying authority 
throughout the Postal Service.


<R05>
Sec. 601.105  Business relationships.

    (a) General. A person or organization wishing to have a continuing 
business relationship with the Postal Service in purchasing matters is 
expected to treat the Postal Service in the same manner as it would 
other valued customers of similar size and importance. The Postal 
Service reserves the right to decline to accept or consider proposals 
from a person or organization when that person or organization fails to 
meet reasonable business expectations or provide a high level of 
confidence regarding quality, prompt service, and overall 
professionalism.
    (b) Declining to accept or consider proposals. The Postal Service 
may decline to accept or consider proposals when a person or 
organization exhibits unacceptable conduct or business practices that do 
not meet reasonable business expectations or does not provide a high 
level of confidence about the entity's current or future business 
relations. Unacceptable conduct or business practices include, but are 
not limited to:
    (1) Marginal or dilatory contract performance;
    (2) Failure to deliver on promises made in the course of dealings 
with the Postal Service;

[[Page 187]]

    (3) Providing false or misleading information regarding financial 
condition, ability to perform, or other material matters, including any 
aspect of performance on a contract; and
    (4) Engaging in other questionable or unprofessional conduct or 
business practices.
    (c) Notice. If the Postal Service elects to decline to accept or 
consider proposals from a person or organization, the vice president, 
Supply Management, or his or her designee, will provide a written notice 
to the person or organization by Certified Mail, return receipt 
requested, explaining:
    (1) The reasons for the decision;
    (2) The effective date of the decision;
    (3) The scope of the decision;
    (4) The period of time the decision will be in effect, (a matter at 
the Postal Service's discretion consistent with the circumstances); and
    (5) The supplier's right to contest the decision.
    (d) Contesting Decisions. If a person or organization believes the 
decision not to accept or consider proposals is not merited, it may 
contest the matter in accordance with Sec. 601.108. The Postal Service 
may reconsider the matter and, if warranted, rescind or modify the 
decision to decline to accept or consider proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 601.106  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 601.107  Initial disagreement resolution.

    (a) Definitions.
    (1) Days. Calendar days; however, any time period will run until a 
day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
    (2) Disagreements. All disputes, protests, claims, disagreements, or 
demands of whatsoever nature arising in connection with the acquisition 
of property and services within the scope of Sec. 601.103 of this 
chapter, except those:
    (i) That arise pursuant to a contract under the Contract Disputes 
Act under Sec. 601.109;
    (ii) That concern debarment, suspension, or ineligibility under 
Sec. 601.113; or
    (iii) That arise out of the nonrenewal of transportation contracts 
containing other provisions for the review of such decisions.
    (3) Interested parties. Actual or prospective offerors whose direct 
economic interests would be affected by the award of, or failure to 
award, the contract.
    (4) Lodge. A disagreement is lodged on the date it is received by 
the contracting officer or the Supplier Disagreement Resolution 
Official, as appropriate.
    (5) SDR Official. The Supplier Disagreement Resolution Official, a 
contracting officer designated by the Postal Service to perform the 
functions established under Sec. 601.108.
    (b) Policy. It is the policy of the Postal Service and in the 
interest of its suppliers to resolve disagreements by mutual agreement 
between the supplier and the responsible contracting officer. All 
disagreements must be lodged with the responsible contracting office in 
writing via facsimile, e-mail, hand delivery, or U.S. Mail. For 
disagreements that concern the award of a contract, the disagreement 
shall be lodged within 10 days of the date the supplier received 
notification of award or 10 days from the date the supplier received a 
debriefing, whichever is later. For disagreements that concern alleged 
improprieties in a solicitation, the contracting officer must receive 
the disagreement before the time set for the receipt of proposals, 
unless the disagreement concerns an alleged impropriety that does not 
exist in the initial solicitation but which is subsequently incorporated 
into the solicitation, in which event the contracting officer must 
receive the disagreement no later than the next closing time for the 
receipt of proposals following the incorporation. The resolution period 
shall last 10 days from the date when the disagreement is lodged with 
the contracting officer. During the supplier-contracting officer 10-day 
resolution period, the responsible contracting officer's management may 
help to resolve the disagreement. At the conclusion of the 10-day 
resolution period, the contracting officer must communicate, in writing, 
to the supplier his or her resolution of the disagreement.
    (c) Alternative dispute resolution. Alternative dispute resolution 
(ADR) procedures may be used to resolve a disagreement. If the use of 
ADR is agreed

[[Page 188]]

upon, the 10-day limitation is suspended. If agreement cannot be 
reached, the supplier has 10 days to lodge its disagreement with the SDR 
Official.

[75 FR 1542, Jan. 12, 2010]


<R05>
Sec. 601.108  SDR Official disagreement resolution.

    (a) General. If a disagreement under Sec. 601.107 is not resolved 
within 10 days after it was lodged with the contracting officer, if the 
use of ADR fails to resolve it at any time, if the supplier is not 
satisfied with the contracting officer's resolution of the disagreement, 
or if the decision not to accept or consider proposals under Sec. 
601.105 is contested, the SDR Official is available to provide final 
resolution of the matter. The Postal Service desires to resolve all such 
matters quickly and inexpensively in keeping with the regulations in 
this part.
    (b) Scope and applicability. This procedure is established as the 
sole and exclusive means to resolve disagreements under Sec. 601.107 
and contests of decisions under Sec. 601.105. This procedure is 
intended to expeditiously resolve disagreements that are not resolved at 
the responsible contracting officer level; to reduce litigation 
expenses, inconvenience, and other costs for all parties; to facilitate 
successful business relationships with Postal Service suppliers, the 
supplier community, and other persons; and to develop further the basis 
for the Postal Service's purchasing decisions and the administrative 
records concerning those decisions. All disagreements under Sec. 
601.107 and contests of decisions under Sec. 601.105 will be lodged 
with and resolved, with finality, by the SDR Official under and in 
accordance with the sole and exclusive procedure established in this 
section.
    (c) Lodging. The disagreement under Sec. 601.107 or contest of 
decision under Sec. 601.105 must be lodged with the SDR Official in 
writing via facsimile, e-mail, hand delivery, or U.S. Mail. The 
disagreement under Sec. 601.107 or contest of decision under Sec. 
601.105 must state the factual circumstances relating to it and the 
remedy sought. A disagreement under Sec. 601.107 must also state the 
scope and outcome of the initial disagreement resolution attempt with 
the contracting officer. The address of the SDR Official is: Room 4130 
(Attn: SDR Official), United States Postal Service Headquarters, 475 
L'Enfant Plaza, SW., Washington, DC 20260-4130. e-mail Address: 
SDROfficial@usps.gov. Fax Number: (202) 268-0075.
    (d) Lodging timeframes. Disagreements under Sec. 601.107 or 
contests of decisions under Sec. 601.105 must be lodged with the SDR 
Official within the following timeframes:
    (1) Disagreements under Sec. 601.107 not resolved with the 
contracting officer must be lodged with the SDR Official within 20 days 
after they were lodged with the contracting officer (unless ADR had been 
used to attempt to resolve them);
    (2) Disagreements under Sec. 601.107 for which ADR had been agreed 
to be used must be lodged with the SDR Official within 10 days after the 
supplier knew or was informed by the contracting officer or otherwise 
that the matter was not resolved;
    (3) Where a supplier is dissatisfied with the contracting officer's 
resolution of a disagreement under Sec. 601.107, the supplier must 
lodge the disagreement with the SDR Official within 10 days after the 
supplier first receives notification of the contracting officer's 
resolution; and
    (4) Contests of decisions under Sec. 601.105 to decline to accept 
or consider proposals must be lodged with the SDR Official within 10 
days of the supplier's receipt of the written notice explaining the 
decision.
    (5) The SDR Official may grant an extension of time to lodge a 
disagreement under Sec. 601.107 or contest of decision under Sec. 
601.105 or to provide supporting information when warranted. Any request 
for an extension must set forth the reasons for the request, be made in 
writing, and be delivered to the SDR Official on or before the time to 
lodge a disagreement lapses.
    (e) Disagreement decision process. The SDR Official will promptly 
provide a copy of a disagreement to the contracting officer, who will 
promptly notify other interested parties. The SDR Official will consider 
a disagreement and any response by other interested parties and 
appropriate Postal Service

[[Page 189]]

officials within a time frame established by the SDR Official. The SDR 
Official may also meet individually or jointly with the person or 
organization lodging the disagreement, other interested parties, and/or 
Postal Service officials, and may undertake other activities in order to 
obtain materials, information, or advice that may help to resolve the 
disagreement. The person or organization lodging the disagreement, other 
interested parties, or Postal Service officials must promptly provide 
all relevant, nonprivileged materials and other information requested by 
the SDR Official. If a submission contains trade secrets or other 
confidential information, it should be accompanied by a copy of the 
submission from which the confidential matter has been redacted. The SDR 
Official will determine whether any redactions are appropriate and will 
be solely responsible for determining the treatment of any redacted 
materials. After obtaining such information, materials, and advice as 
may be needed, the SDR Official will promptly issue a written decision 
resolving the disagreement and will deliver the decision to the person 
or organization lodging the disagreement, other interested parties, and 
appropriate Postal Service officials. When resolving a disagreement 
raised under Sec. 601.107, the SDR Official may grant remedies 
including, but not limited to, the following:
    (1) Directing the contracting officer to revise the solicitation or 
to issue a new solicitation;
    (2) Directing the contracting officer to recompete the requirement;
    (3) Directing the contracting officer to reevaluate the award on the 
basis of current proposals and the evaluation factors contained in the 
solicitation; and
    (4) Directing the contracting officer to terminate the contract or 
to refrain from exercising options under the contract.
    (f) Guidance. The SDR Official will be guided by the regulations 
contained in this part and all applicable public laws enacted by 
Congress. Non-Postal Service procurement rules or regulations and 
revoked Postal Service regulations will not apply or be taken into 
account. Failure of any party to provide requested information may be 
taken into account by the SDR Official in the decision.
    (g) Final resolution by the SDR Official and final contract award of 
the Postal Service. A resolution by the SDR Official will be final and 
binding. If the SDR Official's final resolution affirms the original 
contract award of the contracting officer, the contracting officer's 
original contract award becomes the Postal Service's final contract 
award, and may be subject to judicial review as described in paragraph 
(h) of this section. If the SDR Official's final resolution directs that 
the Postal Service terminate the contract award and issue a new 
solicitation, recompete the requirement, or reevaluate the current 
award, the contracting officer shall implement promptly the SDR 
Official's final resolution. However, any contract award made by the 
contracting officer after a resolicitation, recompetition, or 
reevaluation directed by the SDR Official is not a final contract award 
of the Postal Service that may be subject to judicial review unless and 
until disagreements concerning that contract award have been lodged and 
resolved with finality by the SDR Official.
    (h) Judicial review. The Postal Service's final contract award, as 
described in paragraph Sec. 601.108(g), may be appealed to a Federal 
court with jurisdiction based only upon an alleged violation of the 
regulations contained in this part or an applicable public law enacted 
by Congress. The party lodging the disagreement may seek review of the 
Postal Service's final contract award only after the mandatory 
administrative remedies provided under Sec. 601.107 and Sec. 601.108 
have been exhausted.
    (i) Resolution timeframe. It is intended that this procedure 
generally will resolve disagreements under Sec. 601.107 or contests of 
decisions under Sec. 601.105 within approximately 30 days after receipt 
by the SDR Official. The time may be shortened or lengthened depending 
on the complexity of the issues and other relevant considerations.

[75 FR 1542, Jan. 12, 2010]


<R05>
Sec. 601.109  Contract claims and disputes.

    (a) General. This section implements the Contract Disputes Act of 
1978, as

[[Page 190]]

amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). If ADR is used, the SDR official may serve 
as a mediator for contract performance disagreements prior to bringing a 
contract claim or dispute under this part.
    (b) Policy. It is the Postal Service's intent to resolve contractual 
claims and disputes by mutual agreement at the level of an authorized 
contracting officer whenever possible. In addition, the Postal Service 
supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution as an 
effective way to understand, address, and resolve conflicts with 
suppliers. Efforts to resolve differences should be made before the 
issuance of a final decision on a claim, and even when the supplier does 
not agree to use ADR, the contracting officer should consider holding 
informal discussions between the parties in order to resolve the 
conflict before the issuance of a final decision.
    (c) Supplier claim initiation. Supplier claims must be submitted in 
writing to the contracting officer for final decision. The contracting 
officer must document the contract file with evidence of the date of 
receipt of any submission that the contracting officer determines is a 
claim. Supplier claims must be submitted within 6 years after accrual of 
a claim unless the parties agreed to a shorter time period. The 6-year 
time period does not apply to contracts awarded prior to October 1, 
1995.
    (d) Postal Service claim initiation. The contracting officer must 
issue a written decision on any Postal Service claim against a supplier, 
within six years after accrual of a claim, unless the parties agreed in 
writing to a shorter time period. The 6-year time period does not apply 
to contracts awarded prior to October 1, 1995, or to a Postal Service 
claim based on a supplier claim involving fraud.
    (e) Certified claims. Each supplier claim exceeding $100,000 must be 
accompanied by a certification in accordance with the supplier's 
contract.
    (f) Misrepresentation or fraud. When the contracting officer 
determines that the supplier is unable to support any part of the claim 
and there is evidence or reason to believe the inability is attributable 
to either misrepresentation of fact or fraud on the supplier's part, the 
contracting officer must deny that part of the claim and refer the 
matter to the Office of Inspector General.
    (g) Decision and appeal--(1) Contracting officer's authority. A 
contracting officer is authorized to decide or settle all claims arising 
under or relating to a contract subject to the Contract Disputes Act, 
except for:
    (i) Claims or disputes for penalties or forfeitures prescribed by 
statutes or regulation that a Federal agency administers; or
    (ii) Claims involving fraud.
    (2) Contracting officer's decision. The contracting officer must 
review the facts pertinent to the claim, and may obtain assistance from 
assigned counsel and other advisors, and issue a final decision in 
writing. The decision must include a description of the claim or dispute 
with references to the pertinent contract provisions, a statement of the 
factual areas of agreement and disagreement, and a statement of the 
contracting officer's decision with supporting rationale.
    (3) Insufficient information. When the contracting officer cannot 
issue a decision because the supplier has not provided sufficient 
information, the contracting officer may request the required 
information. Further failure to provide the requested information is an 
adequate reason to deny the claim.
    (4) Furnishing Decisions. The contracting officer must furnish a 
copy of the decision to the supplier by Certified Mail\TM\, return 
receipt requested, or by any other method that provides evidence of 
receipt.
    (5) Decisions on claims for $100,000 or less. If the supplier has 
asked for a decision within sixty days, the contracting officer must 
issue a final decision on a claim of $100,000 or less within sixty 
calendar days of its receipt. The supplier may consider the contracting 
officer's failure to issue a decision within the applicable time period 
as a denial of its claim, and may file a suit or appeal on the claim.
    (6) Decisions on certified claims. For certified claims over 
$100,000, the contracting officer must either issue a final decision 
within sixty days of their receipt or notify the supplier within the 60-
day period of the time when a decision will be issued. The time period 
established must be reasonable, taking

[[Page 191]]

into account the size and complexity of the claim, the adequacy of the 
supplier's supporting data, and any other relevant factors.
    (7) Wording of decisions. The contracting officer's final decision 
must contain the following paragraph: ``This is the final decision of 
the contracting officer pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 
and the clause of your contract entitled Claims and Disputes. You may 
appeal this decision to the Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals by 
mailing or otherwise furnishing written notice (preferably in 
triplicate) to the contracting officer within ninety days from the date 
you receive this decision. The notice should identify the contract by 
number, reference this decision, and indicate that an appeal is 
intended. Alternatively, you may bring an action directly in the United 
States Court of Federal Claims within twelve months from the date you 
receive this decision.''
    (8) Additional wording for decisions of $50,000 or less. When the 
claim or claims denied total $50,000 or less, the contracting officer 
must add the following to the paragraph: ``In taking an appeal to the 
Board of Contract Appeals, you may include in your notice of appeal an 
election to proceed under the Board's small claims (expedited) 
procedure, which provides for a decision within approximately 120 days, 
or an election to proceed under the Board's accelerated procedure, which 
provides for a decision within approximately 180 days. If you do not 
make an election in the notice of appeal, you may do so by written 
notice anytime thereafter.''
    (9) Additional wording for decisions over $50,000 up to $100,000. 
When the claim or claims denied total $100,000 or less, but more than 
$50,000, the contracting officer must add the following to the 
paragraph: ``In taking an appeal to the Board of Contract Appeals, you 
may include in your notice of appeal an election to proceed under the 
Board's accelerated procedure, which provides for a decision within 
approximately 180 days. If you do not make an election in the notice of 
appeal, you may do so by written notice anytime thereafter.''
    (10) Information and resources. Contracting officers must have 
sufficient information available at the time a final decision is issued 
on a claim so resolution of an appeal within the period set for an 
expedited disposition will not be delayed. Once an appeal is docketed, 
and expedited disposition is elected, contracting officers must devote 
sufficient resources to the appeal to ensure the schedule for resolution 
is met. Nothing in this part precludes an effort by the parties to 
settle a controversy after an appeal has been filed, although such 
efforts to settle the controversy will not suspend processing the 
appeal, unless the Board of Contract Appeals so directs.


<R05>
Sec. 601.110  Payment of claims.

    Any claim amount determined in a final decision to be payable, less 
any portion previously paid, should be promptly paid to the supplier 
without prejudice to either party in the event of appeal or action on 
the claim. In the absence of appeal by the Postal Service, a board or 
court decision favorable in whole or in part to the supplier must be 
implemented promptly. In cases when only the question of entitlement has 
been decided and the matter of amount has been remanded to the parties 
for negotiation, a final decision of the contracting officer must be 
issued if agreement is not reached promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 601.111  Interest on claim amounts.

    Interest on the amount found due on the supplier's claim must be 
paid from the date the contracting officer received the claim (properly 
certified, if required) or from the date payment would otherwise be due, 
if that date is later, until the date of payment. Simple interest will 
be paid at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury for 
each 6-month period in which the claim is pending. Information on the 
rate at which interest is payable is announced periodically in the 
Postal Bulletin.


<R05>
Sec. 601.112  Review of adverse decisions.

    Any party may seek review of an adverse decision of the Board of 
Contract Appeals in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or in 
any other appropriate forum.

<R05>
Sec. 601.113  Debarment, suspension, and ineligibility.

    (a) General. Except as provided otherwise in this part, contracting 
officers may not solicit proposals from, award contracts to, or, when a 
contract provides for such consent, consent to subcontracts with 
debarred, suspended, or ineligible suppliers.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Affiliate. A business, organization, person, or 
individual connected by the fact that one controls or has the power to 
control the other or by the fact that a third party controls or has the 
power to control both. Indications of control include, but are not 
limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests 
among family members, shared facilities and equipment, contractual 
relationships, common use of employees, or a business entity organized 
following the debarment, suspension, or proposed debarment of a supplier 
which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal 
employees as the supplier that was debarred, suspended, or proposed for 
debarment. Franchise agreements are not conclusive evidence of 
affiliation if the franchisee has a right to profit in proportion to its 
ownership and bears the risk of loss or failure.
    (2) Debarment. An exclusion from contracting and subcontracting for 
a reasonable, specified period of time commensurate with the seriousness 
of the offense, failure, or inadequacy of performance.
    (3) General Counsel. This includes the General Counsel's authorized 
representative.
    (4) Indictment. Indictment for a criminal offense. An information or 
other filing by competent authority charging a criminal offense is given 
the same effect as an indictment.
    (5) Ineligible. An exclusion from contracting and subcontracting by 
an entity other than the Postal Service under statutes, executive 
orders, or regulations, such as the Davis-Bacon Act, the Service 
Contract Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Acts, the Walsh-Healy 
Public Contracts Act, or the Environmental Protection Acts and related 
regulations or executive orders, to which the Postal Service is subject 
or has adopted as a matter of policy.
    (6) Suspension. An exclusion from contracting and subcontracting for 
a reasonable period of time due to specified reasons or the pendency of 
a debarment proceeding.
    (7) Supplier. For the purposes of this part, a supplier is any 
individual, person, or other legal entity that:
    (i) Directly or indirectly (e.g., through an affiliate) submits 
offers for, is awarded, or reasonably may be expected to submit offers 
for or be awarded, a Postal Service contract, including a contract for 
carriage under Postal Service or commercial bills of lading, or a 
subcontract under a Postal Service contract; or
    (ii) Conducts business or reasonably may be expected to conduct 
business with the Postal Service as a subcontractor, an agent, or as a 
representative of another supplier.
    (c) Establishment and maintenance of lists--(1) The vice president, 
Supply Management will establish, maintain, and make available a list of 
suppliers debarred or suspended by the Postal Service to contracting 
officers.
    (2) The General Services Administration (GSA) compiles and maintains 
a consolidated list of all persons and entities debarred, suspended, 
proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible by Federal agencies or 
the Government Accountability Office. GSA posts the list on the 
Internet.
    (3) The vice president, Supply Management will notify the GSA of any 
Postal Service debarment, suspension, and change in the status of 
suppliers, including any of their affiliates, on the Postal Service 
list.
    (d) Treatment of suppliers on Postal Service or GSA lists. (1) 
Contracting officers will review the Postal Service and GSA lists before 
making a contract award.
    (2) Suppliers on the Postal Service list are excluded from receiving 
contracts and subcontracts, and contracting officers may not solicit 
proposals or quotations from, award contracts to, or, when a contract 
provides for such consent, consent to subcontracts with such suppliers, 
unless the vice president, Supply Management, or his or her designee, 
after consultation with the General Counsel, has approved such action. 
Suppliers on

[[Page 193]]

the Postal Service list may not provide goods or services to other 
persons or entities for resale, in whole or part, to the Postal Service 
and such other persons or entities are obligated to review the 
consolidated GSA list in order to exclude suppliers debarred or 
suspended by the Postal Service from performing any part of a Postal 
Service contract.
    (3) Suppliers on the GSA list are assigned a code by GSA which is 
related to the basis of ineligibility. The vice president, Supply 
Management maintains a table describing the Postal Service treatment 
assigned to each code. Suppliers on the GSA list who are coded as 
ineligible are excluded from receiving contracts and subcontracts, and 
contracting officers may not solicit proposals or quotations from, award 
contracts to, or, when the contract provides for such consent, consent 
to subcontracts with such suppliers, unless the vice president, Supply 
Management, or designee, after consultation with the General Counsel, 
has approved such action. Suppliers on the GSA list may not provide 
goods or services to other persons or entities for resale, in whole or 
part, to the Postal Service, and such other persons or entities are 
obligated to review the consolidated GSA list in order to exclude 
debarred or suspended suppliers from performing any part of a Postal 
Service contract.
    (4) Suppliers on the GSA list are assigned codes for which the table 
provides other Postal Service guidance, and are considered according to 
that guidance. When so indicated on the table, contracting officers must 
obtain additional information from the entity responsible for 
establishing the supplier's ineligibility, if such information is 
available.
    (5) The debarment, suspension, or ineligibility of a supplier does 
not, of itself, affect the rights and obligations of the parties to any 
valid, pre-existing contract. The Postal Service may terminate for 
default a contract with a supplier that is debarred, suspended, or 
determined to be ineligible. Contracting officers may not add new work 
to any contract with a supplier that is debarred, suspended, or 
determined to be ineligible by supplemental agreement, by exercise of an 
option, or otherwise (unless the work is classified as an insignificant 
or significant minor service change to a mail transportation contract), 
except with the approval of the vice president, Supply Management, or 
designee.
    (e) Causes for debarment--(1) The vice president, Supply Management, 
with the concurrence of the General Counsel, may debar a supplier, 
including its affiliates, for cause such as the following:
    (i) Conviction of a criminal offense incidental to obtaining or 
attempting to obtain contracts or subcontracts, or in the performance of 
a contract or subcontract.
    (ii) Conviction under a Federal antitrust statute arising out of the 
submission of bids or proposals.
    (iii) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, 
falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax 
evasion, or receiving stolen property.
    (iv) Violation of a Postal Service contract so serious as to justify 
debarment, such as willful failure to perform a Postal Service contract 
in accordance with the specifications or within the time limit(s) 
provided in the contract; a record of failure to perform or of 
unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more 
Postal Service contracts occurring within a reasonable period of time 
preceding the determination to debar (except that failure to perform or 
unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the 
supplier may not be considered a basis for debarment); violation of a 
contractual provision against contingent fees; or acceptance of a 
contingent fee paid in violation of a contractual provision against 
contingent fees.
    (v) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or 
business honesty.
    (vi) Any other cause of a serious and compelling nature that 
debarment is warranted.
    (2) The existence of a conviction in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of 
this section

[[Page 194]]

can be established by proof of a conviction in a court of competent 
jurisdiction. If appeal taken from such conviction results in a reversal 
of the conviction, the debarment may be removed upon the request of the 
supplier, unless another cause or another basis for debarment exists.
    (3) The existence of any of the other causes in paragraphs 
(e)(1)(iii), (iv),(v), or (vi) of this section can be established by a 
preponderance of the evidence, either direct or indirect, in the 
judgment of the vice president of Supply Management.
    (4) The criminal, fraudulent, or improper conduct of an individual 
may be imputed to the firm with which he or she is or has been connected 
when an impropriety was committed. Likewise, when a firm is involved in 
criminal, fraudulent, or other improper conduct, any person who 
participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the impropriety may 
be debarred.
    (5) The fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one 
supplier participating in a joint venture or similar arrangement may be 
imputed to other participating suppliers if the conduct occurred for or 
on behalf of the joint venture or similar arrangement, or with the 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of the supplier. Acceptance of the 
benefits derived from the conduct will be evidence of such knowledge, 
approval, or acquiescence.
    (f) Mitigating factors--(1) The existence of any cause for debarment 
does not necessarily require that a supplier be debarred. The decision 
to debar is within the discretion of the vice president, Supply 
Management, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, and must be 
made in the best interest of the Postal Service. The following factors 
may be assessed in determining the seriousness of the offense, failure, 
or inadequacy of performance, and may be taken into account in deciding 
whether debarment is warranted:
    (i) Whether the supplier had established written standards of 
conduct and had published internal control systems at the time of the 
activity that constitutes cause for debarment or had adopted such 
procedures prior to any Postal Service investigation of the activity 
cited as a cause for debarment.
    (ii) Whether the supplier brought the activity cited as a cause for 
debarment to the attention of the Postal Service in a prompt, timely 
manner.
    (iii) Whether the supplier promptly and fully investigated the 
circumstances involving debarment and, if so, made the full results of 
the investigation available to appropriate officials of the Postal 
Service.
    (iv) Whether the supplier cooperated fully with the Postal Service 
during its investigation into the matter.
    (v) Whether the supplier paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil, 
and administrative liability and other costs arising out of the improper 
activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred 
by the Postal Service, and made or agreed to make full restitution.
    (vi) Whether the supplier took appropriate disciplinary action 
against the individual(s) responsible for the activity that could cause 
debarment.
    (vii) Whether the supplier implemented and/or agreed to implement 
remedial measures, including those identified by the Postal Service.
    (viii) Whether the supplier instituted and/or agreed to institute 
new and/or revised review and control procedures and ethics programs.
    (ix) Whether the supplier had adequate time to eliminate 
circumstances within the supplier's organization that could lead to 
debarment.
    (x) Whether the supplier's senior officers and mid-level management 
recognize and understand the seriousness of the misconduct giving rise 
to debarment.
    (2) The existence or nonexistence of mitigating factors or remedial 
measures such as those above is not determinative whether or not a 
supplier should be debarred. If a cause for debarment exists, the 
supplier has the burden of demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the 
vice president, Supply Management that debarment is not warranted or 
necessary.
    (g) Period of debarment--(1) When an applicable statute, executive 
order, or controlling regulation of other agencies provides a specific 
period of debarment, that period applies. In other cases, debarment by 
the Postal Service should be for a reasonable, definite,

[[Page 195]]

stated period of time, commensurate with the seriousness of the offense 
or the failure or inadequacy of performance. Generally, a period of 
debarment should not exceed three years. When debarment for an 
additional period is deemed necessary, notice of the proposed additional 
period of debarment must be furnished to the supplier as in the case of 
original debarment.
    (2) Except as precluded by an applicable statute, executive order, 
or controlling regulation of another agency, debarment may be removed or 
the period may be reduced by the vice president, Supply Management when 
requested by the debarred supplier and when the request is supported by 
a reasonable justification, such as newly discovered material evidence, 
reversal of a conviction, bona fide change of ownership or management, 
or the elimination of the causes for which debarment was imposed. The 
vice president, Supply Management may, at his or her discretion, deny 
any request or refer it to the Judicial Officer for a hearing and for 
findings of fact, which the vice president, Supply Management will 
consider when deciding the matter. When a debarment is removed or the 
debarment period is reduced, the vice president, Supply Management must 
state in writing the reason(s) for the removal of the debarment or the 
reduction of the period of debarment.
    (h) Procedural requirements for debarment--(1) After securing the 
concurrence of the General Counsel, the vice president, Supply 
Management will initiate a debarment proceeding by sending the supplier 
a written notice of proposed debarment. The notice will be served by 
sending it to the last known address of the supplier by Certified Mail, 
return receipt requested. A copy of the notice will be furnished to the 
Office of Inspector General. The notice will state that debarment is 
being considered; the reason(s) for the proposed debarment; the 
anticipated period of debarment and the proposed effective date; and 
that, within thirty days of the notice, the supplier may submit, in 
person or in writing, or through a representative, information and 
argument in opposition to the proposed debarment. In the event a 
supplier does not submit information or argument in opposition to the 
proposed debarment to the vice president, Supply Management within the 
time allowed, the debarment will become final with no further review or 
appeal.
    (2) If the proposed debarment is based on a conviction or civil 
judgment, the vice president, Supply Management, with the concurrence of 
the General Counsel, may decide whether debarment is merited based on 
the conviction or judgment, including any information received from the 
supplier. If the debarment is based on other circumstances or if there 
are questions regarding material facts, the vice president, Supply 
Management may seek additional information from the supplier and/or 
other persons, and may request the Judicial Officer to hold a fact-
finding hearing on such matters. The hearing will be governed by rules 
of procedure promulgated by the Judicial Officer. The vice president, 
Supply Management may reject any findings of fact, in whole or in part, 
when they are clearly erroneous.
    (3) When the vice president, Supply Management proposes to debar a 
supplier already debarred by another government agency for a period 
concurrent with such debarment, the debarment proceedings before the 
Postal Service may be based entirely upon the record of evidence, facts, 
and proceedings before the other agency, upon any additional facts the 
Postal Service deems relevant, or on the decision of another government 
agency. In such cases, the findings of facts by another government 
agency may be considered as established, but, within thirty days of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the supplier may submit, in person or in 
writing, or through a representative, any additional facts, information, 
or argument to the vice president, Supply Management, and to explain why 
debarment by the Postal Service should not be imposed.
    (4) Questions of fact to be resolved by a hearing before the 
Judicial Officer will be based on the preponderance of the evidence.
    (5) After consideration of the circumstances and any information and 
argument submitted by the supplier,

[[Page 196]]

the vice president, Supply Management, with the concurrence of the 
General Counsel, will issue a written decision regarding whether the 
supplier is debarred, and, if so, for the period of debarment. The 
decision will be mailed to the supplier by Certified Mail, return 
receipt requested. A copy of the decision will be furnished to the 
Office of the Inspector General. The decision will be final and binding, 
unless the decision was procured by fraud or other criminal misconduct, 
or the decision was obtained in violation of the regulations contained 
in this part or an applicable public law enacted by Congress.
    (i) Causes for suspension. The vice president, Supply Management, 
may suspend any supplier, including any of its affiliates:
    (1) If the supplier commits, is indicted for, or is convicted of 
fraud or a criminal offense incidental to obtaining, attempting to 
obtain, or performing a government contract, violates a Federal 
antitrust statute arising out of the submission of bids and proposals, 
or commits or engages in embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, 
falsification or destruction of records, or receipt of stolen property, 
or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business 
honesty;
    (2) For any other cause of such serious and compelling nature that 
suspension is warranted; or
    (3) If the Postal Service has notified a supplier of its proposed 
debarment under this Part.
    (j) Period of suspension. A suspension will not exceed one year in 
duration, except a suspension may be extended for reasonable periods of 
time beyond one year by the vice president, Supply Management. The 
termination of a suspension will not prejudice the Postal Service's 
position in any debarment proceeding. A suspension will be superseded by 
a decision rendered by the vice president, Supply Management, under 
paragraph (h)(5) of this section.
    (k) Procedural requirements for suspension--(1) The vice president, 
Supply Management will notify a supplier of a suspension or an extension 
of a suspension and the reason(s) for the suspension or extension in 
writing sent to the supplier by Certified Mail, return receipt 
requested, within ten days after the effective date of the suspension or 
extension. A copy of the notice will be furnished to the Office of the 
Inspector General.
    (2) The notice will state the cause(s) for the suspension or 
extension.
    (3) Within thirty days of notice of suspension or an extension, a 
supplier may submit to the vice president, Supply Management, in 
writing, any information or reason(s) the supplier believes makes a 
suspension or an extension inappropriate, and the vice president, Supply 
Management, in consultation with the General Counsel, will consider the 
supplier's submission, and, in their discretion, may revoke a suspension 
or an extension of a suspension. If a suspension or extension is 
revoked, the revocation will be in writing and a copy of the revocation 
will be sent to the supplier by Certified Mail, return receipt 
requested. A copy of the revocation will be furnished to the Office of 
the Inspector General.

Sec. 602.1  General principles.

    It is the policy of the Postal Service to secure full ownership 
rights for its intellectual properties other than patents (hereinafter, 
intellectual properties) having significant economic or other business 
value, except when to do so would be contrary to the best interest of 
the Postal Service. Intellectual property rights shall be acquired and 
managed so as to:
    (a) Promote the economic, operational, and competitive well-being of 
the Postal Service;
    (b) Limit restrictions on the use of Postal Service intellectual 
property to a minimum consistent with its statutory obligations;
    (c) Assure that all potential users are treated fairly;

<R05>
Sec. 602.2  Office of Licensing, Philatelic and Retail Services Department.

    In accordance with the foregoing policy, the Postal Service Office 
of Licensing, Philatelic and Retail Services Department, formulates the 
program for the management of the Postal Service's rights in 
intellectual property (except patents and technical data rights in 
Postal Service contracts, which is the responsibility of Postal Service 
contracting officers). The Office of Licensing and the contracting 
officers identify intellectual properties in which the Postal Service 
should secure its rights. It receives and makes recommendations for the 
disposition of applications for use of Postal Service intellectual 
property. It periodically reviews the intellectual property rights 
portfolio to determine the extent of the utilization of protected 
properties and to recommend relinquishment of ownership when it 
considers ownership no longer desirable. It is advised by the Office of 
Procurement of performance under license agreements and makes 
recommendations for corrective measures when necessary. In consultation 
with the Law Department, it recommends appropriate action against 
unauthorized use of intellectual property.

to the requester.
    (d) Approved requests contemplating a contractual (fee) use of the 
intellectual property are forwarded to the Office of Licensing for the 
negotiation of a satisfactory license agreement.
    (e) Each license agreement is subject to legal review.
    (f) Requesters are promptly advised of unapproved requests.
    A transmittal letter effecting the above changes to the Domestic 
Mail Manual will be published and transmitted automatically to 
subscribers. Notice of issuance of the transmittal letter will be 
published in the Federal Register as provided by 39 CFR 111.3.

or transferred, and the date of the transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 761.3  Scope and effect of book-entry procedure.

    (a) A Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States acting on 
behalf of the Postal Service may apply the book-entry procedure provided 
for in this part to any Postal Service securities which have been or are 
hereafter deposited for any purpose in accounts with it in its 
individual capacity under terms and conditions which indicate that the 
Reserve Bank will continue to maintain such deposit accounts in its 
individual capacity, notwithstanding application of the book-entry 
procedure to such securities. This paragraph is applicable, but not 
limited, to securities deposited:
    (1) As collateral pledged to a Reserve Bank (in its individual 
capacity) for advances by it;
    (2) By a member bank for its sole account;
    (3) By a member bank held for the account of its customers;
    (4) In connection with deposits in a member bank of funds of States, 
municipalities, or other political subdivisions; or,
    (5) In connection with the performance of an obligation or duty 
under Federal, State, municipal, or local law, or judgments or decrees 
of courts.

The application of the book-entry procedure under this paragraph shall 
not derogate from or adversely affect the relationships that would 
otherwise exist between a Reserve Bank in its individual capacity and 
its depositors concerning any deposits under this paragraph. Whenever 
the book-entry procedure is applied to such Postal Service securities, 
the Reserve Bank is authorized to take all action necessary in respect 
of the book-entry procedure to enable such Reserve Bank in its 
individual capacity to perform its obligations as depository with 
respect to such Postal Service securities.
    (b) A Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States acting on 
behalf of the Postal Service may apply the book-entry procedure to 
Postal Service securities deposited as collateral pledged to the United 
States under Treasury Department Circulars Nos. 92 and 176, both as 
revised and amended, and may apply the book-entry procedure, with the 
approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to any other Postal Service 
securities deposited with a Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United 
States.
    (c) Any person having an interest in Postal Service securities which 
are deposited with a Reserve Bank (in either its individual capacity or 
as fiscal agent of the United States) for any purpose shall be deemed to 
have consented to their conversion to book-entry Postal Service 
securities pursuant to the provisions of this part, and in the manner 
and under the procedures prescribed by the Reserve Bank.
    (d) No deposits shall be accepted under this section on or after the 
date of maturity or call of the securities.


<R05>
Sec. 761.4  Transfer or pledge.

    (a) A transfer or pledge of book-entry Postal Service securities to 
a Reserve bank (in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the 
United States) or to the United States, or to any transferee or pledgee 
eligible to maintain an appropriate book-entry account in its name with 
a Reserve bank under this part, is effected and perfected, 
notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, by a Reserve bank 
making an appropriate entry in its records of the securities transferred 
or pledged. The making of such an entry in the records of a Reserve bank 
shall (1) have the effect of a delivery in bearer form of definitive 
Postal Service securities; (2) have the effect of a taking of delivery 
by the transferee or pledgee; (3) constitute the transferee or pledgee a 
holder; and (4) if a pledge, effect a perfected security interest 
therein in favor of the pledgee. A transfer or pledge of book-entry 
Postal Service securities effected under this paragraph shall have 
priority over any transfer, pledge, or other interest, theretofore or 
thereafter effected or perfected under paragraph (b) of this section or 
in any other manner.
    (b) A transfer or a pledge of transferable Postal Service 
securities, or any interest therein, which is maintained by a Reserve 
bank (in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United 
States) in a book-entry account under

[[Page 200]]

this part, including securities in book-entry form under Sec. 
761.3(a)(3), is effected, and a pledge is perfected, by any means that 
would be effective under applicable law to effect a transfer or to 
effect and perfect a pledge of the Postal Service securities, or any 
interest therein, if the securities were maintained by the Reserve bank 
in bearer definitive form. For purposes of transfer or pledge hereunder, 
book-entry Postal Service securities maintained by a Reserve bank shall, 
notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, be deemed to be 
maintained in bearer definitive form. A Reserve bank maintaining book-
entry Postal Service securities either in its individual capacity or as 
fiscal agent of the United States is not a bailee for purposes of 
notification of pledges of those securities under this paragraph, or a 
third person in possession for purposes of acknowledgment of transfers 
thereof under this paragraph. Where transferable Postal Service 
securities are recorded on the books of a depositary (a bank, banking 
institution, financial firm, or similar party, which regularly accepts 
in the course of its business Postal Service securities as a custodial 
service for customers, and maintains accounts in the names of such 
customers reflecting ownership of or interest in such securities) for 
account of the pledgor or transferor thereof and such securities are on 
deposit with a Reserve bank in a book-entry account hereunder, such 
depositary shall, for purposes of perfecting a pledge of such securities 
or effecting delivery of such securities to a purchaser under applicable 
provisions of law, be the bailee to which notification of the pledge of 
the securities may be given or the third person in possession from which 
acknowledgment of the holding of the securities for the purchaser may be 
obtained. A Reserve bank will not accept notice or advice of a transfer 
or pledge effected or perfected under this paragraph, and any such 
notice or advice shall have no effect. A Reserve bank may continue to 
deal with its depositor in accordance with the provisions of this part, 
notwithstanding any transfer or pledge effected or perfected under this 
paragraph.
    (c) No filing or recording with a public recording office or officer 
shall be necessary or effective with respect to any transfer or pledge 
of book-entry Postal Service securities or any interest therein.
    (d) A Reserve Bank shall, upon receipt of appropriate instructions, 
convert book-entry Postal Service securities into definitive Postal 
Service securities and deliver them in accordance with such 
instructions; no such conversion shall effect existing interests in such 
Postal Service securities.
    (e) A transfer of book-entry Postal Service securities within a 
Reserve Bank shall be made in accordance with procedures established by 
the Bank not inconsistent with this part.
    (f) All requests for transfer or withdrawal must be made prior to 
the maturity or date of call of the securities.

[37 FR 16801, Aug. 19, 1972, as amended at 38 FR 12919, May 17, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 761.5  Withdrawal of Postal Service securities.

    (a) A depositor of book-entry Postal Service securities may withdraw 
them from a Reserve Bank by requesting delivery of like definitive 
Postal Service securities to itself or on its order to a transferee.
    (b) Postal Service securities which are actually to be delivered 
upon withdrawal may be issued either in registered or in bearer form.


<R05>
Sec. 761.6  Delivery of Postal Service securities.

    A Reserve Bank which has received Postal Service securities and 
effected pledges, made entries regarding them, or transferred or 
delivered them according to the instructions of its depositor is not 
liable for conversion or for participation in breach of fiduciary duty 
even though the depositor had no right to dispose of or take other 
action in respect of the securities. A Reserve Bank shall be fully 
discharged of its obligations under this part by the delivery of Postal 
Service securities in definitive form to its depositor or upon the order 
of such depositor. Customers of a member bank or other depositary (other 
than a Reserve Bank) may obtain Postal Service securities in definitive 
form only by causing the depositor

[[Page 201]]

of the Reserve Bank to order the withdrawal thereof from the Reserve 
Bank.


<R05>
Sec. 761.7  Registered bonds and notes.

    No formal assignment shall be required for the conversion to book-
entry Postal Service securities of registered Postal Service securities 
held by a Reserve Bank (in either its individual capacity or as fiscal 
agent of the United States) on the effective date of this part for any 
purpose specified in Sec. 761.3(a). Registered Postal Service 
securities deposited thereafter with a Reserve Bank for any purpose 
specified in Sec. 761.3 shall be assigned for conversion to book-entry 
Postal Service securities. The assignment, which shall be executed in 
accordance with the provisions of part 760 of this subchapter and 
subpart F of 31 CFR part 306, so far as applicable, shall be to 
``Federal Reserve Bank of ------------ as fiscal agent of the United 
States acting on behalf of the Postal Service for conversion to book-
entry Postal Service securities.''


<R05>
Sec. 761.8  Servicing book-entry Postal Service securities; payment of interest, 

payment at maturity or upon call.

    Interest becoming due on book-entry Postal Service securities shall 
be charged in the Postal Service Fund on the interest due date and 
remitted or credited in accordance with the depositor's instructions. 
Such securities shall be redeemed and charged in the Postal Service Fund 
on the date of maturity, call or advance refunding, and the redemption 
proceeds, principal and interest, shall be disposed of in accordance 
with the depositor's instructions.

orders simply bear the words ``Pay to'' on their face;

[[Page 202]]

orders, bear on their face the phrase, ``This special money order is 
drawn by the Postal Service to pay one of its own obligations.''; and

words as well as numbers, while the amounts of postal money orders

account under his authorization, the financial organization may use an 
endorsement substantially as follows:

    Credit to the account of the within-named payee in accordance with 
payee's or payees' instructions. Absence of endorsement guaranteed.

their authorization.

with respect to its negotiability.

the owner after a substitute has been received by him, the original

    Responsible official means the person, or designated representative, 
who proposes an action and is responsible for compliance with NEPA. For 
larger projects, that person may not have the financial authority to 
approve such action. The responsible official signs the NEPA documents 
(FONSI, ROD) and the REC.

Sec. 775.6  Categorical exclusions.

    (a) The classes of actions in this section are those that the Postal 
Service has determined do not individually or cumulatively have a 
significant impact on the human environment. To be categorically 
excluded, it must be determined that a proposed action fits within a 
class listed and there are no extraordinary circumstances that may 
affect the significance of the proposal. The action must not be 
connected to other actions with potentially significant impacts or is 
not related to other proposed actions with potentially significant 
impacts. Extraordinary circumstances are those unique situations 
presented by specific proposals, such as scientific controversy about 
the environmental impacts of the proposal, uncertain effects or effects 
involving unique or unknown risks.
    (b) Categorical exclusions relating to general agency actions:
    (1) Policy development, planning and implementation that relate to 
routine activities such as personnel, organizational changes or similar 
administrative functions.
    (2) Routine actions, including the management of programs or 
activities necessary to support the normal conduct of agency business, 
such as administrative, financial, operational and personnel action that 
involve no commitment of resources other than manpower and funding 
allocations.
    (3) Award of contracts for technical support services, management 
and operation of a government owned facility, and personal services.
    (4) Research activities and studies and routine data collection when 
such actions are clearly limited in context and intensity.
    (5) Educational and informational programs and activities.

[[Page 208]]

    (6) Reduction in force resulting from workload adjustments, reduced 
personnel or funding levels, skill imbalances or other similar causes 
that do not affect more than 1,000 positions.
    (7) Postal rate or mail classification actions, address information 
system changes, post office name and zip code changes.
    (8) Property protection, law enforcement and other legal activities 
undertaken by the Postal Inspection Service, the Law Department, the 
Judicial Officer, and the Inspector General.
    (9) Activities related to trade representation and market 
development activities abroad.
    (10) Emergency preparedness planning activities, including 
designation of on-site evacuation routes.
    (11) Minor reassignment of motor vehicles and purchase or deployment 
of motor vehicles to new locations that do not adversely impact traffic 
safety, congestion or air quality.
    (12) Procurement or disposal of mail handling or transport 
equipment.
    (13) Acquisition, installation, operation, removal or disposal of 
communication systems, computers and data processing equipment.
    (14) Postal facility function changes not involving construction, 
where there are no substantial relocation of employees, or no 
substantial increase in the number of motor vehicles at a facility.
    (15) Closure or consolidation of post offices under 39 U.S.C. 
404(b).
    (16) Minor operational changes at an existing facility to minimize 
waste generation and for reuse of materials. These changes include but 
are not limited to, adding filtration and recycling systems to allow 
reuse of vehicle or machine oil, setting up sorting areas to improve 
process efficiency, and segregating waste streams previously mingled and 
assigning new identification codes to the two resulting streams.
    (17) Actions which have an insignificant effect upon the environment 
as established in a previously written Environmental Assessment (EA) and 
Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or Environmental Impact 
Statement (EIS). Such repetitive actions shall be considered ``reference 
actions'' and a record of all decisions concerning these ``reference 
actions'' shall be maintained by the Chief Environmental Officer or 
designee. The proposed action must be essentially the same in context 
and the same or less in intensity or create fewer impacts than the 
``reference action'' previously studied under an EA or EIS in order to 
qualify for this exclusion.
    (18) Rulemakings that are strictly procedural, and interpretations 
and rulings with existing regulations, or modifications or rescissions 
of such interpretations and rulings.
    (c) Categorical exclusions relating to emergency or restoration 
actions:
    (1) Any cleanup, remediation or removal action conducted under the 
provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and 
Liability Act (CERCLA) or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
(RCRA), any asbestos abatement actions regulated under the provisions of 
the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), or the Clean Air Act or 
any PCB transformer replacement or any lead based paint abatement 
actions regulated under the provisions of the Toxic Substances Control 
Act (TSCA), OSHA or RCRA.

occur in floodplains or state and local wetlands or pursuant to the 
nationwide, regional or general permitting process of the US Army Corps 
of Engineers.
    (3) Routine actions normally conducted to protect and maintain 
properties and which do not alter the configuration of the building.
    (4) Changes in configuration of buildings required to promote 
handicapped accessibility pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act.
    (5) Repair to, or replacement in kind or equivalent of building 
equipment or components (e.g., electrical distribution, HVAC systems, 
doors, windows, roofs, etc.).

[[Page 209]]

    (6) Internal modifications or improvements to structure, or 
buildings to accommodate mail processing, computer, communication or 
other similar types of equipment or other actions which do not involve 
modification to the external walls of the facility.
    (7) Joint development and/or joint use projects that only involve 
internal modifications to an existing facility.
    (8) Noise abatement measures, such as construction of noise barriers 
and installation of noise control materials.
    (9) Actions which require concurrence or approval of another federal 
agency where the action is a categorical exclusion under the NEPA 
regulations of that federal agency.
    (e) Categorical exclusions relating to real estate actions.
    (1) Obtaining, granting, disposing, or changing of easements, 
licenses and permits, rights-of-way and similar interests.
    (2) Extension, renewal, renegotiation, or termination of existing 
lease agreements.
    (3) Purchase of Postal Service occupied leased property where the 
planned postal uses do not differ significantly from the past uses of 
the site.
    (4) Acquisition or disposal of existing facilities and real property 
where the planned uses do not differ significantly from past uses of the 
site.
    (5) Acquisition of real property not connected to specific facility 
plans or when necessary to protect the interests of the Postal Service 
in advance of final project approval. This categorical exclusion only 
applies to the acquisition. Any subsequent use of the site for a 
facility project must be considered under this part.
    (6) Disposal through sale or outlease of unimproved real property.
    (7) Disposal through sale, outlease, transfer or exchange of real 
property to other federal or state agencies.
    (8) Acquisition and disposal through sale, lease, transfer or 
exchange of real property that does not involve an increase in volumes, 
concentrations, or discharge rates of wastes, air emissions, or water 
effluents, and that under reasonably foreseeable uses, have generally 
similar environmental impacts as compared to those before the 
acquisition or disposal. A determination that the proposed action is 
categorically excluded can be based upon previous ``reference actions'' 
documented under Sec. 775.6(b)(17).
    (9) Acquisition and disposal through sale, lease, transfer, 
reservation or exchange of real property for nature and habitat 
preservation, conservation, a park or wildlife management.
    (10) New construction, Postal Service owned or leased, or joint 
development and joint use projects, of any facility unless the proposed 
action is listed as requiring an EA in Sec. 775.5.
    (11) Expansion or improvement of an existing facility where the 
expansion is within the boundaries of the site or occurs in a previously 
developed area unless the proposed action is listed as requiring an EA 
in Sec. 775.5.
    (12) Construction and disturbance pursuant to a nationwide, regional 
or general permit issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers.
    (13) Any activity in floodplains being regulated pursuant to Sec. 
775.6 and is not listed as requiring an EA in Sec. 775.5.

Sec. 775.7  Planning and early coordination.

    Early planning and coordination among postal functional groups is 
required to properly consider environmental issues that may be 
attributable to the proposed action. Operational and facility personnel 
must cooperate in the early concept stages of a program or project. If 
it is determined that more than one postal organization will be involved 
in any action, a lead organization will be selected to complete the NEPA 
process before any NEPA documents are prepared. If it is determined that 
a project has both real estate and non-real estate actions, the 
facilities functional organization will take the lead.

Sec. 775.8  Environmental evaluation guidelines.

    (a) Approach. When dealing with proposals which may have an impact 
on the human environment, environmental coordinators, planners, decision 
makers, and other officials responsible for actions, will, as 
appropriate:

[[Page 210]]

    (1) Use a systematic approach that integrates natural and social 
sciences and environmental design in planning and making decisions.
    (2) Identify environmental effects and values in detail, and 
appraise them in conjunction with economic and technical analyses.
    (3) Consider environmental documents at all decision points at which 
other planning documents are considered. (Plans and decisions are to 
reflect environmental values. Proposed actions should be assessed as 
soon as their effects can be meaningfully evaluated, to provide the 
bases for early decision on whether detailed environmental impact 
statements must be prepared.)
    (4) Study, develop, describe, and evaluate at all decision points, 
reasonable alternatives to recommended actions which may have a 
significant effect on the environment.
    (b) Proposal requirements. When an environmental impact statement 
has been prepared, it must accompany the proposal through and be used in 
the decision-making process. Any other proposal must refer to applicable 
environmental documents (e.g., determination of categorical exclusion; 
finding of no significant impact; notice of intent to prepare an impact 
statement), and relevant comments and responses.
    (c) Lead agency arrangements. If the Postal Service and another 
Federal agency become involved in a lead agency arrangement for the 
preparation of an environmental impact statement, the Service will 
cooperate fully.

<R05>
Sec. 775.9  Environmental evaluation process.

    (a) All actions--(1) Assessment of actions. An environmental 
checklist may be used to support a record of environmental consideration 
as the determination that the proposed action does not require an 
environmental assessment. An environmental assessment must be prepared 
for each proposed action except that an assessment need not be made if a 
determination is made that:
    (i) The action is one of a class listed in Sec. 775.6, Categorical 
Exclusions, and
    (ii) The action is not affected by extraordinary circumstances which 
may cause it to have a significant environmental effect, or
    (iii) The action is a type that is not a major federal action with a 
significant impact upon the environment.
    (2) Findings of no significant impact. If an environmental 
assessment indicates that there is no significant impact of a proposed 
action on the environment, an environmental impact statement is not 
required. A ``finding of no significant impact'' (FONSI) is prepared and 
published in accordance with Sec. 775.13. When the proposed action is 
approved, it may be accomplished without further environmental 
consideration. A FONSI document briefly presents the reasons why an 
action will not have a significant effect on the human environment and 
states that an environmental impact statement will not be prepared. It 
must refer to the environmental assessment and any other environmentally 
pertinent documents related to it. The assessment may be included in the 
finding if it is short, in which case the discussion in the assessment 
need not be repeated in the finding. The FONSI may be a mitigated FONSI 
in which case the required mitigation factors should be listed in the 
FONSI. The use of a mitigated FONSI is conditioned upon the 
implementation of the identified mitigation measures in the EA that 
support the FONSI. Unless the mitigation measures are implemented by the 
responsible official, the use of an EA in lieu of an EIS is not 
acceptable.
    (3) Impact statement preparation decision and notices. If an 
environmental assessment indicates that a proposed major action would 
have a significant impact on the environment, a notice of intent to 
prepare an impact statement is published (see Sec. 775.13) and an 
environmental impact statement is prepared.
    (4) Role of impact statement in decision making. An environmental 
impact statement is used, with other analyses and materials, to decide 
which alternative should be pursued, or whether a proposed action should 
be abandoned or other courses of action pursued. See Sec. 775.12 for 
restrictions on the timing of this decision.

[[Page 211]]

    (5) Record of decision. For actions requiring environmental impact 
statements, a concise public record of decision is prepared when a 
decision, or a proposal for legislation, is made. The record, which may 
be integrated into any other record, or notice, including that required 
by Postal Service regulations and procedures governing intergovernmental 
review of Postal Service facility project actions, must:
    (i) State what the decision was.
    (ii) Identify all alternatives considered in reaching a decision, 
specifying alternatives considered to be environmentally preferable; 
identify and discuss all significant factors, including any essential 
considerations of national policy, which were weighed in making the 
decision and state how those considerations entered into the decision.
    (iii) State whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize 
environmental harm from the alternative selected have been or will be 
adopted, and if not, why not.
    (6) Actions prohibited prior to issuance of record of decision. 
Until a record of decision is issued, no action may be taken on a 
proposal on which an environmental impact statement is made if the 
action would:
    (i) Have an adverse environmental impact, or
    (ii) Limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.
    (7) Mitigation measures. Practicable mitigation measures identified 
in an environmental assessment must be implemented. Mitigation measures 
described in an environmental impact statement and accepted in a 
decision must be implemented. Upon request, the Postal Service informs 
federal, state, and local agencies and the public of the progress in 
carrying out adopted mitigation measures.
    (b) Additional requirements for facility actions. (1) The 
environmental assessment of any action which involves the construction 
or acquisition of a new mail processing facility must include reasonable 
alternatives to the proposed action and not just consideration of 
contending sites for a facility. This process must be started early in 
the planning of the action. An environmental assessment report, however, 
is not required until the contending project sites have been determined. 
The information contained in the environmental assessment report must be 
used, together with other site planning information, in the selection of 
the final site.
    (2) When an environmental assessment indicates that an environmental 
impact statement may be needed for a proposed facility action, the 
responsible officer will make the decision whether to prepare an 
environmental impact statement for presentation to the Capital 
Investment Committee, and to the Board of Governors if the Board 
considers the proposal.
    (3) If an environmental impact statement is presented to the 
Committee or the Board, and an analysis indicates that it would be more 
cost-effective to proceed immediately with continued control of sites, 
(including advance acquisition, if necessary, and where authorized by 
postal procedures), environmental impact statement preparation, and 
project designs, a budgetary request will include authorization of funds 
to permit:
    (i) The preparation of an impact statement encompassing all 
reasonable alternatives and site alternatives,
    (ii) The continued control of specified competing sites (including 
advance acquisition, if necessary, and where authorized by postal 
procedures), chosen to preserve environmental or other options, and
    (iii) The development of limited designs of facilities for each 
competing site.
    (4) A completed environmental impact statement will be presented to 
the Capital Investment Committee, and to the Board of Governors if the 
Board considers the proposal, for use in deciding whether a proposed 
project should proceed, be restudied, or be abandoned. If the decision 
is to proceed with a proposed project, the Committee, or the Board if it 
considers the proposal, decides which alternative site is to be

[[Page 212]]

used for project development, and authorizes the project.

Sec. 775.10  Environmental assessments.

    (a) An environmental assessment must contain:
    (1) A summary of major considerations and conclusions,
    (2) A description of the proposed action,
    (3) For each reasonable alternative, a description of the affected 
environment, the environmental consequences, the mitigation measures, if 
any, and a comparison to all alternatives considered.
    (4) A list of applicable environmental permits necessary to complete 
the proposed action.
    (b) Those preparing an environmental assessment must solicit 
information and views from Federal, State, and local agencies and, where 
there is a substantial likelihood of significant effects on the 
environment, the public. All responsible views and information must be 
considered.

<R05>
Sec. 775.11  Environmental impact statements.

    (a) Determining scope. Before an environmental impact statement is 
prepared, the following procedures must be followed to determine what 
issues are to be addressed and in what depth:
    (1) Affected Federal, State, and local agencies and other interested 
persons are invited to participate by furnishing written views and 
information, or at a hearing if appropriate. Notice is given in 
accordance with Sec. 775.13.
    (2) The significance of issues to be analyzed in depth in the 
environmental impact statement is determined through consideration of:
    (i) Actions which are closely related, or similar, or have 
cumulative significant impacts.
    (ii) Alternatives, which must include the ``no action'' alternative, 
other reasonable courses of action, and mitigation measures.
    (iii) Impacts, which may be direct, indirect, or cumulative.
    (3) Issues which are not significant are identified and eliminated.
    (4) The determinations made must be revised if substantial changes 
are made later in the proposed action, or if significant new 
circumstances or information arise which bear on the proposal or its 
impacts.
    (b) Preparation. (1) Except for proposals for legislation, 
environmental impact statements are prepared in two stages:
    (i) Draft environmental impact statement, prepared in accordance 
with the scope decided upon under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) Final environmental impact statement, responding to comments on 
the draft statement and discussing and responding to any responsible 
opposing view which was not adequately discussed in the draft statement.
    (2) Environmental impact statements must:
    (i) Be analytic rather than encyclopedic.
    (ii) Contain discussions of impacts in proportion to their 
significance. Insignificant impacts eliminated during the process under 
Sec. 775.11(a) to determine the scope of issues must be discussed only 
to the extent necessary to state why they will not be significant.
    (iii) Be concise, and not longer than is necessary to comply with 
NEPA. They must not contain repeated statements of the same basic 
points.
    (iv) Contain discussions of alternatives considered and of how 
alternatives chosen will meet the requirements of NEPA and other 
environmental laws and policies.
    (v) Encompass the range of alternatives to be considered by the 
decision makers.
    (vi) Serve to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions, 
rather than to justify decisions already made.
    (3) The text of final environmental impact statements normally 
should be less than 150 pages. Statements on proposals of unusual scope 
or complexity normally should be less than 300 pages.

[[Page 213]]

    (4) Staged or ``tiered'' environmental impact statements must not 
contain repetitive discussions of the same issues. Each document must 
state where each earlier document is available.
    (5) Material may be incorporated into an environmental impact 
statement by reference only when the material is reasonably available 
for inspection by potentially interested persons within the time allowed 
for comment.
    (6) If information relevant to reasonably foreseeable adverse 
impacts cannot be obtained because the overall cost of obtaining it is 
exorbitant or the means to obtain it are not known, the fact that such 
information is incomplete or unavailable must be stated clearly. In 
addition, the relevance of the incomplete or unavailable information to 
the evaluation of the impacts must be stated, and a summary of existing 
credible scientific evidence relevant to evaluation of the impacts must 
be included, as well as an evaluation of such impacts on the basis of 
theoretical approaches or generally accepted research methods. For 
purposes of this subsection, ``reasonably foreseeable'' includes impacts 
which have catastrophic consequences, even if their probability of 
occurrence is low, provided that the analysis of the impacts is 
supported by credible scientific evidence, is not based on pure 
conjecture, and is within the rule of reason.
    (7) If a cost-benefit analysis relevant to the choice among 
environmentally different alternatives was prepared for the proposed 
action, it must be incorporated by reference or appended to the 
statement to aid in evaluating the environmental consequences. The 
relationship between the cost-benefit analysis and any analysis of 
unquantified environmental impacts, values, and amenities must be 
discussed.
    (8) Methods used must be identified, and footnote references must be 
made to scientific and other sources relied on for conclusions. 
Analytical techniques may be incorporated in appendices.
    (9) Permits, licenses, and other authorizations needed to implement 
a proposal must be listed in the draft environmental impact statement 
and the prospects for obtaining them must be assessed. Where there is 
uncertainty as to the need for an authorization it must be indicated.
    (10) An environmental impact statement must contain a discussion of 
any inconsistency between the proposed action and any State or local 
law, ordinance, or approved plan; and must contain a description of the 
manner and extent to which the proposed action will be reconciled with 
the law, ordinance, or approved plan.
    (11) Where State laws or local ordinances impose environmental 
impact statement requirements which are not in conflict with those in 
NEPA, an environmental impact statement made by the Postal Service 
should satisfy pertinent State and local requirements to the extent 
practicable.
    (c) Format. The standard format for environmental statements is:
    (1) Cover Sheet. The cover sheet, not to exceed one page, must 
include:
    (i) A list of the responsible agencies including the lead agency and 
any cooperating agencies.
    (ii) The title of the proposed action that is the subject of the 
statement (and if appropriate, the titles of related cooperating agency 
actions), together with any city, state, and county where the action is 
to take place.
    (iii) The name, address, and telephone number of a person at the 
agency who can supply further information.
    (iv) A designation of the document as a draft or final statement or 
a draft or final supplement.
    (v) A one-paragraph abstract of the statement.
    (vi) The date by which comments must be received.
    (2) Summary. The section should compare and summarize the findings 
of the analyses of the affected environment, the environmental impacts, 
the environmental consequences, the alternatives, and the mitigation 
measures. The summary should sharply define the issues and provide a 
clear basis for choosing alternatives.
    (3) Table of Contents.
    (4) Proposed action. This section should clearly outline the need 
for the EIS and the purpose and description of the proposed action. The 
entire action

[[Page 214]]

should be discussed, including connected and similar actions. A clear 
discussion of the action will assist in consideration of the 
alternatives.
    (5) Alternatives and mitigation. This portion of the environmental 
impact statement is vitally important. Based on the analysis in the 
Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences section (see Sec. 
775.11(c)(6)), the environmental impacts and the alternatives are 
presented in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and 
providing a clear basis for choosing alternatives. Those preparing the 
statement must:
    (i) Explore and evaluate all reasonable alternatives, including the 
``no action'' alternative, and briefly discuss the reasons for 
eliminating any alternatives.
    (ii) Devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in 
detail, including the proposed action, so that reviewers may evaluate 
their comparative merits.
    (iii) Identify the preferred alternative or alternatives in the 
draft and final statements.
    (iv) Describe appropriate mitigation measures not considered to be 
an integral part of the proposed action or alternatives. See Sec. 
775.9(a)(7).
    (6) Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences. For each 
reasonable alternative, each affected element of the environment must be 
described, followed immediately by an analysis of the impacts 
(environmental consequences). The analysis must include, among others, 
the following:
    (i) Any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should 
the action be implemented.
    (ii) The relationship between short-term uses of the environment and 
the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity,
    (iii) Any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources 
should the action be implemented, and
    (iv) Energy requirements and conservation; and natural, or 
depletable, resource requirements and conservation.
    (7) List of Mitigation Measures.
    (8) List of Preparers. List the names, together with the 
qualifications (expertise, professional disciplines), of persons who 
were primarily responsible for preparing the environmental impact 
statement or significant background papers.
    (9) List of Agencies, Organizations and Persons to Whom Copies of 
the Statement Are Sent.
    (10) Index.
    (11) Appendices. Include comments on draft statement in final 
statement.
    (d) Distribution. (1) Any completed draft environmental impact 
statement which is made the subject of a public hearing, must be made 
available to the public as provided in Sec. 775.12, of this chapter at 
least 15 days in advance of the hearing.
    (2) Draft and final environmental impact statements must be filed 
with the Environmental Protection Agency. Five copies are filed with 
EPA's headquarters addressed to the Office of Federal Activities (A-
104), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 
20460; five copies are also filed with the responsible EPA region. 
Statements may not be filed with the EPA earlier than they are 
transmitted to commenting agencies and made available to the public.
    (3) Copies of draft and final environmental impact statements must 
be furnished to:
    (i) Any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved.
    (ii) Any appropriate Federal, state, or local agency authorized to 
develop and enforce environmental standards.
    (iii) The appropriate review officials identified in the Postal 
Service regulations and procedures governing intergovernmental review of 
Postal Service facility project actions, the State Historic Preservation 
Officer, and, when National Register or eligible properties may be 
affected, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
    (iv) Any person, organization or agency requesting them.
    (4) Copies of final environmental impact statements must be 
furnished to any person who, or organization or agency which, submitted 
substantive comments on the draft.
    (e) Responses to comments. (1) A final statement responds to 
comments on a

[[Page 215]]

draft statement in one or more of the following ways:
    (i) Modification of alternatives, including the proposed action.
    (ii) Development and evaluation of alternatives not previously given 
serious consideration.
    (iii) Supplementation, improvement, or modification of analyses.
    (iv) Correction of facts.
    (v) Explanation of why a comment does not warrant a direct response, 
citing supporting sources, authorities, or reasons. Relevant 
circumstances which may trigger reappraisal or further response must be 
indicated.
    (2) Substantive comments received on a draft statement must be 
attached to the final statement.
    (3) If all of the changes are minor and are confined to responses 
described in paragraphs (e)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section, errata 
sheets may be written, and only the comments and errata sheets need be 
recirculated. In such a case, the draft statement with the comments, 
errata sheets, and a new cover, must be filed as the final statement.
    (f) Supplements. (1) A supplement to a draft or final environmental 
impact statement must be issued if:
    (i) Substantial changes are made in the proposed action that are 
relevant to environmental concerns; or
    (ii) Significant new circumstances or information bearing on 
environmental impacts of the proposed action arise or are discovered.
    (2) The decision on a proposed action involving an environmental 
impact statement, must be delayed until any necessary supplement has 
been circulated and has gone through the commenting period. A supplement 
is prepared, circulated, and filed in the same manner (except for 
determining scope) as draft and final statements, unless alternative 
procedures are approved by CEQ.
    (g) Contracting. A contractor employed to prepare an environmental 
impact statement must certify that it has no financial or other interest 
in the outcome of the project.
    (h) Proposals for Legislation. Legislative environmental impact 
statements must be prepared and transmitted as follows:
    (1) A legislative environmental impact statement is considered part 
of the formal transmittal of a legislative proposal to the Congress. It 
may be transmitted to the Congress up to 30 days after the proposal. The 
statement must be available in time for Congressional hearings and 
deliberations.
    (2) Preparation and processing of a legislative statement must 
conform to the requirements for impact statements, except as follows:
    (i) It is not necessary to determine the scope of issues.
    (ii) A draft is considered to be a final statement. Both draft and 
final statements are needed only when:
    (A) A Congressional committee with jurisdiction over the proposal 
has a rule requiring both.
    (B) Both are specifically required by statute for proposals of the 
type being submitted.
    (3) Comments received on a legislative statement, and the Postal 
Service's responses, must be forwarded to the Congress.

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 776.1  Purpose and policy.

    (a) The regulations in this part implement the goals of Executive 
Orders 11990, Protection of Wetlands, and 11988, Floodplain Management, 
and are adopted pursuant to the Postal Reorganization Act, as the Postal 
Service does not meet the definition of the term ``agency'' used in the 
Executive Orders.
    (b) The Postal Service intends to exercise leadership in the 
acquisition and management of real property, construction of facilities, 
and disposal of real property, located in floodplains and wetlands. 
Consistent with the goals of the Executive Orders, the regulations in 
this part are not intended to prohibit floodplain and wetland 
development in all circumstances, but rather to create a consistent 
policy to minimize adverse impacts.


<R05>
Sec. 776.2  Responsibility.

    The appropriate Manager, Facilities Service Office, or functional 
equivalent within the Postal Service's facilities organization, in 
conjunction with the appropriate Vice President, Area Operations, or 
functional equivalent within the Postal Service's operations 
organization, are responsible for overall compliance with the 
regulations in this part pertaining to facilities projects. The Vice 
President, Area Operations, is responsible for compliance with these 
regulations for those projects within the Vice President's delegated 
authority.


<R05>
Sec. 776.3  Definitions.

    Construction means construction, alterations, renovations, and 
expansions of buildings, structures and improvements.
    Contending site means a site or existing building for a proposed 
postal facility action, which meets the requirements of the Postal 
Service as determined by the operations organization.
    Facility means any building, appurtenant structures, or associated 
infrastructure.
    Floodplain means the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining 
inland and coastal waters including flood-prone areas of offshore 
islands, including, at a minimum, that area subject to a one percent or 
greater chance of flooding in any given year (also known as a 100-year 
floodplain).
    Practicable means capable of being accomplished within existing 
constraints. The test of what is practicable depends on the situation 
and includes consideration of many factors, such as environment, cost, 
technology, implementation time, and postal operational needs.
    Preferred area means the specific geographical area proposed for a 
new postal facility, as developed by the operations organization within 
the Postal Service. A preferred area's boundaries are unique for each 
proposed facility based on the operational and customer service needs of 
the Postal Service.
    Preferred site means the most advantageous site for a proposed 
facility, taking into consideration postal operational and customer 
service needs, cost, and availability, as determined by the operations 
organization within the Postal Service.
    Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by 
surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to 
support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of 
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. 
Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Floodplain Management


<R05>
Sec. 776.4  Scope.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart are applicable to the following 
proposed postal facility actions located in a floodplain:
    (1) New construction, owned or leased; or
    (2) Construction projects at an existing facility that would 
increase the amount of impervious surface at the site.
    (b) These procedures are not applicable to the following postal 
facility actions:
    (1) Those actions identified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this 
section, when the entire preferred area, or all

[[Page 218]]

contending sites, for such actions lies within a floodplain;
    (2) Incidental construction, such as construction of athletic 
fields, recreational facilities, sidewalks, and other minor alteration 
projects;
    (3) Construction at existing postal facilities pursuant to the 
Architectural Barriers Act or postal accessibility standards;
    (4) Any facility construction project deemed necessary to comply 
with federal, state, or local health, sanitary, or safety code standards 
to ensure safe working conditions;
    (5) Construction of facilities that are functionally dependent on 
water, such as piers, docks, or boat ramps;
    (6) Maintenance, repair, or renovation of existing facilities; or
    (7) Leasing or other use of space for not more than one year.


<R05>
Sec. 776.5  Review procedures.

    Officials shall follow the decision-making process outlined in 
paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, when a facility action may 
involve floodplain issues. Under certain circumstances, this process may 
be carried out with fewer steps if all objectives of the decision-making 
process can be achieved. A general principle underlying this process is 
that a postal facility action requiring construction in a floodplain may 
be considered only when there is no practicable alternative.
    (a) Analysis of alternatives. If a postal facility action would 
involve construction in a floodplain, alternative actions shall be 
considered.
    (b) Early public notice. If a facility action at the contending 
site(s) could require construction in a floodplain, public notice must 
be provided.
    (c) Floodplain location and information. (1) Personnel shall 
determine whether construction would occur within a floodplain. The 
determination shall be made by reference to appropriate Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) floodplain maps (sometimes referred 
to as Floodplain Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM)), or Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) maps, or more detailed maps if available. If 
such maps are not available, floodplain location must be determined 
based on the best available information.
    (2) Once the preferred site has been identified, potential 
floodplain impacts must be determined. As part of this determination 
process, specific floodplain information should be developed, which is 
to consider:
    (i) Whether the proposed action will directly or indirectly support 
floodplain development;
    (ii) Flood hazard and risk to lives and property;
    (iii) Effects on natural and beneficial floodplain values, such as 
water quality maintenance, groundwater recharge, and agriculture; and
    (iv) Possible measures to minimize harm to, or impact on, the 
floodplain.
    (d) Reevaluation. After the above steps have been followed, if the 
determination is that there appears to be no practicable alternative to 
constructing in a floodplain, a further review of alternatives must be 
conducted by the facilities organization in conjunction with the 
operations organization requesting the construction of the facility. The 
further review of alternatives must be conducted by the operations 
organization for projects within the delegated authority of the Vice 
President, Area Operations.
    (e) Final public notice. As a result of the reevaluation, if it is 
determined that there is no practicable alternative to constructing in a 
floodplain, public notice shall be provided as soon as possible for the 
proposed action. The notice should be publicized and should include:
    (1) Identification of the project's location;
    (2) Provision for a 30-day public commenting period before 
irrevocable action is taken by the Postal Service; and
    (3) Name and complete address of a postal contact person responsible 
for providing further information on the decision to proceed with a 
facility action or construction project in a floodplain. Upon request, 
that person shall provide further information as follows:
    (i) A description of why the proposed action must be located in a 
floodplain;
    (ii) A listing of alternative actions considered in making the 
determination; and

[[Page 219]]

    (iii) A statement indicating whether the action conforms to 
applicable state and local floodplain protection standards.
    (f) Distribution. The above public notice will be sent to 
appropriate officials, local newspapers, and other parties who express 
interest in the project.
    (g) NEPA coordination. If either an Environmental Impact Statement 
or an Environmental Assessment is required under the Postal Service's 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the above review 
procedures must be incorporated into and evaluated in that document.


<R05>
Sec. 776.6  Design requirements for construction.

    If structures impact, are located in, or support development in a 
floodplain, construction must conform, at a minimum, to the standards 
and criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), except 
where those standards are demonstrably inappropriate for postal 
purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 776.7  Lease, easement, right-of-way, or disposal of property to non-federal parties.

    When postal property in floodplains is proposed for lease, easement, 
right-of-way, or disposal to non-federal public or private parties, the 
Postal Service shall:
    (a) Reference in the conveyance document that the parcel is located 
in a floodplain and may be restricted in use pursuant to federal, state, 
or local floodplain regulations; or
    (b) Withhold the property from conveyance.


<R04>
                      Subpart C_Wetlands Protection


<R05>
Sec. 776.8  Scope.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart are applicable to the following 
proposed postal facility actions located in a wetland:
    (1) New construction, owned or leased; or
    (2) Construction projects at an existing facility that would alter 
the external configuration of the facility.
    (b) These procedures are not applicable to the following postal 
facility actions:
    (1) Construction of foot and bike trails, or boardwalks, including 
signs, the primary purposes of which are public education, 
interpretation, or enjoyment of wetland resources;
    (2) Construction at existing postal facilities pursuant to the 
Architectural Barriers Act or postal accessibility standards;
    (3) Any facility construction project deemed necessary to comply 
with federal, state, or local health, sanitary, or safety code standards 
to ensure safe working conditions;
    (4) Construction of facilities that are functionally dependent on 
water, such as piers, docks, or boat ramps; or
    (5) Maintenance, repair, or renovation of existing facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 776.9  Review procedures.

    (a) Early public notice. If a facility action at the contending 
site(s) could require construction in a wetland, public notice must be 
provided.
    (b) Finding of no practicable alternative. The Postal Service shall 
avoid construction located in a wetland unless it issues a finding of no 
practicable alternative. The facilities organization, in conjunction 
with the operations organization, or, for projects within the delegated 
authority of the Vice President, Area Operations, the operations 
organization, shall make a written determination that:
    (1) There is no practicable alternative to such construction; and
    (2) The proposed action includes all practicable measures to 
minimize harm to wetlands.
    (c) NEPA coordination. If either an Environmental Impact Statement 
or an Environmental Assessment is required under the Postal Service's 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the above review 
procedures must be incorporated into and evaluated in that document.


<R05>
Sec. 776.10  Lease, easement, right-of-way, or disposal of property to non-federal parties.

    When postal-owned wetlands or portions of wetlands are proposed for 
lease, easement, right-of-way, or disposal to non-federal public or 
private parties, the Postal Service shall:

[[Page 220]]

    (a) Reference in the conveyance document that the parcel contains 
wetlands and may be restricted in use pursuant to federal, state, or 
local wetlands regulations; or
    (b) Withhold the property from conveyance.

hereinafter referred to as the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 777.12  Purpose.

    The purpose of these regulations is to update policy and procedures 
for the Postal Service's voluntary compliance with the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 777.13  Definitions.

    (a) The Act. The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property 
Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-646; 84 Stat. 1894).
    (b) Business. Any lawful activity, except a farm operation, that is:
    (1) Conducted primarily for the purchase, sale, lease, and/or rental 
of personal and/or real property, and for the manufacturing, processing, 
and/or marketing of products, commodities, and/or any other personal 
property; or
    (2) Conducted primarily for the sale of services to the public; or
    (3) Solely for the purposes of reimbursing moving and related 
expenses, conducted primarily for outdoor advertising display purposes, 
when the display(s) must be moved as a result of the project; or
    (4) Conducted by a nonprofit organization that has established its 
nonprofit status under applicable Federal or State law.
    (c) Small business. A business having at least one but not more than 
500 employees working at the location being acquired.
    (d) Comparable Replacement Dwelling. A dwelling which is:
    (1) Decent, safe, and sanitary.
    (2) Functionally similar to the displacement dwelling with 
particular attention to the number of rooms and living space.
    (3) In an area that is not subject to unreasonably adverse 
environmental conditions, is not generally less desirable than the 
location of the displacement dwelling with respect to public utilities 
and commercial and public facilities, and is reasonably accessible to 
the displaced person's place of employment.
    (4) On a site that is typical in size for residential development 
with normal site improvements including customary landscaping. The site 
need not

[[Page 222]]

include special improvements such as outbuildings, fences, swimming 
pools, and greenhouses.
    (5) Currently available to the displaced person.
    (6) Within the financial means of the displaced person.
    (e) Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling. A dwelling which meets 
local housing and occupancy codes and the following standards, unless 
they are waived for good cause by the Postal Service. The dwelling must:
    (1) Be structurally sound, weathertight, and in good repair.
    (2) Contain a safe electrical wiring system adequate for lighting 
and other electrical devices.
    (3) Contain a heating system capable of sustaining a healthful 
temperature of approximately 70 degrees except in those areas where 
local climatic conditions do not require such a system.
    (4) Be adequate in size with respect to the number of rooms and 
areas of living space needed to accommodate the displaced persons. There 
shall be a separate, well-lighted and ventilated bathroom that provides 
privacy to the user and contains a bathtub or shower stall, sink, and 
toilet, all in good working order and properly connected to appropriate 
sources of water and to a sewage drainage system. In the case of a 
housekeeping unit--as opposed to, for example, a room in a boarding 
house--there shall be a kitchen area that contains a fully usable sink, 
properly connected to potable hot and cold water and to a sewage 
draining system, and adequate space and utility service connections for 
a stove and a refrigerator.
    (5) Contain unobstructed egress to safe, open space at ground level.
    (6) For displaced persons who are handicapped, be free of any 
barriers which would preclude their reasonable ingress, egress, or use 
of the dwelling.
    (f) Displaced Person. (1) Subject to the additional definitions, 
limitations and exceptions in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the term 
``displaced person'' is defined as follows. (``Displaced persons'' are 
entitled to receive benefits only as specifically provided for elsewhere 
in these regulations.)
    (i) A person who owns real property, and who is required to move or 
to move personal property from the real property following Postal 
Service action to obtain title to, or a leasehold interest in, such real 
property by the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent 
domain.
    (ii) A person who is a tenant and who is required to move or to move 
his or her personal property from real property:
    (A) Following Postal Service action to obtain the tenant's leasehold 
interest in such real property by the exercise or the threat of the 
exercise of eminent domain, or,
    (B) Where the Postal Service acquires a fee interest in the property 
(including long-term leases of 50 years or more), as a result of a 
Postal Service notice of displacement or notice to vacate such real 
property, provided the tenant was lawfully in possession on the date 
title to such property transfers to the Postal Service. (The requirement 
that the tenant occupy such real property on the date title in such real 
property transfers to the Postal Service may be waived for good cause by 
the Postal Service.)
    (C) Where such real property was used to construct a new building 
for the express purpose of leasing to the Postal Service under 
circumstances where such tenant would have been a ``displaced person'' 
hereunder had the Postal Service itself acquired the land and required 
the removal of the tenant to undertake construction of the building for 
Postal Service ownership.
    (iii) Where the Postal Service acquires either a fee interest or a 
leasehold interest in the property, a person who is a residential tenant 
and is or will be required to move or to move his or her property from 
the real property, in order for the Postal Service to accomplish the 
project for which the property was acquired, provided such tenant 
occupies such real property on the date title in such real property 
transfers to the Postal Service or the date the Postal Service leases or 
contracts to lease such property, and further provided such tenant was 
lawfully in possession at the time of the initiation of negotiations. 
(The requirement that the tenant occupy such real property on the date 
title in such real

[[Page 223]]

property transfers to the Postal Service may be waived for good cause by 
the Postal Service.)
    (2) The term ``displaced person'' covers only persons meeting the 
requirements in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The term ``displaced 
person'' does not cover the following non-exclusive list of examples.
    (i) An owner who voluntarily sells his or her real property to the 
Postal Service, or,
    (ii) A tenant who voluntarily transfers his or her leasehold 
interest to the Postal Service without the exercise or the threat of the 
exercise of eminent domain, or,
    (iii) A tenant who is not lawfully in possession at the times for 
which lawful possession is specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(B) and 
(f)(1)(iii) of this section. A tenant who was legally required by the 
lease or otherwise to have moved from the property at the times 
specified in such paragraphs shall not be considered to be lawfully in 
possession.
    (iv) A person who, at the determination of the Postal Service, is 
not required to relocate permanently, or,
    (v) A person who, after receiving a notice of displacement or notice 
to vacate by the Postal Service, is notified in writing that he or she 
will not be displaced. Such later notification shall not be issued if 
the person has already moved. If such latter notification is issued, the 
Postal Service shall reimburse the person for any reasonable expenses 
incurred to satisfy any binding contractual relocation obligations 
entered into after the effective date of the notice of displacement or 
the notice to vacate or,
    (vi) A person who is required to temporarily vacate the premises in 
order to permit fumigation, repair, painting, or other maintenance or 
code of enforcement work or,
    (vii) A tenant who is required to move from real property as a 
result of a notice from the Postal Service to vacate such real property 
where such notice to vacate is issued five years or more after the date 
of the acquisition of such real property. A tenant who is given a notice 
to vacate as a result of failure to comply with the terms of his/her 
lease with the Postal Service or failure to renew his/her lease under 
prevailing market conditions is not considered to be a displaced person.
    (viii) A mobile home occupant who owns the site on which the mobile 
home is located and who voluntarily sells the site to the Postal 
Service, regardless of whether such person owns or rents the mobile 
home.
    (ix) A person whose property is acquired through a ``friendly 
condemnation action'' where price is not an issue.
    (g) Displacement Dwelling. The dwelling acquired by the Postal 
Service from which a displaced person is required to move.
    (h) Dwelling. The place of permanent or customary and usual 
residence of a person including a single family house; a single family 
unit in a two-family, multi-family, or multi-purpose property; a unit of 
a condominium or cooperative housing project; a non-housekeeping unit 
(i.e. room in a boarding house); a mobile home; or any other residential 
unit.
    (i) Family. Two or more individuals who are related by blood, 
adoption, marriage, or legal guardianship who live together as a family 
unit. If the Postal Service considers that circumstances warrant, others 
who live together as a family unit may be treated as if they are a 
family for the purpose of determining assistance under these 
regulations.
    (j) Farm Operation. Any activity conducted solely or primarily for 
the production of one or more types of agricultural products or 
commodities, including timber, for sale or home use, and customarily 
producing such products or commodities in sufficient quantity to be 
capable of contributing materially to the operator's support.
    (k) Financial Means. A comparable replacement dwelling is within the 
financial means of the displaced family or individual if the average 
monthly rental or housing cost (e.g., monthly mortgage payments, 
insurance for the dwelling unit, property taxes, and other reasonable 
recurring related expenses) which the displaced person will be required 
to pay does not exceed the greater of 25 percent of the monthly gross 
income of the displaced family or individual or the ratio of the present 
monthly rental or housing cost to the gross income of the displaced 
family or

[[Page 224]]

individual. (Supplemental payments made by public agencies are to be 
included in gross income for purposes of these comparisons.)
    (l) Initiation of Negotiations. In the case where eminent domain is 
neither exercised nor threatened to be exercised, the initiation of 
negotiations is the initial written communication stating a price by the 
owner or the owner's representative to the Postal Service, or by the 
Postal Service to the owner or the owner's representative, regarding a 
proposed acquisition (by purchase or lease) or an interest in a specific 
piece of real property. In the case where eminent domain is either 
exercised or threatened to be exercised, the initiation of negotiations 
is the date the Postal Service makes a written offer of just 
compensation.
    (m) Notice of Displacement. A notice given in writing by the Postal 
Service to a person that he or she will be displaced from his or her 
place of residence, business or farm, as a result of a facility action 
by the Postal Service. A notice of displacement may be combined with or 
in a notice to vacate.
    (n) Notice to Vacate. A notice given in writing by the Postal 
Service to a person that he or she is to vacate postal owned property on 
or before a certain date. A notice to vacate may be combined with or in 
a notice of displacement.
    (o) Owner of Displacement Dwelling. A person is considered to be an 
owner, if, at the initiation of negotiations, the person holds any of 
the following interests in real property acquired for a postal project:
    (1) Fee title, a life estate, a 99-year lease, or a lease, including 
any options for extension, with at least 50 years to run from the date 
of acquisition; or
    (2) An interest other than leasehold interest in a cooperative 
housing project which includes the right to occupy a dwelling; or
    (3) A contract to purchase any of the interests or estates described 
in paragraph (o)(1) or (o)(2) of this section; or
    (4) Any other interest, including a partial interest, which in the 
judgment of the Postal Service, warrants consideration as ownership.
    (p) Person. Any individual, family, partnership, corporation, 
association, business or farm operation.
    (q) Personal Property. Any tangible property, not considered part of 
the real property, for which payment has not been included in the 
acquisition cost.
    (r) Tenant. A person who has the legal right to temporary use and 
occupancy of real property owned by another. In some cases, these 
regulations also use the term ``tenant'' to refer to a person who 
occupies real property owned by another but whose legal right was 
terminated due to a timely notice to vacate the real property used and 
occupied.

Sec. 777.14  Certain indirect actions prohibited.

    Postal employees shall take no indirect, coercive, or deceptive 
actions to cause persons to move from real property in an effort to 
avoid the circumstances under which such persons would be eligible to 
receive relocation benefits as displaced persons under these 
regulations. If a claimant demonstrates that such prohibited action 
caused him or her to move, he or she will be treated as a displaced 
person hereunder, if he or she otherwise meets the definition of a 
displaced person.


<R04>
                 Subpart B_Uniform Relocation Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 777.21  General procedures.

    (a) Planning Prior to Site Selection. When acquisition of a site 
under consideration would likely involve displacement of a person 
eligible under Sec. 777.13 for relocation assistance, the Postal 
Service representative shall prepare a relocation needs and availability 
analysis. The Postal Service representative shall include in the 
analysis a complete inventory of persons who may be displaced and 
specifically identify their needs.
    (b) Planning Subsequent to Site Selection. Subsequent to site 
selection, the Postal Service must review the relocation needs and 
availability analysis

[[Page 225]]

and establish a specific plan for providing the assistance covered by 
these regulations to any eligible displaced persons. It will further 
determine the necessity of establishing an on-site relocation office 
which would be accessible to displaced persons and would be staffed with 
relocation personnel qualified to render all relocation services. The 
Postal Service will assure that cost estimates reflect current market 
conditions and that funding is available for all relocation assistance 
and activities.
    (c) Contracting for Relocation Services. When the Postal Service 
determines it to be advantageous, it may enter into a relocation 
assistance service contract with a public agency or private firm having 
expertise in relocation assistance. The contract must require the 
contractor to follow Postal Service relocation assistance regulations.
    (d) Notice to Vacate, Ninety Day Requirement. Postal Service notices 
to vacate must be issued at least 90 days prior to the date the property 
must be vacated. Any such notice must be in writing and delivered in 
person with receipt acknowledged, or by certified mail, return receipt 
requested. The 90-day requirement does not apply to any such notice 
issued subsequent to a valid notice to vacate issued by the prior owner 
of the property. A 90-day notice may be given with, or such notice may 
be combined with, but such notice must not be given before, the notice 
of displacement referred to in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) Shorter Notice Period, Unusual Circumstances. An occupant may be 
required to vacate the property on less than 90 days advance written 
notice if the Postal Service determines that a 90-day notice is 
impracticable. An example of such a situation is when the person's 
continued occupancy of the property would constitute a substantial 
danger to the person's health or safety.
    (f) Notice of Displacement. Normally, a notice of displacement will 
be given at the time of acquisition or later. Such notice must not be 
given earlier than the time of contracting, except in the case of 
acquisitions by eminent domain or by the threat of eminent domain. Such 
notice may be given at the time of contracting or between the time of 
contracting and the time of acquisition if the Postal Service considers 
it wise to start the displacement process then and if, in the judgment 
of the Postal Service, it is clear that person will in fact be a 
displaced person.
    (g) Notice of Availability of Advisory Services. The notice of 
displacement will state that relocation assistance advisory services 
will be available to the displaced person and will designate who will 
provide such services.
    (h) Eviction for cause. Any person occupying real property and not 
in unlawful occupancy on the date of initiation of negotiations is 
presumed to be entitled to relocation payments and other assistance 
unless the Postal Service determines that:
    (1) The person received an eviction notice prior to initiation of 
negotiations and, as a result of that notice, is later evicted; or
    (2) The person is evicted after initiation of negotiations for 
serious or repeated violation of material terms of the lease or 
occupancy agreement; and
    (3) In either case the eviction is not undertaken for the purpose of 
evading the obligation to make the relocation payments and other 
assistance available.

[51 FR 6983, Feb. 27, 1986, as amended at 54 FR 10667, Mar. 15, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 777.22  Relocation assistance advisory services.

    (a) General. The Postal Service carries out an advisory assistance 
program for displaced persons.
    (b) Relocation Information. The Postal Service must contact each 
displaced person to provide an informational statement outlining the 
assistance available to the particular person. If it is impracticable to 
contact the displaced persons personally, the informational statement 
must be mailed to the persons, certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (c) Time of Initial Contact to Provide Relocation Information. The 
initial contact to provide relocation information must take place by the 
following dates:
    (1) Where acquisition of the property is to occur as a result of the 
exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent

[[Page 226]]

domain, at the time of initiation of negotiation or within 30 days 
thereafter.
    (2) In any other instance such contact must be made prior to 
acquisition and prior to the notice of displacement or the notice to 
vacate, but it should normally not be made prior to contracting for the 
acquisition.
    (d) Service to be Provided. The advisory program shall include such 
services as may be necessary or appropriate to:
    (1) Provide current information on the availability, purchase 
prices, financing, and rental costs of replacement dwellings.
    (2) For displaced persons eligible for replacement housing payments, 
explain that the displaced person cannot be required to move unless at 
least one comparable replacement dwelling is made available.
    (i) At the request of the displaced person, the Postal Service must 
inform that person, in writing, of the specific comparable replacement 
dwelling used as the basis for the replacement housing payment offer, 
the price or rent used to establish the upper limit of that offer, the 
basis for the determination, and the amount of the replacement housing 
payment to which he or she may be entitled.
    (ii) Where feasible, housing must be inspected by the Postal Service 
representative prior to its being made available to assure that it is a 
comparable replacement dwelling and meets the decent, safe, and sanitary 
standard. The displaced person must be notified that a replacement 
housing payment will not be made unless the replacement dwelling is 
inspected and determined to be decent, safe, and sanitary.
    (iii) Whenever possible, minority displaced persons must be given 
reasonable opportunities to relocate to comparable dwellings, not 
located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their 
financial means. This policy, however, does not require the Postal 
Service to provide a person a larger payment than is necessary to enable 
that person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling.
    (iv) All displaced persons, especially the elderly and handicapped, 
must be offered transportation to inspect housing to which they are 
referred.
    (3) Provide current and continuing information on the availability, 
purchase prices, and rental costs of comparable and suitable commercial 
and farm properties and locations, and assist any person displaced from 
a business or farm operation to obtain and become established in a 
suitable replacement location.
    (4) Minimize hardships to displaced persons in adjusting to 
relocation by providing counseling, advice about other sources of 
assistance that may be available, and such other help as may be 
appropriate.
    (5) Supply displaced persons with appropriate information concerning 
Federal, State, and local housing programs, disaster loan and other 
programs administered by the Small Business Administration, and other 
Federal, State, and local programs offering assistance to displaced 
persons.
    (6) Upon selection of a replacement property by a displaced person, 
the Postal Service may arrange for a representative to assist the 
displaced person with necessary arrangements for the move.


<R05>
Sec. 777.23  Moving expenses.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Residential displaced persons are entitled to 
benefits under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (2) Business and farm displaced persons are entitled to benefits 
under paragraphs (d) through (k) of this section.
    (3) Those business or farm displaced persons who reside on the 
property where the business or farm operation is conducted are eligible 
for applicable benefits both as residents and as business or farm 
displaced persons, but no duplicate payments are allowed.
    (4) Persons who are required to move or to move personal property 
from real property, an interest in which is not acquired by the Postal 
Service, when it is determined by the Postal Service that such move is 
necessary or reasonable because of the Postal Service's having acquired 
an interest in other real property owned or leased by such persons and 
on which such persons conduct a business or farm operation,

[[Page 227]]

under circumstances where such persons are displaced persons with regard 
to such other real property or would have been displaced persons with 
regard to such other real property had they been required to move or to 
move personal property from such other real property, are entitled to 
benefits as residential, business or farm displaced persons under 
paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.
    (5) Eligibility for moving expenses does not depend upon the owner's 
or tenant's actual occupancy of the displacement real property.
    (b) Allowable Expenses, Residential Moves. Allowable moving expenses 
include:
    (1) Transportation of the displaced person and his or her personal 
property. Transportation costs are limited to the costs of a move up to 
a distance of 50 miles unless the Postal Service determines that 
relocation beyond 50 miles is justified.
    (2) Packing, crating, unpacking, and uncrating of the personal 
property.
    (3) Disconnecting, dismantling, removing, reassembling, and 
reinstalling relocated household appliances and other personal property.
    (4) Storage of the personal property not to exceed 12 months unless 
the Postal Service determines that a longer period is necessary.
    (5) Reasonable costs for insurance for the replacement value of the 
personal property being moved or stored.
    (6) When determined to be fair and reasonable by the Postal Service 
the replacement value of property lost, stolen, or damaged in the 
process of moving (not through the fault or negligence of the displaced 
person, his or her agent, or employee), but only where insurance 
covering such loss, theft, or damage is not reasonably available.
    (7) Other moving related expenses that are not listed as non-
allowable under paragraph (l)(3) of this section and which the Postal 
Service determines to be reasonable and necessary.
    (c) Fixed payment for moving expenses. residential moves. Any person 
displaced from a dwelling or a seasonal residence is entitled to receive 
an expense and dislocation allowance as an alternative to a payment for 
actual moving and related expenses. This allowance shall be determined 
according to the applicable schedule approved by the Federal Highway 
Administration. This includes a provision that the expense and 
dislocation allowance to a person with minimal personal possessions who 
is in occupancy of a dormitory style room shared by two or more other 
unrelated persons or a person whose residential move is performed by an 
agency at no cost to the person shall be limited to $50.
    (d) Allowable Expenses, Business and Farm Operations. Allowable 
expenses include:
    (1) The expenses allowed under paragraphs (b) (2), (4), (5) and (6)

    (3) Disconnecting, dismantling, removing, reassembling, and 
reinstalling relocated machinery, equipment, and other personal 
property, and substitute personal property as described in paragraph 
(d)(8) of this section. This includes connection to utilities available 
at the replacement site or building and minor modifications to personal 
property to adapt it to the replacement site or building. Excluded are 
expenses for providing utilities to or installing utilities at the 
replacement site or building and expenses for repair, alteration, 
improvement or modification of the replacement site or building. This 
exclusion includes, but is not limited to, any repairs, alterations, 
improvements, or modifications required by local code to bring the 
building up to standard.
    (4) Any license, permit, or certification fee required of the 
displaced person by a governmental authority at the replacement 
location. However, this payment is limited to the pro rata value for the 
remaining useful life of any existing license, permit, or certification.
    (5) Reasonable professional services necessary for planning the move 
of the personal property. Such professional services must be approved in 
advance by the Postal Service and shall not exceed the lowest of three 
acceptable bids.

[[Page 228]]

    (6) Relettering signs and replacing stationary on hand at the time 
of displacement that are made obsolete as a result of the move.
    (7) Actual direct loss of tangible personal property incurred as a 
result of moving or discontinuing the business or farm operation. The 
payment will consist of the reasonable costs incurred in attempting to 
sell the item plus the lesser of:
    (i) The fair market value of the item for continued use at the 
displacement site, less the proceeds from its sale. (To be eligible for 
this payment the claimant must make a good faith effort to sell the 
personal property, unless the Postal Service determines that such effort 
is not necessary. When payment for property loss is claimed for goods 
held for sale, the fair market value must be based on the cost of the 
goods to the business, not the potential selling price.); or
    (ii) The estimated cost of moving the item no more than 50 miles, 
but with no allowance for storage.
    (8) If an item of personal property which is used as part of a 
business or farm operation is not moved, is promptly replaced with a 
substitute item that performs a comparable function at the replacement 
site, the displaced person is entitled to payment of the lesser of:
    (i) The cost of the substitute item, including installation costs at 
the replacement site, less any proceeds from the sale. (To be eligible 
for payments under paragraph (d)(8) of this section, the claimant must 
make a good faith effort to sell the personal property, unless the 
Postal Service determines that such effort is not necessary.)
    (ii) The estimated cost of moving and reinstalling the replaced 
item, based on the lowest acceptable bid or estimate obtained by the 
Postal Service for eligible moving and related expenses, but with no 
allowance for storage.
    (9) A displaced business or farm operation is entitled to 
reimbursement for actual expenses, not to exceed $1,000, which the 
Postal Service determines to be reasonable and which are incurred in 
searching for a replacement location. These expenses include 
transportation, meals and lodging away from home, time spent searching 
(based on reasonable salary or earnings) and fees paid to a real estate 
agent or broker to locate a replacement site, exclusive of any fees or 
commissions related to the purchase of such site.
    (10) Other moving-related expenses, not listed as non-allowable 
under paragraph (l)(3) of this section, which the Postal Service 
determines to be reasonable and necessary.
    (e) Fixed Payment in Lieu of Moving Expenses, Business Moves. Any 
displaced business, other than an outdoor advertising display business, 
or a non-profit organization, is eligible for a fixed payment in lieu of 
actual moving and related expenses. This payment must be in an amount 
equal to the average annual net earnings of the business at that 
location, as computed under paragraph (i) of this section, but not less 
than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. For a displaced person to qualify for 
this payment, the Postal Service must determine that:
    (1) The business owns or rents personal property which must be moved 
in connection with such displacement and for which an expense would be 
incurred in such move; and, the business vacates or relocates from its 
displacement site; and
    (2) The business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of 
its existing patronage (clientele or net earnings). A business is 
assumed to meet this test unless the Postal Service determines that it 
will not suffer a substantial loss of its existing patronage; and
    (3) The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having more 
than three other entities which are not being acquired by the Postal 
Service, and which are under the same ownership and engaged in the same 
or similar business activities.
    (4) The business contributed materially to the income of the 
displaced person during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement (see 
paragraph (h) of this section). However, the Postal Service may waive 
this test for good cause.
    (5) The business is not operated at a displacement dwelling solely 
for the purpose of renting such dwelling to others.

[[Page 229]]

    (f) Determining the Number of Businesses. In determining whether two 
or more displaced legal entities constitute a single business which is 
entitled to only one fixed payment, all pertinent factors shall be 
considered, including the extent to which:
    (1) The same premises and equipment are shared;
    (2) Substantially identical or interrelated business functions are 
carried out and business and financial affairs are commingled;
    (3) The entities are held out to the public, and to those 
customarily dealing with them, as one business; and
    (4) The same person or closely related persons own, control, or 
manage the affairs of the entities.
    (g) Fixed Payment in Lieu of Moving Expenses, Farm Operation. Any 
displaced farm operation may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment 
for actual moving and related expenses in an amount equal to its average 
annual net earnings as computed in accordance with paragraph (i) of this 
section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. For a displaced 
person to qualify for this payment, the Postal Service must determine 
that the farm operation contributed materially to the income of the 
displaced person during the two taxable years prior to the displacement 
(see paragraph (h) of this section). In the case of acquisition of land 
which was part of a farm operation before the acquisition, the fixed 
payment shall be made only if the Postal Service determines that:
    (1) The acquisition of part of the land caused the operator to be 
displaced from the operation on the remaining land; or
    (2) The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the 
nature of the farm operation.
    (h) Contributes materially. The term ``contributes materially,'' as 
used in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section means that, during the 2 
taxable years prior to the taxable year in which displacement occurs, or 
during such other period as the Postal Service determines to be more 
equitable, a business or farm operation:
    (1) Had average annual gross receipts of at least $5,000; or
    (2) Had average annual net earnings of at least $1,000; or
    (3) Contributed at least 33\1/3\ percent of the owner's or 
operator's average annual gross income from all sources.
    (4) If the application of the above criteria creates an inequity or 
hardship in any given case, the Postal Service may approve the use of 
other criteria as determined appropriate.
    (i) Average Annual Net Earnings of a Business or Farm Operation. The 
average annual net earnings of a business or farm operation are one-half 
of its net earnings before Federal, State, and local income taxes during 
the 2 taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year in which it 
was displaced. If the business or farm was not in operation for the full 
2 taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be based on 
the actual period of operation at the displacement site during the 2 
taxable years prior to displacement, projected to an annual rate. 
Average annual net earnings may be based upon a different period of time 
when the Postal Service determines it to be more equitable. Net earnings 
include any compensation obtained from the business or farm operation by 
its owner, the owner's spouse, and dependents. The displaced person 
shall furnish the Postal Service proof of net earnings through income 
tax returns, certified financial statements, or other reasonable 
evidence which the Postal Service determines is satisfactory.
    (j) Nonprofit Organizations. Any displaced nonprofit organization 
may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment for actual moving and 
related expenses in an amount of $2,500, if the Postal Service 
determines that it:
    (1) Cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of existing 
patronage (membership or clientele). A nonprofit organization is assumed 
to meet this test, unless the Postal Service demonstrates otherwise; and
    (2) Is not part of an enterprise having at least one other 
establishment engaged in the same or similar activity which is not being 
acquired by the Postal Service.
    (k) Relocation of Outdoor Advertising Signs. The amount of a payment 
for direct loss of an advertising sign which is personal property is the 
lesser of:

[[Page 230]]

    (1) The depreciated replacement cost of the sign, as determined by 
the Postal Service, less the proceeds from its sale; (To be eligible for 
payments under this paragraph (k)(1), the claimant must make a good 
faith effort to sell the sign, unless the Postal Service determines that 
such effort is not necessary.) or
    (2) The estimated cost of moving the sign, no more than 50 miles, 
but with no allowance for storage.
    (l) Payment for actual reasonable reestablishment expenses, 
nonresidential moves. In addition to the payments available as allowable 
expenses for nonresidential moves, a small business, farm or non-profit 
organization may be eligible to receive a payment, not to exceed $10,000 
for expenses actually incurred in relocating and reestablishing such 
small business, farm or non-profit organization at a replacement site.
    (1) Allowable expenses. Reestablishment expenses must be reasonable 
and necessary, as determined by the Postal Service. They may include the 
following:
    (i) Repairs or improvements to the replacement real property as 
required by federal, state, local law, code or ordinance.
    (ii) Modifications to the replacement property to accommodate the 
business operation or make replacement structures suitable for 
occupancy.
    (iii) Construction and installation costs not to exceed $1,500 for 
exterior signing to advertise the business.
    (iv) Installation of security or fire protection devices.
    (v) Provision of utilities from right-of-way to improvements on the 
replacement site.
    (vi) Redecoration or replacement of soiled or worn surfaces at the 
replacement site, such as paint, panelling or carpeting.
    (vii) Licenses, fees and permits when not paid as part of the moving 
expenses.
    (viii) Feasibility surveys, soil testing and marketing studies.
    (ix) Advertisement of replacement location, not to exceed $1,500
    (x) Professional services in connection with the purchase or lease 
of a replacement site.
    (xi) Increased costs of operation during the first two years at the 
replacement site, not to exceed $5,000, for such items as lease or 
rental charges, personal or real property taxes, insurance premiums, 
utility charges including impact fees or one time assessments for 
anticipated heavy utility usage.
    (xii) Other items that the Postal Service considers essential to the 
reestablishment of the business.
    (2) Non-allowable expenses. Following is a non-exclusive listing of 
restablishment expenditures not considered to be reasonable, necessary 
or otherwise allowable.
    (i) Purchase of capital assets such as office furniture, filing 
cabinets, machinery, or trade fixtures.
    (ii) Purchase of manufacturing materials, production supplies, 
product inventory, or other items used in the normal course of the 
business operation.
    (iii) Interior or exterior refurbishment at the replacement site 
which are for cosmetic purposes only.
    (iv) Interest on money borrowed to make the move or purchase the 
replacement property.
    (v) Payment to a part-time business in the home which does not 
contribute materially to the household income.
    (vi) Payment to a person whose sole business at a replacement 
dwelling is the rental of such dwelling to others.
    (m) General Provisions--(1) Self moves. If the displaced person 
elects to take full responsibility for all or a part of the move, the 
Postal Service may approve a payment for the person's moving expenses in 
an amount not to exceed the lowest of three bids acceptable to the 
Postal Service. Bids may be obtained by either the displaced person or 
the Postal Service.
    (2) Transfer of Ownership. Upon request by the Postal Service and in 
accordance with applicable law, the displaced person may transfer to the 
Postal Service ownership of any personal property that is not to be 
moved, sold, or traded-in by executing a disclaimer of all rights or 
interest in the property.
    (3) Non-Allowable Expenses. Except as specifically otherwise 
provided herein, a displaced person is not entitled to payment for:

[[Page 231]]

    (i) The cost of moving any structure or other real property 
improvement.
    (ii) Loss of goodwill.

Sec. 777.24  Replacement housing payments.

    (a) Residential displaced persons are eligible for replacement 
housing payments as follows:
    (1) Residential displaced persons who lawfully and continuously 
owned and occupied a displacement dwelling for not less than 180 days 
prior to the initiation of negotiations are entitled to the benefits set 
out in paragraph (b) of this section. Such displaced persons may 
alternately choose the benefits under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) Residential displaced persons who lawfully and continuously 
owned and occupied, and residential displaced persons who were tenants 
and lawfully and continuously occupied, a displacement dwelling for not 
less than 90 days prior to the initiation of negotiations are entitled 
to the benefits set out in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) Where the replacement housing payment provided hereunder does 
not provide for housing within the financial means (see Sec. 777.13(j)) 
of the displaced person, see Sec. 777.27, Last Resort Housing.
    (b) Benefits for 180 Day Owner Occupants. Displaced persons eligible 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are entitled to benefits as set 
out below:
    (1) An amount which is the sum of:
    (i) The amount which must be added to the acquisition cost of the 
displacement dwelling to provide a total amount equal to the lesser of:
    (A) The reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling as 
determined by paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (B) The purchase price of a decent, safe and sanitary replacement 
dwelling actually purchased and occupied by the displaced person; plus
    (ii) Interest Cost (see paragraph (d) of this section); plus
    (iii) Incidental Expenses (see paragraph (h) of this section).
    (2) The benefits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are limited to 
a maximum payment of $22,500.
    (3) The benefits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are available 
only if a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling is purchased 
within 12 months after the latter of:
    (i) The date of acquisition or, in the case of condemnation, the 
date the required amount is deposited in a court for the displaced 
person's benefit, or
    (ii) The date the person moves from the displacement dwelling.
    (c) Determining the Cost of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling. The 
cost of a comparable replacement dwelling for purposes of benefits to be 
paid to 180 day owner occupants will be determined by applying the 
following:
    (1) If available, at least three representative comparable 
replacement dwellings must be examined and the payment offer computed on 
the cost of the fair market value of the dwelling most closely 
comparable to the displacement dwelling.
    (2) To the extent, feasible, comparable replacement dwellings will 
be selected from the neighborhood in which the displacement dwelling was 
located. If this is not possible, comparable replacement dwellings will 
be selected from nearby or similar neighborhoods where housing costs are 
similar.
    (d) Increased Mortgage Interest Costs. The amount to be paid to a 
displaced 180 day owner occupant for increased mortgage interest costs 
is the amount, if any, by which the present value of the interest on the 
mortgage loan(s) on the replacement dwelling plus any other debt service 
costs exceeds the present value of the interest on the

[[Page 232]]

mortgage loan(s) on the displacement dwelling plus purchaser's points 
and loan origination fees, subject to the following:
    (1) The payment must be based only on bona fide mortgages that were 
a valid lien on the displacement dwelling for at least 180 days prior to 
the initiation of negotiations. All such mortgages on the displacement 
dwelling must be used to compute the payment.
    (2) The payment must be based on the unpaid mortgage balance on the 
displacement dwelling or the new mortgage amount, whichever is less.
    (3) The payment must be based on the remaining term of the mortgage 
on the displacement dwelling or the actual term of the new mortgage, 
whichever is shorter.
    (4) The new mortgage must be a bona fide mortgage and its interest 
rate must not exceed the prevailing interest rate currently charged by 
mortgage lending institutions in the area in which the replacement 
dwelling is located.
    (5) The discount rate used to compute the present value of the 
increased interest cost must be the prevailing interest rate paid on 
demand savings deposits by commercial banks in the area in which the 
replacement dwelling is located.
    (6) Purchaser's points and loan origination fees, but not seller's 
points, are reimbursable to the extent they are not paid as incidental 
expenses, they do not exceed rates normal to similar real estate 
transactions in the area, and the Postal Service determines them to be 
necessary. The computation of such points and fees shall be based on the 
unpaid mortgage balance on the displacement dwelling, or the new 
mortgage amount, whichever is less.
    (e) Benefits for 90 Day Owner Occupant and Tenants. Displaced 
persons eligible under paragraph (a)(2) of this section are entitled to 
benefits as set out below:
    (1) Rental assistance benefits, as set out in paragraph (f) of this 
section or downpayment assistance benefits, as set out in paragraph (g) 
of this section.
    (2) The benefits in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, are limited to 
$5,250.
    (3) The benefits in (e)(1) above are available only if a decent, 
safe and sanitary replacement dwelling is purchased or rented within 12 
months after the latter of:
    (i) The date of acquisition or, in the case of condemnation, the 
date the required amount is deposited in the court for the displaced 
person's benefit, or
    (ii) The date the person moves from the displacement dwelling.
    (f) Rental Assistance. The rental assistance benefits, not to exceed 
$5,250, for 90 day owner occupants and tenants will be computed as 
follows:
    (1) The amount which must be added to 42 times the average monthly 
rental paid at the displacement dwelling (or, if the displaced person is 
an owner occupant, the fair market rental value had the displacement 
dwelling been rented) for the three-month period prior to displacement 
to provide a total amount equal to the lesser of:
    (i) 42 times the reasonable monthly rental of a comparable 
replacement dwelling; or
    (ii) 42 times the actual monthly rental cost of the decent, safe, 
and sanitary dwelling actually rented and occupied by the displaced 
person.
    (2) If utilities are included in either the replacement dwelling or 
the displacement dwelling rent, appropriate utilities must be factored 
into both rentals. If utilities are not included in either monthly 
rental then the payment will be computed using the base rental rates.
    (3) If, in the opinion of the Postal Service, the monthly rental at 
the displacement dwelling is significantly below the fair market rent of 
the displacement dwelling, such fair market rent must be used in 
computing the rental assistance payment.
    (4) The payment under this section must be disbursed in a lump-sum 
amount unless the Postal Service determines on a case-by-case basis, for 
good cause, that the payment should be made in installments. Where the 
rental assistance payment exceeds $5,250 under the provisions of Last 
Resort Housing, (Sec. 777.27), installment payments or payments through 
escrow accounts may be considered.
    (g) Downpayment assistance. Downpayment assistance, not to exceed 
$5,250, is available to 90 day owner occupants and 90 day tenants. This 
$5,250

[[Page 233]]

amount may be considered to include the full amount of the required 
downpayment and incidental expenses.
    (h) Incidental Expenses. Incidental expenses covered under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) or (g) of this section are those reasonable costs actually 
incurred by the displaced person incident to the purchase of a 
replacement dwelling and customarily paid by the buyer (not to exceed 
the costs of such for a comparable replacement dwelling). They include:
    (1) Legal, closing, and related costs, including those for title 
search and insurance, preparing conveyance instruments, notary fees, 
preparing surveys and plats, and recording fees.
    (2) Lender, FHA, or VA appraisal fees.
    (3) FHA or VA application fee.
    (4) Certification of structural soundness when required by the 
lender.
    (5) Credit report.
    (6) Owner's and mortgagee's evidence or assurance of title.
    (7) Escrow agent's fee.
    (8) State revenue or documentary stamps, sales or transfer taxes.
    (9) Such other costs as the Postal Service determines to be 
incidental to the purchase.

Sec. 777.25  Additional rules for replacement housing payments.

    (a) Multiple Owners. When a single family dwelling is owned by more 
than one person and occupied by only some of the 180 day owners (for 
example, when the dwelling is owned by an estate and only one of the 
heirs is in occupancy), the occupant(s) is (are) eligible to receive a 
maximum total price differential which is the lesser of:
    (1) The difference between (i) the reasonable cost of a comparable 
replacement dwelling, as determined under Sec. 777.24(c) and (ii) the 
acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling; or
    (2) The difference between (i) the occupant's share of the 
acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling and (ii) the purchase 
price of a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling actually 
purchased and occupied by the displaced person.
    (b) Multiple Occupants of One Displacement Dwelling. If two or more 
occupants of the displacement dwelling move to separate replacement 
dwellings, each occupant is entitled to a reasonable prorated share, as 
determined by the Postal Service, of any relocation payments that would 
have been made if the occupants moved together to a comparable 
replacement dwelling. However, if the Postal Service determines that two 
or more occupants maintained separate households within the same 
dwelling, such occupants have separate entitlements to relocation 
payments.
    (c) Mixed Use and Multi-Family Properties Acquired. If the 
displacement dwelling was part of a property that contained another 
dwelling unit or space used for non-residential purposes, or if it is 
located on a lot larger than that typical for residential purposes, only 
that portion of the acquisition payment which is actually attributable 
to the displacement dwelling and site can be considered its acquisition 
cost when computing the price differential.
    (d) Disaster-Related Insurance Proceeds. To the extent necessary to 
avoid duplicate compensation, the amount of any insurance proceeds 
received by a person in connection with a disaster related loss to the 
displacement dwelling must be included in the acquisition cost of the 
displacement dwelling when computing the price differential.
    (e) Inspection of Replacement Dwelling. Before making a replacement 
housing payment or releasing a payment from escrow, the Postal Service 
must inspect the replacement dwelling and determine that it is a decent, 
safe, and sanitary dwelling.
    (f) Purchase of Replacement Dwelling. A displaced person is 
considered to have met the requirement to purchase a replacement 
dwelling if the person has purchased an existing dwelling; purchased and 
rehabilitated or moved and restored an existing dwelling; or constructed 
a new dwelling, provided in each instance the dwelling is determined to 
be decent, safe and sanitary.

[[Page 234]]

    (g) Conversion of Payment. A displaced person who initially rents a 
replacement dwelling and receives a rental assistance payment may, 
within the required 12 month eligibility period, purchase a decent, safe 
and sanitary replacement dwelling. In such case, he or she is eligible 
to revise his or her original claim, and claim any additional assistance 
for which he or she was originally eligible. However, any portion of the 
rental assistance payment that has been disbursed must be deducted from 
the resultant replacement housing payment or downpayment assistance 
payment.
    (h) Payment After Death. A replacement housing payment is personal 
to the displaced person. Upon his or her death, the undisbursed portion 
of any such payment shall not be paid to the heirs or assigns, except 
that:
    (1) The amount attributable to the displaced person's period of 
actual occupancy of the replacement housing will be paid.
    (2) The full payment must be disbursed in any case in which a member 
of a displaced family dies and other family members continue to occupy 
the replacement dwelling selected in accordance with these regulations.
    (3) Any portion of a replacement housing payment necessary to 
satisfy the legal obligation of an estate in connection with the 
selection of a replacement dwelling by or on behalf of a deceased person 
must be disbursed to the estate.
    (i) 180 Day Owner Retention of Displacement Dwelling. If a 180 day 
owner occupant retains ownership of his or her dwelling or the right to 
move his or her dwelling from the displacement site, and he or she moves 
it and reoccupies it on a replacement site, the cost of the actual 
replacement dwelling to be computed for purposes of Sec. 
777.24(b)(1)(i)(A) (not to exceed the purchase price of a comparable 
replacement dwelling) will be the sum of:
    (1) The expenses of moving and restoring the retained dwelling to a 
condition comparable to that prior to the move; and
    (2) The salvage or other value deducted from the acquisition cost 
for the retained ownership; and
    (3) Additional costs, if necessary, incurred to make the unit a 
decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling; and
    (4) The cost of the replacement site, not to exceed the cost of a 
comparable available and suitable replacement site.
    (j) 90 Day Owner/Retention of Displacement Dwelling. A 90 day owner 
occupant who retains ownership of his or her dwelling or the right to 
remove his or her dwelling may receive the benefits as if he or she were 
a 180 day owner occupant subject, however, to a limitation of $5,250 on 
maximum benefits in lieu of the $22,500 limitation set out in paragraph 
Sec. 777.24(b)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 777.26  Mobile homes.

    (a) Moving Expenses. Displaced persons who are occupants of mobile 
homes are eligible for moving expenses under Sec. 777.23 subject to the 
following:
    (1) If the person owns the mobile home, moving expenses may, at the 
owner's option, include any reasonable costs incurred to move the mobile 
home to a replacement site, plus the reasonable cost of disassembling, 
moving, and reassembling any attached appurtenances (such as porches, 
decks, skirting, and awnings) which were not acquired, anchoring of the 
unit, and utility ``hook-up charges.''
    (2) If the person rents the mobile home, the Postal Service may 
allow the person moving expense benefits for moving the mobile home as 
if the person were an owner of the mobile home under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section.
    (3) If costs of moving a mobile home are paid as moving expenses 
under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, the person may not 
receive housing assistance benefits hereunder, other than any benefits 
to which they are entitled that are limited to the site of the mobile 
home.
    (4) Displaced occupants of mobile homes are eligible for moving 
expenses for personal property other than the mobile home and its 
appurtenances, but only to the extent the Postal Service does not pay 
the costs of moving the mobile home (either as moving expenses or 
replacement housing payments or, if it does pay such costs, the

[[Page 235]]

personal property is of a type that is customarily moved separately from 
the mobile home.)
    (b) Replacement Housing Payments. Displaced persons who are 180 day 
or 90 day occupants of mobile homes qualify for replacement housing 
payments under Sec. 777.24 subject to the following:
    (1) If the displaced person owns the mobile home and owns the site, 
the person is eligible for benefits under either Sec. 777.24 (b) or 
(e).
    (2) If the displaced person rents the mobile home and rents the site 
the person is eligible for benefits under Sec. 777.24(e).
    (3) If the displaced person rents the mobile home and owns the site 
the person is eligible for benefits under Sec. 777.24(e), with regard 
to the mobile home and to benefits under Sec. 777.24(b) with regard to 
the site, subject to a limitation on the home and site benefits combined 
of $22,500. (Persons who voluntarily sell mobile home sites are not 
displaced persons and are not entitled to benefits under Subpart B. See 
Sec. 777.13(e)(2)(viii)).
    (4) If the displaced person owns the mobile home and rents the site 
the person is eligible for benefits under either Sec. 777.24 (b) or (e) 
with regard to the mobile home and to benefits as a tenant under Sec. 
777.24(e) with regard to the site, subject to a limitation on home and 
site benefits combined of $5,250.
    (c) Special Rules for Mobile Homes. (1) In computing replacement 
housing payments for mobile home owners under paragraph (b) of this 
section, apply the terms of Sec. 777.25 (i) and (j) as appropriate, to 
transactions involving moving the mobile home to a new site.
    (2) The acquisition of a portion of a mobile home park may leave a 
remainder that is not adequate to continue the operation of the park. 
When the Postal Service determines that its acquisition of the real 
property has had this effect and that for this reason a mobile home 
occupant located on the remaining part of the property is required to 
move, such occupant shall be considered a displaced person under these 
regulations and shall be entitled to such benefits hereunder as the 
person would otherwise qualify.

<R05>
Sec. 777.27  Last resort housing.

    (a) Basic Determination to Provide Last Resort Housing. A displaced 
person cannot be required to move from his or her dwelling unless at 
least one comparable replacement dwelling is made available to him or 
her which is within his or her financial means. When such comparable 
replacement dwelling is not available, additional measures may be taken 
to provide for ``last resort'' housing for eligible displaced persons.
    (b) Basic Rights of Persons to be Displaced. The provisions of this 
section do not deprive any displaced person of any rights the person may 
have under these regulations such as the right to accept the maximum 
replacement housing payment available under these regulations and to 
move to a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling even if such 
dwelling is beyond the person's financial means.
    (c) Methods of Providing Replacement Housing. The Postal Service has 
broad latitude in implementing this section, but implementation must be 
on a reasonable cost basis. The Postal Service may provide last resort 
housing using the following methods:
    (1) Rehabilitation of and/or additions to an existing replacement 
dwelling.
    (2) The construction of a new replacement dwelling.
    (3) The provision of a direct loan which requires regular 
amortization or deferred repayment. Terms of such loan will be at the 
discretion of the Postal Service.
    (4) A replacement housing payment in excess of the $5,250 and 
$22,500 limitations contained in Sec. 777.24. A rental subsidy under 
this section may be provided in installments.
    (5) The relocation and any needed rehabilitation of a replacement 
dwelling.
    (6) The purchase or lease of land and/or a replacement dwelling by 
the Postal Service and subsequent sale or lease to, or exchange with, a 
displaced person.
    (7) The removal of barriers to the handicapped.
    (8) Any other method determined by the Postal Service to be 
reasonable.
    (d) Proof of Financial Need. Last Resort Housing benefits exceeding 
the limitations under Sec. 777.24(b)(2) and

[[Page 236]]

Sec. 777.24(e)(2) will not be paid unless required to provide housing 
within the displaced person's financial means. To establish financial 
means, the displaced person must furnish the Postal Service proof of 
gross monthly income through income tax returns, certified financial 
statements or other reasonable evidence which the Postal Service 
determines is satisfactory.

<R05>
Sec. 777.28  Claims and appeals.

    (a) Preparation of Claim. The relocation representative should 
assist eligible displaced persons in the preparation of claims for 
moving assistance and relocation housing assistance. Preliminary review 
should be conducted in the field by the relocation representative with 
the displaced person, to preclude technical difficulties in processing 
the claim at a higher level.
    (b) Documentation. Any claim for a relocation payment must be 
supported by such documentation as may be required to support the claim, 
for example the length of occupancy at the displacement dwelling, the 
rent paid at the displacement dwelling, expenses incurred in relocating, 
etc. A displaced person must be provided reasonable assistance to 
complete and file any required claim.
    (c) Time for Filing. All claims must be filed with the Postal 
Service within 18 months after the date of the actual move from the 
displacement property.
    (d) Review, Approval and Payment. The Postal Service will review 
claims within 60 days of submission and approve or disapprove payment. 
Upon approval or partial approval of the displaced person's claim, the 
Postal Service will promptly authorize payment of the approved amount. 
The certification that the claimant has occupied decent, safe, and 
sanitary housing must be completed prior to final payment of replacement 
housing payments.
    (e) Relocation Payments Not Considered as Income. Upon approval of 
the claim and delivery of the relocation payment, the displaced person 
must be advised that no relocation payment made under these procedures 
shall be considered as income for the purpose of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954, or for the purpose of determining the eligibility or the 
extent of eligibility of any person for assistance under the Social 
Security Act or any other Federal Law.
    (f) Certification. Certification that a person is displaced will be 
provided any agency requiring such information to assist that person 
under any Federal law or program.
    (g) Advance of Funds. If the displaced person cannot arrange for the 
acquisition of a replacement property because of financial problems and 
the problems would be solved by an advance of funds, the Postal Service 
may determine the estimated amount of the actual claim and authorize an 
advance of that amount or a portion thereof. The displaced person will 
be fully informed in writing that his or her final claim will then be 
subject to adjustment. Advance payments should not be made to persons 
with a history of financial irresponsibility.
    (h) Money Owed to the Postal Service. In cases of Postal Service 
leasing the acquired property to a displaced persons, or in cases of 
advance moving cost payments, any monies due the Postal Service by the 
displaced person and not paid before the remainder of the relocation 
payments are made must be deducted from such payments and the relocation 
file so documented.
    (i) Notice of Denial of Claim. If the Postal Service disapproves all 
or part of a payment claimed, of refuses to consider the claim on its 
merits because of untimely filing or other grounds, it must promptly 
notify the claimant in writing of the determination, the basis for the 
determination, and the procedures for appealing the determination.
    (j) Appeal Procedure. If a displaced person wishes to file an 
appeal:
    (1) The appeal must be in writing.
    (2) The appeal must be directed to the General Manager, Real Estate 
Division, and must set forth the displaced person's reasons for the 
appeal. (The General Manager shall not have taken part in the decision 
which led to the appeal. Appeals misdirected to others must be forwarded 
immediately to the General Manager with notification of the forwarding 
to the appellant.)

[[Page 237]]

    (3) The appeal must be submitted within 60 days after the displaced 
person receives written notification of the Postal Service's original 
determination concerning the displacee's claim. The Postal Service may 
extend this time limit for good cause.
    (k) Right of Representation. A displaced person has a right to be 
represented by legal counsel or other representative in connection with 
his or her appeal, but solely at the person's own expense.
    (l) Review of Files by Appellant. The Postal Service must permit a 
person to inspect and copy all materials pertinent to his or her appeal, 
except materials which are confidential. Such inspection will be 
permitted as allowed under the Freedom of Information Act, 39 CFR Part 
265.
    (m) Scope of Review. In deciding an appeal, the Postal Service must 
consider all pertinent justification and other material submitted by the 
displaced person and all other available information that is needed to 
ensure a fair and full review of the appeal.
    (n) Determination and Notification After Appeal. Promptly after 
receipt of all supporting information submitted by the appellant, the 
General Manager, Real Estate Division, must make a written determination 
on the appeal, including the basis on which the decision was made, and 
furnish the appellant a copy. If the full relief requested is not 
granted at the Service Center level, the General Manager, Real Estate 
Division, must advise the person of his or her right to appeal the 
decision to the Director, Office of Real Estate. The rules stated here 
for appeals to the General Manager apply as well as to appeals to the 
Director, Office of Real Estate.

                          Subpart C_Acquisition


<R05>
Sec. 777.31  Acquisition procedures.

    (a) Policy; Application of Section. The Postal Service, as a matter 
of policy, acquires interests in real property through voluntary 
agreements with owners. Only under unusual and compelling circumstances, 
and on a case-by-case basis, does the Postal Service acquire real 
property through the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent 
domain. This policy does not, however, prevent the Postal Service from 
occasionally entering into mutually agreeable condemnation proceedings 
with an owner, where price is not an issue, and for such purposes as to 
clear title or to acquire property from certain elected officials. For 
the purposes of this section, the Postal Service does not consider such 
voluntary and mutually agreeable uses of condemnation proceedings as the 
exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain. The following 
regulations apply only to acquisitions by the exercise or the threat of 
the exercise of eminent domain:
    (1) Notice to Owner. As soon as feasible after deciding to acquire a 
specific property through the exercise of eminent domain, the Postal 
Service must notify the owner of its intent to acquire the property.
    (2) Expeditious Negotiations. The Postal Service must make every 
reasonable effort to acquire real property expeditiously by negotiation.
    (3) Appraisal and Invitation to Owner. Before the initiation of 
negotiations, the real property shall be appraised in accordance with 
Postal Service appraisal standards as outlined in RE-1 and the owner or 
the owner's designated agent shall be given an opportunity to accompany 
the appraiser during the appraiser's inspection of the property.
    (4) Establishment of Offer of Just Compensation. Prior to the 
initiation of negotiations (see Sec. 777.13(k) for definition) the 
Postal Service must establish an amount which it believes is just 
compensation for the real property rights be acquired. The amount must 
not be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value, 
including damages or benefits to the remaining property. Appraisers 
shall not give consideration to, or include in their real property 
appraisals, any allowances for the benefits provided by title II of the 
Act.
    (5) Summary Statement. Promptly after determining fair market value, 
the Postal Service shall make a written offer to acquire the property 
for the full amount believed to be just compensation. Along with the 
written

[[Page 238]]

purchase offer, the owner must be given a written statement of the basis 
for the offer of just compensation. This statement must include:
    (i) A statement of the amount offered as just compensation. In the 
case of a partial acquisition, the compensation for the real property to 
be acquired and the compensation for damages, if any, must be separately 
stated.
    (ii) The location and description of the real property and the 
interest(s) to be acquired.
    (iii) An identification of the buildings, structures, and other 
improvements (including removable building equipment and trade fixtures) 
which are considered part of the real property for which the offer of 
just compensation is made. Where appropriate, the statement shall 
identify and separately held ownership interest in the improvement(s), 
for example, a tenant-owned improvement.
    (6) Basic Negotiation Procedures. The Postal Service must make every 
reasonable effort to contact the owner or the owner's representative 
and:
    (i) Discuss the Postal Service's offer to purchase the property 
including the basis for the offer of just compensation, and;
    (ii) Explain Postal Service acquisition policies and procedures 
including the provisions for the payment of incidental expenses as 
described under Sec. 777.33.
    (7) Opportunity to Consider Offer. The owner must be given a 
reasonable opportunity to consider the Postal Service's offer, to 
present material which he or she believes is relevant to determining the 
value of the property, and to suggest modification in the proposed terms 
and conditions of the purchase. The Postal Service must consider the 
owner's presentation.
    (8) Updating Offer of Just Compensation. If the information 
presented by the owner or a material change in the character or 
condition of the property indicates the need for new appraisal 
information, or if a significant delay has occurred since the time of 
the appraisal(s) of the property, the Postal Service must have the 
appraisal(s) updated or obtain a new appraisal(s). If the latest 
appraisal information indicates that a change in the purchase offer is 
warranted, the Postal Service must promptly reestablish just 
compensation and offer the revised amount to the owner in writing.
    (9) Contracts and Options. Contracts to purchase shall cover only 
those items related to the acquisition of the property, and not 
incorporate provisions for making payments for relocation costs or 
related costs under title II of these regulations.
    (10) Title II Benefits Not To Be Considered. In the event of 
condemnation, estimated compensation shall be determined solely on the 
basis of the appraised value of the real property with no consideration 
being given to or reference contained therein to the payments to be made 
under title II.
    (11) Coercive Action. The Postal Service shall not advance the time 
of condemnation, or defer negotiations or condemnation, or the deposit 
of funds with the court, or take any other coercive action in order to 
induce an agreement on the price to be paid for the property.
    (12) Inverse Condemnation. If the Postal Service intends to acquire 
any interest in real property by exercise of the power of eminent 
domain, it must institute formal condemnation proceedings and not 
intentionally make it necessary for the owner to institute proceedings 
to prove the fact of the taking of the real property.
    (13) Payment Before Taking Possession. Before requiring the owner to 
surrender possession of the real property, the Postal Service must 
either:
    (i) Pay the agreed purchase price to the owner; or
    (ii) In the case of a condemnation proceeding, deposit with the 
court for the benefit of the owner an amount not less than the amount of 
the approved appraised value of the property or the amount of the award 
of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for the property.
    (14) Right-of-Entry. With the prior approval of the owner, the 
Postal Service may obtain a right-of-entry before making payment to the 
owner.


<R05>
Sec. 777.32  Acquisition of tenant-owned improvements.

    (a) Acquisition of Improvements. When acquiring any interest in real 
property,

[[Page 239]]

the Postal Service must acquire at least an equal interest in all 
buildings, structures, or other improvements located upon the real 
property. This must include any improvement of a tenant owner who has 
the right or obligation to remove the improvement at the expiration of 
the lease term.
    (b) Special Conditions. Payment for tenant-owned improvements will 
be made to the tenant only if he or she meets the following conditions:
    (1) In consideration for the payment the tenant-owner assigns, 
transfers, and releases to the Postal Service all of the tenant-owner's 
rights, title, and interests in the improvement;
    (2) The owner of the real property on which the improvement is 
located disclaims all interest in the improvement; and
    (3) The payment does not result in the duplication of any 
compensation otherwise authorized by law.
    (c) Preservation of Tenant's Rights. Nothing in this section shall 
be construed to deprive the tenant-owner of any rights to reject payment 
under this section and to obtain payment for such property interests in 
accordance with other applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 777.33  Expenses incidental to transfer of title to the Postal Service.

    (a) Reimbursement. When property is acquired through the exercise or 
the threat of the exercise of eminent domain, the owner shall be 
reimbursed for all reasonable expenses he or she necessarily incurred in 
conveying the real property to the Postal Service for:
    (1) Recording fees, transfer taxes, documentary stamps, evidence of 
title, boundary surveys, legal descriptions of the real property, and 
similar incidental expenses. However, the Postal Service will not pay 
costs solely required to perfect the owner's title to the real property.
    (2) Penalty costs and other charges for prepayment of any 
preexisting recorded mortgage, entered into in good faith, encumbering 
the real property.
    (3) The pro rata portion of any prepaid real property taxes which 
are allocable to the period after the Postal Service obtains title to 
the property or effective possession of it, whichever is earlier.
    (b) Direct Payment. Whenever feasible the Postal Service must pay 
these costs directly and thus avoid the need for an owner to pay such 
costs and then seek reimbursement from the Postal Service.
    (c) Certain Litigation Expenses. The owner of the real property 
acquired must be reimbursed any reasonable expenses, including 
reasonable attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees which the owner 
actually incurred because of a condemnation proceeding if:
    (1) The final judgment of the court is that the Postal Service 
cannot acquire the real property by condemnation; or
    (2) The condemnation proceeding is abandoned by the Postal Service 
other than under an agreed-upon settlement; or
    (3) The court having jurisdiction renders a judgment in favor of the 
owner in an inverse condemnation proceeding or the Postal Service 
effects a settlement of such a proceeding.


<R04>
                    Subpart D_Voluntary Acquisitions


<R05>
Sec. 777.41  Acquisition procedures.

    (a) Voluntary Acquisitions. Acquisition rules for voluntary 
purchases are set out in Handbook RE-1, Realty Acquisition and 
Management and cover such areas as appraisal and negotiation procedures.
    (b) Tenant-Owned Improvements. In general the Postal Service deals 
exclusively with the fee owner on the acquisition of all real property 
interest at the site. The Postal Service may, however, in exceptional 
cases deal directly with a tenant on a leasehold improvements matter. 
Should the Postal Service acquire the fee interest without acquiring 
rights in a leasehold improvement under circumstances in which the 
tenant would be entitled to compensation under Sec. 777.32 of this 
part, if the acquisition were by eminent domain or the under threat 
thereof, the tenant will be entitled to the benefits that would, under 
such circumstances, have been paid under Sec. 777.32 of this part, 
unless the tenant has formally disclaimed further right in the real 
property improvement beyond the time of the expiration of his or her 
tenancy.

                           Subpart E_Donations


<R05>
Sec. 777.51  Acceptance of donations.

    Nothing in these regulations shall prevent a person from making a 
gift or donation of real property or any part thereof, or any interest 
therein, or of any compensation paid therefor, to the Postal Service. 
The Postal Service may obtain an appraisal of the real property for 
income tax or other purposes if the owner thereof requests the Postal 
Service to do so.

changes in their facility action category selections.
    (d) The Postal Service uses a state's process as soon as feasible, 
after the Postal Service is notified of the state's selections.

Capital Planning Commission (NCPC). The Postal Service gives the NCPC 90 
days to comment on projects in the Maryland and Virginia portions of the 
National Capital Region.
    (b) This section also applies to comments in cases in which the

point of contact between a state process and all federal agencies, and
    (2) That office or official transmits a state process recommendation 
for a facility project action of a category selected under Sec. 778.6.
    (b)(1) The single point of contact is not obligated to transmit 
comments from state, areawide, regional or local officials and entities 
where there is no state process recommendation.

point of contact, all comments from state, areawide, regional, and local 
officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.
    (c) If a state has not established a process, or does not submit a 
state process recommendation, state, areawide, regional and local 
officials and entities may submit comments directly to the Postal 
Service.
    (d) If a facility project action is not selected for a state 
process, state, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may 
submit comments directly to the Postal Service. In addition, if a state 
process recommendation for a nonselected facility project action is 
transmitted to the Postal Service by the single point of contact, the 
Postal Service follows the procedures of Sec. 778.10.
    (e) The Postal Service considers comments which do not constitute a 
state process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for 
which the Postal Service is not required to apply the procedures of 
Sec. 778.10 when such comments are provided by a single point of 
contact or directly to the Postal Service by a commenting party.


<R05>
Sec. 778.10  How does the Postal Service make efforts to accommodate intergovernmental concerns?

    (2) Reaches a mutually agreeable solution with the state process; or
    (3) Provides the single point of contact with such written 
explanation of its decision as the Postal Service in its discretion 
deems appropriate. The Postal Service may also supplement the written 
explanation by providing the explanation to the single point of contact 
by telephone, other telecommunication, or other means.
    (b) In any explanation under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 
Postal Service informs the single point of contact that:
    (1) The Postal Service will not implement its decision for at least 
ten days after the single point of contact receives the explanation; or
    (2) The Postal Service has reviewed the decision and determined that 
because of unusual circumstances, the waiting period of at least ten 
days is not feasible.
    (c) For purposes of computing the waiting period under paragraph

received written notification 5 days after the date of mailing of such 
notification.

areawide, regional, and local officials and entities in those states 
that have not adopted a process under the Order or do not select the 
Postal Service's facility project action for review;
    (4) Responding pursuant to Sec. 778.10 if the Postal Service 
receives a recommendation from a designated areawide agency transmitted 
by a single point of contact in cases in which the review, coordination, 
and communication with the Postal Service have been delegated.
    (b) The Postal Service uses the procedures in Sec. 778.10 if a

Service through a single point of contact.

    (4) By use of his name, personal appearance, or any device, aids or 
abets an attorney to practice during the period of his suspension or 
disbarment, such suspension or disbarment being known to him;
    (5) Displays toward the Judicial Officer, Board of Contract Appeals 
or any

[[Page 255]]

Administrative Law Judge assigned to the Postal Service, conduct which, 
if displayed toward any court of any State, the United States, any of 
its Territories or the District of Columbia, would be cause for censure, 
suspension or disbarment; or
    (6) Is otherwise guilty of misconduct or lacking in character or 
professional integrity.
    (b) Before any person shall be censured, suspended or disbarred, he 
shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard by the Judicial Officer on 
the charges made against him. The General Counsel or his designee shall 
prosecute such cases.
    (c) In the event the Judicial Officer is unavailable for any reason, 
he may assign complaints of misconduct to the Associate Judicial 
Officer, an Administrative Law Judge appointed pursuant to the 
provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, an Administrative Judge 
appointed pursuant to the provisions of the Contract Disputes Act of 
1978, or some other disinterested member of the headquarters staff of

requiring formal administrative action under 39 U.S.C. 3005, he shall 
prepare and file with the Recorder a complaint which names the person 
involved; states the name, address and telephone number of the attorney 
representing Complainant; states the legal authority and jurisdiction 
under which the proceeding is initiated; states the facts in a manner 
sufficient to enable the person named therein to make answer thereto; 
and requests the issuance of an appropriate order or orders and/or the 
assessment of civil penalties. Complainant shall attach to the complaint 
a copy of the order or orders requested which may, at any time during 
the proceedings, be modified. The person named in the complaint shall be 
known as the ``Respondent'', and the Chief Postal Inspector or his or 
designee shall be known as the ``Complainant.''

The term ``person'' (1 U.S.C. 1) shall include any name, address, number 
or other designation under or by use of which the Respondent seeks 
remittances of money or property through the mail.

under 39 U.S.C. 3005, mail addressed to a respondent may be impounded 
upon obtaining an appropriate order from a U.S. District Court, as 
provided in 39 U.S.C. 3007.


<R05>
Sec. 952.7  Notice of answer and hearing.

    (a) When a complaint is filed against a Respondent whose mailing 
address is within the United States, the Recorder shall issue a notice 
of answer and hearing stating the date for filing an answer which shall 
not exceed 15 days from the service of the complaint, the time and place 
of the hearing and a reference to the effect of failure to file an 
answer or appear at the hearing. (See Sec. Sec. 952.10 and 952.11.) 
Whenever practicable, the hearing date shall be within 30 days of the 
date of the notice.
    (b) Where a complaint is filed against a Respondent whose mailing 
address is not within the United States, the Judicial Officer shall 
review the complaint and any supporting information and determine 
whether a prima facie showing has been made that Respondent is engaged 
in conduct warranting issuance of the orders authorized by 39 U.S.C. 
3005(a) and/or the assessment of civil penalties authorized by 39 U.S.C. 
3012. Where he concludes that a prima facie showing has not been made he 
shall dismiss the complaint. Where he concludes that a prima facie 
showing has been made, he shall issue a tentative decision and orders 
which: set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law; direct 
Respondent to cease and desist from engaging in conduct warranting the 
issuance of an order authorized by 39 U.S.C. 3005(a); direct that postal 
money orders drawn to the order of Respondent not be paid for 45

[[Page 257]]

days from date of the tentative decision; direct that mail addressed to 
Respondent be forwarded to designated facilities and detained for 45 
days from the date of the tentative decision subject to survey by 
Respondent and release of mail unrelated to the matter complained of; 
tentatively assess such civil penalties as he considers appropriate 
under applicable law; and provide that unless Respondent presents, 
within 45 days of the date of the tentative decision, good cause for 
dismissing the complaint, or modifying the tentative decision and 
orders, the tentative decision and orders shall become final. The 
Judicial Officer may, upon a showing of good cause made within 45 days 
of the date of the tentative decision, hold a hearing to determine 
whether the tentative decision and orders should be revoked, modified or 
allowed to become final. Should a hearing be granted, the Judicial 
Officer may modify the tentative decision and orders to extend the time 
during which the payment of postal money orders payable to Respondent is 
suspended and mail addressed to Respondent is detained.

of address of the Respondent or to the inspector in charge of any 
division in which the Respondent is doing business, which shall be 
delivered to the Respondent or his agent by said postmaster or a 
supervisory employee of his post office or a postal inspector. A receipt 
acknowledging delivery of the notice shall be secured from the 
Respondent or his agent and forwarded to the Recorder, U.S. Postal 
Service, 2101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201-3078, to 
become a part of the official record.
    (b) If, after 5 days, the postmaster or his agent can find no person 
to accept service of the notice of answer and hearing and complaint 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the notice may be delivered 
in the usual manner as other mail addressed to the respondent. A 
statement, showing the time and place of delivery, signed by the postal 
employee who delivered the notice of answer and hearing and complaint 
shall be forwarded to the Recorder and such statement shall constitute 
evidence of service.
    (c) Where the only address against which Complainant seeks relief is 
outside the United States, a copy of the complaint, the tentative 
decision, and a copy of these rules of practice shall be sent by 
registered air mail, return receipt requested, by the Recorder to the 
address cited in the complaint. A written statement by the Recorder 
noting the time and place of mailing shall be accepted as evidence of 
service in the event a signed return receipt is not returned to the 
Recorder.

express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all 
respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendments as 
may be necessary to make the pleadings conform to the evidence and to 
raise such issues shall be allowed at any time upon the motion of any 
party.
    (d) If a party objects to the introduction of evidence at the 
hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the

of the pleadings would prejudice him on the merits, the presiding 
officer may allow the pleadings to be amended and may grant a 
continuance to enable the objecting party to rebut the evidence 
presented.

terms as are just, permit service of a supplemental pleading setting

    (2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and 
general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any records 
sought.
    (3) The presiding officer, in his discretion, may honor requests for 
subpoenas not made within the time limitations specified in this 
paragraph.
    (d) Requests to quash or modify. Upon written request by the person 
subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any 
event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, 
the presiding officer may:
    (1) Quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and 
oppressive or for other good cause shown, or
    (2) require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to 
advance the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed records. Where 
circumstances require, the presiding officer may act upon such a request 
at any time after a copy has been served upon the opposing party.
    (e) Form; issuance. (1) Every subpoena shall state the title of the 
proceeding, shall cite 39 U.S.C. 3016(a)(2) as the authority under which 
it is issued, and shall command each person to whom it is directed to 
attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to produce specified 
records at a time and place therein specified. In issuing a subpoena to 
a requesting party, the presiding officer shall sign the subpoena and 
may, in his discretion, enter the name of the witness and otherwise 
leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall complete 
the subpoena before service.
    (2) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be 
responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of 
the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such 
charges on demand may be deemed by the presiding officer as sufficient 
ground for striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the 
witness has produced.
    (f) Service--(1) In general. The party requesting issuance of a 
subpoena shall arrange for service.
    (2) Service within the United States. A subpoena issued under this 
section may be served by a person designated under 18 U.S.C. 3061 or by 
a United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is 
not a party and not less than 18 years of age at any place within the 
territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.
    (3) Foreign Service. Any such subpoena may be served upon any person 
who is not to be found within the territorial

[[Page 261]]

jurisdiction of any court of the United States, in such manner as the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe for service in a foreign 
country. To the extent that the courts of the United States may assert 
jurisdiction over such person consistent with due process, the United 
States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same 
jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance with this section 
by such person that such court would have if such person were personally 
within the jurisdiction of such court.
    (4) Service on Business Persons. Service of any such subpoena may be 
made upon a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity 
by:
    (i) Delivering a duly executed copy thereof to any partner, 
executive officer, managing agent, or general agent thereof, or to any 
agent thereof authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of 
process on behalf of such partnership, corporation, association, or 
entity;
    (ii) Delivering a duly executed copy thereof to the principal office 
or place of business of the partnership, corporation, association, or 
entity; or
    (iii) Depositing such copy in the United States mails, by registered 
or certified mail, return receipt requested, duly addressed to such 
partnership, corporation, association, or entity at its principal office 
or place of business.
    (5) Service on Natural Persons. Service of any subpoena may be made 
upon any natural person by:
    (i) delivering a duly executed copy to the person to be served; or
    (ii) depositing such copy in the United States mails, by registered 
or certified mail, return receipt requested, duly addressed to such 
person at his residence or principal office or place of business.
    (6) Verified Return. A verified return by the individual serving any 
such subpoena setting forth the manner of such service shall be proof of 
service. In the case of service by registered or certified mail, such 
return shall be accompanied by the return post office receipt of 
delivery of such subpoena.
    (g) Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena. In the case of 
contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Judicial Officer may 
request the Attorney General to petition the district court for any 
district in which the person receiving the subpoena resides, is found, 
or conducts business (or in the case of a person outside the territorial 
jurisdiction of any district court, the district court for the District 
of Columbia) to issue an appropriate order for the enforcement of such 
subpoena. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punishable 
as contempt.

Sec. 952.20  Witness fees.

    The Postal Service does not pay fees and expenses for respondent's 
witnesses or for depositions requested by respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 952.21  Depositions, interrogatories, requests for admission of fact

and production of documents.

    (a) Not later than 5 days after the filing of Respondent's answer, 
any party may file application with the Recorder for the taking of 
testimony by deposition. In support of such application the applicant 
shall submit under oath or affirmation a statement setting out the 
reasons why such testimony should be taken by deposition, the time and 
the place, and the name and address of the witness whose deposition is 
desired, the subject matter of the testimony of each witness and its 
relevancy.
    (b) If the application is granted, the order for the taking of the 
deposition will specify the time and place thereof, the name of the 
witness, and require that the deposition be taken before a person 
authorized to administer oaths as required by paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (c) Each witness testifying upon deposition shall be duly sworn, and 
the adverse party shall have the right to cross-examine. The questions 
and answers together with all objections, shall be reduced to writing 
and, unless waived by stipulation of the parties, shall be read to and 
subscribed by the witness in the presence of the deposition officer who 
shall certify it in the usual form. The deposition officer shall file 
the testimony taken by deposition as directed in the order. The 
deposition officer shall put the witness on oath.

[[Page 262]]

All objections made at the time of examination shall be noted by the 
deposition officer and the evidence objected to shall be taken subject 
to the objections. In lieu of participating in the oral examination, a 
party may transmit written interrogatories to the officer, who shall 
propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim. Objections 
to relevancy or materiality of testimony, or to errors and 
irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking 
the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or 
affirmation, or in the conduct of the parties and errors of any kind 
which might be obviated, cured or removed if promptly presented, are 
waived unless timely objection is made at the taking of the deposition.
    (d) At the hearing any part or all of the deposition may be offered 
in evidence by any party who was present or represented at the taking of 
the deposition or who had notice thereof. If the deposition is not 
offered and received in evidence, it shall not be considered as a part 
of the record in the proceeding. The admissibility of depositions or 
parts thereof shall be governed by the rules of evidence.
    (e) The party requesting the deposition shall pay all fees required 
to be paid to witnesses and the deposition officer, and shall provide an 
original and one copy of the deposition for the official record, and 
shall serve one copy upon the opposing party.
    (f) Within the United States or within a territory or insular 
possession, subject to the dominion of the United States, depositions or 
interrogatories may be taken or certified before an officer authorized 
to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place 
where the examination is held; within a foreign country, depositions or 
interrogatories may be taken or certified before a secretary of an 
embassy or legation, consul general, vice consul or consular agent of 
the United States, or any other person designated in the order for the 
taking of a deposition.
    (g) Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written 
interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by 
oral examination. When a deposition is taken upon written 
interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, none of the parties except a 
witness who is a party shall be present or represented, and no person, 
other than the witness, a stenographic reporter, and the officer shall 
be present at the examination of the witness, which fact shall be 
certified by the officer, who shall propound the interrogatories and 
cross-interrogatories to the witness in their order and reduce the 
testimony to writing in the witness' own words. For good cause shown or 
by stipulation of the parties, written interrogatories and cross-
interrogatories propounding questions of fact may be answered by the 
witness in writing, without the presence of an officer and without being 
recorded by a stenographic reporter, provided the answers are sworn to 
by the witness before a person authorized to administer an oath 
prescribed by paragraph (f).
    (h) Not later than 5 days after the filing of Respondent's answer, 
any party may serve on the other party a request for the admission of 
specified facts. In the event the party served refuses timely to respond 
to the request for admissions, the presiding officer for good cause 
shown may require the party served to admit or deny each requested fact. 
The factual propositions set out in the request shall be deemed admitted 
upon the failure of a party to respond to the presiding officer's order 
for admission or denial.
    (i) Not later than 5 days after the filing of Respondent's answer, 
either party may file an application for the production of documents or 
objects. The application shall state the cause therefor and specifically 
identify the documents or objects and their relevance and materiality to 
the cause or causes in issue. The presiding officer may order the other 
party to produce and permit the inspection and photographing of any 
designated documents or objects not privileged which are reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. If the 
parties cannot themselves agree thereon, the presiding officer shall 
specify such terms and conditions in making the inspection and taking 
the copies and photographs.

[[Page 263]]

    (j) Failure of a party to comply with an order pursuant to this rule 
may result in the presiding officer's ruling that the disobedient party 
may not support or oppose designated charges or defenses or may not 
introduce designated matters in evidence. The presiding officer may also 
infer from the disobedient party's failure to comply with the order that 
the facts to which the order related would, if produced or admitted, be 
adverse to such party's interests. The admissibility of matter adduced 
by operation of Sec. 952.21 shall be governed by Sec. 952.18.

Sec. 952.22  Transcript.

    (a) Hearings shall be stenographically reported by a contract 
reporter of the Postal Service under the supervision of the assigned 
presiding officer. Argument upon any matter may be excluded from the 
transcript by order of the presiding officer. A copy of the transcript 
shall be a part of the record and the sole official transcript of the 
proceeding. Copies of the transcript shall be supplied to the parties to 
the proceeding by the reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates 
fixed by contract between the Postal Service and the reporter. Copies of 
parts of the official record including exhibits admitted into evidence, 
other than the transcript, may be obtained by the Respondent from the 
Recorder upon the payment of reasonable copying charges. Items that 
cannot reasonably be photocopied may be photographed and furnished in 
that form to Respondent.
    (b) Changes in the official transcript may be made only when they 
involve errors affecting substance and then only in the manner herein 
provided. No physical changes shall be made in or upon the official 
transcript, or copies thereof, which have been filed with the record. 
Within 10 days after the receipt by any party of a copy of the official 
transcript, or any part thereof, he may file a motion requesting 
correction of the transcript. Opposing counsel shall, within such time 
as may be specified by the presiding officer, notify the presiding 
officer in writing of his concurrence or disagreement with the requested 
corrections. Failure to interpose timely objection to a proposed 
correction shall be considered to be concurrence. Thereafter, the 
presiding officer shall by order specify the corrections to be made in 
the transcript. The presiding officer on his own initiative may order 
corrections to be made in the transcript with prompt notice to the 
parties of the proceeding. Any changes ordered by the presiding officer 
other than by agreement of the parties shall be subject to objection and 
exception.

conclusions of law, orders and supporting reasons shall be the same for 
both parties. If not submitted by such date, or unless extension of time 
for the filing thereof is granted, they will not be included in the 
record or given consideration.
    (b) Except when presented orally before the close of the hearing, 
proposed findings of fact shall be set forth in serially numbered 
paragraphs and shall state with particularity all evidentiary facts in 
the record with appropriate citations to the transcript or exhibits 
supporting the proposed findings. Each

[[Page 264]]

    (3) Direct that postal money orders drawn to the order of Respondent 
not be paid for 45 days from date of the tentative decision;
    (4) Direct that mail addressed to Respondent be forwarded to 
designated facilities and detained for 45 days from the date of the 
tentative decision subject to survey by Respondent and release of mail 
unrelated to the matter complained of;
    (5) Tentatively assess such civil penalties as he considers 
appropriate under applicable law; and
    (6) Provide that unless Respondent presents, within 45 days of the 
date of the tentative decision, good cause for dismissing the complaint, 
or modifying the tentative decision and orders, the tentative decision 
and orders shall become final.
    (c) The Judicial Officer may, upon a showing of good cause made 
within 45 days of the date of the tentative decision, hold a hearing to 
determine whether the tentative decision and orders should be revoked, 
modified, or allowed to become final. Should a hearing be granted, the 
Judicial Officer may modify the tentative decision and orders to extend 
the time during which the payment of postal money orders payable to 
Respondent is suspended and mail addressed to Respondent is detained.

Sec. 952.8  Service.

    (a) Where Respondent's mailing address is within the United States, 
the Recorder shall cause a notice of docketing and answer due date (the 
``Notice''), a copy of these rules of practice, and a copy of the

outside the United States, a copy of the complaint, the tentative 
decision, and a copy of these rules of practice shall be sent by

<R05>
Sec. 952.11  Default.

    (a) If Respondent fails to file an answer within the time specified 
in the notice of docketing and answer, Respondent may be deemed in 
default, and to have waived hearing and further procedural steps. The 
Judicial Officer may thereafter issue orders and/or assess civil 
penalties without further notice.
    (b) If Respondent files an answer but fails to appear at the 
hearing, Respondent may, unless timely indications to the contrary are

to the charges of the complaint, and the Judicial Officer, without 
further notice to Respondent, may issue the orders and/or assess civil 
penalties sought in the complaint.
    (c) If Respondent or Complainant fails to respond to or comply with 
an order of the presiding officer, the party may be held in default, and 
absent good cause shown, the party may be deemed to have abandoned the 
intention to present a defense, or to prosecute the complaint, and the 
presiding officer or Judicial Officer, without further notice to the 
offending party, may, as appropriate, dismiss the complaint or issue the 
orders and/or assess civil penalties sought in the complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 952.12  Amendment of pleadings.

    (a) Amendments shall be filed with the Recorder.
    (b) By consent of the parties, a pleading may be amended at any

presiding officer rule on the motion as he or she deems to be fair and 
equitable to the parties.
    (c) When issues not raised by the pleadings but reasonably within 
the scope of the proceedings initiated by the complaint are tried by 
express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all 
respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendments as 
may be necessary to conform the pleadings to the evidence and to raise 
such issues may be allowed at any time upon the motion of any party.
    (d) If a party objects to the introduction of evidence at the 
hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the 
pleadings, but fails to satisfy the presiding officer that an amendment 
of the pleadings would prejudice him or her on the merits, the presiding 
officer may allow the pleadings to be amended and may grant a 
continuance to enable the objecting party to rebut the evidence 
presented.
    (e) The presiding officer may, upon reasonable notice and upon such 
terms as are just, permit service of a supplemental pleading setting

the matters in question.
    (h) A party which objects to the admission of evidence shall explain 
the grounds for the objection. Formal exceptions to the rulings of the 
presiding officer are unnecessary.


<R05>
Sec. 952.19  Subpoenas.

    (a) General. Upon written request of either party filed with the 
Recorder or on his or her own initiative, the presiding officer may 
issue a subpoena requiring:
    (1) Testimony at a deposition. The deposing of a witness in the city 
or county where the witness resides or is employed or transacts business 
in person, or at another location convenient for the witness that is 
specifically determined by the presiding officer;

[[Page 270]]

    (2) Testimony at a hearing. The attendance of a witness for the 
purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and
    (3) Production of records. The production by the witness at a 
deposition or hearing of records designated in the subpoena.
    (b) Voluntary cooperation. Each party is expected:
    (1) To cooperate and make available witnesses and evidence under its 
possession, custody or control as requested by the other party, without 
issuance of a subpoena, and
    (2) To secure voluntary production of desired third-party records 
whenever possible.
    (c) Requests for subpoenas. (1) A request for a subpoena shall to 
the extent practical be filed:
    (i) At the same time a request for deposition is filed; or
    (ii) Fifteen (15) days before a scheduled hearing where the 
attendance of a witness at a hearing is sought.
    (2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and 
relevance to the case of the testimony and of any records sought.
    (3) The presiding officer, in his or her sole discretion, may honor 
requests for subpoenas not presented within the time limitations 
specified in this paragraph.
    (d) Motion to quash or modify. (1) Upon written request by the 
person subpoenaed or by a party, the presiding officer may:
    (i) Quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable, oppressive 
or for other good cause shown, or
    (ii) Require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to 
advance the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed records. Where 
circumstances require, the presiding officer may act upon such a request 
at any time after a copy has been served upon the opposing party.
    (2) Motions to quash or modify a subpoena shall be filed within 10 
days of service, or at least one day prior to any scheduled hearing, 
whichever first occurs. The presiding officer, in his or her sole 
discretion, may entertain motions to quash or modify not made within the 
time limitations specified in this paragraph.
    (e) Form; issuance. (1) Every subpoena shall state the title of the 
proceeding, shall cite 39 U.S.C. 3016(a)(2) as the authority under which 
it is issued, and shall command each person to whom it is directed to 
attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to produce specified 
records at a time and place therein specified. In issuing a subpoena to 
a requesting party, the presiding officer shall sign the subpoena and 
may, in his or her discretion, enter the name of the witness and 
otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall 
complete the subpoena before service.
    (2) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be 
responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness in 
accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821, or other applicable law, and of the 
officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such 
charges on demand may be deemed by the presiding officer as sufficient 
ground for striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the 
witness has produced.
    (f)(1) Service in general. The party requesting issuance of a 
subpoena shall arrange for service.
    (2) Service within the United States. A subpoena issued under this 
section may be served by a person designated under 18 U.S.C. 3061 or by 
a United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is 
not a party and not less than 18 years of age at any place within the 
territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.
    (3) Service outside the United States. Any such subpoena may be 
served upon any person who is not to be found within the territorial 
jurisdiction of any court of the United States, in such manner as the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe for service in a foreign 
country. To the extent that the courts of the United States may assert 
jurisdiction over such person consistent with due process, the United 
States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same 
jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance with this section 
by such person that such court would have if such person were personally 
within the jurisdiction of such court.
    (4) Service on business persons. Service of any such subpoena may be 
made upon a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity 
by:
    (i) Delivering a duly executed copy thereof to any partner, 
executive officer, managing agent, or general agent thereof, or to any 
agent thereof authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of 
process on behalf of such partnership, corporation, association, or 
entity;
    (ii) Delivering a duly executed copy thereof to the principal office 
or place of business of the partnership, corporation, association, or 
entity; or
    (iii) Depositing such copy in the United States mails, by registered 
or certified mail, return receipt requested, duly addressed to such 
partnership, corporation, association, or entity at its principal office 
or place of business.
    (5) Service on natural persons. Service of any subpoena may be made 
upon any natural person by:
    (i) Delivering a duly executed copy to the person to be served; or
    (ii) Depositing such copy in the United States mails, by registered 
or certified mail, return receipt requested, duly addressed to such 
person at his or her residence or principal office or place of business.
    (6) Verified return. A verified return by the individual serving any 
such subpoena setting

[[Page 271]]

forth the manner of such service shall constitute proof of service. In 
the case of service by registered or certified mail, such return shall 
be accompanied by the return post office receipt of delivery of such 
subpoena, or a statement of service by registered or certified mail in 
the event that receipt of delivery is unavailable.
    (g) Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena. In the case of refusal 
to obey a subpoena, the Judicial Officer may request the Attorney 
General to petition the district court for any district in which the 
person receiving the subpoena resides, is found, or conducts business 
(or in the case of a person outside the territorial jurisdiction of any 
district court, the district court for the District of Columbia) to 
issue an appropriate order for the enforcement of such subpoena. Any 
failure to obey such order of the court may be punishable as contempt.


<R05>
Sec. 952.20  Witness fees.

    The Postal Service does not pay fees and expenses for Respondent's 
witnesses or for depositions requested by Respondent, unless otherwise 
ordered by the presiding officer.


<R05>
Sec. 952.21  Discovery.

    (a) Voluntary discovery. The parties are encouraged to engage in 
voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any deposition or 
other discovery procedure, the presiding officer may issue any order 
which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, and those orders 
may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for 
discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential 
information or documents.
    (b) Discovery disputes. The parties are required to make a good 
faith effort to resolve objections to discovery requests informally. A 
party receiving an objection to a discovery request, or a party which 
believes that another party's response to a discovery request is 
incomplete or entirely absent, may file a motion to compel a response, 
but such a motion must include a representation that the moving party 
has tried in good faith, prior to filing the motion, to resolve the 
matter informally. The motion to compel shall include a copy of each 
discovery request at issue and the response, if any.
    (c) Discovery limitations. The presiding officer may limit the 
frequency or extent of use of discovery methods described in these 
rules. In doing so, generally the presiding officer will consider 
whether:
    (1) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, 
or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less 
burdensome, or less expensive;
    (2) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by 
discovery in the case to obtain the information sought; or
    (3) The discovery is unduly burdensome and expensive, taking into 
account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, limitations on 
the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake.
    (d) Interrogatories. At any time after service of the complaint, a 
party may serve on the other party written interrogatories to be 
answered separately in writing, signed under oath and returned within 30 
days. Upon timely objection, the presiding officer will determine the 
extent to which the interrogatories will be permitted.
    (e) Requests for admission. At any time after service of the 
complaint, a party may serve upon the other party a request for the 
admission of specified facts. Within 30 days after service, the party 
served shall answer each requested fact or file objections thereto. The 
factual propositions set out in the request may be ordered by the 
presiding officer as deemed admitted upon the failure of a party to 
respond timely and fully to the request for admissions.
    (f) Requests for production of documents. At any time after service 
of the complaint, a party may serve on the other party written requests 
for the production, inspection, and copying of any documents, 
electronically stored information, or things, to be answered within 30 
days. Upon timely objection, the presiding officer will determine the 
extent to which the requests must be satisfied, and if the parties 
cannot themselves agree thereon, the presiding officer shall specify 
just terms and conditions for compliance.
    (g) Depositions. Except as stated herein, depositions shall be 
conducted in accordance with Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.
    (1) After a complaint has been filed and docketed, the parties may 
mutually agree to, or the presiding officer may, upon application of 
either party and for good cause shown, order the taking of testimony of 
any person by deposition upon oral examination or written 
interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the 
place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. 
The application for order shall specify whether the purpose of the 
deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
    (2) The time, place, and manner of conducting depositions shall be 
as mutually agreed by the parties or, failing such agreement, and upon 
proper application, governed by order of the presiding officer.
    (3) No testimony taken by deposition shall be considered as part of 
the evidence in the hearing of an appeal unless and until such testimony 
is offered and received in evidence at or before such hearing. It will 
not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is available to 
testify at the hearing,

[[Page 272]]

but the presiding officer may admit testimony taken by deposition in his 
or her discretion. A deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the 
testimony of the witness given at the hearing. In cases submitted on the 
written record in lieu of an oral hearing, the presiding officer may, in 
his or her discretion, receive depositions as evidence in 
supplementation of that record.
    (4) Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with the 
taking of any deposition unless otherwise ordered by the presiding 
officer.
    (h) Sanctions. If a party fails to appear for a deposition, after 
being served with a proper notice, or fails to serve answers or 
objections to interrogatories, requests for admissions, or requests for 
the production or inspection of documents, after proper service, the 
party seeking discovery may request that the presiding officer impose 
appropriate orders. Failure of a party to comply with an order pursuant 
to this rule may result in the presiding officer's ruling that the 
disobedient party may not support or oppose designated charges or 
defenses or may not introduce designated matters in evidence. The 
presiding officer may also infer from the disobedient party's failure to 
comply with the order that the facts to which the order related would, 
if produced or admitted, be adverse to such party's interests. In the 
sole discretion of the presiding officer, failure of a party to comply 
with an order pursuant to this rule may result in the presiding 
officer's issuance of an order of default under Sec. 952.11(c).


<R05>
Sec. 952.22  Transcript.

    (a) Hearings shall be reported and transcribed by a court reporter. 
Argument upon any matter may be excluded from the transcript by order of 
the presiding officer. A copy of the transcript shall be a part of the 
record and the sole official transcript of the proceeding. Copies of the 
transcript shall be supplied to the parties to the proceeding by the 
reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by contract 
between the Postal Service and the reporter. Copies of parts of the 
official record including exhibits admitted into evidence, other than 
the transcript, may be obtained by Respondent from the Recorder upon the 
payment of reasonable copying charges. Items that cannot reasonably be 
photocopied may be photographed and furnished in that form.
    (b) Changes in the official transcript may be ordered by the 
presiding officer only to correct errors affecting substance and then 
only in the manner herein provided. Within 10 days after the receipt by 
any party of a copy of the official transcript, or any part thereof, he 
or she may file a motion requesting correction of the transcript. 
Opposing counsel shall, within such time as may be specified by the 
presiding officer, notify the presiding officer in writing of his or her 
concurrence or disagreement with the requested corrections. Failure to 
interpose timely objection to a proposed correction shall be considered 
to be concurrence. Thereafter, the presiding officer shall by order 
specify the corrections to be made in the transcript. The presiding 
officer on his or her own initiative may order corrections to be made in 
the transcript with prompt notice to the parties of the proceeding. Any 
changes ordered by the presiding officer other than by agreement of the 
parties shall be subject to objection and exception.


<R05>
Sec. 952.23  Proposed findings and conclusions.

    (a) Each party to a proceeding, except one who fails to answer the 
complaint or, having answered, either fails to appear at the hearing or 
indicates in the answer that he or she does not desire to appear, may, 
unless at the discretion of the presiding officer such is not 
appropriate, submit proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, 
orders and supporting reasons either in oral or written form in the 
discretion of the presiding officer. The presiding officer may also 
require parties to any proceeding to submit proposed findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, orders, and supporting reasons. Unless given orally, 
the date set for filing of proposed findings of fact, conclusions of 
law, orders and supporting reasons shall be within 30 days after the 
delivery of the official transcript to the Recorder who shall notify 
both parties of the date of its receipt. The filing date for proposed 
findings of fact, conclusions of law, orders and supporting reasons 
shall be the same for both parties. If not submitted by such date, or 
unless extension of time for the filing thereof is granted, they will 
not be included in the record or given consideration.
    (b) Except when presented orally before the close of the hearing, 
proposed findings of fact shall be set forth in serially numbered 
paragraphs and shall state with particularity all evidentiary facts in 
the record with appropriate citations to the transcript or exhibits 
supporting the proposed findings. Each proposed conclusion shall be 
separately stated.
    (c) Except when presented orally before the close of the hearing, 
proposed orders shall state the statutory basis of the order and, with 
respect to orders proposed to be issued pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 
3005(a)(3), shall be set forth in serially numbered paragraphs stating 
with particularity the representations Respondent and its representative 
shall cease and desist from using for the purpose of obtaining money or 
property through the mail.


<R05>
Sec. 952.24  Decisions.

    (a) Initial decision by Administrative Law Judge. A written initial

practical after completion of the

[[Page 273]]

hearing, or after close of the record in matters heard upon the written 
record in lieu of an oral hearing under Sec. 952.17(b)(10). The initial 
decision shall include findings and conclusions with the reasons 
therefor upon all the material issues of fact or law presented on the 
record, and the appropriate orders or denial thereof. The initial 
decision shall become the final agency decision unless an appeal is 
taken in accordance with Sec. 952.25.
    (b) Tentative or final decision by the Judicial Officer. When the 
Judicial Officer presides at the hearing he or she shall issue a final 
or a tentative decision. Such decision shall include findings and 
conclusions with the reasons therefor upon all the material issues of 
fact or law presented on the record, and the appropriate orders or 
denial thereof. The tentative decision shall become the final agency 
decision unless exceptions are filed in accordance with Sec. 952.25.
    (c) Oral decisions. The presiding officer may render an oral 
decision (an initial decision by an Administrative Law Judge, or a 
tentative or final decision by the Judicial Officer) at the close of the 
hearing when the nature of the case and the public interest warrant. A 
party which desires an oral decision shall notify the presiding officer 
and the opposing party at least 5 days prior to the date set for the 
hearing. Either party may submit proposed findings, conclusions, and 
proposed orders either orally or in writing at the conclusion of the 
hearing.

on appeal within 15 days from the receipt of the Administrative Law 
Judge's initial decision.
    (b) A party in a proceeding presided over by the Judicial Officer 
may file exceptions within 15 days from the receipt of the Judicial 
Officer's tentative decision.
    (c) If an initial or tentative decision is rendered orally by the 
presiding officer at the close of the hearing, he or she may then orally 
provide notice to the parties participating in the hearing of the time 
limit within which an appeal must be filed.
    (d) The date for filing the reply to an appeal brief or to a brief 
in support of exceptions to a tentative decision by the Judicial Officer 
is 10 days after the receipt thereof. No additional briefs shall be 
received unless requested by the Judicial Officer.
    (e) Briefs upon appeal or in support of exceptions to a tentative 
decision by the Judicial Officer and replies thereto shall be filed in 
duplicate with the Recorder and contain the following matter:
    (1) A subject index of the matters presented, with page references; 
a table of cases alphabetically arranged; a list of statutes and texts 
cited with page references;
    (2) A concise abstract or statement of the case in briefs on appeal 
or in support of exceptions;
    (3) Numbered exceptions to specific findings and conclusions of 
fact, conclusions of law, or recommended orders of the presiding officer 
in briefs on appeal or in support of exceptions; and
    (4) A concise argument clearly setting forth points of fact and of 
law relied upon in support of or in opposition to each exception taken, 
together with specific references to the parts of the record and the 
legal or other authorities relied upon.
    (f) Unless permission is granted by the Judicial Officer no brief 
shall exceed 50 printed pages double spaced, using 12 point type.
    (g) The Judicial Officer will extend the time to file briefs only 
upon written application for good cause shown. If the appeal brief or 
brief in support of exceptions is not filed within the time prescribed, 
the defaulting party may be deemed to have abandoned the appeal or 
waived the exceptions, and the initial or tentative decision shall 
become the final agency decision.


<R05>
Sec. 952.26  Judicial Officer.

    (a) The Judicial Officer is authorized:
    (1) To act as presiding officer;
    (2) To render tentative decisions;
    (3) To render final agency decisions;
    (4) To issue Postal Service orders for the Postmaster General;
    (5) To refer the record in any proceeding to the Postmaster General 
or the Deputy Postmaster General for final agency decision;
    (6) To remand a case to the presiding officer for consideration; 
and,
    (7) To revise or amend these rules of practice.
    (b) In determining appeals from initial decisions or exceptions to 
tentative decisions, the entire official record will be considered 
before a final agency decision is rendered. Before rendering a final 
agency decision, the Judicial Officer may order the hearing reopened for 
the presentation of additional evidence by the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 952.27  Motion for reconsideration.

    A party may file a motion for reconsideration of a final agency

of law relied upon in support of said motion.


<R05>

to be published in the Postal Bulletin and cause the order to be 
transmitted to such postmasters and other officers and employees of the 
Postal Service as may be required to place the order into effect.
    (b) If an order is issued which requires Respondent to cease and 
desist from using certain representations for the purpose of obtaining 
money or property through the mail, it shall be incorporated in the 
record of the proceeding and a copy thereof shall be served upon 
Respondent or his or her or its agent by certified mail or by personal 
service, or if no person can be found to accept service, service shall 
be accomplished by ordinary mail to the last known address of Respondent 
or his or her or its agent. If service is not accomplished by certified 
mail, a statement, showing the time and place of delivery, signed by the 
postal employee who delivered the order, shall be forwarded to the

<R05>
Sec. 952.29  Modification or revocation of orders.

    A party against which an order or orders have been issued may file 
an application for modification or revocation thereof. The Recorder

or his or her designee, who shall file a written reply within 10 days 
after filing or such other period as the Judicial Officer may order. A 
copy of the reply shall be sent to the applicant by the Recorder. 
Thereafter an order granting or denying such application will be issued 
by the Judicial Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 952.30  Supplemental orders.

    When the Chief Postal Inspector or his or her designee, or the Chief 
Postal Inspector's designated representative shall have reason to 
believe that a person is evading or attempting to evade the provisions 
of any such orders by conducting the same or a similar enterprise under 
a different name or at a different address, he or she may file a 
petition with accompanying evidence setting forth the alleged evasion or 
attempted evasion and requesting the issuance of a supplemental order or 
orders against the name or names allegedly used. Notice shall then be 
given by the Recorder to the person that the order has been requested 
and that an answer may be filed within 10 days of the notice. The 
Judicial Officer, for good cause shown, may hold a hearing to consider 
the issues in controversy, and shall, in any event, render a final 
decision granting or denying the supplemental order or orders.


<R05>
Sec. 952.31  Computation of time.

    A designated period of time under these rules excludes the day the 
period begins, and includes the last day of the period unless the last

U.S. Postal Service pursuant to authority delegated by the Postmaster 
General.


<R05>

appeal with the Recorder, Judicial Officer Department, U.S. Postal 
Service, 2101 Wilson

and every reason why the appellant believes the determination or ruling 
should be reversed;
    (e) Indicate whether the appellant desires to have an oral hearing 
or, instead, to have the case decided solely on the basis of the written 
record (i.e., the appeal, the General Counsel's or Chief Postal 
Inspector's or his or her designee's reply reply, and any documents 
submitted by the parties pursuant to an order of the presiding officer);

to bind the organization.

[59 FR 31538, June 20, 1994, as amended at 71 FR 53972, Sept. 13, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 953.4  Service of notice; Reply; Motion for summary judgment.

    (a) Service of notice. (1) Upon receiving the appeal, the Recorder 
shall issue a notice specifying that the Postal Service General 
Counsel's or Chief Postal Inspector's or his or her designee's reply 
shall be filed within 15 days of receipt of the notice; and the time and 
place of the hearing (if one was requested).
    (2) The Recorder shall promptly serve this notice on the parties as 
follows:
    (i) The notice, with a copy of the appeal, shall be sent to the 
General Counsel or the Chief Postal Inspector or his or her designee at 
Postal Service headquarters.
    (ii) When the appellant's address is within the United States, the 
notice, with a copy of the appeal, shall be sent to the postmaster at 
the office that delivers mail to the appellant's address. The postmaster 
shall be instructed that, acting personally or through a supervisory 
employee or a postal inspector, he or she is to serve these documents on 
the appellant. If the appellant cannot be found within 3 days, the 
postmaster shall send these documents to the appellant by ordinary mail 
and forward a statement to the Recorder that is signed by the delivering 
employee and that specifies the time and place of delivery.
    (iii) When the appellant's address is outside the United States, the 
notice, with a copy of the appeal, shall be sent to the appellant by 
registered airmail, return receipt requested. A written statement by the 
Recorder, noting the time and place of mailing, shall be accepted as 
proof of service in the event a signed and dated return receipt is not 
received.
    (b) Reply. The General Counsel or the Chief Postal Inspector or his 
or her designee shall file a written reply, in triplicate, with the 
Recorder, within the aforementioned 15-day period or any extension 
granted by the presiding officer for good cause shown. If the General 
Counsel's or the Chief Postal Inspector's or his or her designee's reply 
fails to address any allegation in the appeal, that allegation shall be 
deemed admitted.
    (c) Motion for summary judgment. Upon motion of either the General 
Counsel, the Chief Postal Inspector, or his or her designee, or the 
appellant, or on the presiding officer's own initiative, the presiding 
officer may find that the appeal and answer present no genuine and 
material issues of fact requiring an evidentiary hearing, and thereupon 
may render an initial decision upholding or reversing the determination 
or ruling. The initial decision

[[Page 276]]

shall become the final Agency decision if a timely appeal is not taken.

[59 FR 31538, June 20, 1994, as amended at 71 FR 53972, Sept. 13, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 953.5  Hearings.

    (a) In general, admissibility of evidence at hearings conducted 
under this part hinges on relevancy and materiality. However, relevant 
evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially 
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, or by considerations of 
undue delay, or by needless presentation of cumulative evidence. 
Testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation, and witnesses are 
subject to cross-examination. Stipulations of fact are encouraged and 
may be received in evidence.
    (b) Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence shall be in 
short form, stating the grounds of objections relied upon. The 
transcript shall not include argument or debate thereon except as 
ordered by the presiding officer. Rulings on such objections shall be a 
part of the transcript.
    (c) Formal exceptions to the rulings of the presiding officer made 
during the course of the hearing are unnecessary. For all purposes for 
which an exception otherwise would be taken, it is sufficient that a 
party, when the ruling of the presiding officer is made or sought, makes 
known the action he desires the presiding officer to take or his 
objection to an action taken, and his grounds therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 953.6  Compromise and informal dispositions.

    Either party may request the other to consider informal disposition 
of any question of mailability, and the scheduled hearing date may be 
postponed by the presiding officer for such period of time as may be 
necessary to accommodate settlement discussions between the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 953.7  Default; Appearances.

    If a timely reply to the appeal is not filed, the presiding officer 
shall refer the appeal to the Judicial Officer, who may find that the 
General Counsel or the Chief Postal Inspector or his or her designee is 
in default. Whenever the General Counsel or the Chief Postal Inspector 
or his or her designee has been deemed to be in default, the Judicial 
Officer shall take whatever action on the appeal he deems appropriate. 
If an oral evidentiary hearing is to be held, the appellant may appear 
at the hearing in person or by counsel. If either party fails to appear 
at the hearing, the presiding officer shall receive the evidence of the 
party appearing and render a decision.

[59 FR 31538, June 20, 1994, as amended at 71 FR 53972, Sept. 13, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 953.8  Location of hearing.

    Unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer, the hearing shall 
be held at 2101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201-3078, 
on the date set in the notice.

[63 FR 66050, Dec. 1, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 953.9  Change of place of hearing.

    (a) Not later than the date fixed for the filing of the reply, a 
party may file a motion that the scheduled hearing be held at a place 
other than that designated in the notice. The motion shall include a 
supporting statement outlining:
    (1) The evidence to be offered in such place;
    (2) The names and addresses of the witnesses who will testify; and
    (3) The reasons why such evidence cannot be presented in Arlington, 
VA.
    (b) In ruling on the motion, the presiding officer shall consider 
the convenience and necessity of the parties and the relevancy of the 
evidence to be offered.

[59 FR 31538, June 20, 1994, as amended at 63 FR 66050, Dec. 1, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 953.10  Presiding officers.

    The presiding officer at any hearing shall be an Administrative Law 
Judge qualified in accordance with law (5 U.S.C. 3105) and assigned by 
the Judicial Officer (39 U.S.C. 204), or the Judicial Officer, may at 
his discretion, elect to preside at the reception of evidence. The 
Judicial Officer shall assign cases to Administrative Law Judges upon 
rotation if practicable.

[[Page 277]]


<R05>
Sec. 953.11  Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.

    Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be submitted 
orally or in writing at the conclusion of the hearing, or otherwise, as 
ordered by the presiding officer.


<R05>
Sec. 953.12  Initial decision.

    Unless given orally at the conclusion of the hearing, the 
Administrative Law Judge shall render an initial decision as 
expeditiously as practicable after the conclusion of the hearing and the 
receipt of the proposed findings and conclusions, if any. The initial 
decision shall become the decision of the Postal Service if an appeal is 
not perfected. When the Judicial Officer presides at the hearing, his 
powers shall include those of an Administrative Law Judge, but the 
Judicial Officer may render either an initial or final decision. 
Exceptions may be filed to an initial decision rendered by the Judicial 
Officer in accordance with Sec. 953.13.


<R05>
Sec. 953.13  Appeal from initial decision.

    Either party may file exceptions in a brief on appeal to the 
Judicial Officer within 5 days after receipt of the initial decision 
unless additional time is granted. A reply brief may be filed within 5 
days after the receipt of the appeal brief by the opposing party.


<R05>
Sec. 953.14  Final Agency decision.

    The Judicial Officer shall render a final Agency decision. The 
decision shall be served upon the parties and the postal official having 
custody of any mail detained pursuant to the determination or ruling.


<R05>
Sec. 953.15  Expedition.

    For the purpose of further expedition, either party may move to have 
the hearing held at an earlier date than that specified in the notice. 
Either party may also move to have the initial decision (if an 
Administrative Law Judge or the Judicial Officer is presiding) or the 
final Agency decision (if the Judicial Officer is presiding) rendered 
orally at the conclusion of the hearing. The presiding officer may grant 
or deny any such motion. The parties may, with the concurrence of the 
Judicial Officer, agree to waive any of the procedures established in 
these rules.


<R05>
Sec. 953.16  Disposition.

    Mail matter found to be nonmailable shall be held at the post office 
where detained for a period of 15 days from the date of the Postal 
Service decision, unless that period is extended by the Judicial 
Officer. During this holding period, the appellant may apply for the 
withdrawal of the matter. If any such application is made, the General 
Counsel or Chief Postal Inspector or his or her designee shall be given 
notice and the opportunity to oppose the application. Upon the 
expiration of the holding period with no application having been made, 
the Judicial Officer shall order that the matter be disposed of in 
accordance with 39 U.S.C. 3001(b). If a timely application is made, the 
Judicial Officer shall consider the application and any reasons advanced 
by the General Counsel or Chief Postal Inspector or his or her designee 
for denying the application. The Judicial Officer shall thereafter order 
either that the matter be returned to the applicant or that it be 
disposed of in accordance with 39 U.S.C. 3001(b).

[59 FR 31538, June 20, 1994, as amended at 71 FR 53972, Sept. 13, 2006]

<R05>
Sec. 954.5  Application.

    A publisher may file an application for Periodicals mailing 
privileges. (See Sec. E213 of the Domestic Mail Manual.) An authorized 
administrative official of the Postal Service (hereinafter called ``the 
authorized official'') rules upon all applications. If he or she denies 
the application he or she shall notify the publisher specifying the 
reasons for his or her denial and attaching a copy of these rules. 
Before taking action on an application, the authorized official may call 
upon the publisher for additional information or evidence to support or 
clarify the application. Failure of the publisher to furnish such 
information or evidence may be cause for the authorized official to deny 
the application as incomplete or, on its face, not fulfilling the 
requirements for entry.

[36 FR 11567, June 16, 1971, as amended at 38 FR 17217, June 29, 1973;

<R05>
Sec. 954.6  Revocation or suspension.

    When the authorized official determines that a publication is no 
longer entitled to Periodicals mailing privileges, he or she shall issue 
a ruling of suspension or revocation to the publisher at the last known

copy of these rules.

of the publisher to file a petition in accordance with the requirements 
of Sec. 954.8(b).

[36 FR 11567, June 16, 1971, as amended at 38 FR 17217, June 29, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 954.8  Pleading.

    (a) Place of filing. Parties shall file an original and three copies 
of all documents of record, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding 
officer with the Recorder of the Postal Service, who shall cause copies 
to be delivered to the other parties and to the presiding officer. 
Service is ordinarily made on the private parties by certified mail and 
delivery is deemed complete when a document or notice of its arrival is

[[Page 279]]

left at the designated address. The Recorder shall maintain a docket and 
the files in all proceedings.
    (b) Petition. A publisher may appeal from a ruling of the authorized 
official by filing a petition within 15 days of the receipt of the 
ruling unless the time is extended by the authorized official. The 
petition shall state the reasons why the publisher (designated 
``Petitioner'' in the proceeding) believes the ruling of the authorized 
official is erroneous and shall provide the address at which documents 
may be served on the Petitioner. The petition shall also allege facts 
showing compliance with each provision of law or regulation on which the 
publisher's claim to Periodicals mail privileges is based. The publisher 
shall attach to his or her petition a copy of the letter of the 
authorized official denying, suspending or revoking Periodicals mail 
privileges.
    (c) Notice of hearing. Upon receipt of the petition the Recorder 
shall set a date for the hearing and issue a notice of hearing to the 
parties stating the time and place of the hearing, the date for filing 
an answer, and the name of the presiding officer.
    (d) Answer. The authorized official (designated the ``Respondent'' 
in the proceeding) shall answer the petition within 15 days after filing 
and admit or deny each allegation of the petition.
    (e) Amendment. An amendment of a pleading may be offered by any 
party at any time prior to the close of the hearing. If the presiding 
officer deems it appropriate to permit the amendment of a pleading, he 
or she may impose such conditions, by way of continuance of the hearing 
date or otherwise, as he or she considers necessary to assure a fair 
hearing.

[36 FR 11567, June 16, 1971, as amended at 38 FR 17217, June 29, 1973;

The application shall state whom the potential intervenor represents, 
his or her interest, the extent to which he or she desires to

answer the application. The presiding officer shall grant or deny the 
application on such terms and conditions as he or she deems appropriate. 
In so doing the presiding officer will consider, among other things, 
whether intervention or other participation is consistent with the 
timely and proper adjudication of the rights of the original parties.

<R05>
Sec. 954.15  Judicial Officer.

    The Judicial Officer is authorized (a) to act as presiding officer 
at hearings and (b) to render a final Postal Service Decision for the 
Postmaster General. On appeal from an Initial Decision of an 
Administrative Law Judge, the Judicial Officer will consider the entire 
record including the initial decision and the exceptions to that 
decision. Before any final agency decision has been rendered, the 
Judicial Officer may order the hearing reopened for the presiding 
officer to take additional evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 954.16  Procedure.

    (a) Evidence. The general rules of evidence governing civil 
proceedings in matters not involving trial by jury in the courts of the 
United States apply. The rules may be relaxed to the extent that the 
presiding officer may deem proper to insure an adequate and fair 
hearing. The presiding officer may exclude irrelevant or repetitious 
evidence.
    (b) Subpoenas. The Postal Service is not authorized to issue 
subpoenas.
    (c) Fees. The Postal Service does not pay fees and expenses for 
witnesses of, or depositions requested by, the publisher or intervenor.
    (d) Depositions. Depositions may be taken as follows:
    (1) Not later than 5 days after the filing of the authorized 
officials's answer, any party may file application with the presiding 
officer for the taking of testimony by deposition. In support of such 
application the applicant shall submit under oath or affirmation a 
statement setting out the reasons why such testimony should be taken by 
deposition, the time and the place, and the name and address of the 
witness whose deposition is desired, the subject matter of

[[Page 281]]

the testimony of each witness, its relevancy, and the name and address 
of the person before whom the deposition is to be taken.
    (2) If the application is granted, the order for the taking of the 
deposition will specify the time and place thereof, the name of the 
witness, the person before whom the deposition is to be taken and any 
other necessary information.
    (3) Each witness testifying upon deposition shall be duly sworn by 
the deposition officer and the adverse party shall have the right to 
cross-examine. The questions and answers together with all objections, 
shall be reduced to writing and, unless waived by stipulation of the 
parties, shall be read to and subscribed by the witness in the presence 
of the deposition officer who shall certify it in the usual form. The 
deposition officer shall file the testimony taken by deposition as 
directed in the order. All objections made at the time of examination 
shall be noted by the deposition officer and the evidence objected to 
shall be taken subject to the objections. In lieu of participating in 
the oral examination, a party may transmit written interrogatories to 
the deposition officer, who shall propound them to the witness and 
record the answers verbatim. Objections to relevancy or materiality of 
testimony, or to errors and irregularities occurring at the oral 
examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the 
questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of 
the parties and errors of any kind which might be obviated, cured or 
removed if promptly presented, are waived unless timely objection is 
made at the taking of the deposition.
    (4) At the hearing any part or all of the deposition may be offered 
in evidence by any party who was present or represented at the taking of 
the deposition or who had notice thereof. If the deposition is not 
offered and received in evidence, it shall not be considered as a part 
of the record in the proceeding. The admissibility of depositions or 
parts thereof shall be governed by the rules of evidence.
    (5) The party requesting the deposition shall pay all fees required 
to be paid to witnesses and the deposition officer, and shall provide an 
original and one copy of the deposition for the official record, and 
shall serve one copy upon the opposing party.
    (6) Within the United States or within a territory or insular 
possession subject to the dominion of the United States, depositions may 
be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of 
the United States or of the place where the examination is held; within 
a foreign country, depositions may be taken before a secretary of an 
embassy or legation, consul general, vice consul or consular agent of 
the United States, or any other person designated in the order for the 
taking of a deposition.
    (7) Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written 
interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by 
oral examination. When a deposition is taken upon written 
interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, none of the parties shall be 
present or represented, and no person, other than the witness, a 
stenographic reporter, and the deposition officer shall be present at 
the examination of the witness, which fact shall be certified by the 
officer, who shall propound the interrogatories and cross-
interrogatories to the witness in their order and reduce the testimony 
to writing in the witness' own words.

[36 FR 11567, June 16, 1971, as amended at 62 FR 66998, Dec. 23, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 954.17  Transcript.

    (a) A contract reporter of the Postal Service under the supervision 
of the presiding officer shall report hearings. The reporter shall 
supply the parties with copies of the transcript at rates not to exceed 
those fixed by contract between the Postal Service and the reporter.
    (b) Changes in the official transcript may be made only when they 
involve substantial errors. A party may file a motion for correction of 
the official transcript within 10 days after his or her receipt of the 
transcript or any part thereof. Other parties shall, within such time as 
may be specified by the presiding officer, notify the presiding officer 
in writing if they object to the requested corrections. Failure of a 
party to interpose timely objection to

[[Page 282]]

a proposed correction may be considered by the presiding officer to be 
concurrence. The presiding officer shall then specify the corrections to 
be made in the transcript. He or she may on his or her own initiative 
order corrections in the transcript after notice to the parties subject 
to their objection.

[36 FR 11567, June 16, 1971, as amended at 62 FR 66998, Dec. 23, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 954.18  Proposed findings and conclusions.

    (a) A party to a proceeding may submit proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law to the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall 
determine whether they shall be oral or written. The presiding officer 
may require parties to a proceeding to submit proposed findings of fact 
and conclusions of law with supporting reasons. When the proposed 
findings and conclusions are not submitted orally they shall be filed 
within 15 days after delivery of the official transcript to the 
Recorder. The Recorder shall notify the parties of the filing date which 
shall be the same for both parties. If not submitted by that date, the 
findings and conclusions will not be considered or included in the 
record.
    (b) Except when presented orally, proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law shall be set forth in numbered paragraphs and shall 
state with particularity all evidentiary facts in the record with 
appropriate citations to the transcript or exhibits relied upon to 
support the conclusions proposed. Each proposed conclusion shall be 
separately stated.

[36 FR 11567, June 16, 1971, as amended at 62 FR 66998, Dec. 23, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 954.19  Initial decision.

    (a) Upon request of either party the presiding officer may render an 
oral initial decision at the close of the hearing when the nature of the 
case and the public interest warrant. If a party desires an oral initial 
decision he or she shall notify the presiding officer and the opposing 
party at least 5 days prior to the date set for hearing. Parties may 
then submit proposed findings and conclusions orally or in writing at 
the conclusion of the hearing.
    (b) If an oral initial decision is not rendered, the presiding 
officer shall render a written initial decision with all due speed after 
the parties have submitted all posthearing material. The initial 
decision shall become the final agency decision unless it is appealed.
    (c) The initial decision shall include findings upon all material 
issues of fact and law presented on the record and the reasons for those 
findings.

[36 FR 11567, June 16, 1971, as amended at 62 FR 66998, Dec. 23, 1997]


<R05>

decision by filing exceptions in a brief on appeal within 15 days from 
the receipt of a written or oral initial decision.
    (b) The time for the filing of the reply brief is 10 days after 
receipt of the appeal brief. No additional briefs shall be received 
unless requested by the Judicial Officer.
    (c) Appeal briefs shall contain the following matter in the order 
indicated:
    (1) A subject index of the matters presented with page references;
    (2) A table of cases alphabetically arranged;

citation to part 955 was revised, effective July 28, 2011. For the 
convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
    Authority: 39 U.S.C. 204, 401; 41 U.S.C. 7101-7109.

    Source: 74 FR 20592, May 5, 2009, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 955.1  Jurisdiction, procedure, service of documents.

    (a) Jurisdiction for considering appeals. Pursuant to the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. 601-613, the Postal Service Board of 
Contract Appeals (Board) has jurisdiction to consider and decide any 
appeal from a decision of a contracting officer of the United States 
Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission relative to a 
contract made by either. In addition the Board has jurisdiction over 
other matters assigned to it by the Postmaster General, and over matters 
otherwise authorized by applicable law.
    (b) Organization and location of the Board. (1) The Board is located 
at 2101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, Virginia 22201-3078. The 
Board's telephone number is (703) 812-1900, and its Web site is http://
www.usps.gov/judicial.

[[Page 284]]

The Board's fax number is (703) 812-1901.
    (2) The Board consists of the Judicial Officer as Chairman, the 
Associate Judicial Officer as Vice Chairman, and the Judges of the 
Board, as appointed by the Postmaster General in accordance with the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. 601-613. All members of the 
Board shall meet the qualifications established in the Contract Disputes 
Act. In general, appeals are assigned to a panel of at least three 
members of the Board. The decision of a majority of the panel 
constitutes the decision of the Board.
    (c) Board procedures-- (1) Rules. Appeals to the Board are handled 
in accordance with the rules of the Board.
    (2) Administration and interpretation of rules. These rules will be 
interpreted so as to secure a just and inexpensive determination of 
appeals without unnecessary delay. Emphasis is placed upon the sound 
administration of these rules in specific cases, because it is 
impracticable to articulate a rule to fit every possible circumstance 
which may be encountered. The Board may consider the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure for guidance in construing those Board rules that are 
similar to Federal Rules and for matters not specifically covered 
herein.
    (3) Time, computation, and extensions. (i) All time limitations 
specified for various procedural actions are computed as maximums, and 
are not to be fully exhausted if the action described can be 
accomplished in a lesser period. These time limitations are similarly 
eligible for extension in appropriate circumstances.
    (ii) Except as otherwise provided by law, in computing any period of 
time prescribed by these rules or by any order of the Board, the day of 
the event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall 
not be included, but the last day of the period shall be included unless 
it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday in which event the period 
shall run to the end of the next business day. Except as otherwise 
provided in these rules or an applicable order, prescribed periods of 
time are measured in calendar days rather than business days.
    (iii) Requests for extensions of time from either party shall be 
made in writing stating good cause therefor, shall represent that the 
moving party has contacted the opposing party about the request, or made 
reasonable and good faith efforts to do so, and shall indicate whether 
the opposing party consents to the extension. If the request for 
extension of time is filed after the time for taking the required action 
has expired, the request should indicate the reasons for the party's 
failure to have submitted the request before that time expired.
    (4) Place of filings. Unless the Board otherwise directs, pleadings 
and other communications shall be filed with the Recorder of the Board 
at its office at 2101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, Virginia 
22201-3078. Generally, and unless otherwise prescribed by law, rule or 
applicable Board order, the Board considers documents filed upon the 
earlier of receipt by the Recorder of the Board during the Board's 
working hours (8:45-4:45) or, if mailed, the date mailed to the Board. A 
United States Postal Service postmark shall be prima facie evidence that 
the document with which it is associated was mailed on the date of the 
postmark.
    (5) Service. Documents shall be served personally or by mail, 
addressed to the party upon whom service is to be made. Copies of 
simultaneous briefs shall be filed directly with the Board for 
distribution and shall not be sent directly by the parties to each 
other. The party filing any other document with the Board shall send a 
copy thereof to the opposing party, by an equally or more expeditious 
means of transmittal, noting on the document filed with the Board, or on 
the transmitting letter, that a copy has been so furnished. The filing 
of a document by fax transmission occurs upon receipt by the Board of 
the entire legible submission by fax. The Board may determine not to 
extend a deadline for filing if the extension is necessary solely 
because the Board's fax machine is busy or otherwise unavailable when a 
filing is due. Submissions filed by fax shall be followed promptly by 
filing by mail.

    Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 37660, June 28, 2011, Sec. 955.1 was 
amended in the first sentence of paragraph (a) and the first sentence

[[Page 285]]

of paragraph (b)(2) by removing ``41 U.S.C. 601-613'', and adding ``41 
U.S.C. 7101-7109'' in its place, effective July 28, 2011.


<R05>
Sec. 955.2  Notice of appeals.

    Notice of an appeal must be in writing, and the original, together 
with two copies, may be filed with the contracting officer from whose 
decision the appeal is taken, or may be filed directly with the Board. 
The notice of appeal must be mailed or otherwise filed within the time 
specified by applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 955.3  Contents of notice of appeal.

    (a) A notice of appeal from a contracting officer's decision should 
indicate that an appeal is thereby intended. It should identify the 
contract by number or other identifying reference, and identify the 
decision from which the appeal is taken, or it should attach a copy of 
the contracting officer's decision. If an appeal is taken from the 
failure of a contracting officer to issue a decision, the notice of 
appeal should describe in detail the claim that the contracting officer 
has failed to decide and/or attach a copy of the claim that the 
contracting officer has failed to decide, and explain that the 
contracting officer has failed to decide the claim as required.
    (b) The notice of appeal should be signed personally by the 
appellant (the contractor taking the appeal), or by an officer of the 
appellant corporation or member of the appellant firm, or by the 
contractor's duly authorized representative or attorney. The complaint 
referred to in Sec. 955.7 may be filed with the notice of appeal, or 
the appellant may designate the notice of appeal as a complaint, if it 
otherwise fulfills the requirements of a complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 955.4  Forwarding of appeals.

    Upon receipt of a notice of appeal in any form, the contracting 
officer shall indicate thereon the date of mailing (or date of receipt, 
if otherwise conveyed) and within 10 days shall forward said notice of 
appeal to the Board, and shall include a copy of the contracting 
officer's final decision if one has been issued. Following receipt by 
the Board of the notice of an appeal (whether through the contracting 
officer or otherwise), the contractor and contracting officer will be 
advised promptly of its receipt, and the contractor will be furnished a 
copy of these rules.


<R05>
Sec. 955.5  Preparation, contents, organization, forwarding, and status of appeal file.

    (a) Duties of the respondent. Within 30 days from receipt of the 
Board's docketing notice, or such other period as the Board may order, 
the respondent's counsel shall file with the Board an appeal file 
consisting of all documents pertinent to the appeal and shall provide a 
copy to the appellant. The appeal file shall include:
    (1) The claim and contracting officer's final decision from which 
the appeal is taken;
    (2) The contract, including pertinent specifications, amendments, 
plans and drawings;
    (3) All correspondence between the parties pertinent to the appeal;
    (4) Transcripts of any testimony taken during the course of 
proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witnesses on the matter 
in dispute made prior to the filing of the notice of appeal with the 
Board; and
    (5) Any additional information considered pertinent.
    (b) Duties of the appellant. Within 30 days after receipt of a copy 
of the appeal file, the appellant shall supplement the appeal file by 
transmitting to the Board any documents not contained therein considered 
to be pertinent to the appeal, and shall furnish copies of such 
documents to Postal Service counsel.
    (c) Organization of appeal file. Documents in the appeal file or 
supplement, as applicable, may be originals or legible copies thereof, 
and shall be arranged in chronological order where practicable, numbered 
sequentially, tabbed, and indexed to identify the contents. Page 
numbering shall be consecutive and continuous from one document to the 
next, so that the complete file or supplement, as applicable, will 
consist of one set of consecutively numbered pages.
    (d) Lengthy documents. The Board may waive the requirement of 
furnishing to the other party copies of

[[Page 286]]

bulky, lengthy, or out-of-size documents in the appeal file when a party 
has shown that doing so would impose an undue burden. The party filing 
with the Board a document as to which such a waiver has been granted, 
shall notify the other party at the time of filing that the document is 
available for inspection at the offices of the Board or of the party.
    (e) Status of documents in appeal file. Documents contained in the 
appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as 
part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision, unless 
a party objects to the consideration of a particular document. Unless 
otherwise provided by Board order, any such objection shall be made at 
least 10 days prior to a hearing or the date specified for settling the 
record in the event there is no hearing on the appeal. If timely 
objection to a document is made, the Board will rule upon its 
admissibility into the record as evidence in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
955.14 and 955.21.


<R05>
Sec. 955.6  Motions.

    (a) Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board shall be 
promptly filed. Hearing on the motion may be afforded on application of 
either party. The Board may at any time and on its own motion raise the 
issue of its jurisdiction to proceed with a particular case.
    (b) A motion filed in lieu of an answer shall be filed no later than 
the date on which the answer is required to be filed or such later date 
as may be established by Board order. Any other dispositive motion shall 
be filed as soon as practicable after the grounds therefor are known.
    (c) Motions for summary judgment may be considered by the Board. 
However, the Board may defer ruling on a motion for summary judgment, in 
its discretion, until after a hearing or other presentation of evidence. 
Motions for summary judgment may be filed only when a party believes 
that, based upon uncontested material facts, it is entitled to relief as 
a matter of law. The parties are to consider proceeding by submission of 
the case without a hearing in accordance with Sec. 955.12, in lieu of a 
motion for summary judgment.
    (1) Motions for summary judgment shall include a separate document 
titled Statement of Uncontested Facts, which shall contain in separately 
numbered paragraphs all of the material facts upon which the moving 
party bases its motion and as to which it contends there is no genuine 
issue. This statement shall include references to affidavits, 
declarations and/or documents relied upon to support such statement.
    (2) The opposing party shall file with its opposition a separate 
document titled Statement of Genuine Issues. This document shall 
identify, by reference to specific paragraph numbers in the moving 
party's Statement of Uncontested Facts, those facts as to which the 
opposing party claims there is a genuine issue necessary to be 
litigated. An opposing party shall state the precise nature of its 
disagreement, and support its opposition with references to affidavits, 
declarations and/or documents that demonstrate the existence of a 
genuine dispute.
    (3) The moving party and the non-moving party shall each submit a 
memorandum of law supporting or opposing summary judgment.
    (4) If, despite reasonable efforts, the opposing party cannot 
present facts essential to justify its opposition, the Board may defer 
ruling on the motion to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions 
to be taken or other discovery to be conducted, or may issue such other 
order as is just. The parties should not expect the Board to search the 
record for evidence in support of either party's position.

    Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 37660, June 28, 2011, Sec. 955.6 was 
amended by revising paragraph (a), effective July 28, 2011. For the 
convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 955.6  Motions.

    (a) Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board shall be 
promptly filed. Oral argument on the motion may be afforded on 
application of either party, in the Board's discretion, or on the 
Board's initiative. The Board may at any time and on its

[[Page 287]]

own initiative raise the issue of its jurisdiction to proceed with a 
particular case.

<R05>
Sec. 955.7  Pleadings.

    (a) Appellant. Within 45 days after receipt of notice of docketing 
of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board a complaint 
setting forth simple, concise and direct statements of each of its 
claims, alleging the basis, with appropriate reference to contract 
provisions, for each claim, and the dollar amount claimed, and shall 
serve the respondent with a copy. This pleading shall fulfill the 
generally recognized requirements of a complaint although no particular 
form or formality is required. Should the complaint not be filed within 
the time required, appellant's claim and notice of appeal may, if in the 
opinion of the Board the issues before the Board are sufficiently 
defined, be deemed to constitute the complaint and the respondent shall 
be so notified.
    (b) Respondent. Within 30 days from receipt of said complaint, or 
the aforesaid notice from the Board, the respondent shall prepare and 
file with the Board an answer thereto, setting forth simple, concise, 
and direct statements of the respondent's defenses to each claim 
asserted by the appellant, and shall serve the appellant with a copy. 
This pleading shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of an 
answer, and shall set forth any affirmative defenses or counterclaims as 
appropriate. Should the answer not be filed within the time required, 
the Board may, in its discretion, enter a general denial on behalf of 
the respondent, and the appellant shall be so notified.
    (c) Affirmative claims by the respondent. Where an appellant has 
appealed an affirmative claim by the respondent asserted in a final 
decision by a Postal Service contracting officer, such as a termination 
for default or a Postal Service claim that a contractor owes the Postal 
Service money under a contract, the Board may order the respondent to 
file the complaint as described in Sec. 955.7(a), and the appellant to 
file the answer as described in Sec. 955.7(b).

    Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 37660, June 28, 2011, Sec. 955.7 was 
amended by revising paragraph (a), effective July 28, 2011. For the

setting forth simple, concise and direct statements of each of its 
claims, alleging the basis, with appropriate reference to contract 
provisions, for each claim, and the dollar amount claimed, and shall 
serve the respondent with a copy. This pleading shall fulfill the 
generally recognized requirements of a complaint although no particular 
form or formality is required. Upon the appellant's request or on the 
Board's own initiative, the appellant's claim, notice of appeal or other 
document may be deemed to constitute the complaint if in the opinion of 
the Board the issues before the Board are sufficiently defined.

<R05>
Sec. 955.8  Amendments of pleadings or record.

    (a) Upon its own initiative or upon application by a party, the 
Board may, in its discretion, order a party to submit a more definite 
statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an answer.
    (b) When issues within the proper scope of an appeal, but not raised 
in the pleadings, have been raised without objection or with permission 
of the Board at a hearing or in record submissions, they may be treated 
in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. If evidence 
is objected to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within the 
issues raised by the pleadings, in its discretion the Board may admit 
the evidence and grant the objecting party a continuance or other relief 
if necessary to enable it to meet such evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 955.9  Hearing election.

    As directed by Board order, each party shall inform the Board, in 
writing, whether it desires a hearing as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 955.18 
through 955.25, or in the alternative submission of its case on the 
record without a hearing as prescribed in Sec. 955.12. If a hearing is 
elected, the election should state where and when the electing party 
desires the

[[Page 288]]

hearing to be conducted and should explain the reasons for its choices.

    Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 37660, June 28, 2011, Sec. 955.9 was 
revised, effective July 28, 2011. For the convenience of the user, the 
revised text is set forth as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 955.9  Hearing request.

    As directed by Board order, each party shall inform the Board, in 
writing, whether it requests a hearing as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 
955.18 through 955.25, or in the alternative submission of its case on 
the record without a hearing as prescribed in Sec. 955.12. If a hearing 
is requested, the request should state where and when the requesting 
party desires the hearing to be conducted and should explain the reasons 
for its choices. After considering the parties' requests, the Board will 
determine whether a hearing will be held.


<R05>
Sec. 955.10  Prehearing briefs.

    Based on an examination of the documentation described in Sec. 
955.5, the pleadings, and a determination of whether the arguments and 
authorities addressed to the issues are adequately set forth therein, 
the Board may, in its discretion, require the parties to submit 
prehearing briefs in any case in which a hearing has been elected 
pursuant to Sec. 955.9. In the absence of a Board requirement therefor, 
either party may, in its discretion and upon appropriate and sufficient 
notice to the other party, furnish a prehearing brief to the Board. In 
any case where a prehearing brief is submitted, it shall be furnished so 
as to be received by the Board at least 15 days prior to the date set 
for hearing, and a copy shall be furnished simultaneously to the other 
party.

    Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 37660, June 28, 2011, Sec. 955.10 was 
amended by revising the first sentence, effective July 28, 2011. For the 
convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 955.10  Prehearing briefs.

    Based on an examination of the documentation described in Sec. 
955.5, the pleadings, and a determination of whether the arguments and 
authorities addressed to the issues are adequately set forth therein, 
the Board may, in its discretion, require the parties to submit 
prehearing briefs in any case in which a hearing has been ordered 
pursuant to Sec. 955.9. * * *


<R05>
Sec. 955.11  Prehearing or presubmission conference.

    (a) Whether the case is to be submitted pursuant to Sec. 955.12, or 
heard pursuant to Sec. Sec. 955.18 through 955.25, the Board may upon 
its own initiative or upon the application of either party, convene a 
conference to consider:
    (1) The simplification or clarification of the issues;
    (2) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions, 
agreements on documents, understandings on matters already of record, or 
similar agreements which will avoid unnecessary proof;
    (3) The limitation of the number of expert witnesses, or avoidance 
of similar cumulative evidence, if the case is to be heard;
    (4) The possibility of agreement disposing of all or any of the 
issues in dispute; and
    (5) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the appeal.
    (b) The results of the conference shall be reduced to writing by the 
Board and this writing shall thereafter constitute part of the record.


<R05>
Sec. 955.12  Submission without a hearing.

    Submission of the case without hearing does not relieve the parties 
from the necessity of proving the facts supporting their allegations or 
defenses. Affidavits, depositions, admissions, answers to 
interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed to supplement other 
documentary evidence in the record which will be settled pursuant to 
Sec. 955.14. The Board may permit such submission to be supplemented by 
oral argument (transcribed if requested), and by briefs in accordance 
with Sec. 955.24.


<R05>
Sec. 955.13  Optional Small Claims (Expedited) and Accelerated Procedures.

    (a) The Small Claims (Expedited) Procedure. (1) The Expedited 
Procedure is available solely at the election of the appellant. Such 
election requires decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 120 
days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election 
to utilize this procedure.
    (2) The appellant may elect this procedure when:

[[Page 289]]

    (i) There is a monetary amount in dispute and that amount is $50,000 
or less, or
    (ii) There is a monetary amount in dispute and that amount is 
$150,000 or less and the appellant is a small business concern (as that 
term is defined in the Small Business Act and regulations promulgated 
under the Act).
    (3) In cases proceeding under the Expedited Procedure, the 
respondent shall send the Board a copy of the contract, the contracting 
officer's final decision, and the appellant's claim letter or letters, 
if any, within ten days from the respondent's first receipt from either 
the appellant or the Board of a copy of the appellant's notice of 
election of the Expedited Procedure. If either party requests an oral 
hearing in accordance with Sec. 955.9, the Board shall promptly 
schedule such a hearing for a mutually convenient time consistent with 
administrative due process and the 120-day limit for a decision, at a 
place determined under Sec. 955.18. If a hearing is not requested by 
either party, the appeal shall be deemed to have been submitted under 
Sec. 955.12 without a hearing.
    (4) Promptly after receipt of the appellant's election of the 
Expedited Procedure, the Board shall establish a schedule of proceedings 
that will allow for the timely resolution of the appeal. Pleadings, 
discovery, and other prehearing activities may be restricted or 
eliminated at the Board's discretion as necessary to enable the Board to 
decide the appeal within 120 days after the Board has received the 
appellant's notice of election of the Expedited Procedure. In so doing, 
the Board may reserve whatever time it considers necessary for 
preparation of the decision.
    (5) Written decisions by the Board in cases processed under the 
Expedited Procedure will be short and contain only summary findings of 
fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the Board by a 
single Judge. If there has been a hearing, the Judge presiding at the 
hearing may, in his or her discretion, at the conclusion of the hearing 
and after entertaining such oral arguments as he or she deems 
appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral 
decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties a 
printed copy of such oral decision for the record and payment purposes 
and for the establishment of the commencement date of the period for 
filing a motion for reconsideration under Sec. 955.30.
    (6) Decisions of the Board under the Expedited Procedure will not be 
published, will have no value as precedents, and in the absence of 
fraud, cannot be appealed.
    (b) The Accelerated Procedure. (1) The Accelerated Procedure is 
available solely at the election of the appellant and shall apply only 
to appeals where there is a monetary amount in dispute and the amount in 
dispute is $100,000 or less. Such election requires decision of the 
appeal, whenever possible, within 180 days after the Board receives 
written notice of the appellant's election to utilize this procedure.
    (2) Promptly after receipt of the appellant's election of the 
Accelerated Procedure, the Board shall establish a schedule of 
proceedings that will allow for the timely resolution of the appeal. The 
Board, in its discretion, may shorten time periods prescribed elsewhere 
in these Rules as necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal 
within 180 days after the Board has received the appellant's notice of 
election of the Accelerated Procedure.
    (3) Written decisions by the Board in cases processed under the 
Accelerated Procedure will normally be short and contain only summary 
findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the 
Board by a single Judge with the concurrence of the Chairman or Vice 
Chairman or other designated Judge, or by a majority among these two and 
an additional designated member in case of disagreement. In cases where 
the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less and in which there has been a 
hearing, the single Judge presiding at the hearing may, with the 
concurrence of both parties, convert the appeal to an Expedited 
Proceeding and at the conclusion of the hearing, after entertaining such 
oral arguments as he or she deems appropriate, render on the record oral 
summary findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision of

[[Page 290]]

the appeal. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will 
subsequently furnish the parties a printed copy of such oral decision 
for record and payment purposes and to establish the date of 
commencement of the period for filing a motion for reconsideration under 
Sec. 955.30.
    (c) Denial of election. At the request of the respondent, or on its 
own initiative, the Board may determine whether the amount in dispute 
and/or the appellant's status make the election of the Expedited 
Procedure or the Accelerated Procedure inappropriate.
    (d) Motions for Reconsideration in Cases Arising Under Sec. 955.13. 
Motions for reconsideration of cases decided under either the Expedited 
Procedure or the Accelerated Procedure need not be decided within the 
time periods prescribed by this Sec. 955.13 for the initial decision of 
the appeal, but all such motions shall be processed and decided rapidly 
so as to fulfill the intent of this section.
    (e) General rule. Except as herein modified, the rules of this Part 
955 otherwise apply in all aspects.


<R05>
Sec. 955.14  Settling the record.

    (a) The record upon which the Board's decision will be rendered 
consists of the appeal file described in Sec. 955.5, and to the extent 
the following items have been filed, pleadings, prehearing conference 
memoranda or orders, prehearing briefs, depositions or interrogatories 
received in evidence, admissions, stipulations, transcripts of 
conferences and hearings, hearing exhibits, posthearing briefs, and 
documents which the Board has specifically designated be made a part of 
the record. The record will at all reasonable times be available for 
inspection by the parties at the Board.
    (b) Except as the Board may otherwise order in its discretion, no 
proof shall be received in evidence after completion of an oral hearing 
or, in cases submitted on the record, after notification by the Board 
that the case is ready for decision.
    (c) The weight to be attached to any evidence of record will rest 
within the sound discretion of the Board. The Board may in any case 
require either party, with appropriate notice to the other party, to 
submit additional evidence on any matter relevant to the appeal.
    (d) The Board may consider the Federal Rules of Evidence for 
guidance regarding admissibility of evidence and other evidentiary 
issues in construing those Board rules that are similar to Federal Rules 
and for matters not specifically covered herein.


<R05>
Sec. 955.15  Discovery.

    (a) The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery 
procedures. In connection with any deposition or other discovery 
procedure, the Board may issue any order which justice requires to 
protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or 
undue burden or expense, and those orders may include limitations on the 
scope, method, time and place for discovery, and provisions for 
protecting the secrecy of confidential information or documents.
    (b)(1) The Board may limit the frequency or extent of use of 
discovery methods described in these rules. In doing so, generally the 
Board will consider whether:
    (i) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, 
or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less 
burdensome, or less expensive;
    (ii) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by 
discovery in the case to obtain the information sought; or
    (iii) The discovery is unduly burdensome and expensive, taking into 
account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, limitations on 
the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake.
    (2) The parties are required to make a good faith effort to resolve 
objections to discovery requests informally. A party receiving an 
objection to a discovery request, or a party which believes that another 
party's response to a discovery request is incomplete or entirely 
absent, may file a motion to compel a response, but such a motion must 
include a representation that the moving party has tried in good faith, 
prior to filing the motion, to resolve the matter informally. The motion 
to

[[Page 291]]

compel shall include a copy of each discovery request at issue and the 
response, if any.
    (c) If a party fails to appear for a deposition, after being served 
with a proper notice, or fails to serve answers or objections to 
interrogatories, requests for admission of facts, or requests for the 
production or inspection of documents, after proper service, the party 
seeking discovery may request that the Board impose appropriate rulings 
or sanctions.


<R05>
Sec. 955.16  Interrogatories to parties, admission of facts, and production

and inspection of documents.

    (a) Interrogatories to parties. After an appeal has been filed with 
the Board, a party may serve on the other party written interrogatories 
to be answered separately in writing, signed under oath and returned 
within 30 days. Upon timely objection, the Board will determine the 
extent to which the interrogatories will be permitted. The scope and use 
of interrogatories will be controlled by Sec. 955.15.
    (b) Admission of facts. After an appeal has been filed with the 
Board, a party may serve upon the other party a request for the 
admission of specified facts. Within 30 days after service, the party 
served shall answer each requested fact or file objections thereto. The 
factual propositions set out in the request may be ordered by the Board 
as deemed admitted upon the failure of a party to respond timely and 
fully to the request for admissions.
    (c) Production and inspection of documents. After an appeal has been 
filed with the Board, a party may serve on the other party written 
requests for the production, inspection, and copying of any documents, 
electronically stored information, or things, to be answered within 30 
days. Upon timely objection, the Board will determine the extent to 
which the requests must be satisfied, and if the parties cannot 
themselves agree thereon, the Board shall specify just terms and 
conditions of compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 955.17  Depositions.

    (a) When depositions permitted. After an appeal has been docketed 
and complaint filed, the parties may mutually agree to, or the Board 
may, upon application of either party and for good cause shown, order 
the taking of testimony of any person by deposition upon oral 
examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to 
administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for 
purpose of discovery. The application for order shall specify whether 
the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
    (b) Orders on depositions. The time, place, and manner of taking 
depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties or, failing such 
agreement, governed by order of the Board.
    (c) Use as evidence. No testimony taken by deposition shall be 
considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal unless 
and until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at or 
before such hearing. It will not ordinarily be received in evidence if 
the deponent is available to testify at the hearing, but the Board may 
admit testimony taken by deposition in its discretion. A deposition may 
be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the witness given at 
the hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the Board may, in its 
discretion, receive depositions as evidence in supplementation of that 
record.
    (d) Expenses. Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with 
the taking of any deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 955.18  Hearings--where and when held.

    If there is to be a hearing, it will be held at a time and place 
prescribed by the Board after consultation with the party or parties 
electing the hearing. At the discretion of the Board, hearings may be 
held in the Board's hearing room in Arlington, Virginia or may be held 
at another location with due consideration to the just, informal, 
expeditious and inexpensive resolution of each case.

    Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 37660, June 28, 2011, Sec. 955.18 was 
amended by revising the first sentence, effective July 28, 2011. For the 
convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:

[[Page 292]]


<R05>
Sec. 955.18  Hearings--where and when held.

    If there is to be a hearing, it will be held at a time and place 
prescribed by the Board after consultation with the parties. * * *


<R05>
Sec. 955.19  Notice of hearings.

    The Board shall issue an order reasonably in advance of the hearing 
identifying the time and place thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 955.20  Unexcused absence of a party.

    The unexcused absence of a party at the time and place set for 
hearing will not be occasion for delay. In the event of such absence, 
the hearing will proceed and the case will be regarded as submitted by 
the absent party as provided in Sec. 955.12.


<R05>
Sec. 955.21  Nature of hearings.

    Hearings shall be as informal as may be reasonable and appropriate 
under the circumstances. The Board may exclude evidence to avoid unfair 
prejudice, confusion of the issues, undue delay, waste of time, or 
presentation of irrelevant, immaterial or cumulative evidence. Although 
the Board will consider the Federal Rules of Evidence as described in 
Sec. 955.14(d), letters or copies thereof, affidavits, or other 
evidence not ordinarily admissible under the Federal Rules, may be 
admitted in the discretion of the Board. The weight to be attached to 
evidence presented in any particular form will be within the discretion 
of the Board, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the 
particular case. Stipulations of fact agreed upon by the parties may be 
accepted as evidence at the hearing. The parties may stipulate the 
testimony that would be given by a witness if the witness were present. 
The Board may in any case require evidence in addition to that offered 
by the parties. A party requiring the use of a foreign language 
interpreter allowing testimony to be taken in English for itself or 
witnesses it proffers is responsible for making all necessary 
arrangements and paying all costs and expenses associated with the use 
of an interpreter.


<R05>
Sec. 955.22  Examination of witnesses.

    Witnesses before the Board will be examined orally under oath or 
affirmation, unless the facts are stipulated, or the Board shall 
otherwise order. If the testimony of a witness is not given under oath 
or affirmation, the Board may warn the witness that his or her 
statements may be subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 287 and 1001, 
and any other provisions of law imposing penalties for knowingly making 
false representations in connection with claims against the United 
States or in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or 
agency thereof. Upon the request of either party, or if the Board deems 
it advisable, the Board may exclude witnesses from the hearing room. The 
Board will not exclude a party who is an individual, the properly 
designated representative of a party which is an entity, a person whose 
presence is essential to the presentation of a party's case, or a person 
required by statute to be present.


<R05>
Sec. 955.23  Copies of papers, withdrawal of exhibits.

    (a) When books, records, papers, or documents have been received in 
evidence, a true copy thereof or of such part thereof as may be material 
or relevant may be substituted therefor, during the hearing or at the 
conclusion thereof.
    (b) After a decision has become final, upon request and after notice 
to the other party, the Board in its discretion may permit the 
withdrawal of original exhibits, or any part thereof, by the party 
entitled thereto. The substitution of true copies of exhibits or any 
part thereof may be required by the Board in its discretion as a 
condition of granting permission for such withdrawal.


<R05>
Sec. 955.24  Posthearing briefs.

    Posthearing briefs may be submitted upon such terms as may be 
ordered by the Board at the conclusion of the hearing. Ordinarily, they 
will be simultaneous briefs, submitted to the Board on a date 
established by the Board, following receipt of transcripts.


<R05>
Sec. 955.25  Transcript of proceedings.

    Testimony and argument at hearings shall be reported verbatim, 
unless the Board otherwise orders. Transcripts of the proceedings will 
be provided to the parties by the Board.

[[Page 293]]


<R05>
Sec. 955.26  Representation of the parties.

    (a) The term appellant means a party that has filed an appeal for 
resolution by the Board. An individual appellant may appear before the 
Board in his or her own behalf, a corporation may appear before the 
Board by an officer thereof, a partnership or joint venture may appear 
before the Board by a member thereof, or any of these may appear before 
the Board by an attorney at law duly licensed in any state, 
commonwealth, territory of the United States, or in the District of 
Columbia. An attorney representing an appellant shall file a written 
notice of appearance with the Board, including his or her address, 
telephone number, fax number, and jurisdiction in which the attorney is 
licensed to practice law.
    (b) The term respondent means the U.S. Postal Service. Postal 
Service counsel, who shall be an attorney at law licensed to practice in 
a state, commonwealth, or territory of the United States, or in the 
District of Columbia, designated by the General Counsel, will represent 
the interest of the Postal Service before the Board. Postal Service 
counsel shall file a written notice of appearance with the Board, 
including his or her address, telephone number, fax number, and 
jurisdiction in which the attorney is licensed to practice law.
    (c) References to contractor, appellant, contracting officer, 
respondent and parties shall include respective counsel for the parties, 
as soon as appropriate notices of appearance have been filed with the 
Board. A self-represented party or an attorney representing either party 
shall inform the Board promptly of any change in his or her address, 
telephone number, or fax number.


<R05>
Sec. 955.27  Withdrawal of attorney.

    Any attorney for either party who has filed a notice of appearance 
and who wishes to withdraw from a case must file a motion or notice 
which includes the name, address, telephone number, and fax number of 
the person who will assume responsibility for representation of the 
party in question.


<R05>
Sec. 955.28  Suspension.

    (a) Whenever at any time it appears that the parties are in 
agreement as to disposition of the controversy, the Board may suspend 
further processing of the appeal: Provided, however, That if the Board 
is advised thereafter by either party that the controversy has not been 
disposed of by agreement, the case shall be restored to the Board's 
active docket.
    (b) The Board may in its discretion suspend proceedings to permit a 
contracting officer to issue a decision when an appeal has been taken 
from the contracting officer's failure to render a timely decision, or 
for other good cause.


<R05>
Sec. 955.29  Decisions.

    Decisions of the Board will be made in writing and sent 
simultaneously to both parties. The rules of the Board and all final 
orders and decisions shall be open for public inspection at the offices 
of the Board, and may be made available on its official Web site and to 
commercial publishers. Decisions of the Board will be made solely upon 
the record, as described in Sec. 955.14.


<R05>
Sec. 955.30  Motion for reconsideration.

    A motion for reconsideration, if filed by either party, shall set 
forth specifically the ground or grounds relied upon to sustain the 
motion, and shall be filed within 30 days from the date of the receipt 
of a copy of the decision of the Board by the party filing the motion.


<R05>
Sec. 955.31  Dismissal without prejudice.

    In certain cases, appeals docketed before the Board are required to 
be placed in a suspense status and the Board is unable to proceed with 
disposition thereof for reasons not within the control of the Board. In 
any such case where the suspension has continued, or it appears that it 
will continue, for an inordinate length of time, the Board may, in its 
discretion, dismiss such appeals from its docket without prejudice to 
their restoration when the cause of suspension has been removed. Unless 
either party or the Board acts within

[[Page 294]]

three years to reinstate any appeal dismissed without prejudice, the 
dismissal shall be deemed with prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 955.32  Dismissal for failure to prosecute.

    Whenever a record discloses the failure of either party to file 
documents required by these rules, respond to notices or correspondence 
from the Board, comply with orders of the Board, or otherwise indicates 
an intention not to continue the prosecution or defense of an appeal, 
the Board may issue an order requiring the offending party to show cause 
why the appeal should not be either dismissed or granted, as 
appropriate. If the offending party shall fail to show such cause, the 
Board may take such action as it deems reasonable and proper under the 
circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 955.33  Ex parte communications.

    No member of the Board or of the Board's staff shall entertain, nor 
shall any person directly or indirectly involved in an appeal submit to 
the Board or the Board's staff, off the record, any evidence, 
explanation, analysis, or advice, whether written or oral, regarding any 
matter at issue in an appeal. This provision does not apply to 
consultation among Board members nor to ex parte communications 
concerning the Board's administrative functions or procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 955.34  Sanctions.

    (a) All parties and their attorneys must obey directions and orders 
prescribed by the Board and adhere to standards of conduct applicable to 
such parties and attorneys. As to an attorney, the standards include the 
rules of professional conduct and ethics of the jurisdictions in which 
that attorney is licensed to practice, to the extent that those rules 
are relevant to conduct affecting the integrity of the Board, its 
process, or its proceedings.
    (b) If any party or its attorney fails to comply with any direction 
or order issued by the Board, or engages in misconduct affecting the 
Board, its process, or its proceedings, the Board may issue such orders 
as are just, including the imposition of appropriate sanctions. 
Sanctions may include:
    (1) Taking the facts pertaining to the matter in dispute to be 
established for the purpose of the case;
    (2) Forbidding challenge of the accuracy of any evidence;
    (3) Refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose 
designated claims or defenses;
    (4) Prohibiting the disobedient party from introducing in evidence 
designated documents or testimony;
    (5) Striking pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further 
proceedings until the order is obeyed;
    (6) Dismissing or granting the case or any part thereof;
    (7) Imposing such other sanctions as the Board deems appropriate.
    (c) In addition, the Board may sanction individual attorneys for a 
violation of any Board order or direction or standard of conduct 
applicable to such individual where the violation seriously affects the 
integrity of the Board, its process, or its proceedings. Sanctions may 
be public or private, and may include admonishment, disqualification 
from a particular matter, disqualification from practice before the 
Board in accordance with 39 CFR Part 951, referral to an appropriate 
licensing authority, or such other action as circumstances may warrant.


<R05>
Sec. 955.35  Subpoenas.

    (a) General. Upon written request of either party filed with the 
Recorder, or on the Board's own initiative, the Board may issue a 
subpoena requiring:
    (1) Testimony at a deposition. The deposing of a witness in the city 
or county where the witness resides or is employed or transacts business 
in person, or at another convenient location as determined by the Board;
    (2) Testimony at a hearing. The attendance of a witness for the 
purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; or
    (3) Production of books and papers. The production by a witness of 
books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, and other 
tangible and intangible things designated in the subpoena.
    (b) Voluntary cooperation. Each party is expected:

[[Page 295]]

    (1) To cooperate and make available witnesses and evidence under its 
control as requested by the other party, without issuance of a subpoena; 
and
    (2) To secure voluntary attendance of desired third-party witnesses, 
books, papers, documents, or tangible things whenever possible.
    (c) Requests for subpoenas. (1) A request for a subpoena shall 
normally be filed at least:
    (i) 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a 
witness at a deposition is sought, and/or where the production by a 
witness of books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, 
and other tangible and intangible things is sought; and
    (ii) 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a 
witness at a hearing is sought; except that
    (iii) In its discretion the Board may honor requests for subpoenas 
not made within these time limitations.
    (2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and 
general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books, papers, 
documents, electronically stored information, and other tangible and 
intangible things sought.
    (d)(1) Requests to quash or modify. Upon written request by the 
person subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but 
in any event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for 
compliance, the Board may:
    (i) Quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and 
oppressive or for other good cause shown; or
    (ii) Require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to 
advance the reasonable cost of compliance.
    (2) Where circumstances require, the Board may act upon such a 
request at any time after a copy has been served upon the opposing 
party.
    (e) Form; issuance. (1) Every subpoena shall state the name of the 
Board and the title of the appeal and shall command each person to whom 
it is directed to attend and give testimony, and where appropriate, to 
produce specified books, papers, documents, electronically stored 
information, and other tangible and intangible things at a time and 
place therein specified. In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, 
the Judge shall sign the subpoena and may enter the name of the witness 
and otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued 
shall complete the subpoena before service.
    (2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter 
rogatory or subpoena may be issued and served under the circumstances 
and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.
    (f) Service. (1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall 
arrange for service.
    (2) A subpoena may be served by a United States marshal or deputy 
marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and not less than 18 
years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be 
made by personally delivering a copy to that person and tendering the 
fees for one day's attendance and the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 
or other applicable law.
    (3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be 
responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of 
the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such 
charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as a sufficient ground for 
striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the witness has 
produced.
    (g) Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena. In case of contumacy or 
refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or 
transacts business within the jurisdiction of a U.S. District Court, the 
Board will apply to the Court through the Attorney General of the United 
States for an order requiring the person to appear before the Board or a 
member thereof to give testimony or produce evidence or both. Any 
failure of any such person to obey the order of the Court may be 
punished by the Court as a contempt thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 955.36  Effective dates and applicability.

    These revised rules govern proceedings in all cases docketed by the 
Board on or after June 1, 2009.

authorized representative of the Vice President. In the case of personal 
service the person making service shall secure from the proposed 
Respondent or his or her agent, a written acknowledgment of receipt of 
said notice, showing the date and time of such receipt. Said 
acknowledgment (or the return receipt where service is effectuated by

Sec. 957.9  Respondent's failure to appear at the hearing.

Sec. 957.10  Respondent already debarred by another Government agency.

    (a) When a Vice President proposes to debar a firm or individual 
already debarred by another Government agency for a term concurrent with 
such debarment, the debarment proceedings before the Postal Service may 
be based entirely upon the record of facts obtained from such other 
agency or upon such facts and additional other facts. In such cases the 
facts obtained from the other agency shall be considered as established, 
but the party to be debarred shall have opportunity to present 
information to the Judicial Officer and to explain why the debarment by 
the Postal Service should not be imposed.
    (b) Where the Vice President initiating the debarment proceeding 
relies:
    (1) Upon the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, or
    (2) Upon all or part of the record of the proposed Respondent's 
previous debarment by another Government agency, in initiating such 
proceeding, the notice of proposed debarment shall contain a statement 
so stating in sufficient detail to apprise the Respondent of the extent 
of such reliance.
    (c) The Vice President's reliance upon provisions of paragraph (a) 
of this section, stated in conformity with the directions set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section does not deprive the Respondent of the 
right to request the Judicial Officer to grant a hearing pursuant to 
these rules, nor the Judicial Officer the full discretion to grant or 
deny such request.

[36 FR 11574, June 16, 1971, as amended at 63 FR 66051, Dec. 1, 1998]


<R05>

Also, a party may move to amend a pleading at any time prior to the 
close of the hearing: Provided, That the proposed amendment is 
reasonably within the scope of the proceeding.
    (b) When issues not raised by the pleadings but reasonably within 
the scope of the proceedings initiated by the notice of proposed 
debarment are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they 
shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the 
pleadings. Such amendments as may be necessary to make the pleadings 
conform to the evidence and to raise such issues shall be allowed at any 
time upon the motion of any party.
    (c) If a party objects to the introduction of evidence at the 
hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues framed by the 
pleadings, but fails to satisfy the Judicial Officer that an amendment 
of the pleadings would prejudice him on the merits, the Judicial Officer 
may allow the pleadings to be amended and may grant a continuance to 
enable the objecting party to rebut the evidence presented.
    (d) The Judicial Officer may, upon reasonable notice and upon such 
terms as are just, permit service of a supplemental pleading setting 
forth transactions, occurrences, or events which have transpired since 
the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented and which are 
relevant to any of the issues involved.

any party may file application with the Recorder for the taking of 
testimony by deposition. In support of such application the applicant 
shall submit under oath or affirmation a statement setting out the 
reasons why such testimony should be taken by deposition, the time and

examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the 
questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of 
the parties and errors of any kind which might be obviated, cured or 
removed if promptly presented, are waived unless timely objection is 
made at the taking of the deposition.
    (d) At the hearing any part or all of the deposition may be offered 
in evidence by any party who was present or represented at the taking of 
the deposition or who had notice thereof. If the deposition is not

Sec. 958.3  Petition for hearing.

    Within 30 days of being served the Postal Service's Complaint

    (a) If the respondent fails to request a hearing within the

discretion of the Presiding Officer in supervising the extent and manner 
of presentation of such evidence. In general, admissibility will hinge

needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

is requested;

appropriate.

    (a) In the judicial district of the United States in which the 
respondent resides or transacts business;
    (b) In the judicial district of the United States in which the 
incident or incidents occurred upon which the determination of liability 
under 39 U.S.C. 3018 was made by the Determining Official; or
    (c) In such other place as may be determined by the Presiding 
Officer.


<R05>

<R05>

    (a) At a reasonable time after issuing the Notice of Docketing and 
Hearing, and with adequate notice to the parties, the Presiding Officer

    (2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings, 
including the need for a more definite statement;
    (3) Stipulations or admissions of fact or as to the contents and 
authenticity of documents;
    (4) Limitation of the number of witnesses;

<R05>
Sec. 958.11  Respondent's access to information.

    Except as provided in this section, after receiving the Notice of 
Docketing and Hearing the respondent may review and obtain a copy of all 
relevant and material documents, transcripts, records, and other 
materials which relate to the determination of liability by the 
Determining Official under 39 U.S.C. 3018, and all exculpatory 
information in the possession of the Determining Official relating to 
liability for civil penalties, clean-up costs and/or damages for mailing 
hazardous materials and/or related violations under 39 U.S.C. 3018. The 
respondent is not entitled to review or obtain a copy of any

[[Page 306]]

document, transcript, record, or other material which is privileged 
under Federal law. The Presiding Officer is authorized to issue orders 
placing limitations on the scope, method, time and place for accessing 
this information, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of 
confidential information or documents.


<R05>
Sec. 958.12  Depositions; interrogatories; admission of facts; production

and inspection of documents.

    (a) General policy and protective orders. The parties are encouraged 
to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any 
discovery procedure permitted under this part, the Presiding Officer may 
issue any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from 
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. Such 
orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for 
discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential 
information or documents. Each party shall bear its own expenses 
relating to discovery.
    (b) Depositions. After the issuance of a Notice of Docketing and 
Hearing, the parties may mutually agree to, or the Presiding Officer 
may, upon application of either party and for good cause shown, order 
the taking of testimony of any person by deposition upon oral 
examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to 
administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for 
purposes of discovery. The application for an order of the Presiding 
Officer under this paragraph shall specify whether the purpose of the 
deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
    (1) The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as 
mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, governed by 
order of the Presiding Officer.
    (2) No testimony taken by depositions shall be considered as part of 
the record in the hearing unless and until such testimony is offered and 
received into evidence by order of the Presiding Officer. Deposition 
testimony will not ordinarily be received in evidence if an oral hearing 
is requested by either party, and the deponent is available to testify 
personally at the hearing. In such instances, however, deposition 
testimony may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the 
witness given at the hearing. In cases submitted for a decision on a 
written record, the Presiding Officer may, in his or her discretion, 
receive deposition testimony as evidence in supplementation of that 
record.
    (c) Interrogatories to parties. After the issuance of a Notice of 
Docketing and Hearing, a party may serve on the other party written 
interrogatories. Within 30 days after service, the party served shall 
answer each interrogatory separately in writing, signed under oath, or 
file objections thereto. Upon timely objection by the party, the 
Presiding Officer will determine the extent to which the interrogatories 
will be permitted.
    (d) Admission of facts. After the issuance of a Notice of Docketing 
and Hearing, a party may serve upon the other party a request for the 
admission of specified facts. Within 30 days after service, the party 
served shall answer each requested fact or file objections thereto. Upon 
timely objection by the party, the Presiding Officer will determine the 
extent to which the request for admission will be permitted. The factual 
propositions set out in the request shall be deemed admitted upon the 
failure of a party to respond to the request for admission.
    (e) Production and inspection of documents. Upon motion of a party 
showing good cause therefor, and upon notice, the Presiding Officer may 
order the other party to produce and permit the inspection and copying 
or photographing of any designated documents or objects, not privileged, 
specifically identified, and their relevance and materiality to the 
cause or causes in issue explained, which are reasonably calculated to 
lead to the discovery or admissible evidence. If the parties cannot 
themselves agree thereon, the Presiding Officer shall specify just terms 
and conditions in making the inspection and taking the copies and 
photographs.
    (f) Limitations. A discovery procedure may not be used to reach 
documents, transcripts, records, or other material

[[Page 307]]

which a person is not entitled to review pursuant to Sec. 958.11.


<R05>
Sec. 958.13  Sanctions.

    (a) In general. The Presiding Officer may sanction a person, 
including any party, attorney or representative, for:
    (1) Failing to comply with a lawful order or prescribed procedure;
    (2) Failing to prosecute or defend an action; or
    (3) Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, 
orderly, or fair conduct of the hearing.
    (b) Reasonableness. Any such sanction, including but not limited to 
those listed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, shall 
reasonably relate to the severity and nature of the failure or 
misconduct.
    (c) Failure to comply with an order. When a party fails to comply 
with an order, including an order for taking a deposition, the 
production of evidence within the party's control, or a request for 
admission, the Presiding Officer may:
    (1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard 
to the information sought;
    (2) Prohibit such party from introducing evidence concerning, or 
otherwise relying upon, testimony relating to the information sought;
    (3) Permit the requesting party to introduce secondary evidence 
concerning the information sought; and
    (4) Strike any part of the pleadings or other submissions of the 
party failing to comply with such request.
    (d) Failure to prosecute or defend. If a party fails to prosecute or 
defend an action under this part, the Presiding Officer may dismiss the 
action, or enter an order of default and an Initial Decision.
    (e) Failure to file timely. The Presiding Officer may refuse to 
consider any motion or other pleading, report, or response which is not 
filed in a timely fashion.


<R05>
Sec. 958.14  Ex parte communications.

    Communications between a Presiding Officer and a party shall not be 
made on any matter in issue unless on notice and opportunity for all 
parties to participate. This prohibition does not apply to procedural 
matters. A memorandum of any communication between the Presiding Officer 
and a party shall be transmitted by the Presiding Officer to all 
parties.


<R05>

unless the Presiding Officer orders otherwise. Transcripts or copies of 
the proceedings may be obtained by the parties at such rates as may be 
fixed by contract between the reporter and the Postal Service.


<R05>
Sec. 958.17  Initial decision.

    (a) After the conclusion of the hearing, and the receipt of briefs, 
if any, from the parties, the Presiding Officer shall issue a written 
Initial Decision, including his or her findings and determinations. Such 
decision shall include the findings of fact and conclusions of law which 
the Presiding Officer relies upon in determining whether the respondent 
is liable for civil penalties, clean-up costs and/or damages for mailing 
hazardous materials and/or related violations under 39 U.S.C. 3018, and, 
if liability is found, shall set forth the amount of any civil 
penalties, clean-up costs and/or damages imposed.
    (b) The Presiding Officer shall promptly send to each party a copy 
of his or her Initial Decision. A party may, in accordance with Sec. 
958.18, appeal an adverse Initial Decision to the Judicial Officer. 
Unless a party timely appeals in accordance with Sec. 958.18, the 
Presiding Officer's Initial Decision, including the findings and 
determinations, becomes the final agency decision.


<R05>
Sec. 958.18  Appeal of initial decision to Judicial Officer.

    (a) Notice of appeal and supporting brief. A party may appeal an 
adverse Initial Decision by filing, within 30 days after the Presiding 
Officer issues the Initial Decision, a Notice of Appeal with the 
Recorder. The Judicial Officer may extend the filing period but only if

[[Page 308]]

<R05>

presiding officer.
    (b) By consent of the parties, a pleading may be amended at any 
time. Also, a party may move to amend a pleading at any time prior to

presiding officer shall make such ruling on the motion as he or she 
deems fair and equitable to the parties.

respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendments as 
may be necessary to make the pleadings conform to the evidence, and to 
raise such issues, shall be allowed at any time upon the motion of any 
party.
    (d) If a party objects to the introduction of evidence at the 
hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the 
pleadings, but fails to satisfy the presiding officer that an amendment 
of the pleadings would prejudice the objecting party on the merits, the 
presiding officer may allow the amendment and may grant a continuance to 
enable the objecting party to rebut the evidence presented.
    (e) The presiding officer may, upon reasonable notice and upon such 
terms as are just, permit service of supplemental pleadings setting 
forth transactions, occurrences, or events which have happened since the 
date of the pleading sought to be supplemented and which are relevant to

<R05>

    The Postal Service does not pay fees and expenses for a respondent's 
witnesses or for depositions requested by a respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 959.20  Depositions.

    (a) Not later than 5 days after the filing of respondent's answer, 
any party may file an application with the Recorder for the taking of 
testimony by deposition. In support of such application, the applicant 
shall submit under oath or affirmation, a statement containing the 
reasons why such testimony should be taken by deposition, the time and 
place, and the name and address of the witness whose deposition is 
desired, the subject matter of the testimony of each witness, its 
relevancy, and the name and address of the person before whom the 
deposition is to be taken.
    (b) If the application be granted, the order shall specify the time 
and place thereof, the name of the witness, the person before whom the 
deposition is to be taken, and any other necessary information.
    (c) Each deponent shall first be duly sworn, and the adverse party 
shall have the right to cross-examine. The questions and answers, 
together with all objections, shall be reduced to writing and, unless 
waived by stipulation of the parties, shall be read to and subscribed by 
the witness in the presence of the deposition officer who shall certify 
it in the usual form. The deposition officer shall file the testimony 
taken by deposition as directed in the order. All objections made at the 
time of examination shall be noted by the deposition officer and the 
evidence objected to shall be taken subject to the objections. In lieu 
of participating in the oral examination, a party may transmit written 
interrogatories to the deposition officer, who shall propound them to 
the witness and record the answers verbatim. Objections to relevancy or 
materiality of testimony, or to errors and irregularities occurring at 
the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form 
or relevancy or materiality of the questions or answers, in the oath or 
affirmation, or in the conduct of the parties, and errors of any kind 
which might be obviated, cured or removed if promptly presented, are 
waived unless timely objection is made at the taking of the deposition.
    (d) At the hearing, any part or all of the deposition may be offered 
into evidence by any party who was present or represented at the taking 
of the deposition or who had notice thereof. If the deposition is not 
offered and received into evidence, it shall not be considered as a part 
of the record. The admissibility of depositions or parts thereof shall 
be governed by the rules of evidence.
    (e) The party requesting the deposition shall pay all fees required 
to be paid to witnesses and the deposition officer, and shall provide an 
original and one copy thereof for the official record, and shall serve 
one copy upon the opposing party.
    (f) Within the United States, or within a territory or possession 
subject to the dominion of the United States, depositions may be taken 
before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the 
United States or of the place where the examination is held; within a 
foreign country, depositions may be taken before a secretary of an 
embassy or legation, consul general, vice consul or consular agent of 
the United States, or any other person designated in the order for the 
taking of the deposition.

[[Page 314]]

    (g) Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written 
interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by 
oral examination. When a deposition is taken upon written 
interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, none of the parties shall be 
present or represented, and no person, other than the witness, a 
stenographic reporter, and the deposition officer, shall be present at 
the examination of the witness, which fact shall be certified by the 
deposition officer, who shall propound the interrogatories and cross-
interrogatories to the witness in their order and cause the testimony to 
be reduced to writing in the witness' own words.

Sec. 959.21  Transcript.

    (a) Hearings shall be stenographically reported by a contract 
reporter of the Postal Service under the supervision of the assigned 
presiding officer. Argument upon any matter may be excluded from the 
transcript by order of the presiding officer. A copy of the transcript 
shall be a part of the record and the sole official transcript of the 
proceeding. Copies of the transcript shall be supplied to the parties by 
the reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by the 
contract between the Postal Service and the reporter. Copies of parts of 
the official record, other than the transcript, may be obtained by the 
respondent from the reporter upon the payment of a reasonable price 
therefor.
    (b) Changes in the official transcript may be made only when they 
involve errors affecting substance, and then only in the manner herein 
provided. No physical changes shall be made in or upon the official 
transcript, or copies thereof, which have been filed with the record. 
Within 10 days after the receipt by any party of a copy of the official 
transcript, or any part thereof, a party may file a motion requesting 
correction of the transcript. The opposing party shall, within such time 
as may be specified by the presiding officer, notify the presiding 
officer in writing of his or her concurrence or disagreement with the 
requested corrections. Failure to interpose timely objection to a 
proposed correction shall be considered to be concurrence. Thereafter, 
the presiding officer shall by order specify the corrections to be made 
in the transcript. The presiding officer on his or her own initiative 
may order corrections to be made in the transcript with prompt notice to 
the parties of the proceeding. Any changes ordered by the presiding 
officer other than by agreement of the parties shall be subject to 
objection and exception.

Sec. 959.22  Proposed findings and conclusions.

having answered, either fails to appear at the hearing or indicates in 
the answer that he or she does not desire to appear, may submit proposed 
findings of fact, conclusions of law and supporting reasons either in 
oral or written form. The presiding officer may also require the parties 
to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with 
supporting reasons.
    (b) Proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and supporting 
reasons not presented orally before the close of the hearing, shall, 
unless otherwise directed by the presiding officer, be filed within 15 
days after the delivery of the official transcript to the Recorder, who 
shall notify the parties of the date of its receipt. The proposed 
findings of fact, conclusions of law and supporting reasons shall be set 
forth in serially numbered paragraphs, and shall state with 
particularity, all pertinent evidentiary facts in the record with 
appropriate citations to the transcript or exhibits supporting the 
proposed findings. Each proposed conclusion of law shall be separately 
stated.

initial decision shall be rendered with all due speed. The initial 
decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, with the

become the final decision of the Postal Service unless an appeal is 
taken in accordance with Sec. 959.24.
    (c) Written tentative or final decision by the Judicial Officer. 
When the Judicial Officer presides at the hearing, he or she shall issue 
a final or a tentative decision. Such decision shall include findings of 
fact and conclusions of law, with the reasons therefor, upon all the 
material issues of fact or law presented on the record, and appropriate 
order. The tentative decision shall become the final decision of the 
Postal Service unless exceptions are filed in accordance with Sec. 
959.24.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 960.1  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called ``the Act'' in 
this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses 
to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (called ``adversary adjudications'') before 
the Postal Service. An eligible party may receive an award when it 
prevails over the Postal Service, unless the Postal Service's position 
was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award 
unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards 
and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for 
awards, and the procedures and standards that the Postal Service will 
use to make them.

[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6797, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 960.2  When the Act applies.

    The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending or commenced 
before the Postal Service on or after August 5, 1985. It also applies to 
any adversary adjudication commenced on or after October 1, 1984, and 
finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided that an application 
for fees and expenses, as described in subpart B of these rules, has 
been filed with the Postal Service within 30 days after August 5, 1985, 
and to any adversary adjudication pending on or commenced on or after 
October 1, 1981, in which an application for fees and other expenses was 
timely filed and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

[52 FR 6797, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 960.3  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the 
Postal Service. These are:
    (1) Adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the 
Postal Service is presented by an attorney or other representative who 
enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding (for the Postal 
Service, the types of proceedings generally covered are proceedings 
relative to false representation and cease and desist orders and 
mailability under chapter 30 of title 39, U.S.C., with the exception of 
proceedings under 39 U.S.C. 3008); and
    (2) Appeals of decisions of contracting officers made pursuant to 
section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before 
the Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals as provided in section 8 of 
that Act. (41 U.S.C. 607).
    (b) The Postal Service may also designate a proceeding not listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section as an adversary adjudication for purposes 
of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or 
designating the matter for hearing. The failure to designate a 
proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of 
an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the 
Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for 
resolution in proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include 
only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6798, Mar. 5, 1987; 67 
FR 62179, Oct. 4, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 960.4  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term ``party'' is defined 
in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show by clear and convincing 
evidence that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this 
subpart and in subpart B and must submit additional information to 
verify its eligibility upon order by the adjudicative officer.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;

[[Page 318]]

    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees; and
    (5) Any other partnerships, corporation, association, unit of local 
government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million 
and not more than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purposes of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated, which in proceedings before the Board of 
Contract Appeals is the date the applicant files its appeal to the 
Board.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an 
unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment 
would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the 
actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the 
applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.

[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6798, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 960.5  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, including expenses 
and fees incurred in filing for an award under the Act, or in a 
significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless 
the position of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was 
substantially justified. The position of the agency includes in addition 
to the position taken by the agency in the adversary adjudication, the 
action or failure to act by the agency upon which the adversary 
adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be 
made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on Postal Service counsel.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.

[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6798, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 960.6  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
a reduced rate to the applicant. Attorney fees may not be recovered by 
parties appearing pro se in postal proceedings.
    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $125.00 per hour, or such rate as prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 504. 
No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at 
which the Postal Service pays expert witnesses. However, an award may 
also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness 
as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness

[[Page 319]]

ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or 
her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6798, Mar. 5, 1987; 66 
FR 55577, Nov. 2, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 960.7  Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

    (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special 
circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to 
handle certain types of proceedings), the Postal Service may adopt 
regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher 
than $125.00 per hour, or such rate as prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 504, in 
some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part. The Postal 
Service will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under 
the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (b) Any person may request the Postal Service to initiate a 
rulemaking proceeding to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees. 
The request should identify the rate the person believes the Postal 
Service should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate 
should be used. It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher 
rate is warranted. The Postal Service will respond to the request within 
60 days after it is filed, by determining to initiate a rulemaking 
proceeding, denying the request, or taking other appropriate action.

[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 66 FR 55577, Nov. 2, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 960.8  Official authorized to take final action under the Act.

    The Postal Service official who renders the final agency decision in 
a proceeding under Sec. 952.26 or Sec. 953.15, or the panel that 
renders the decision in an appeal before the Board of Contract Appeals 
under part 955 procedures, as the case may be, is authorized to take 
final action on matters pertaining to the Equal Access to Justice Act as 
applied to the proceeding.

[52 FR 6798, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R04>
             Subpart B_Information Required From Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 960.9  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act 
shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is 
sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and 
identify the position of the Postal Service in the proceeding that the 
applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant 
is an individual, the application shall also state the number of 
employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of 
its organization or business.
    (b) The application shall also include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or 
$7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates.) 
However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt

[[Page 320]]

status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief 
that it qualifies under such section; or
    (2) It states on the application that it is a cooperative 
association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing 
Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes the Postal Service to consider in determining whether 
and in what amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.

[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6798, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 960.10  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 960.4(f)) when the proceeding was initiated. The 
exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides 
full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and 
liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant 
qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative officer may 
require an applicant to file additional information to determine its 
eligibility for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a 
sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information'', 
accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public 
disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be 
withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the 
specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1) through (9), why public disclosure 
of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why 
disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in 
question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against 
which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other 
party to the proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the 
information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed 
in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to 
inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the 
Postal Service's established procedures under the Freedom of Information 
Act, part 265 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 960.11  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    (a) The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of 
the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The adjudicative officer may require the 
applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any 
expenses claimed. In addition, the Board of Contract Appeals may require 
an applicant to submit to an audit by the Postal Service of its claimed 
fees and expenses.
    (b) Where the case has been sustained in part and denied in part or 
where the applicant has prevailed in only a significant and discrete 
substantive portion of the case, the application must

[[Page 321]]

be limited to fees and expenses allocable to the portion of the case as 
to which the applicant was the prevailing party.

[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6798, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 960.12  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the Postal 
Service's final disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as 
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the 
award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the 
underlying controversy.
    (c) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the later of 
(1) the date on which an initial decision or other recommended 
disposition of the merits of the proceeding by an adjudicative officer 
or intermediate review board becomes administratively final;
    (2) Issuance of an order disposing of any petitions for 
reconsideration of the Postal Service's final order in the proceeding;
    (3) If no petition for reconsideration is filed, the last date on 
which such a petition could have been filed;
    (4) Issuance of a final order or any other final resolution of a 
proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, which is not 
subject to a petition for reconsideration;
    (5) In proceedings under 39 U.S.C. 3005, on the date that an 
Administrative Law Judge enters an order indefinitely suspending further 
proceedings on the basis of a compromise agreement entered into between 
the parties; or
    (6) In proceedings before the Board of Contract Appeals, the Board 
of Contract Appeals decision on quantum. When the Board decides only 
entitlement and remands the issue of quantum to the parties, the final 
disposition occurs when the parties execute an agreement on quantum, or 
if the parties cannot agree on quantum and resubmit the quantum dispute 
to the Board, when the Board issues a decision on quantum.

            Subpart C_Procedures for Considering Applications


<R05>
Sec. 960.13  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other pleading or document related 
to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the 
proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, 
except as provided in Sec. 960.11(b) for confidential financial 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 960.14  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel 
representing the Postal Service may file an answer to the application. 
Unless the Postal Service counsel requests an extension of time for 
filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) 
of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may 
be treated as a consent to the award requested.
    (b) If the Postal Service counsel and the applicant believe that the 
issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a 
statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this 
statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 
30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the adjudicative 
officer upon request by Postal Service counsel and the applicant.
    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the Postal 
Service's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not

Sec. 960.16  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and Postal 
Service may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is 
served or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting 
party may not participate further in proceedings on the application

requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of 
matters raised in the comments.


<R05>
Sec. 960.17  Settlement.

    The applicant and the Postal Service may agree on a proposed 
settlement of the award before final action on the application, either

Sec. 960.18  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the

adjudicative officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal 
conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, or an 
evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when 
necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the 
application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or 
not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be 
determined on the basis of the entire administrative record that is made 
in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are 
sought.
    (b) A request that the adjudicative officer order further 
proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the 
information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the 
additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

    (a) The adjudicative officer shall issue an initial decision on the 
application as promptly as possible after completion of proceedings on 
the application. The decision shall include written findings and 
conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing 
party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the 
amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also 
include, if at issue, findings on whether the Postal Service's position 
was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the 
proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If 
the applicant has sought an award against the Postal Service and another 
agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any 
award made between the Postal Service and the other agency, and shall 
explain the reasons for the allocation made.
    (b) The Board of Contract Appeals shall issue its decision on the 
application as promptly as possible after completion of proceedings on 
the application. Whenever possible, the decision shall be made by the 
same Administrative Judge or panel that decided the contract appeal for 
which fees are sought. The decision shall be in the format described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

    (a) Either the applicant or Postal Service counsel may seek review 
of the initial decision on the fee application, in accordance with Sec. 
952.25 or Sec. 953.14. If neither the applicant nor the Postal Service 
counsel seeks review, the initial decision on the application shall 
become a final decision of the Postal Service 30 days after it is 
issued. If review is taken, the Judicial Officer will issue a final 
decision on the application or remand the application to the

[[Page 323]]

adjudicative officer for further proceedings.
    (b) In Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, either party may seek 
reconsideration of the decision on the fee application in accordance 
with 39 CFR 955.30.

determination on the award is made, appeal the determination to the 
court of the United States having jurisdiction to review the merits of 
the underlying decision of the agency adversary adjudication in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).

[52 FR 6799, Mar. 5, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 960.22  Payment of award.

Sec. 961.5  Effect of Petition filing.

    Upon receipt and docketing of the employee's Petition for a hearing,

section 5 of the Debt Collection Act, a timely-filed Petition for a 
hearing stays further collection action.


<R05>

representation of parties.

    (a) Filing. All documents relating to the Debt Collection Act

Official.

    (d) Representation of parties. After the filing of the Petition, 
further document transmittals for, or communications with, the 
Postmaster/Installation Head or Postal Service shall be through their 
representative, the General Counsel, or, if an appropriate notice of 
appearance is filed, the General Counsel's designee. If a notice of 
appearance by an attorney authorized to practice law in any of the 
United States or the District of Columbia or a territory of the United 
States is filed in behalf of an employee, further transmissions of 
documents and other communications with the employee shall be made 
through his or her attorney rather than directly with the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 961.7  Answer to Petition and Supplement to Petition.

    If the employee's Petition states reasons to support the employee's 
position, within 15 days from notice of the Petition, the General 
Counsel shall file an Answer to the Petition, and attach all available 
relevant records and documents in support of the Postal Service's claim, 
and a list of witnesses the Postal Service intends to call if an oral 
hearing is granted. If the employee files a Supplement to the Petition,

    The Hearing Official shall provide a full and fair hearing. The

no later than 60 days after the filing of the employee's hearing 
Petition. The Hearing Official's authority includes, but is not limited 
to, the following:
    (a) Ruling on all offers, motions or requests by the parties;
    (b) Issuing any notices, orders or memoranda to the parties 
concerning the hearing proceedings;

place, date and time for the hearing or the taking of testimony by 
telephone conference;
    (e) Administering oaths or affirmations to witnesses, and conducting 
the hearing in a manner to maintain discipline and decorum while 
assuring

[[Page 326]]

that relevant, reliable and probative evidence is elicited on the issues 
in dispute, but irrelevant, immaterial or repetitious evidence is 
excluded;
    (f) Establishing the record in the case;
    (g) Issuing the final decision orally or in writing no later than 
sixty (60) days after the filing of the employee's hearing Petition. 
When an oral decision is rendered, a written confirmation will 
thereafter be sent to the parties. The decision must include the 
determination of the amount and validity of the alleged debt and, where 
applicable, the repayment schedule. It should also include findings and 
reasons.


<R05>
Sec. 961.9  Effect of Hearing Official's decision; motion for reconsideration.

    The Hearing Official's decision shall be the final administrative 
determination on the employee's debt or repayment schedule. No 
reconsideration of the decision will be allowed unless a motion for 
reconsideration is filed by either party within 10 days from receipt of 
the decision and shows good reasons for reconsideration. Reconsideration 
will be allowed only in the discretion of the Hearing Official. A motion 
for reconsideration by the employee will not operate to stay the 
collection action authorized by the Hearing Official's decision.


<R05>
Sec. 961.10  Waiver of employee rights.

    The Hearing Official may determine the employee has waived his or 
her right to a hearing and the employee's pay shall be offset in 
accordance with the Postal Service's offset schedule, if the employee:
    (a) Files a Petition for hearing after the end of the 15-day period 
allowed by the Act for filing the Petition, and fails to demonstrate to 
the satisfaction of the Hearing Official good cause for the delay;
    (b) Has received notice to appear at an oral hearing but fails to do 
so without showing circumstances beyond the employee's control;
    (c) Fails to file required submissions or to comply with orders of 
the Hearing Official, and the failure makes it difficult or impossible 
to hold the hearing or to issue the decision within the statutory time;
    (d) Files a withdrawal of his or her Petition for a hearing with the 
Recorder.


<R05>
Sec. 961.11  Ex parte communications.

    Ex parte communications between a Hearing Official or his staff and 
a party shall not be made. This prohibition does not apply to procedural

    Within 30 days of receiving the Postal Service's Complaint, issued

U.S.C. 3802, the Respondent may request a hearing under the Program

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the 
Respondent, at any time after receiving the Notice of Hearing required 
by Sec. 962.6, may review, and upon payment of a duplication fee

    (2) The Respondent is not entitled to review or obtain a copy of any

    (c) Requests to review or copy material under this section must be

[[Page 330]]

to the Reviewing Official who must respond within a reasonable time.


<R05>
Sec. 962.12  Depositions; interrogatories; admission of facts; production 

and inspection of documents.

    (a) General Policy and protective orders. The parties are encouraged 
to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any 
discovery procedure permitted under this part, the Presiding Officer may 
issue any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from 
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. Such 
orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for 
discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential 
information or documents. Each party shall bear its own expenses 
relating to discovery.
    (b) Depositions. (1) After the issuance of a Notice of Hearing 
described in Sec. 962.6, the parties may mutually agree to, or the 
Presiding Officer may, upon application of either party and for good 
cause shown, order the taking of testimony of any person by deposition 
upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer 
authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as 
evidence or for purposes of discovery. The application for order shall 
specify whether the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as 
evidence.
    (2) The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as 
mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, governed by 
order of the Presiding Officer.
    (3) No testimony taken by depositions shall be considered as part of 
the evidence in the hearing unless and until such testimony is offered 
and received in evidence at such hearing. Depositions will not 
ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is present and can 
testify personally at the hearing. In such instances, however, the 
deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the 
witness given at the hearing. In cases submitted for a decision on the 
record, the Presiding Officer may, in his discretion, receive 
depositions as evidence in supplementation of that record.
    (c) Interrogatories to parties. After the issuance of a Notice of 
Hearing described in Sec. 962.6, a party may serve on the other party 
written interrogatories to be answered separately in writing, signed 
under oath and returned within 30 days. Upon timely objection by the 
party, the Presiding Officer will determine the extent to which the 
interrogatories will be permitted.
    (d) Admission of facts. After the issuance of a Notice of Hearing 
described in Sec. 962.6, a party may serve upon the other party a 
request for the admission of specified facts. Within 30 days after 
service, the party served shall answer each requested fact or file 
objections thereto. The factual propositions set out in the request 
shall be deemed admitted upon the failure of a party to respond to the 
request for admission.
    (e) Production and inspection of documents. Upon motion of any party 
showing good cause therefor, and upon notice, the Presiding Officer may 
order the other party to produce and permit the inspection and copying 
or photographing of any designated documents or objects, not privileged, 
specifically identified, and their relevance and materiality to the 
cause or causes in issue explained, which are reasonably calculated to 
lead to the discovery or admissible evidence. If the parties cannot 
themselves agree thereon, the Presiding Officer shall specify just terms 
and conditions in making the inspection and taking the copies and 
photographs.
    (f) Limitations. Under no circumstances may a discovery procedure be 
used to reach
    (1) Documents, transcripts, records, or other material which a 
person is not entitled to review pursuant to Sec. 962.11;
    (2) The notice sent to the Attorney General from the Reviewing 
Official under Sec. 273.6 of this title; or
    (3) Other documents which are privileged under Federal law.

<R05>
Sec. 962.13  Subpoenas.

    (a) General. Upon written request of either party filed with the 
Recorder or on his own initiative, the Presiding Officer may issue a 
subpoena requiring:

[[Page 331]]

    (1) Testimony at a deposition. The deposing of a witness in the city 
or county where he resides or is employed or transacts his business in 
person, or at another location convenient for him that is specifically 
determined by the Presiding Officer;
    (2) Testimony at a hearing. The attendance of a witness for the 
purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and
    (3) Production of books and papers. In addition to paragraphs (a)(1) 
and (a)(2) of this section, the production by the witness at the 
deposition or hearing of books and papers designated in the subpoena.
    (b) Voluntary cooperation. Each party is expected (1) to cooperate 
and make available witnesses and evidence under its control as requested 
by the other party, without issuance of a subpoena, and (2) to secure 
voluntary attendance of desired third-party books, papers, documents, or 
other tangible things whenever possible.
    (c) Requests for subpoenas. (1) A request for a subpoena shall 
normally be filed at least:
    (i) 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a 
witness at a deposition is sought;
    (ii) 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a 
witness at a hearing is sought.
    (2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and 
general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books, papers, 
documents, or other tangible things sought.
    (3) The Presiding Officer, in his discretion, may honor requests for 
subpoenas not made within the time limitations specified in this 
paragraph.
    (d) Requests to quash or modify. Upon written request by the person 
subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any 
event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, 
the Presiding Officer may (1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is 
unreasonable and oppressive or for other good cause shown, or (2) 
require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance 
the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed books and papers. Where 
circumstances require, the Presiding Officer may act upon such a request 
at any time after a copy has been served upon the opposing party.
    (e) Form; issuance. (1) Every subpoena shall state the title of the 
proceeding, shall cite 31 U.S.C. 3804(b) as the authority under which it 
is issued, and shall command each person to whom it is directed to 
attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to produce specified 
books and papers at a time and place therein specified. In issuing a 
subpoena to a requesting party, the Presiding Officer shall sign the 
subpoena and may, in his discretion, enter the name of the witness and 
otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall 
complete the subpoena before service.
    (2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter 
rogatory or subpoena may be issued and served under the circumstances 
and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.
    (f) Service. (1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall 
arrange for service.
    (2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition 
or hearing may be served at any place. A subpoena may be served by a 
United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is 
not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena 
upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a 
copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day's attendance and 
the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law.
    (3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be 
responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of 
the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such 
charges on demand may be deemed by the Presiding Officer as sufficient 
ground for striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the 
witness has produced.

[52 FR 12904, Apr. 20, 1987, as amended at 67 FR 62179, Oct. 4, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 962.14  Enforcement of subpoenas.

    In the case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 962.9(b)(5) and 962.13, the district courts of 
the United States have jurisdiction to issue an appropriate order for 
the enforcement of such subpoena.

[[Page 332]]

Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punishable as 
contempt. In any case in which the Postal Service seeks the enforcement 
of a subpoena under this section, the Postal Service shall request the 
Attorney General to petition the district court for the district in 
which a hearing under this part is being conducted or in which the 
person receiving the subpoena resides or conducts business to issue such 
an order.


<R05>
Sec. 962.15  Sanctions.

    (a) The Presiding Officer may sanction a person, including any party 
or representative, for
    (1) Failing to comply with a lawful order or prescribed procedure;
    (2) Failing to prosecute or defend an action; or
    (3) Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, 
orderly, or fair conduct of the hearing.
    (b) Any such sanction, including but not limited to those listed in 
paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, shall reasonably relate to 
the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct.
    (c) Failure to comply with an order. When a party fails to comply 
with an order, including an order for taking a deposition, the 
production of evidence within the party's control, or a request for 
admission, the Presiding Officer may:
    (1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard 
to the information sought;
    (2) Prohibit such party from introducing evidence concerning, or 
otherwise relying upon, testimony relating to the information sought;
    (3) Permit the requesting party to introduce secondary evidence 
concerning the information sought; and
    (4) Strike any part of the pleadings or other submissions of the 
party failing to comply with such request.
    (d) Failure to prosecute or defend. If a party fails to prosecute or 
defend an action under this part commenced by service of a Complaint, 
the Presiding Officer may dismiss the action or enter an order of 
default.
    (e) Failure to make timely filing. The Presiding Officer may refuse 
to consider any motion or other pleading, report, or response which is 
not filed in a timely fashion.


<R05>
Sec. 962.16  Disqualification of reviewing official or presiding official.

    If a Respondent believes, in good faith, that the Reviewing Official 
or Presiding Officer should be disqualified because of personal bias, or 
other reason, the Respondent may file a timely and sufficient affidavit 
alleging such belief with supporting evidence. If the Presiding Officer 
finds that such allegations concerning the Reviewing Official are 
meritorious, he may direct the Reviewing Official to disqualify himself 
and request the appointment of a new Reviewing Official. Where a 
Respondent seeks the disqualification of a Presiding Officer, such 
Presiding Officer, may, in his discretion, disqualify himself at any 
time during the proceeding. In the event a Reviewing Official or 
Presiding Officer withdraws from a hearing, the proceeding shall be 
stayed until the assignment of a new Reviewing Official or Presiding 
Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 962.17  Ex parte communications.

    Communications between a Presiding Officer and a party shall not be 
made on any matter in issue unless on notice and opportunity for all 
parties to participate. This prohibition does not apply to procedural 
matters. A memorandum of any communication between the Presiding Officer 
and a party shall be transmitted by the Presiding Officer to all 
parties.


<R05>

the proceedings may be obtained by the parties at such rates as may be 
fixed by contract between the reporter and the Postal Service.


<R05>
Sec. 962.20  Initial decision.

    (a) After the conclusion of the hearing, and the receipt of briefs, 
if any,

[[Page 333]]

from the parties, the Presiding Officer shall issue a written initial 
decision, including his or her findings and determinations. Such 
decision shall include the findings of fact and conclusions of law which 
the Presiding Officer relied upon in determining whether the Respondent 
is liable under 31 U.S.C. 3802, and, if liability is found, shall set 
forth the amount of any penalties and assessments imposed.
    (b) The Presiding Officer shall promptly send to each party a copy 
of his or her initial decision, and a statement describing the right of 
any person determined to be liable under 31 U.S.C. 3802, to appeal, in 
accordance with Sec. 962.21, the decision of the Presiding Officer to 
the Judicial Officer.
    (c) Unless the Respondent appeals the Presiding Officer's initial 
decision, such decision, including the findings and determinations, is 
final.

appeal an adverse initial decision by filing, within 30 days after the 
Presiding Officer issues an initial decision, a Notice of Appeal with 
the Recorder. The Judicial Officer may extend the filing period if the 
Respondent files a request for an extension within the initial 30-day 
period and demonstrates good cause for such extension.
    (2) The Respondent's Notice of Appeal must be accompanied by a 
written brief specifying the Respondent's exceptions, and any reasons 
for such exceptions, to the Presiding Officer's initial decision.
    (3) Within 30 days of receiving the Respondent's brief, the 
Reviewing Official may file with the Judicial Officer a response to the 
Respondent's specified exceptions to the Presiding Officer's initial 
decision.
    (b) Form of review. (1) Review by the Judicial Officer will be based 
entirely on the record and written submissions.
    (2) The Judicial Officer may affirm, reduce, reverse, or remand any 
penalty or assessment determined by the Presiding Officer.
    (3) The Judicial Officer shall not consider any objection that was 
not raised in the hearing unless the interested party demonstrates that 
the failure to raise the objection before the Presiding Officer was 
caused by extraordinary circumstances.
    (4) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Judicial 
Officer that additional evidence not presented at the hearing is 
material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to 
present such evidence, the Judicial Officer shall remand the matter to 
the Presiding Officer for consideration of such additional evidence.
    (c) Decision of judicial officer. (1) The Judicial Officer shall 
promptly serve each party to the appeal with a copy of his decision and 
a statement describing the right to judicial review under 31 U.S.C. 3805 
of any Respondent determined to be liable under 31 U.S.C. 3802.
    (2) The decision of the Judicial Officer constitutes final agency 
action and becomes final and binding on the parties 60 days after it is 
issued unless a petition for judicial review is filed.

<R05>
Sec. 963.2  Scope of the rules.

    These rules of practice are applicable to cases in which the 
Prohibitory Order Processing Center Manager (hereinafter, ``Manager'') 
has issued a complaint, pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3008(d), alleging 
violation of a prohibitory order, and in which the alleged violator has 
petitioned for a hearing in the matter. As provided in 39 U.S.C. 
3008(h), subchapter II of chapter 5 (relating to administrative 
procedure) and chapter 7 (relating to judicial review) of part I of 
title 5, U.S.C., do not apply to the hearings authorized by 39 U.S.C. 
3008(d).

FR 4459, Jan. 30, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 963.3  Petition; notice of hearing; answer; filing and copies of documents; summary judgment.

    (a) Petition. Anyone against whom a complaint has been issued 
pursuant to 39 U.S.C 3008(d) may submit to the Manager a petition for 
hearing on the alleged violation. The petition must be in writing, 
signed by the petitioner or his or her attorney, and filed with the 
Manager on or before the 15th day after receipt of the complaint. The 
petition shall state the reasons why the petitioner believes the 
complaint to be erroneous. No petition received after the 15th day will 
be considered to have been filed on time, unless it was duly sent to the 
Manager via certified mail, deposited in the U.S. mail on or before the 
15th day. The Manager will forward each timely petition to the Recorder, 
Judicial Officer Department, U.S. Postal Service, 2101 Wilson Boulevard, 
Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201-3078.
    (b) Notice of hearing. Upon receiving a petition, the Recorder shall 
schedule a hearing for a date not later than 30 days after the date of 
receipt, issue and send a notice of hearing to the parties, and send a 
copy of the petition to the General Counsel of the U.S. Postal Service.
    (c) Answer. The General Counsel shall file with the Recorder an 
answer to the petition within 15 days after the date of receiving a copy 
thereof. A certified copy of the material documents from the Manager's 
case file (i.e., of the PS Forms 1500, Application for Listing and/or 
Prohibitory Order, 2152, Prohibitory Order, and 2153, Complaint, 
underlying mail pieces, and pertinent return receipts) shall be appended 
to the answer.
    (d) Filing and copies of documents. With the exception of the 
initial petition, all documents shall be filed with the Recorder in 
triplicate at the address set forth above. The Recorder shall promptly 
provide copies to the other party to the proceeding and to the presiding 
officer.
    (e) Summary Judgment. Upon motion of either the General Counsel or 
the petitioner, or on his or her own initiative, the presiding officer 
may find that the petition and answer present no genuine and material 
issues of fact requiring an evidentiary hearing, and thereupon may 
render an initial decision upholding or dismissing the complaint. The 
initial decision shall become the final agency decision if a timely

<R05>
Sec. 964.2  Scope of rules.

    The rules in this part provide for administrative review of cases in 
which the Chief Postal Inspector or his delegate, acting pursuant to 39 
U.S.C. 3003(a), has withheld from delivery mail which he believes is 
involved in a scheme described in section 3003(a), and cases in which 
the Chief Postal Inspector or his delegate, acting pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 
3004, determines that letters or parcels sent in the mail are addressed 
to places not the residence or regular business address of the person 
for whom they are intended to enable the person to escape 
identification.

pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3003(a) or 3004 may oppose such action by filing 
with the Judicial Officer a written Petition stating the reasons for his 
or her opposition. The Petition, signed by the Petitioner or his 
attorney, shall be filed by sending the Petition via certified mail to 
the Recorder,

[[Page 339]]

Judicial Officer Department, U.S. Postal Service, 2101 Wilson Boulevard, 
Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201-3078. The Petition must be postmarked 
within 14 days of the date upon which the Petitioner received the 
notice. The failure of an addressee who has received notice of withheld 
mail to file a Petition opposing such action with the Judicial Officer 
shall constitute a waiver of hearing and further procedural steps by the 
addressee. The Chief Postal Inspector or his or her designee of the 
Postal Service shall thereupon file the matter with the Judicial Officer 
for issuance of a final order pursuant to Sec. 964.19. Such referral 
shall contain a statement of the basis for the detention, evidence that 
the notice of the detention and the addressee's right to petition for 
review under this part were served on the addressee in person or by 
mailing a copy to the address to which the detained mail is directed, 
the date of such service, and a copy of the proposed order sought by the 
Chief Postal Inspector or his or her designee.
    (b) Notice of hearing. On receipt of the Petition, the Recorder 
shall schedule a hearing on a date not later than 28 days after the date 
of receipt. A Notice of Hearing shall be sent to the Petitioner. A copy 
of the Notice of Hearing and the Petition shall be sent to the Chief 
Postal Inspector or his or her designee of the U.S. Postal Service.
    (c) Answer. The Chief Postal Inspector or his or her designee of the 
Postal Service shall file an Answer to the Petition within 10 days of 
receipt of the Petition from the Recorder.
    (d) Summary judgment. Upon motion of either the Chief Postal 
Inspector or his or her designee or the Petitioner, or upon his own 
initiative, the presiding officer may find that the Petition and Answer 
present no material issues of fact requiring an evidentiary hearing and 
thereupon may render an initial decision granting or dismissing the 
Petition. The initial decision shall become the final agency decision if 
a timely appeal is not taken pursuant to Sec. 964.16 of this part.

oral hearing should be filed not later than 10 days prior to the date 
set for hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 964.6  Default.

    If a Petitioner fails to appear at the hearing without notice or

Petitioner.


<R05>
Sec. 964.9  Discovery; interrogatories; admission of facts; production and 

inspection of documents.

    (a) General policy and protective orders. The parties are encouraged 
to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any 
discovery procedure permitted under this part, the presiding officer may 
issue any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from 
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. Such 
orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for 
discovery, and provisions for protecting confidential information or 
documents from unwarranted public disclosure. Each party shall bear its 
own expenses relating to discovery.
    (b) Depositions. (1) After the issuance of a notice of hearing 
described in Sec. 964.3 of this part, the parties may mutually agree 
to, or the presiding officer may, upon application of either party and 
for good cause shown, order the taking of testimony of any person by 
deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any 
officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for 
use as evidence or for purposes of discovery. The application for order 
shall specify whether the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for 
use as evidence, or both.
    (2) The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as 
mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, governed by 
order of the presiding officer.
    (3) No testimony taken by depositions shall be considered as part of 
the evidence in the hearing unless and until such testimony is offered 
and received in evidence at such hearing. Depositions will not 
ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is present and can 
testify personally at the hearing. In such instances, however, the 
deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the 
witness given at the hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the 
presiding officer may, in his discretion, receive depositions as 
evidence in supplementation of the record.
    (c) Interrogatories to parties. Not later than 5 days after the

the Answer described in Sec. 964.3, a party may serve upon the other 
party a request for the admission of specified facts. Within 10

[[Page 341]]

days after receipt of the request for admissions, the party served shall 
admit or answer each specified fact or file objections thereto. Any 
factual propositions set out in the request to which a party fails to 
respond shall be deemed admitted.
    (e) Production and inspection of documents. Upon motion of any party 
showing good cause therefor, and upon notice, the presiding officer may 
order the other party to produce and permit the inspection and copying 
or photographing of any designated documents and or objects, provided 
that such documents and objects are not privileged, their relevance to 
the cause or causes in issue is explained, and they are reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. If the 
parties cannot themselves agree thereon, the presiding officer shall 
specify the terms and conditions for making the inspection and taking 
the copies and photographs.


<R05>
Sec. 964.10  Evidence.

<R05>
Sec. 965.9  Evidence.

    (a) In general, admissibility will hinge on relevancy and 
materiality. However, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative

presentation of cumulative evidence.
    (b) Testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation and witnesses 
are subject to cross-examination.

Sec. 965.11  Initial decision.

    The presiding officer shall render an initial decision in writing, 
based on the record, as expeditiously as possible, but to the extent 
practicable within 10 working days of closing of the record. The 
decision will be brief, containing summary findings of fact, conclusions 
of law, and reasons therefor. If there has been a hearing the presiding 
officer may in his discretion render an oral decision. A typed copy of 
such oral decision will subsequently be furnished to the parties to 
establish the date for commencement of time for requesting review of the 
initial decision.


<R05>
Sec. 965.12  Appeal.

    Within 10 days after receipt by the parties of the initial or 
tentative decision, either party may file an appeal to the Judicial 
Officer. The Judicial Officer, or by delegation the Associate Judicial 
Officer, in his or her sole discretion, also may review the initial or 
tentative decision on his or her own initiative. If an appeal is denied, 
the initial or tentative decision becomes the final agency decision upon 
the issuance of such denial. If an appeal is not filed and the Judicial 
Officer, or by delegation the Associate Judicial Officer does not review 
the initial or tentative decision on his or her own initiative, a final 
order will be issued. The Judicial Officer's decision on appeal or his 
or her final order is the final agency decision with no further agency 
review or appeal rights.

<R05>

[62 FR 63279, Nov. 28, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 66053, Dec. 1, 1998]


<R05>

and 4:45 p.m., eastern standard or daylight saving time as appropriate 
during the year.) The Recorder will transmit a copy of each document 
filed to the other party, and the original to the Hearing Official.
    (b) Docketing. The Recorder will maintain a docket record of 
proceedings under this part and will assign each petition a docket 
number. After notification of the docket number, the former employee and

which event the period runs until the close of business on the next 
business day.
    (d) Representation of parties. After the filing of the petition, 
further document transmittals for, or communications with, the Postal 
Service shall be through its representative, the General Counsel. If a 
former employee is represented by an attorney authorized to practice law 
in any of the United States or the District of Columbia or a territory 
of the United States, further transmissions of documents and other 
communications with the former employee shall be made through his or her 
attorney rather than directly with the former employee.


<R05>
Sec. 966.7  Answer to petition.

    Within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of the petition, 
the General Counsel shall file an answer to the petition, and attach all 
available relevant records and documents in support of the Postal 
Service's claim, or the administrative offset schedule proposed by the

objection; a list of witnesses the Postal Service intends to call if an 
oral hearing is requested and the request is granted; a synopsis of the 
testimony of each witness; a statement of concurrence or objection to 
the proposed location and dates for the oral hearing; and a statement of 
the basis for the determination of debt or offset schedule if not 
contained in the relevant records or documents. If the former employee 
files a supplement to the petition, the General Counsel may file any 
supplemental answer and records to support the position of the Postal 
Service within twenty (20) calendar days from the date of receipt of the 
supplement filed with the Recorder.


<R05>
Sec. 966.8  Authority and responsibilities of Hearing Official or Judicial Officer.

    (a) In processing a case under this part, the Hearing Official's 
authority includes, but is not limited to, the following:
    (1) Ruling on all offers, motions, or requests by the parties;
    (2) Issuing any notices, orders, or memoranda to the parties 
concerning the hearing procedures;
    (3) Conducting telephone conferences with the parties to expedite 
the proceedings (a memorandum of a telephone conference will be 
transmitted to both parties);
    (4) Determining if an oral hearing is necessary, the type of oral 
hearing that would be appropriate, and setting the place, date, and time 
for such hearing;
    (5) Administering oaths or affirmations to witnesses;
    (6) Conducting the hearing in a manner to maintain discipline and 
decorum while assuring that relevant, reliable, and probative evidence 
is elicited on the issues in dispute, and that irrelevant, immaterial, 
or repetitious evidence is excluded;
    (7) Establishing the record in the case;
    (8) Issuing an initial decision or one on remand; and
    (9) Granting, at the request of either party, reasonable time 
extensions.

[[Page 348]]

    (b) The Judicial Officer, in addition to possessing such authority 
as is described elsewhere in this part, shall possess all of the 
authority and responsibilities of a Hearing Official.


<R05>
Sec. 966.9  Opportunity for oral hearing.

    An oral hearing generally will be held only in those cases which, in 
the opinion of the Hearing Official, cannot be resolved by a review of 
the documentary evidence, such as when the existence, or amount, of a 
debt turns on issues of credibility or veracity. An oral hearing 
includes an in-person hearing, a telephonic hearing, or a hearing by 
video conference. When the Hearing Official determines that an oral 
hearing is not necessary, the decision shall be based solely on written 
submissions.


<R05>
Sec. 966.10  Initial decision.

    (a) After the receipt of written submissions or after the conclusion 
of the hearing and the receipt of any post-hearing briefs, the Hearing 
Official shall issue a written initial decision, including findings of 
fact and conclusions of law, which the Hearing Official relied upon in 
determining whether the former employee is indebted to the Postal 
Service, or in upholding or revising the administrative offset schedule 
proposed by the Postal Service for collecting a former employee's debt. 
When the Judicial Officer presides at a hearing he or she shall issue a 
final or a tentative decision.
    (b) The Hearing Official shall promptly send to each party a copy of 
the initial or tentative decision, and a statement describing the right 
of appeal to the Judicial Officer in accordance with Sec. 966.11.


<R05>
Sec. 966.11  Appeal.

    The initial or tentative decision will become final and an order to 
that effect will be issued by the Judicial Officer thirty (30) days 
after issuance and receipt by the parties of the initial or tentative 
decision unless the Judicial Officer, in his discretion, grants review 
upon appeal by either party, or on his own motion. If an appeal is 
denied, the initial or tentative decision becomes the final agency 
decision upon the issuance of such denial. The Judicial Officer's 
decision on appeal is the final agency decision with no further right of 
appeal within the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 966.12  Waiver of rights.

    The Hearing Official may determine the former employee has waived 
his or her right to a hearing and administrative offset may be initiated 
if the former employee:
    (a) Files a petition for hearing after the end of the prescribed 
thirty (30) day period, and fails to demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Hearing Official good cause for the delay;
    (b) Has received notice to appear at an oral hearing but fails to do 
so without showing circumstances beyond the former employee's control;
    (c) Fails to file required submissions or to comply with orders of 
the Hearing Official; or
    (d) Files a withdrawal of his or her petition for a hearing with the 
Recorder.


<R05>
Sec. 966.13  Ex parte communications.

    Ex parte communications between a Hearing Official or his or her 
staff and a party shall not be made. This prohibition does not apply to 
procedural matters. A memorandum of any communication between the 
Hearing Official and a party will be transmitted to both parties.

regarding (1) a particular matter (substantive or procedural) at issue 
in contested proceedings before the Commission or (2) the substantive 
merits of a matter that is likely to become a particular matter at issue 
in contested proceedings before the Commission. A particular matter is 
at issue in contested proceedings before the Commission when it is a 
subject of controversy in a hearing held under 39 U.S.C. 3624 or 
3661(c). However, this section does not prohibit participation in off-
the-record proceedings conducted under regulations adopted by the

receives such a communication, shall--within 2 workdays after the 
receipt of such a communication--prepare a written report concerning the 
communication. The report shall identify the employee and the person or 
persons who participated in the ex parte communication; the 
circumstances which resulted in the communication; the substance of the 
communication; and the relationship of the communication to a particular 
matter at issue or likely to become at issue in contested proceedings 
before the Commission. When the ex parte communication concerns a 
particular matter at issue in a proceeding before the Commission, a copy 
of the report shall be submitted to each party to the proceeding. The 
report is a public record of the Commission and a copy thereof shall be 
available to any member of the public on request. This section does not 
apply to ex parte communications under paragraph 3000.735-501(b).

<R05>
   Sec. Appendix A to Part 3000--Code of Ethics For Government Service

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that the following Code of Ethics 
should be adhered to by all Government employees, including office-
holders:

                  code of ethics for government service

    Any person in Government service should:
    1. Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above 
loyalty to persons, party, or Government department.
    2. Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the 
United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to 
their evasion.
    3. Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving to the 
performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.
    4. Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of 
getting tasks accomplished.
    5. Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors 
or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never 
accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under 
circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as 
influencing the performance of his governmental duties.
    6. Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of 
office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be 
binding on public duty.
    7. Engage in no business with the Government, either directly or 
indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of 
his governmental duties.
    8. Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the 
performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit.

[[Page 353]]

    9. Expose corruption wherever discovered.
    10. Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a 
public trust.
    Passed July 11, 1958.

of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes administered by the

Any filing that is rejected is deemed not to have been filed with the 
Commission. If a filing is rejected, the Secretary or the Secretary's 
designee will notify the person submitting the filing, indicating the 
reason(s) for rejection. Acceptance for filing shall not waive any 
failure to comply with this part, and such failure may be cause for 
subsequently striking all or any part of any document.
    (e) Account holder exemptions. Notices of intervention and comments 
solicited by the Commission may be filed under temporary Filing Online 
accounts.

subscription requirements of Sec. 11. Other categories of documents may 
be filed under temporary Filing Online accounts under extraordinary 
circumstances, for good cause shown.

in these rules, in any case noticed for a proceeding to be determined on 
the record pursuant to Sec. 3001.17(a), the Commission may hold a

Sec. 3001.20  Formal intervention.

    (a) Who may intervene. A notice of intervention will be entertained 
in those cases that are noticed for a proceeding pursuant to Sec. 
3001.17(a) from any person claiming an interest of such nature that 
intervention is allowed by the Act, or appropriate to its 
administration.
    (b) Contents. A notice of intervention shall clearly and concisely 
set forth the nature and extent of the intervenor's interest in the 
issues to be decided, including the classifications of postal service 
utilized by the intervenor giving rise to his/her interest in the 
proceeding, and to the extent known, the position of the intervenor with 
regard to the proposed changes in postal rates, fees, classifications, 
or services, or the subject matter of the complaint, as described in the 
notice of the proceeding. Such notice shall state whether or not the 
intervenor requests a hearing or in lieu thereof, a conference, and 
whether or not the intervenor intends to actively participate in a 
hearing. Such notice shall also include on page one thereof the name and 
full mailing address of no more than two persons who are to receive 
service of any documents relating to such proceeding.

[[Page 363]]

    (c) Form and time of filing. Notices of intervention shall be filed 
no later than the date fixed for such filing in any notice or order with 
respect to the proceeding issued by the Commission or its Secretary, 
unless in extraordinary circumstances for good cause shown, the 
Commission authorizes a late filing. Notices of intervention shall 
conform to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12.
    (d) Oppositions. Oppositions to notices of intervention may be filed 
by any participant in the proceeding no later than 10 days after the 
notice of intervention is filed. Pending Commission action, an 
opposition to intervention shall delay on a day-for-day basis, the date 
for responses to discovery requests filed by that intervenor.
    (e) Effect of intervention. A person filing a notice of intervention 
shall be a party to the proceeding subject, however, to a determination 
by the Commission, either in response to an opposition, or sua sponte, 
that party status is not appropriate under the Act. Intervenors are also 
subject to the right of the Commission or the presiding officer as 
specified in Sec. 3001.24 to require two or more intervenors having 
substantially like interests and positions to join together for purposes 
of service of documents, presenting evidence, making and arguing motions 
and objections, cross-examining witnesses, filing briefs, and presenting 
oral arguments to the Commission or presiding officer. No intervention 
shall be deemed to constitute a decision that the intervening party has 
such an interest in the proceeding that he/she would be aggrieved by an 
ultimate decision by order of the Commission.

participator may be filed by any participant in the proceeding no later 
than 10 days after the notice of intervention as a limited participator 
is filed.
    (c) Scope of participation. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 
3001.30(f), limited participators may present evidence which is relevant 
to the issues involved in the proceeding and their testimony shall be 
subject to cross-examination on the same terms applicable to that of 
formal participants. Limited participants may file briefs or proposed 
findings pursuant to Sec. Sec. 3001.34 and 3001.35, and within 15 days 
after the release of an intermediate decision, or such other time as may 
be fixed by the Commission, they may file a written statement of their 
position on the issues. The Commission or the presiding officer may 
require limited participators having substantially like interests and 
positions to join together for any or all of the above purposes. Limited 
participators are not required to respond to discovery requests under 
Sec. Sec. 3001.25 through 3001.28 except to the extent that those 
requests are directed specifically to testimony which the limited 
participators provided in the proceeding; however, limited 
participators, particularly those making contentions under 39 U.S.C. 
3622(b)(4), are advised that failure to provide relevant and material 
information in support of their claims will be taken into account in 
determining the weight to be placed on their evidence and arguments.

Sec. 3001.22  Requests for waiver.

    Upon request by motion, any requirement of any subpart of this Part 
3001 may be waived in whole or in part to the extent permitted by law 
upon a showing that such waiver will not unduly prejudice the interests 
of other participants and is consistent with the public interest and the 
Commission's expeditious discharge of its responsibilities under the 
Act. A request for waiver shall not be entertained unless it is timely 
filed so as to permit Commission disposition of the request prior to the 
date specified for the requirement for which waiver is requested. The 
pendency of a request for waiver does

[[Page 365]]

not justify or excuse any person from timely meeting the requirements of 
this part.

Sec. 3001.23  Presiding officers.

    (a) Authority delegated. Presiding officers shall have the 
authority, within the Commission's powers and subject to its published 
rules, as follows:
    (1) To regulate the course of the hearing, including the recessing, 
reconvening, and adjournment thereof, unless otherwise directed by the 
Commission, as provided in Sec. 3001.16;
    (2) To administer oaths and affirmations;
    (3) To issue subpoenas authorized by law;
    (4) To rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;
    (5) To take or authorize that depositions be taken as provided in 
Sec. 3001.33;
    (6) To hold appropriate conferences before or during hearings and to 
rule on matters raised at such conferences including those specified in 
paragraph (d) of Sec. 3001.24;
    (7) To dispose of procedural requests or similar matters but not, 
before their initial or recommended decision, to dispose of motions made 
during hearings to dismiss proceedings or other motions which involve a 
final determination of the proceeding;
    (8) Within their discretion, or upon direction of the Commission, to 
certify any question to the Commission for its consideration and 
disposition;
    (9) To submit an initial or recommended decision in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 3001.38 and 3001.39; and
    (10) To take any other action necessary or appropriate to the 
discharge of the duties vested in them, consistent with the statutory or 
other authorities under which the Commission functions and with the 
rules, regulations, and policies of the Commission.
    (b) Conduct of hearings. It is the duty of the presiding officer to 
conduct a fair and impartial hearing and to maintain order. Any 
disregard by participants or counsel of his/her rulings on matters of 
order and procedure shall be noted on the record, and where he/she deems 
it necessary shall be made the subject of a special written report to 
the Commission. In the event that participants or counsel should be 
guilty of disrespectful, disorderly, or contumacious language or conduct 
in connection with any hearing, the presiding officer immediately may 
submit to the Commission his/her report thereon, together with his/her 
recommendations, and in his/her discretion, suspend the hearing.
    (c) Ex parte communication. Except to the extent required for the 
disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law and by the rules of 
the Commission, no presiding officer shall, in any proceeding in which 
the Commission may so direct, or in any proceeding required by statute 
to be determined on the record after opportunity for hearing, consult 
any person on any matter in issue unless upon notice and opportunity for 
all participants to be heard.
    (d) Disqualification. A presiding officer may withdraw from a 
proceeding when he/she deems himself disqualified, or may be withdrawn 
by the Commission for good cause found after timely affidavits alleging 
personal bias or other disqualifications have been filed.

<R05>
Sec. 3001.24  Prehearing conferences.

    (a) Initiation and purposes. In any proceeding the Commission or the 
presiding officer may, with or without motion, upon due notice as to 
time and place, direct the participants in a proceeding to appear for a 
prehearing conference for the purposes of considering all possible ways 
of expediting the proceeding, including those in paragraph (d) of this 
section. It is the intent of the Commission to issue its recommended 
decision or advisory opinion on requests under sections 3622, 3623, and 
3661 of the Act with the utmost practicable expedition. The Commission 
directs that these prehearing procedures shall be rigorously pursued by 
the presiding officer and all participants to that end.
    (b) Informal off-the-record procedures. In order to make the 
prehearing conference as effective as possible, the presiding officer 
may, in his/her discretion, direct that conferences be held off

[[Page 366]]

the record at the beginning of a prehearing conference or at other 
appropriate times, without the presiding officer being present. Such 
informal off-the-record conferences shall be presided over by the 
Commission's officer designated to represent the interests of the 
general public or such other person as the participants may select. At 
such off-the-record conferences the participants shall be expected to 
reach agreement on those matters which will expedite the proceeding, 
including the matters specified in the notice of the prehearing 
conference, in the ruling of the presiding officer directing that the 
off-the-record conference be held and in paragraph (d) of this section. 
A report on the results of such off-the-record conference shall be made 
to the presiding officer on the record at a time specified by the 
presiding officer and he/she shall then determine the further prehearing 
procedures to be followed.
    (c) Required preparation and cooperation of all parties. All 
participants in any proceeding before the Commission are required and 
expected to come to the prehearing conference fully prepared to discuss 
in detail and resolve all matters specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section, and notice of the prehearing conference, and such other notice 
or agenda as may have been issued by the Commission or the presiding 
officer. All participants are required and expected to cooperate fully 
at all stages of the proceeding to achieve these objectives, through 
thorough advance preparation for the prehearing conference, including 
informal communications between the participants, requests for discovery 
and appropriate discovery procedures at the earliest possible time and 
no later than at the prehearing conference, and the commencement of 
preparation of evidence and cross-examination. The failure of any 
participant to appear at the prehearing conference or to raise any 
matters that could reasonably be anticipated and resolved at the 
prehearing conference shall not be permitted to unduly delay the 
progress of the proceeding and shall constitute a waiver of the rights 
of the participant with regard thereto, including all objections to the 
agreements reached, actions taken, or rulings issued by the presiding 
officer with regard thereto.
    (d) Matters to be pursued. At the prehearing conference in any 
proceeding, the presiding officer and the participants shall consider 
and resolve the following matters:
    (1) The definition and simplification of the issues including any 
appropriate explanation, clarification, or amendment of any proposal, 
filing, evidence, complaint or other pleading filed by any participant;
    (2) Arrangement for timely completion of discovery from the Postal 
Service or any other participant concerning information desired by any 
participant with regard to any issues in the proceeding or prior 
filings, evidence or pleadings of any participant;
    (3) Agreement as to procedures for timely discovery with regard to 
any future evidentiary filings of any participant;
    (4) Stipulations, admissions or concessions as to evidentiary facts, 
and agreements as to documentary matters, exhibits and matters of 
official notice, which will avoid unnecessary proof or dispute;
    (5) Grouping parties with substantially like interests for purposes 
of presenting evidence, making and arguing motions and objections, 
cross-examining witnesses, filing briefs, and presenting oral argument 
to the Commission or presiding officer;
    (6) Disclosure of the number, identity and qualifications of 
witnesses, and the nature of their testimony, particularly with respect 
to the policies of the Act and, as applicable according to the nature of 
the proceeding, each factor stated in section 3622 or 3623 of the Act;
    (7) Limitation of the scope of the evidence and the number of 
witnesses to eliminate irrelevant, immaterial, or cumulative and 
repetitious evidence;
    (8) Procedures to direct and control the use of discovery prior to 
the hearing and submission of written testimony and exhibits on matters 
in dispute so as to restrict to a bare minimum the amount of hearing 
time required for oral cross-examination of witnesses;
    (9) Division of the proceeding where practicable into two or more 
phases for separate simultaneous hearings;

[[Page 367]]

    (10) Fixing dates for the submission and service of such written 
testimony and exhibits as may be appropriate in advance of the hearing;
    (11) Order of presentation of the evidence and cross-examination of 
witnesses so that the hearing may proceed in the most expeditious and 
orderly manner possible; and
    (12) All other matters which would aid in an expeditious disposition 
of the proceeding, including consent of the participants to the conduct 
of the entire proceedings off the record.
    (e) Rulings by presiding officer. The presiding officer at such 
prehearing conference, irrespective of the consent of the participants, 
shall dispose of by ruling (1) any of the procedural matters itemized in 
paragraph (d) of this section and (2) such other procedural matters on 
which he/she is authorized to rule during the course of the hearing if 
ruling at this stage would expedite the proceeding. Either on the record 
at the conclusion of such prehearing conference, or by order issued 
shortly thereafter, the presiding officer shall state the agreements 
reached by the participants, the actions taken, and the rulings made by 
the presiding officer. Such rulings shall control the subsequent course 
of the proceedings unless modified at the hearing to prevent manifest 
injustice.

<R05>
Sec. 3001.25  Discovery--general policy.

    (a) Rules 26 through 28 allow discovery reasonably calculated to 
lead to admissible evidence during a noticed proceeding. Generally, 
discovery against a participant will be scheduled to end prior to the 
receipt into evidence of that participant's direct case. An exception to 
this procedure shall operate in all proceedings brought under 39 U.S.C. 
3622, 3623, 3661 and 3662 when a participant needs to obtain information 
(such as operating procedures or data) available only from the Postal 
Service. Discovery requests of this nature are permissible only for the 
purpose of the development of rebuttal testimony and may be made up to 
20 days prior to the filing date for final rebuttal testimony.
    (b) The discovery procedures set forth in rules 26 through 28 are 
not exclusive. Participants are encouraged to engage in informal 
discovery whenever possible to clarify exhibits and testimony. The 
results of these efforts may be introduced into the record by 
stipulation, by supplementary testimony or exhibit, by presenting 
selected written interrogatories and answers for adoption by a witness 
at the hearing, or by other appropriate means. In the interest of 
reducing motion practice, parties also are expected to use informal 
means to clarify questions and to identify portions of discovery 
requests considered overbroad or burdensome.
    (c) If a participant or an officer or agent of a participant fails 
to obey an order of the Commission or the presiding officer to provide 
or permit discovery pursuant to Sec. Sec. 3001.26 to 3001.28, the 
Commission or the presiding officer may make such orders in regard to 
the failure as are just, and among others, may direct that the matters 
regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall 
be taken to be established for the purposes of the proceeding in 
accordance with the claim of the participants obtaining the order, or 
prohibit the disobedient participant from introducing designated matters 
in evidence, or strike the evidence, complaint or pleadings or parts 
thereof.

[65 FR 6543, Feb. 10, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 3001.26  Interrogatories for purpose of discovery.

    (a) Service and contents. In the interest of expedition and limited 
to information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence, any participant may propound to any 
other participant in a proceeding written, sequentially numbered 
interrogatories, by witness, requesting nonprivileged information 
relevant to the subject matter in such proceeding, to be answered by the 
participant served, who shall furnish such information as is available 
to the participant. A participant through interrogatories may require 
any other participant to identify each person whom the other participant 
expects to call as a witness at the hearing and to state

[[Page 368]]

the subject matter on which the witness is expected to testify. The 
participant propounding the interrogatories shall file them with the 
Commission in conformance with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12. 
Follow-up interrogatories to clarify or elaborate on the answer to an 
earlier discovery request may be filed after the initial discovery 
period ends. They must be filed within seven days of receipt of the 
answer to the previous interrogatory unless extraordinary circumstances 
are shown.
    (b) Answers. Answers to discovery requests shall be prepared so that 
they can be incorporated as written cross-examination. Each answer shall 
begin on a separate page, identify the individual responding and the 
relevant testimony number, if any, the participant who asked the 
question, and the number and text of the question. Each interrogatory 
shall be answered separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected 
to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in the 
manner prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section. The participant 
responding to the interrogatories shall file the answers in conformance 
with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12 within 14 days of the filing of 
the interrogatories or within such other period as may be fixed by the 
Commission or presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the 
hearing.
    (c) Objections. In the interest of expedition, the bases for 
objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If objection is made to 
part of an interrogatory, the part shall be specified. A participant 
claiming privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary privilege 
asserted and state the reasons for its applicability. A participant 
claiming undue burden shall state with particularity the effort that 
would be required to answer the interrogatory, providing estimates of 
cost and work hours required, to the extent possible. An interrogatory 
otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable because an answer 
would involve an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the 
application of law to fact, but the Commission or presiding officer may 
order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until a prehearing 
conference or other later time. Objections shall be filed with the 
Commission in conformance with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12 within 
10 days of the filing of the interrogatories.
    (d) Motions to compel responses to discovery. Motions to compel a 
more responsive answer, or an answer to an interrogatory to which an 
objection was interposed, should be filed within 14 days of the answer 
or objection to the discovery request. The text of the discovery 
request, and any answer provided, should be provided as an attachment to 
the motion to compel. Participants who have objected to interrogatories 
which are the subject of a motion to compel shall have seven days to 
answer. Answers will be considered supplements to the arguments 
presented in the initial objection.
    (e) Compelled answers. The Commission, or the presiding officer, 
upon motion of any participant to the proceeding, may compel a more 
responsive answer, or an answer to an interrogatory to which an 
objection has been raised if the objection is found not to be valid, or 
may compel an additional answer if the initial answer is found to be 
inadequate. Such compelled answers shall be filed in conformance with 
Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12 within seven days of the date of the 
order compelling an answer or within such other period as may be fixed 
by the Commission or presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the 
hearing.
    (f) Supplemental answers. The individual or participant who has 
answered interrogatories is under the duty to seasonably amend a prior 
answer if he/she obtains information upon the basis of which he/she 
knows that the answer was incorrect when made or is no longer true. 
Participants shall serve supplemental answers to update or to correct 
responses whenever necessary, up until the date the answer could have 
been accepted into evidence as written cross-examination. Participants 
filing supplemental answers shall indicate whether the answer merely 
supplements the previous answer to make it current or whether it is a 
complete replacement for the previous answer.
    (g) Orders. The Commission or the presiding officer may order that 
any participant or person shall answer on such terms and conditions as 
are just

[[Page 369]]

and may for good cause make any protective order, including an order 
limiting or conditioning interrogatories, as justice requires to protect 
a participant or person from undue annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, 
or expense.

Sec. 3001.27  Requests for production of documents or things for purpose of discovery.

    (a) Service and contents. In the interest of expedition and limited 
to information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence, any participant may serve on any other 
participant to the proceeding a request to produce and permit the 
participant making the request, or someone acting in his/her behalf, to 
inspect and copy any designated documents or things that constitute or 
contain matters, not privileged, that are relevant to the subject matter 
involved in the proceeding and that are in the custody or control of the 
participant to whom the request is addressed. The request shall set 
forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or category, 
and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity, and 
shall specify a reasonable time, place and manner of making inspection. 
The participant requesting the production of documents or things shall 
file its request with the Commission in conformance with Sec. Sec. 
3001.9 through 3001.12.
    (b) Answers. The participant responding to the request shall file an 
answer with the Commission in conformance with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 
12 within 14 days after the request is filed, or within such other 
period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer. The 
answer shall state, with respect to each item or category, that 
inspection will be permitted as requested unless the request is objected 
to pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Objections. In the interest of expedition, the bases for 
objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If objection is made to 
part of an item or category, the part shall be specified. A participant 
claiming privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary privilege 
asserted and state with particularity the reasons for its applicability. 
A participant claiming undue burden shall state with particularity the 
effort that would be required to answer the request, providing estimates 
of cost and work hours required, to the extent possible. Objections 
shall be filed with the Commission in conformance with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 
through 3001.12 within 10 days of the request for production.
    (d) Motions to compel requests for production of documents or things 
for purposes of discovery. Motions to compel shall be filed within 14 
days of the answer or objection to the discovery request. The text of 
the discovery request, and any answer provided, should be provided as an 
attachment to the motion to compel. Participants who have objected to 
requests for production of documents or things which are the subject of 
a motion to compel shall have seven days to answer. Answers will be 
considered supplements to the arguments presented in the initial 
objection.
    (e) Compelled answers. Upon motion of any participant to the 
proceeding to compel a response to discovery, as provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section, the Commission or the presiding officer may compel 
production of documents or things to which an objection is found not to 
be valid. Such compelled documents or things shall be made available to 
the participant making the motion within seven days of the date of the 
order compelling production or within such other period as may be fixed 
by the Commission or presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the 
hearing. When complying with orders to produce documents or things, 
notice shall be filed in conformance with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 
3001.12. The Commission or the presiding officer may, on such terms and 
conditions as are just and reasonable, order that any participant in a 
proceeding shall respond to a request for inspection, and may make any 
protective order of the nature provided in Sec. 3001.26(g) as may be 
appropriate.

Sec. 3001.28  Requests for admissions for purpose of discovery.

    (a) Service and content. In the interest of expedition, any 
participant may serve upon any other participant a written request for 
the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding only, of any 
relevant, unprivileged facts, including the genuineness of any documents 
or exhibits to be presented in the hearing. The participant requesting 
the admission shall file its request with the Commission in conformance 
with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12.
    (b) Answers. Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be 
separately set forth and is admitted unless within 14 days after the 
request is filed, or within such other period as may be fixed by the 
Commission or presiding officer, the participant to whom the request is 
directed files a written answer or objection pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section. A participant who answers a request for admission shall 
file its answer with the Commission in conformance with Sec. Sec. 
3001.9 through 3001.12.
    (c) Objections. In the interest of expedition, the bases for 
objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If objection is made to 
part of an item, the part shall be specified. A participant claiming 
privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary privilege asserted and 
state the reasons for its applicability. A participant claiming undue 
burden shall state with particularity the effort that would be required 
to answer the request, providing estimates of cost and work hours 
required to the extent possible. Objections shall be filed with the 
Commission in conformance with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12, within 
10 days of the request for admissions.
    (d) Motions to compel responses to requests for admissions. Motions 
to compel a more responsive answer, or an answer to a request to which 
an objection was interposed, shall be filed within 14 days of the answer 
or objection to the request for admissions. The text of the request for 
admissions, and any answer provided, should be provided as an attachment 
to the motion to compel. Participants who have objected to requests for 
admissions which are the subject of a motion to compel shall have seven 
days to answer. Answers will be considered supplements to the arguments 
presented in the initial objection.
    (e) Compelled answers. Upon motion of any participant to the 
proceeding the Commission or the presiding officer may compel answers to 
a request for admissions to which an objection has been raised if the 
objection is found not to be valid. Such compelled answers shall be 
filed with the Commission in conformance with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 
3001.12 within seven days of the date of the order compelling production 
or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or the 
presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the hearing. If the 
Commission or presiding officer determines that an answer does not 
comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order either that the 
matter is admitted or that an amended answer be filed.

Sec. 3001.29  Settlement conferences.

    Any participant in a proceeding may submit offers of settlement or 
proposals of adjustment at any time and may request a conference between 
the participants to consider such offers or proposals. The Commission or 
the presiding officer shall afford the participants appropriate 
opportunity prior to or during the hearing for conferences for the 
purpose of considering such offers or proposals as time, the nature of 
the proceeding, and the public interest permit. Unaccepted offers of 
settlement or adjustment and proposed stipulations not agreed to shall 
be privileged and shall not be admissible in evidence against any 
participant claiming such privilege.


<R05>
Sec. 3001.30  Hearings.

    (a) How initiated. Hearings for the purpose of taking evidence shall 
be initiated by the issuance of a notice by the Commission as provided 
in Sec. 3001.19.
    (b) Presiding officer. All hearings shall be held before the 
Commission sitting en banc, or a duly designated presiding officer.
    (c) Entering of appearances. The Commission or the presiding officer 
before whom the hearing is held will cause to be entered on the record 
all appearances together with a notation showing

[[Page 371]]

in whose behalf each such appearance has been made.
    (d) Order of procedure. In public hearings before the Commission, 
the Postal Service shall open and close in proceedings which it has 
initiated under sections 3622, 3623, or 3661 of the Act, and a 
complainant shall open and close in proceedings on complaints filed 
under section 3662 of the Act. With respect to the order of presentation 
of all other participants, and in all other proceedings, unless 
otherwise ordered by the Commission, the presiding officer shall direct 
the order of presentation of evidence and issue such other procedural 
orders as may be necessary to assure the orderly and expeditious 
conclusion of the hearing.
    (e)(1) Presentations by participants. Any participant shall have the 
right in public hearings of presentation of evidence, cross-examination 
(limited to testimony adverse to the participant conducting the cross-
examination), objection, motion, and argument. The case-in-chief of 
participants other than the proponent shall be in writing and shall 
include the participant's direct case and rebuttal, if any, to the 
initial proponent's case-in-chief. It may be accompanied by a trial 
brief or legal memoranda. (Legal memoranda on matters at issue will be 
welcome at any stage of the proceeding.) There will be an opportunity 
for participants to rebut presentations of other participants and for 
the initial proponent to present surrebuttal evidence. New affirmative 
matter (not in reply to another participant's direct case) should not be 
included in rebuttal testimony or exhibits. When objections to the 
admission or exclusion of evidence before the Commission or the 
presiding officer are made, the grounds relied upon shall be stated. 
Formal exceptions to rulings are unnecessary.
    (2) Written cross-examination. Written cross-examination will be 
utilized as a substitute for oral cross-examination whenever possible, 
particularly to introduce factual or statistical evidence. Designations 
of written cross-examination should be served in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12 no later than three working days 
before the scheduled appearance of a witness. Designations shall 
identify every item to be offered as evidence, listing the participant 
who initially posed the discovery request, the witness and/or party to 
whom the question was addressed (if different from the witness 
answering), the number of the request and, if more than one answer is 
provided, the dates of all answers to be included in the record. (For 
example, ``OCA-T1-17 to USPS witness Jones, answered by USPS witness 
Smith (March 1, 1997) as updated (March 21, 1997)).'' When a participant 
designates written cross-examination, two hard copies of the documents 
to be included shall simultaneously be submitted to the Secretary of the 
Commission. The Secretary of the Commission shall prepare for the record 
a packet containing all materials designated for written cross-
examination in a format that facilitates review by the witness and 
counsel. The witness will verify the answers and materials in the 
packet, and they will be entered into the transcript by the presiding 
officer. Counsel may object to written cross-examination at that time, 
and any designated answers or materials ruled objectionable will be 
stricken from the record.
    (3) Oral cross-examination. Oral cross-examination will be permitted 
for clarifying written cross-examination and for testing assumptions, 
conclusions or other opinion evidence. Notices of intent to conduct oral 
cross-examination should be filed three or more working days before the 
announced appearance of the witness and should include specific 
references to the subject matter to be examined and page references to 
the relevant direct testimony and exhibits. A participant intending to 
use complex numerical hypotheticals, or to question using intricate or 
extensive cross-references, shall provide adequately documented cross-
examination exhibits for the record. Copies of these exhibits should be 
filed at least two calendar days (including one working day) before the 
scheduled appearance of the witness. They may be filed online or 
delivered in hardcopy form to counsel for the

[[Page 372]]

witness, at the discretion of the participant. If a participant has 
obtained permission to receive service of documents in hardcopy form, 
hardcopy notices of intent to conduct oral cross-examination of 
witnesses for that participant should be delivered to counsel for that 
participant and served three or more working days before the announced 
appearance of the witness, and cross-examination exhibits should be 
delivered to counsel for the witness at least two calendar days 
(including one working day) before the scheduled appearance of the 
witness.
    (f) Limitations on presentation of the evidence. The taking of 
evidence shall proceed with all reasonable diligence and dispatch, and 
to that end, the Commission or the presiding officer may limit 
appropriately (1) the number of witnesses to be heard upon any issue, 
(2) the examination by any participant to specific issues, and (3) the 
cross-examination of a witness to that required for a full and true 
disclosure of the facts necessary for the disposition of the proceeding 
and to avoid irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious testimony.
    (g) Motions during hearing. After a hearing has commenced in a 
proceeding, a request may be made by motion to the presiding officer for 
any procedural ruling or relief desired. Such motions shall set forth 
the ruling or relief sought, and state the grounds therefor and 
statutory or other supporting authority. Motions made during hearings 
may be stated orally upon the record, except that the presiding officer 
may require that such motions be reduced to writing and filed 
separately. Any participant shall have the opportunity to answer or 
object to such motions at the time and in the manner directed by the 
presiding officer.
    (h) Rulings on motions. The presiding officer is authorized to rule 
upon any such motion not formally acted upon by the Commission prior to 
the commencement of a prehearing conference or hearing where immediate 
ruling is essential in order to proceed with the prehearing conference 
or hearing, and upon any motion to the presiding officer filed or made 
after the commencement thereof, except that no motion made to the 
presiding officer, a ruling upon which would involve or constitute a 
final determination of the proceeding, shall be ruled upon affirmatively 
by the presiding officer except as a part of his intermediate decision. 
This section shall not preclude a presiding officer, within his 
discretion, from referring any motion made in hearing to the Commission 
for ultimate determination.
    (i) Transcript corrections. Corrections to the transcript of a 
hearing should not be requested except to correct a material substantive 
error in the transcription made at the hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 3001.31  Evidence.

    (a) Form and admissibility. In any public hearing before the 
Commission, or a presiding officer, relevant and material evidence which 
is not unduly repetitious or cumulative shall be admissible. Witnesses 
whose testimony is to be taken shall be sworn, or shall affirm, before 
their testimony shall be deemed evidence in the proceeding or any 
questions are put to them.
    (b) Documentary material--(1) General. Documents and detailed data 
and information shall be presented as exhibits. Exhibits should be self-
explanatory. They should contain appropriate footnotes or narrative 
explaining the source of each item of information used and the methods 
employed in statistical compilations. The principal title of each 
exhibit should state what it contains or represents. The title may also 
contain a statement of the purpose for which the exhibit is offered; 
however, this statement will not be considered part of the evidentiary 
record. Where one part of a multi-part exhibit is based on another part 
or on another exhibit, appropriate cross-references should be made. 
Relevant exposition should be included in the exhibits or provided in 
accompanying testimony. Testimony, exhibits and supporting workpapers 
prepared for Commission proceedings that are premised on data or 
conclusions developed in a library reference shall provide the location 
of that information within the library reference with sufficient 
specificity to

[[Page 373]]

permit ready reference, such as the page and line, or the file and the 
worksheet or spreadsheet page or cell. Where relevant and material 
matter offered in evidence is embraced in a document containing other 
matter not material or relevant or not intended to be put in evidence, 
the participant offering the same shall plainly designate the matter 
offered excluding the immaterial or irrelevant parts. If other matter in 
such document is in such bulk or extent as would unnecessarily encumber 
the record, it may be marked for identification, and, if properly 
authenticated, the relevant and material parts may be read into the 
record, or, if the Commission or presiding officer so directs, a true 
copy of such matter in proper form shall be received in evidence as an 
exhibit. Copies of documents shall be delivered by the participant 
offering the same to the other participants or their attorneys appearing 
at the hearing, who shall be afforded an opportunity to examine the 
entire document and to offer in evidence in like manner other material 
and relevant portions thereof.
    (2) Library references. (i) The term ``library reference'' is a 
generic term or label that participants and others may use to identify 
or designate certain documents or things (``material'') filed with the 
Commission's docket section. To the extent possible, material filed as a 
library reference shall be identified and referred to by participants in 
terms of the following categories: Category 1--Reporting Systems 
Material (consisting of library references relating to the Service's 
statistical cost and revenue reporting systems, and their primary 
outputs); Category 2--Witness Foundational Material (consisting of 
material relating to the testimony of specific witnesses, primarily that 
which is essential to the establishment of a proper foundation for 
receiving into evidence the results of studies and analyses); Category 
3--Reference Material (consisting of previously published material 
provided for the convenience of the reader, such as books, chapters or 
other portions of books, articles, reports, manuals, handbooks, guides, 
and contracts; Category 4--Material Provided in Response to Discovery 
(consisting of material provided in response to discovery requests); 
Category 5--Disassociated Material (consisting of material filed at the 
request of another, from which the filing party wishes to be 
disassociated, is not vouching for or sponsoring the material provided); 
Category 6--All Other Material (consisting of library references not 
fitting any of the other categories).
    (ii) The practice of filing a library reference is authorized 
primarily as a convenience to filing participants and the Commission 
under certain circumstances. These include when the physical 
characteristics of the material, such as number of pages, bulk, or 
format, are reasonably likely to render compliance with the service 
requirements unduly burdensome; and one of the following considerations 
apply:
    (A) Interest in the material or things so labeled is likely to be so 
limited that service on the entire list would be unreasonably 
burdensome, and the participant agrees to serve the material on 
individual participants upon request within three days of a request, or 
to provide, within the same period, an explanation of why the material 
cannot be provided within three days, and to undertake reasonable 
efforts to promptly provide the material; or
    (B) The participant satisfactorily demonstrates that designation of 
material as a library reference is appropriate because the material 
constitutes a secondary source. A secondary source is one that provides 
background for a position or matter referred to elsewhere in a 
participant's case or filing, but does not constitute essential support 
and is unlikely to be a material factor in a decision on the merits of 
issues in the proceeding; or
    (C) Reference to, identification of, or use of the material would be 
facilitated if it is filed as a library reference; or
    (D) The material is filed in compliance with a discovery request for 
production of documents or things.
    (iii) Other circumstances. If a participant considers it appropriate 
to file material as a library reference because its physical 
characteristics render service unduly burdensome, but cannot satisfy the 
terms set out in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, 
the material may be filed (by means of

[[Page 374]]

a notice) subject to the following conditions:
    (A) Inclusion in the accompanying notice of a detailed explanation 
of the reason for filing the material under this provision;
    (B) Satisfaction of all other applicable requirements relating to 
library references; and
    (C) The Commission's right to refuse acceptance of the material in 
its docket room and its right to take other action to ensure 
participants' ability to obtain access to the material.
    (iv) Filing procedure. Participants filing material as a library 
reference shall file contemporaneous written notice of this action in 
conformance with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12. The notice shall:
    (A) Set forth the reason(s) why the material is being designated as 
a library reference, with specific reference to paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) 
and (iii) of this section;
    (B) Identify the category into which the material falls and describe 
in detail what the material consists of or represents, noting matters 
such as the presence of survey results;
    (C) Explain in detail how the material relates to the participant's 
case or to issues in the proceeding;
    (D) Identify authors or others materially contributing to 
substantive aspects of the preparation or development of the library 
reference;
    (E) Identify the documents (such as testimony, exhibits, and an 
interrogatory) or request to which the library reference relates, to the 
extent practicable;
    (F) Identify other library references or testimony relied upon or 
referred to in the designated material, to the extent practicable;
    (G) Indicate whether the library reference is an update or revision 
to another library reference and, if it is, clearly identify the 
predecessor material.
    (H) To the extent feasible, identify portions expected to be entered 
into the record and the expected sponsor (if the participant filing a 
library reference anticipates seeking, on its own behalf, to enter all 
or part of the material contained therein into the evidentiary record).
    (v) Labeling. Material filed as a library reference shall be labeled 
in a manner consistent with standard Commission notation and any other 
conditions the presiding officer or Commission establishes.
    (vi) Optional preface or summary. Inclusion of a preface or summary 
in a library reference addressing the matters set out in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) through (H) of this section is encouraged but optional.
    (vii) Electronic version. Material filed as a library reference 
shall also be made available in an electronic version, absent a showing 
of why an electronic version cannot be supplied or should not be 
required to be supplied. Participants are encouraged to include in the 
electronic version the information and disclosures required to be 
included in the accompanying notice.
    (viii) Number of copies. Except for good cause shown, two hard 
copies of each library reference shall be filed.
    (ix) Special requests and motions seeking service. In situations 
other than that covered in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, 
special requests for service of material contained in a library 
reference may be made by the participant that filed the interrogatory or 
inquiry that generated a response in the form of a library reference. 
Service shall be made within a reasonable time. Others seeking service 
of the material contained in a library reference shall file a detailed 
motion setting forth the reasons why service is necessary or 
appropriate.
    (x) Waiver. Upon the filing of a motion showing good cause, the 
Commission may waive one or more of the provisions relating to library 
references. Motions seeking waiver may request expedited consideration 
and may seek waiver for categories of library references.
    (xi) Status of library references. Designation of material as a 
library reference and acceptance in the Commission's docket section do 
not confer evidentiary status. The evidentiary status of the material is 
governed by this section.
    (c) Commission's files. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 
3001.31(e), in case any matter contained in a report or other

[[Page 375]]

document on file with the Commission is offered in evidence, such report 
or other document need not be produced or marked for identification, but 
may be offered in evidence by specifying the report, document, or other 
file containing the matter so offered.
    (d) Public document items. Whenever there is offered in evidence (in 
whole or in part) a public document, such as an official report, 
decision, opinion or published scientific or economic statistical data 
issued by any of the Executive Departments (or their subdivisions), 
legislative agencies or committees, or administrative agencies of the 
Federal Government (including Government-owned corporations) and such 
document (or part thereof) has been shown by the offeror thereof to be 
reasonably available to the public, such document need not be produced 
or physically marked for identification, but may be offered in evidence 
as a public document item by clearly identifying the document and the 
relevant parts thereof.
    (e) Designation of evidence from other Commission dockets. 
Participants may request that evidence received in other Commission 
proceedings be entered into the record of the current proceeding. These 
requests shall be made by motion, shall explain the purpose of the 
designation, and shall identify material by page and line or paragraph 
number. Absent extraordinary justification, these requests must be made 
at least 28 days before the date for filing the participant's direct 
case. Oppositions to motions for designations and/or requests for 
counter-designations shall be filed within 14 days. Oppositions to 
requests for counter-designations are due within seven days. At the time 
requests for designations and counter-designations are made, the moving 
participant must submit two copies of the identified material to the 
Secretary of the Commission.
    (f) Form of prepared testimony and exhibits. Unless the presiding 
officer otherwise directs, the direct testimony of witnesses shall be 
reduced to writing and offered either as such or as an exhibit. All 
prepared testimony and exhibits of a documentary character shall, so far 
as practicable, conform to the requirements of Sec. 3001.10(a) and (b).
    (g) Copies to participants. Except as otherwise provided in these 
rules, copies of prepared testimony and exhibits shall be furnished to 
the presiding officer and to the participants or counsel, unless the 
presiding officer otherwise directs. In addition, unless otherwise 
directed by the presiding officer, eight copies of all prepared 
testimony and exhibits shall be furnished for the use of the Commission.
    (h) Reception and ruling. The presiding officer shall rule on the 
admissibility of evidence and otherwise control the reception of 
evidence so as to confine it to the issues in the proceeding.
    (i) Offers of proof. Any offer of proof made in connection with any 
ruling of the presiding officer rejecting or excluding proffered oral 
testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance of the evidence 
which counsel contends would be adduced by such testimony; and if the 
excluded evidence consists of evidence in documentary or written form, 
or of reference to documents or records, a copy of such evidence shall 
be marked for identification and shall constitute the offer of proof.
    (j) Official notice of facts. Official notice may be taken of such 
matters as might be judicially noticed by the courts of the United 
States or of any other matter peculiarly within the general knowledge of 
the Commission as an expert body: Provided, That any participant shall, 
on timely request, be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.
    (k) Introduction and reliance upon studies and analyses--(1) 
General. In the case of all studies and analyses offered in evidence in 
hearing proceedings or relied upon as support for other evidence, other 
than the kinds described in paragraphs (k) (2) and (3) of this section, 
there shall be a clear statement of the study plan, all relevant 
assumptions and a description of the techniques of data collection, 
estimation and/or testing. In addition, there shall be a clear statement 
of the facts and judgments upon which conclusions are based, together 
with an indication of the alternative courses of action considered. 
Tabulations of input data shall be made available upon request at the 
offices of the Commission.

    (2) Statistical studies. All statistical studies offered in evidence 
in hearing proceedings or relied upon as support for other evidence 
shall include a comprehensive description of the assumptions made, the 
study plan utilized and the procedures undertaken. Where a computer 
analysis is employed to obtain the result of a statistical study, all of 
the submissions required by Sec. 3001.31(k)(3) shall be furnished, upon 
request. In addition, for each of the following types of statistical 
studies, the indicated information should be furnished:

for other evidence, a foundation for the reception of such materials 
must be laid by furnishing a general description of the program that 
includes the objectives of the program, the processing tasks performed, 
the methods and procedures employed, and a listing of the input and 
output data and source codes (or a showing pursuant to paragraph 
(k)(3)(iii) of this section as to why such codes cannot be so furnished) 
and such description shall be furnished in all cases. For the purpose of 
completing such foundation, the following additional items shall be 
deemed presumptively necessary and shall be furnished upon request of a 
participant, the Commission, or the presiding officer, unless the 
presumption is overcome by an affirmative showing.
    (a) For all input data, designations of all sources of such data, 
and explanations of any modifications to such data made for use in the 
program;
    (b) Definitions of all input and output variables or sets of

    (g) All pertinent operating system and programming language manuals; 
and
    (h) If the requested program is user interactive, a representative 
sample run, together with any explanation necessary to illustrate the 
response sequence.
    (i) An expert on the design and operation of the program shall be 
provided at a technical conference to respond to any oral or written 
questions concerning information that is reasonably necessary to enable 
independent replication of the program output. Machine-readable data 
files and program files shall be provided in the form of a compact disk 
or other media or method approved in advance by the Administrative 
Office of the Postal Regulatory Commission. Any machine-readable data 
file or program file so provided must be identified and described in 
accompanying hardcopy documentation. In addition, files in text format 
must be accompanied by hard-copy instructions for printing them. Files 
in machine code must be accompanied by hardcopy instructions for 
executing them.
    (j) Computer simulation models offered in evidence or relied upon as 
support for other evidence, shall be bound by all applicable provisions 
of paragraph (k)(3) of this section and the separate requirements of 
paragraph (k)(2) of this section, to the extent that portions of the 
simulation model utilize or rely upon such studies. Information that 
compares the simulation model output results to the actual phenomena 
being modelled, using data other than those from which the model was 
developed, shall be separately identified and submitted as evidence 
supporting the test and validation of the simulation model. Separate 
statements concerning the model limitations, including limiting model 
design assumptions and range of data input utilized in model design, 
shall be provided. Where test and validation of the entire simulation 
model are not possible, test and validation information shall be 
provided for disaggregate portions of the model. If disaggregate testing 
and validation are not possible, separate statements to that effect and 
statements regarding operational experts' review of model validity shall 
be provided.
    (ii) Upon timely and otherwise proper request of a participant, or 
sua sponte, the Commission or the Presiding Officer may rule that 
matters other than

[[Page 378]]

those listed in paragraphs (k)(3)(i) (a) through (h) of this section are 
necessary to establish the foundation for reception of the evidence 
concerned and must be furnished.
    (iii) When the requestor is other than the Commission or the 
Presiding Officer, the cost of producing the material required in 
paragraph (k)(3)(i) (d), (f), and (g)of this section, shall be borne by 
the requesting party unless otherwise ordered, for good cause shown by 
the requestor. When the Commission or the Presiding Officer is the 
requestor, it may assume or equitably allocate such costs for good cause 
shown by the requestee.
    (iv) If the recipient of a request for materials pursuant to this 
paragraph (k)(3) of this section asserts that compliance with the 
request would conflict with patent, copyright, trade secret or contract 
rights applicable to the requested material, the recipient shall 
immediately notify the requestor and the Presiding Officer. If valid, 
the Presiding Officer shall devise means of accommodating such rights. 
Such means may include protective orders, including access under 
protective conditions to the computer facilities of the recipient of a 
request, making material available for inspection, compensation, or 
other procedures, according to the nature of the right affected by 
compliance with this paragraph (k)(3) of this section. If the Presiding 
Officer determines that compensation is necessary to accommodate the 
affected right, the cost of compensation shall be borne in the same 
manner that paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section prescribes for bearing 
the costs referenced there. If such right cannot be accommodated by 
reasonable compensation, or by protective orders or other procedures, 
and, as a result, materials required by this paragraph (k)(3) of this 
section cannot be provided, the Presiding Officer shall determine, in 
his/her discretion, whether evidence that relies upon the materials not 
provided shall be admissible or afforded limited weight.
    (4) Expedition. The offeror shall expedite responses to requests 
made pursuant to this section. Responses shall be served on the 
requesting party, and notice thereof filed with the Secretary in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3001.12, no later than 14 days 
after a request is made.

Sec. 3001.31a  In camera orders.

    (a) Definition. Except as hereinafter provided, documents and 
testimony made subject to in camera orders are not made a part of the 
public record, but are kept confidential, and only authorized parties, 
their counsel, authorized Commission personnel, and court personnel 
concerned with judicial review shall have access thereto. The right of 
the presiding officer, the Commission, and reviewing courts to disclose 
in camera data to the extent necessary for the proper disposition of the 
proceeding is specifically reserved.
    (b) In camera treatment of documents and testimony. Presiding 
officers shall have authority, but only in those unusual and exceptional 
circumstances when good cause is found on the record, to order documents 
or oral testimony offered in evidence whether admitted or rejected, to 
be placed in camera. The order shall specify the date on which in camera 
treatment expires and shall include: (1) A description of the documents 
and testimony; (2) a full statement of the reasons for granting in 
camera treatment; and (3) a full statement of the reasons for the date 
on which in camera treatment expires. Any party desiring, for the 
preparation and presentation of the case, to disclose in camera 
documents or testimony to experts, consultants, prospective witnesses, 
or witnesses, shall make application to the presiding officer setting 
forth the justification therefor. The presiding officer, in granting 
such application for good cause found, shall enter an order protecting 
the rights of the affected parties and preventing unnecessary disclosure 
of information. In camera documents and the transcript of testimony 
subject to an in camera order shall be segregated from the public record 
and filed in a sealed envelope, bearing the title and docket number of

[[Page 379]]

the proceeding, the notation ``In Camera Record under Sec. 3001.31a,'' 
and the date on which in camera treatment expires.
    (c) Release of in camera information. In camera documents and 
testimony shall constitute a part of the confidential records of the 
Commission and shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 3001.42 of 
this chapter. However, the Commission, on its own motion or pursuant to 
a request, may make in camera documents and testimony available for 
inspection, copying, or use by any other governmental agency. The 
Commission shall, in such circumstances, give reasonable notice of the 
impending disclosure to the affected party. However, such notice may be 
waived in extraordinary circumstances for good cause.
    (d) Briefing of in camera information. In the submittal of proposed 
findings, briefs, or other papers, counsel for all parties shall make a 
good faith attempt to refrain from disclosing the specific details of in 
camera documents and testimony. This shall not preclude references in 
such proposed findings, briefs, or other papers to such documents or 
testimony including generalized statements based on their contents. To 
the extent that counsel consider it necessary to include specific 
details of in camera data in their presentations, such data shall be 
incorporated in separate proposed findings, briefs, or other papers 
marked ``confidential,'' which shall be placed in camera and become a 
part of the in camera record.

<R05>
Sec. 3001.32  Appeals from rulings of the presiding officer.

    (a) General policy. The Commission will not review a ruling of the 
presiding officer prior to its consideration of the entire proceeding 
except in extraordinary circumstances. This section specifies the 
showing which participants must make in order to appeal interlocutory 
rulings.
    (b) Appeals certified by the presiding officer. (1) Before the 
issuance of an initial decision pursuant to Sec. 3001.39(a) or the 
certification of the record to the Commission pursuant to Sec. 
3001.38(a), rulings of the presiding officer may be appealed when the 
presiding officer certifies in writing that an interlocutory appeal is 
warranted. The presiding officer shall not certify an appeal unless the 
officer finds that (i) the ruling involves an important question of law 
or policy concerning which there is substantial ground for difference of 
opinion and (ii) an immediate appeal from the ruling will materially 
advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or subsequent review 
will be an inadequate remedy.
    (2) A request for the presiding officer to certify an appeal shall 
be made within 5 days after the presiding officer's ruling has been 
issued. The request shall set forth with specificity the reasons that a 
participant believes that an appeal meets the criteria of paragraphs 
(b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. Such requests shall also state in 
detail the legal, policy, and factual arguments supporting the 
participant's position that the ruling should be modified. If the appeal 
is from a ruling rejecting or excluding evidence, such request shall 
include a statement of the substance of the evidence which the 
participant contends would be adduced by the excluded evidence and the 
conclusions intended to be derived therefrom.
    (3) The presiding officer may request responsive pleadings from 
other participants prior to ruling upon the request to certify an 
appeal.
    (c) Appeals not certified by the presiding officer. If the presiding 
officer declines to certify an appeal, a participant who has requested 
certification may apply to the Commission for review within 10 days. 
Unless the Commission directs otherwise, its review of the application 
will be based on the record and pleadings filed before the presiding 
officer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Action by the Commission. (1) The Commission may dismiss an 
appeal certified by the presiding officer if it determines that (i) the 
objection to the ruling should be deferred until the Commission's 
consideration of the entire proceeding or (ii) interlocutory review is 
otherwise not warranted or appropriate under the circumstances.

[[Page 380]]

    (2) Where the presiding officer has declined to certify an appeal, 
the Commission will not allow an application for review unless it 
determines (i) that the presiding officer should have certified the 
matter, (ii) that extraordinary circumstances exist, and (iii) that 
prompt Commission decision is necessary to prevent grave detriment to 
the public interest.
    (3) The Commission may issue an order accepting an interlocutory 
appeal within 15 days after the presiding officer certifies the appeal 
or a participant files an application for review. If the Commission 
fails to issue such an order, leave to appeal from the presiding 
officer's interlocutory ruling shall be deemed to be denied. If the 
Commission issues an order accepting an appeal, it may rule upon the 
merits of the appeal in that order or at a later time.
    (e) Effect of appeals. Unless the presiding officer or the 
Commission so orders, the certification of an appeal or the filing of an 
application for review shall not stay the proceeding or the 
effectiveness of any ruling.
    (f) Review at conclusion of proceeding. If an interlocutory appeal 
is not allowed or requested, objection to the ruling may be raised on 
review of the presiding officer's initial decision, or, if the initial 
decision is omitted, at the conclusion of the proceeding.
    (g) Form, filing, and service of documents. Requests for 
certification, applications for review, and any responses shall be in 
writing and shall be in conformity with Sec. Sec. 3001.10 and 3001.11. 
They shall be filed and served pursuant to Sec. Sec. 3001.9 and 
3001.12.

<R05>
Sec. 3001.33  Depositions.

    (a) When permissible. The testimony of a witness may be taken by 
deposition upon authorization by the Commission or the presiding officer 
on application of any participant before the hearing is closed. An 
authorization to take the deposition of a witness will be issued only if 
(1) the person whose deposition is to be taken would be unavailable at 
the hearing, or (2) the deposition is deemed necessary to perpetuate the 
testimony of the witness, or (3) the taking of the deposition is 
necessary to prevent undue and excessive expense to a participant and 
will not result in undue delay or an undue burden to other participants.
    (b) Application. An application for authorization to take testimony 
by deposition shall be filed in duplicate with the Commission or the 
presiding officer and shall state (1) the name, identification, and post 
office address of the witness, (2) the subject matter of the testimony, 
(3) the time and place of taking the deposition, (4) the name, 
identification, and post office address of the officer before whom the 
deposition is to be taken, and (5) the reasons why the testimony of such 
witness should be taken by deposition.
    (c) Authorization. If the application so warrants, the Commission or 
the presiding officer will issue and serve or cause to be served on the 
participants within a reasonable time in advance of the time fixed for 
taking testimony, an authorization for the taking of such testimony by 
deposition. Such authorization shall name the witness, and the time, 
place, and officer before whom the deposition shall be taken, and shall 
specify the number of copies of the deposition to be submitted to the 
Commission. The authorization may include such terms and conditions as 
the Commission or the presiding officer deems fair and reasonable.
    (d) Qualifications of officer before whom taken. Such deposition may 
be taken before a presiding officer or other authorized representative 
of the Commission, or any officer, not being counsel or attorney for any 
participant or having an interest in the proceeding, authorized to 
administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where 
the deposition is to be taken.
    (e) Oath and reduction to writing. The officer before whom the 
deposition is to be taken shall put the witness on oath or affirmation 
and shall personally, or by some one acting under his/her direction and 
in his/her presence, record the examination of the witness. The 
examination shall be transcribed in the form specified in Sec. 
3001.10(a), signed by the witness, and certified in the usual form by 
the officer. The original of the deposition, together

[[Page 381]]

with the number of copies required by the authorization to be made by 
such officer, shall be forwarded by the officer to the Secretary by 
personal delivery or registered mail. Upon receipt the Secretary shall 
hold the original for use in the hearing upon request by any participant 
and shall make copies available for public inspection.
    (f) Scope and conduct of examination. Unless otherwise directed in 
the authorization, the witness may be questioned regarding any matter 
which is relevant to the issues involved in the proceeding. Participants 
shall have the right of cross-examination and objection. In lieu of 
participation in the oral examination, participants may transmit written 
interrogatories to the officer who shall propound them to the witness.
    (g) Objections. The officer before whom the deposition is taken 
shall not have the power to rule upon procedural matters or the 
competency, materiality, or relevancy of questions. Procedural 
objections or objections to questions of evidence shall be stated 
briefly and recorded in the deposition without argument. Objections not 
stated before the officer shall be deemed waived.
    (h) When a part of the record. No portion of a deposition shall 
constitute a part of the record in the proceeding unless received in 
evidence by the presiding officer. If only a portion of the deposition 
is offered in evidence by a participant, any other participant may 
require him/her to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part 
introduced, and any participant may offer in evidence any other 
portions.
    (i) Fees. Witnesses whose depositions are taken and the officer 
taking the same shall be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like 
services in the District Courts of the United States to be paid directly 
by the participant or participants on whose application the deposition 
was taken.

FR 38976, July 21, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 3001.34  Briefs.

    (a) When filed. At the close of the taking of testimony in any 
proceeding, the Commission or the presiding officer shall fix the time 
for the filing and service of briefs, giving due regard to the timely 
issuance of a recommended decision or advisory opinion to the Postal 
Service within the contemplation of sections 3641(a) and 3661 of the 
Act. In addition, subject to such consideration, due regard shall be 
given to the nature of the proceeding, the complexity and importance of 
the issues involved, and the magnitude of the record. In cases subject 
to a limitation on the time available to the Commission for decision, 
the Commission shall generally direct that each participant shall file a 
single brief at the same time. In cases where, because of the nature of 
the issues and the record or the limited number of participants 
involved, the filing of initial and reply briefs, or the filing of 
initial, answering, and reply briefs, will not unduly delay the 
conclusion of the proceeding and will aid in the proper disposition of 
the proceeding, the participants may be directed to file more than one 
brief and at different times rather than a single brief at the same 
time. The presiding officer or the Commission may also order the filing 
of briefs during the course of the proceeding.
    (b) Contents. Each brief filed with the Commission shall be as 
concise as possible, within any page limitation specified by the 
Commission or the presiding officer, and shall include the following in 
the order indicated:
    (1) A subject index with page references, and a list of all cases 
and authorities relied upon, arranged alphabetically, with references to 
the pages where the citation appears;
    (2) A concise statement of the case from the viewpoint of the filing 
participant;
    (3) A clear, concise and definitive statement of the position of the 
filing participant as to the proposals of the Postal Service, the 
subject matter of the complaint, or recommended decision, advisory 
opinion, or public report to be issued;
    (4) A discussion of the evidence, reasons, and authorities relied 
upon with exact references to the record and the authorities; and
    (5) Proposed findings and conclusions with appropriate references to 
the record or the prior discussion of the evidence and authorities 
relied upon.

[[Page 382]]

    (c) Incorporation by references. Briefs before the Commission or a 
presiding officer shall be completely self-contained and shall not 
incorporate by reference any portion of any other brief, pleading or 
document.
    (d) Excerpts from the record. Testimony and exhibits shall not be 
quoted or included in briefs except for short excerpts pertinent to the 
argument presented.
    (e) Filing and service. Briefs shall be filed in the form and manner 
and served as required by Sec. Sec. 3001.9 to 3001.12.

[36 FR 396, Jan. 12, 1971, as amended at 38 FR 4328, Feb. 13, 1973; 51

<R05>
Sec. 3001.35  Proposed findings and conclusions.

    The Commission or the presiding officer may direct the filing of 
proposed findings and conclusions with a brief statement of the 
supporting reasons for each proposed finding and conclusion.

<R05>
Sec. 3001.36  Oral argument before the presiding or other designated officer.

    In any case in which the presiding officer is to issue an initial or 
recommended decision, or another designated officer of the Commission is 
to issue a recommended decision, such officer may permit the 
presentation of oral argument when, in his/her opinion, time permits, 
and the nature of the proceedings, the complexity or importance of the 
issues of fact or law involved, and the public interest warrants hearing 
such argument. Such officer shall determine the time and place for oral 
argument. He may specify the issue or issues on which oral argument is 
to be presented, the order in which the presentations shall be made, and 
the amount of time allowed each participant. A request for oral argument 
before the issuance of an intermediate decision shall be made during the 
course of the hearing on the record.

[36 FR 396,Jan. 12, 1971, as amended at 58 FR 38976, July 21, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 3001.37  Oral argument before the Commission.

    (a) When ordered. In any proceeding before the Commission for 
decision, the Commission, upon the request of any participant or on its 
own initiative, may order oral argument when, in the Commission's 
discretion, time permits, and the nature of the proceedings, the 
complexity or importance of the issues of fact or law involved, and 
public interest warrants such argument.
    (b) How requested. Any participant in a proceeding before the 
Commission for decision may request oral argument before the Commission 
by filing a timely motion pursuant to Sec. 3001.21. In a proceeding 
before the Commission on exceptions to an intermediate decision, such 
motion shall be filed no later than the date for the filing of briefs on 
exceptions. Motions requesting oral argument may be included in briefs 
or briefs on exceptions or in a separate document.
    (c) Notice of oral argument. The Commission shall rule on requests 
for oral argument, and if argument is allowed, the Commission shall 
notify the participants of the time and place set for argument, the 
amount of time allowed each participant, and the issue or issues on 
which oral argument is to be heard. Unless otherwise ordered by the 
Commission, oral argument shall be limited to matters properly raised on 
the record and in the briefs before the Commission.
    (d) Use of documents at oral argument. Charts, graphs, maps, tables 
and other written material may be presented to the Commission at oral 
argument only if limited to facts in the record of the case being argued 
and if copies of such documents are filed with the Secretary and served 
on all parties at least 7 days in advance of the argument. Enlargements 
of such charts, graphs, maps and tables may be used at the argument 
provided copies are filed and served as required by this paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 3001.38  Omission of intermediate decisions.

    (a) Basis of omission. In any proceeding noticed pursuant to Sec. 
3001.17, the Commission, on the motion of any participant or on its own 
initiative, may direct the certification of the

[[Page 383]]

record to the Commission and omit any intermediate decision upon a 
finding on the record that due and timely execution of its functions 
imperatively and unavoidably so requires. In proceedings in which all 
participants concur in a request by any participant that any 
intermediate decision be omitted, the Commission shall direct the 
certification of the record to the Commission and forthwith render a 
final decision unless the Commission denies such request within 10 days 
next following its filing or referral by the presiding officer.
    (b) Requests for omission. Requests for omission of the intermediate 
decision in any proceeding shall be made by motion pursuant to Sec. 
3001.21 or made orally on the record before the presiding officer who 
shall promptly refer the same to the Commission. Such requests shall 
specify (1) the concurrence of other parties and (2) whether opportunity 
for filing briefs or presenting oral argument to the Commission is 
desired or waived. Failure of any party to object to such request shall 
constitute a waiver of any objections.


<R05>
Sec. 3001.39  Intermediate decisions.

    (a) Initial decision by presiding officer. In any proceedings in 
which a Commissioner or hearing officer has presided at the reception of 
evidence, such presiding officer, as soon as practicable after the 
conclusion of the hearing and the filing of briefs, shall certify and 
file with the Secretary, a copy of the record of the hearing and his/her 
initial decision on the matters and issues presented for decision in 
such proceeding.
    (b) Tentative decision. Prior to the issuance of an initial decision 
by the presiding officer, the Commission, with notice to the 
participants or by order in specific cases or by general rule for a 
class of cases, may direct the certification of the record to the 
Commission for the purpose of the issuance of a tentative decision. In 
such cases, the Commission may issue a tentative decision or require 
that the presiding officer or any designated responsible officer of the 
Commission recommend a decision.
    (c) Contents. All intermediate decisions (initial, recommended or 
tentative) shall include (1) findings and conclusions, and the reasons 
or basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact, law, or 
discretion presented on the record, and (2) the appropriate recommended 
decision, advisory opinion or public report pursuant to the Act. An 
intermediate decision in a proceeding under section 3622 or 3623 of the 
Act shall include a statement specifically responsive to the criteria 
established under section 3622 or 3623 of the Act, as the case may be; 
and an intermediate decision in a proceeding under section 3661 of the 
Act shall include a determination of the question of whether or not the 
proposed change in the nature of postal service conforms to the policies 
established under the Act.
    (d) Service and Commission review. All intermediate decisions shall 
be part of the record, shall be served on the participants to the 
proceeding by the Secretary pursuant to Sec. 3001.12 and shall be 
subject to review by the Commission on its own initiative, or the filing 
of exceptions by the participants pursuant to Sec. 3001.40.
    (e) Unavailability of presiding officer. In any proceeding in which 
the intermediate decision is not omitted pursuant to Sec. 3001.38, if a 
presiding officer becomes unavailable to issue an intermediate decision 
on a timely basis, the Commission shall, by a notice served on the 
participants require the record to be certified to it and it shall 
either designate a qualified responsible officer of the Commission to 
issue a recommended decision or will itself issued a tentative decision, 
as the Commission may deem appropriate.
    (f) Effect of intermediate decision. Unless briefs on exceptions are 
filed to an intermediate decision pursuant to Sec. 3001.40 or unless 
the Commission issues an order to review an intermediate decision on its 
own initiative, the intermediate decision shall become the final action 
of the Commission after 30 days from the date of issuance thereof. If 
briefs on exceptions are timely filed or the Commission initiates review 
on its own motion, the intermediate decision is stayed until further 
order of the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 3001.40  Exceptions to intermediate decisions.

    (a) Briefs on exceptions and opposing exceptions. Any participant in 
a proceeding may file exceptions to any intermediate decision by filing 
a brief on exceptions with the Commission within 30 days after the date 
of issuance of the intermediate decision or such other time as may be 
fixed by the Commission. Any participant to a proceeding may file a 
response to briefs on exceptions within 20 days after the time limited 
for the filing of briefs on exceptions or such other time as may be 
fixed by the Commission. No further response will be entertained unless 
the Commission, upon motion for good cause shown or on its own 
initiative, so orders.
    (b) Filing and contents. Briefs on exceptions and briefs opposing 
exceptions shall be filed in accordance with Sec. 3001.34. In briefs on 
exceptions, the discussion of evidence, reasons and authorities shall be 
specifically directed to the findings, conclusions and recommendations 
in the intermediate decision to which exception is taken. Briefs on 
exceptions should not include a discussion of evidence and authorities 
on matters and issues to which no exception to the intermediate decision 
is taken. Briefs on exceptions and briefs opposing exceptions need not 
contain a statement of the case to the extent that it was correctly 
stated in either the intermediate decision or the brief on exceptions of 
another participant to which reference is made.
    (c) Failure to except results in waiver. Any participant who fails 
to except or object to any part of an intermediate decision in its brief 
on exceptions may not thereafter raise such exceptions or objections 
which shall be deemed to have been waived.

Sec. 3001.41  Rulemaking proceedings.

    (a) General notice. Before the adoption of any rule of general 
applicability, or the commencement of any hearing on any such proposed 
rulemaking, the Commission will cause general notice to be given by 
publication in the Federal Register, such notice to be published therein 
not less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the consideration of 
the adoption of a proposed rule or rules or for the commencement of the 
hearing, if any, on the proposed rulemaking, except where a shorter 
period is reasonable and good cause exists therefor. However, where the 
Commission, for good cause, finds it impracticable, unnecessary, or 
contrary to the public interest to give such notice, it may proceed with 
the adoption of rules without notice by incorporating therein a finding 
to such effect and a concise statement of the reasons therefor. Advance 
notice shall not be required for rules subject to 5 U.S.C. 553(d).
    (b) Contents of notice. The notice shall include (1) a statement of 
the time, place and nature of the public rulemaking proceedings; (2) 
reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed; and 
(3) either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description 
of the subjects and issues involved.
    (c) Participation. After notice given as provided in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Commission shall give interested persons an 
opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of 
written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity for oral 
presentation.
    (d) General statement as to basis and purpose. After consideration 
of the relevant matter presented, the Commission shall incorporate in 
the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and 
purpose.
    (e) Exceptions. Except when notice or hearing is required by 
statute, the Commission may issue at any time rules of organization, 
procedure or practice, or interpretive rules, or statements of policy, 
without notice or public procedure, and this section is not to be 
construed as applicable to the extent that there may be involved any

military, naval or foreign affairs function of the United States, or any 
matter relating to the Commission's management or personnel, or to U.S. 
property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.

Sec. 3001.42  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 3001.43  Public attendance at Commission meetings.

    (a) Open Commission meetings. (1) Commissioners shall not jointly 
conduct or dispose of agency business other than in accordance with this 
section. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, every 
portion of every meeting of the Commission shall be open to public 
observation. Access to documents being considered at Commission meetings 
shall be obtained in the manner set forth in Sec. 3001.42.
    (2) Members of the public may not participate in open meetings. They 
may record the proceedings, provided they use battery-operated recording 
devices at their seats. Cameras may be used by observers to photograph 
proceedings, provided it is done from their seats and no flash or 
lighting equipment is used. Persons may electronically record or 
photograph a meeting, as long as such activity does not impede or 
disturb the members of the Commission in the performance of their 
duties, or members of the public attempting to observe, or to record or 
photograph, the Commission meeting.
    (b) Physical arrangements for open meetings. The Secretary shall be 
responsible for seeing that ample space, sufficient visibility, and 
adequate acoustics are provided for public observation of the Commission 
meetings.
    (c) Closed Commission meetings. Except in a case where the 
Commission finds that the public interest requires otherwise, the second 
sentence of paragraph (a) shall not apply to any portion of a Commission 
meeting, and the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) shall not apply 
to any information pertaining to such meeting otherwise required by this 
section to be disclosed to the public, where the Commission properly 
determines that such portion or portions of its meetings or the 
disclosure of such information is likely to
    (1) Disclose matters that are (i) specifically authorized under 
criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the 
interests of national defense or foreign policy and (ii) in fact 
properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;
    (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Commission;
    (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than section 552 of title 5), provided that such statute 
(i) requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (ii) establishes 
particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of 
matters to be withheld;
    (4) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring 
any person;
    (6) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such 
records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or 
information would (i) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii) 
deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy, (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the 
case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source, (v) disclose investigative 
techniques and procedures, or (vi) endanger the life or physical safety 
of law enforcement personnel;
    (8) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, 
operating,

[[Page 386]]

or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an 
agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial 
institutions;
    (9) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed 
Commission action, except that paragraph (c)(9) shall not apply in any 
instance where the Commission has already disclosed to the public the 
content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Commission is 
required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to 
taking final Commission action on such proposal; or
    (10) Specifically concern the Commission's issuance of a subpoena or 
the Commission's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an 
action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, 
or the initiation, conduct or disposition by the Commission of a 
particular case of formal Commission adjudication pursuant to the 
procedures in section 554 of title 5 or otherwise involving a 
determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing as provided 
by section 3624(a) of title 39.
    (d) Procedures for closing meetings. (1) Action under paragraph (c) 
of this section shall be taken only when three Commissioners vote to 
take such action. A separate vote of the Commissioners shall be taken 
with respect to each agency meeting a portion or portions of which are 
proposed to be closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section, or with respect to any information which is proposed to be 
withheld under paragraph (c) of this section. A single vote may be taken 
with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are 
proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information 
concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such 
series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held 
no more than 30 days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote 
of each Commissioner participating in such vote shall be recorded and no 
proxies shall be allowed.
    (2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by 
a portion of a meeting requests that the Commission close such portion 
to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraph (c) (5), 
(6), or (7) of this section, the Commission upon request of any one of 
its members, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting.
    (3) Within 1 day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) or 
(2) of this section, the Commission shall make publicly available a 
written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the 
question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the 
Commission shall, within 1 day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(1) or (2) of this section, make publicly available a full written 
explanation of its action closing the portion together with a list of 
all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.
    (4) Any person may protest a Commission decision to hold a closed 
meeting under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section by filing a motion 
to open the meeting. Such motion shall be addressed to the Commission 
and shall set forth with particularity the statutory or other authority 
relied upon, the reasons for which the movant believes the meeting 
should not be closed, and the reasons for which the movant believes that 
the public interest requires the meeting to be open. Such motion shall 
be filed with the Secretary no later than 24 hours prior to the time for 
which the closed meeting is scheduled.
    (5) The Commission has determined that a majority of its meetings 
may be closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (c)(4), (8) or (10) of 
this section or any combination thereof. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552b(d)(4), Commission meetings shall be closed to the public pursuant 
to paragraph (c)(4), (8) or (10) of this section or any combination 
thereof when three Commissioners vote by recorded vote at the beginning 
of such meeting, or portion thereof, to close the exempt portion or 
portions of the meeting, and a copy of such vote, reflecting the vote of 
each Commissioner on the question, is made available to the public. The 
provisions of paragraphs (d) (1), (2), (3), and (e) of this section 
shall not apply to any portion of a meeting to which paragraph

[[Page 387]]

(d)(5) of this section applies: Provided, that the Commission shall, 
except to the extent that such information is exempt from disclosure 
under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, provide the 
public with public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter 
of the meeting and of each portion thereof at the earliest practicable 
time.
    (e) Scheduling and public announcement. (1) In the case of each 
meeting, the Commission shall make public announcement, at least 1 week 
before the meeting, of the time, place, and subject matter of the 
meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to the public, and the name 
and phone number of the official designated by the Commission to respond 
to requests for information about the meeting. Such announcement shall 
be made unless three Commissioners determine by a recorded vote that 
Commission business requires that such meeting be called at an earlier 
date, in which case the Commission shall make public announcement of the 
time, place, and subject matter of such meeting, and whether open or 
closed to the public, at the earliest practicable time.
    (2) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the 
public announcement required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section only if 
the Commission publicly announces such change at the earliest 
practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination 
of the Commission to open or close a meeting, or a portion of a meeting, 
to the public, may be changed following the public announcement required 
by paragraph (e)(1) only if (i) three Commissioners determine by a 
recorded vote that Commission business so requires and that no earlier 
announcement of the change was possible, and (ii) the Commission 
publicly announces such change and the vote of each Commissioner upon 
such change at the earliest practicable time.
    (3) Immediately following each public announcement required by 
paragraph (e) of this section, notice of the time, place, and subject 
matter of a meeting, whether the meeting is open or closed, any change 
in one of the preceding, and the name and phone number of the official 
designated by the Commission to respond to requests for information 
about the meeting, shall also be submitted for publication in the 
Federal Register.
    (4) The public announcement required by this section may consist of 
the Secretary:
    (i) Publicly posting a copy of the document in the office of the 
Secretary of the Commission at 901 New York Avenue NW., Suite 200, 
Washington, DC 20268-0001;
    (ii) Mailing a copy to all persons whose names are on a mailing list 
maintained for this purpose;
    (iii) Operating a recorded telephone announcement, giving the 
announcement; and
    (iv) Any other means which the Secretary believes will serve to 
further inform any persons who might be interested.
    (f) Certification of closed meetings; transcripts, electronic 
recordings, and minutes. (1) Before any meeting to be closed pursuant to 
paragraphs (c) (1) through (10) of this section, the General Counsel of 
the Commission, or in the General Counsel's absence, the senior advisory 
staff attorney available, should publicly certify that, in his/her 
opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each 
relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together 
with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth 
the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be 
retained by the Commission. The Commission shall maintain a complete 
transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the 
proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the 
public, except that in the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, 
closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (c)(8) or (10) of this 
section, the Commission shall maintain either such a transcript or 
recording, or a set of minutes. Such minutes shall fully and clearly 
describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate 
summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a 
description of the views expressed on any item and the record of any 
rollcall vote (reflecting the vote of each Commissioner

[[Page 388]]

on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action 
shall be identified in such minutes.
    (2) The Commission shall make promptly available to the public, in a 
place easily accessible to the public, the transcript, electronic 
recording, or minutes (as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section) 
of the discussion of any item on the agenda, or of any item of the 
testimony of any witness received at the meeting, except for such item 
or items of such discussion or testimony as the Commission determines by 
a majority vote of all its members (i) contains information which may be 
withheld under paragraph (c) of this section, and (ii) is not required 
by the public interest to be made available. Copies of such transcript, 
or minutes, or a transcription of such recording disclosing the identity 
of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of 
duplication or transcription. The Commission shall maintain a complete 
verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes, or a 
complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, 
closed to the public, for a period of at least 2 years after such 
meeting, or until 1 year after the conclusion of any Commission 
proceeding with respect to which the meeting or portion was held, 
whichever occurs later.
    (g) Requests to open or close Commission meetings. (1)(i) Any person 
may request in writing that the Commission open to public observation 
discussion of a matter which it has earlier decided to close.
    (ii) Such requests shall be captioned ``Request to open ---------- 
(date) Commission meeting on item ---------- (number or description).'' 
The request shall state the reason(s) therefor, the name and address of 
the person making the request and, if desired, a telephone number.
    (iii) Ten copies of such requests must be received by the office of 
the Secretary no later than three working days after the issuance of the 
notice of meeting to which the request pertains. Requests received after 
that time will be returned to the requester with a statement that the 
request was untimely received and that copies of any nonexempt portions 
of the transcript or minutes for the meeting in question will ordinarily 
be available in the office of the Secretary 10 working days after the 
meeting.
    (2)(i) Any person whose interests may be directly affected may 
request in writing that the Commission close to public observation 
discussion of a matter which it has earlier decided to open as provided 
for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Such requests shall be captioned ``Request to Close ---------- 
(date) Commission meeting on item ---------- (number or description),'' 
shall state the reason(s) therefor, the name and address of the person 
making the request and, if desired, a telephone number.
    (iii) Ten copies of such requests should be filed with the office of 
the Secretary as soon as possible after the issuance of the notice of 
meeting to which the request pertains. However, a single copy of the 
request will be accepted. Requests to close meetings must be received by 
the office of the Secretary no later than the time scheduled for the 
meeting to which such a request pertains.
    (3) The Secretary shall retain one copy of timely requests and 
forward one copy to each Commissioner, one copy to the interested 
Office, and two copies to the Docket Section, one for entry in the 
appropriate docket file, if any, and one to be posted on the Public 
Notice Board located in that section as an attachment to the Notice of 
Meeting to which it pertains.
    (4) Pleadings replying to requests to open or close shall not be 
accepted.
    (5) Any Commissioner may require that the Commission vote upon the 
request to open or close. If the request is supported by the votes of a 
majority of the agency membership, notice of change in meeting shall be 
issued and the Secretary shall immediately notify the requester and, 
before the close of business the next working day, have posted such vote 
and other material required by paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section on 
the Commission's Public Notice Board.
    (6) If no Commissioner requests that a vote be taken on a request to 
open or close a Commission meeting, the Secretary shall by the close of 
the next

[[Page 389]]

working day after the meeting to which such request pertains certify 
that no vote was taken. The Secretary shall forward one copy of that 
certification to the requester and two copies of that certification to 
the Docket Section, one to be placed in the appropriate docket file, if 
any, and one to be posted on the Public Notice Board, where it will be 
displayed for one week.

office, the opportunity for such persons to present their views, and a 
written determination based upon consideration of each of the factors 
listed in section 404(b)(2) of the Act. This notice must include a 
provision stating that, pursuant to Pub. L. 94-421, a final Postal 
Service determination to close or consolidate a post office may be

review, all of whom must be persons served by the post office proposed 
to be closed or consolidated and shall identify the Postal Service as 
respondent. The Commission encourages parties seeking review to attach a 
copy of the Postal Service written determination, as the appeal process 
is thereby expedited. If two or more persons are entitled to petition 
for review of the same determination and their interests are such as to 
make joinder practicable, they may file a joint petition for review and 
may thereafter proceed as a single petitioner.
    (b) Intervention. A person served by the post office to be closed or 
consolidated pursuant to the Postal Service written determination under 
review who desires to intervene in the proceeding, or any other 
interested person, or any counsel, agent or other person authorized or 
recognized by the Postal Service as such interested person's 
representative or the representative of such interested person's 
recognized group, such as Postmasters, shall file with the Secretary of 
the Commission and serve upon all parties a notice of intervention in a 
form prescribed by Sec. 3001.20. The notice shall contain a concise 
statement of the interest of the moving party and the grounds upon which 
intervention is sought. A notice of intervention shall be filed within 
25 days of the date on which the notice for review is filed. The 
provisions of Sec. 3001.20 (c) through (f) of Subpart A of

[[Page 391]]

this part shall apply to notices of intervention in review proceedings.

Service.


<R05>
Sec. 3001.113  Filing of the record.

    (b) Composition of the filing. The Postal Service may file the 
entire record or such parts thereof as the parties may designate by

facts relied upon, and if the facts are subject to dispute the 
application shall be supported by affidavits or other sworn statements 
or copies thereof. The applicant must be a person served by the affected 
post office. Immediate notice of the application shall be given to all 
parties to the proceeding. The application shall be filed with the 
Secretary of the Commission.
    (b) Answer and filing of the relevant record by the U.S. Postal 
Service. Within 10 days after the application for suspension is filed,

<R05>
Sec. 3002.2  Statutory functions.

    (a) Areas of jurisdiction. The Commission has jurisdiction over 
changes in postal rates and fees under 39 U.S.C. 3622, and over mail 
classifications under 39 U.S.C. 3623. It issues recommended decisions to 
the Governors of the Postal Service on these matters. It also acts on 
postal patrons' appeals from Postal Service decisions to close or 
consolidate post offices under 39 U.S.C. 404(b). Further, the Commission 
investigates complaints of substantial national scope concerning postal 
rates, fees, mail classifications or services under 39 U.S.C. 3662. It 
also responds to requests of the Postal Service for advisory opinions on 
changes in the nature of postal services under 39 U.S.C. 3661. Because 
of the Commission's expertise, Congress occasionally asks it to 
undertake special studies on postal issues.
    (b) Public participation. Interested persons may elect to 
participate in Commission rate and mail classification proceedings as 
formal intervenors (Sec. 3001.20), limited participators (Sec. 
3001.20a), or commenters (Sec. 3001.20b). Interested parties who 
believe the Postal Service is charging rates which do not conform with 
the policies of the Postal Reorganization Act, or who believe that they 
are not receiving postal service in accordance with the policies of 
title 39, may lodge a complaint with the Commission under section 
3001.82. Persons served by post offices that the Postal Service decides 
to close or consolidate with other post offices may appeal such 
determinations under Sec. 3001.111.

<R05>
Sec. 3004.11  Use of exemptions.

    (a) Under FOIA, there are nine exemptions which may be used to 
protect information from disclosure. The Commission has paraphrased the 
exemptions in paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section. These 
paraphrases are not intended to be interpretations of the exemptions.
    (b) National security information concerning national defense or 
foreign policy, provided that such information has been properly 
classified, in accordance with an Executive Order.
    (c) Information related solely to the internal personnel rules and 
practices of an agency.
    (d) Information specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, 
for example, 39 U.S.C. 410(c):
    (1) The name or address, past or present, of any postal patron;
    (2) Information of a commercial nature, including trade secrets, 
whether or not obtained from a person outside the Postal Service, which 
under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed;
    (3) Information prepared for use in connection with the negotiation 
of collective bargaining agreements under 39 U.S.C. chapter 12, or 
minutes of, or

[[Page 400]]

notes kept during negotiating sessions conducted under such chapter;
    (4) Information prepared for use in connection with proceedings 
under 39 U.S.C. chapter 36; and

contractors except to the extent that they would be required to be 
disclosed if prepared within the agency.
    (e) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information which is 
obtained from a person and is privileged or confidential.
    (f) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters, which would 
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation 
with the agency.
    (g) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy.
    (h) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
the release of which:
    (1) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (2) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (3) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (4) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source and investigations or prosecutions if such 
disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the 
law; or
    (5) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.
    (i) Information contained in or related to examination, operating, 
or condition reports, prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of an 
agency responsible for regulating or supervising financial institutions.
    (j) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, 
concerning wells.
    (k) It is Commission policy to make records publicly available upon 
request, unless the record qualifies for exemption under one or more of 
the nine exemptions. It is Commission policy to make discretionary 
releases; however, a discretionary release is not normally appropriate 
for records exempt under exemptions identified in paragraphs (b), (d), 
(e), (g), (h)(3) and (h)(5) of this section. The remainder of the 
exemptions are discretionary.
    (l) The following are examples of information that is not part of 
the public records of the Commission:
    (1) Written communications between or among the Commission, members 
of the Commission, the Secretary, and expressly designated staff members

notice, order, advisory opinion, or public report and findings, with or 
without opinion, or report in any matter or proceeding;

    (b) Requesting records subject to the Privacy Act. A request by an 
individual for his or her own records contained in a system of records 
is governed by the Privacy Act. Release will first be considered under 
the Privacy Act pursuant to part 3003 of this chapter. However, if there 
is any record that the Commission need not release under the Privacy 
Act, the Commission will also consider the request under FOIA, and will 
release the record if FOIA requires it.
    (c) Requesting another individual's record. Request for records of 
individuals which may not be granted under the Privacy Act shall be 
considered under FOIA.
    (1) If the Commission makes a disclosure in response to a request 
and the disclosure is permitted by the Privacy Act's disclosure 
provision, 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), the Commission will rely on the Privacy Act 
to govern the disclosure.
    (2) In some circumstances, the Privacy Act may prohibit the 
Commission's ability to release records which may be released under 
FOIA.
    (d) Requesting a Postal Service record. The Commission maintains 
custody of records that are both Commission and Postal Service records.
    (1) A request made pursuant to FOIA for records designated as non-
public by the Postal Service shall be referred to the Postal Service; 
and
    (2) A request made pursuant to part 3007 of this chapter for records 
designated as non-public by the Postal Service shall be considered under 
the applicable standards set forth in that part.
    (e) Requesting a third-party record submitted under seal. The 
Commission maintains records of a confidential nature submitted by third 
parties as non-public materials.
    (1) A request made pursuant to FOIA for records designated as non-
public by a third party shall be considered in light of all applicable 
exemptions; and
    (2) A request made pursuant to part 3007 of this chapter for records 
designated as non-public by a third party shall be considered under the 
applicable standards set forth in that part.

paid.
    (d) Denying request. If denying the request, in whole or in part, 
the Secretary or Assistant Secretary will inform the requester in

basis for withholding of the records sought and, if applicable, the harm 
to an interest protected by a statutory exemption;
    (2) An estimate of the volume of requested matter that was denied:

request or a modified request. The applicable time limits are not tolled 
while the Commission waits for a response from the requester under this 
subsection.


<R05>
Sec. 3004.50  Fees--definitions as used in this part.

    Commercial use means a request from or on behalf of a person seeking 
information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or 
profit interests of the requester or person on whose behalf the request 
is made. In determining the applicability of this term, the use to which 
a requester will put the document is considered first; where reasonable 
doubt exists as to the use, the Commission may seek clarification before 
assigning the request to a category.
    Direct costs means the expenditures the Commission incurs in 
searching for, duplicating, and, where applicable, reviewing documents 
to respond to a request. They include (without limitation) the salary of 
the employee(s) performing work (the basic pay rate of such employee(s) 
plus 16 percent to cover benefits).
    Duplication means copying the documents necessary to respond to a 
request. Such copies may be paper, microform, audiovisual, or machine-
readable.
    Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate or 
undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional 
education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a 
program or programs of scholarly research.
    Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution, not 
operated on a commercial basis (as referenced above), which is operated 
solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research whose results 
are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    Representative of the news media means any person or entity that 
gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, 
uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct 
work, and distributes

[[Page 404]]

that work to an audience. The term ``news'' means information that is 
about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. 
Examples of news media entities are television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but 
only if such entities qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make 
their products available for purchase or by subscription or by free 
distribution to the general public. These examples are not all inclusive 
and may include alternate media to disseminate news. A freelance 
journalist shall be regarded as working for a news media entity if the 
journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication 
through that entity (e.g., by a publication contract or prior 
publication record), whether or not the journalist is actually employed 
by the entity.
    Review means examining documents located in response to a request to 
determine whether any portion is exempt from disclosure, and processing 
or preparing documents for release, but not determination of general 
legal or policy issues regarding application of exemptions.
    Search includes all time spent looking for material responsive to a 
request, including identification of pages or lines within documents. 
The term covers both manual and computerized searching.


<R05>
Sec. 3004.51  Fees--request category.

    (a) The level of fee charged depends on the request category.
    (1) Commercial use. A request appearing to be for commercial use 
will be charged the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and 
duplicating the records sought.
    (2) Educational and noncommercial scientific institutions. A request 
from an educational or noncommercial scientific institution will be 
charged for the cost of duplication only (excluding charges for the 
first 100 pages). To be eligible for this category, a requester must 
show that the request is made under the auspices of a qualifying 
institution and that the records are not sought for commercial use but 
are in furtherance of scholarly (in the case of educational 
institutions) or scientific (in the case of noncommercial scientific 
institutions) research.
    (3) News media. A request from a representative of the news media 
will be charged the cost of duplication only (excluding charges for the 
first 100 pages).
    (4) Other requesters. A request from any other person will be 
charged the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing, and 
duplicating records responsive to the request, except that the first 100 
pages of duplication and the first 2 hours of search/review will be 
furnished without charge.
    (b) Privacy Act. A request by an individual for his or her own 
records in a system of records will be charged fees as provided under 
the Commission's Privacy Act regulations in part 3003 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 3004.52  Fees--general provisions.

    (a) The Commission may charge search fees even if no records are 
found or if the records found are exempt from disclosure.
    (b) Except in the case of commercial use requesters, the first 100 
pages of duplication and the first 2 hours of search time are provided 
without charge.
    (1) A page for these purposes is a letter- or legal-size sheet, or 
the equivalent amount of information in a medium other than paper copy.
    (2) Search time for these purposes refers to manual searching; if 
the search is performed by computer, the 2 hours provided without charge 
will be equal to 2 hours' salary of the person performing the search.
    (c) No requester will be charged a fee when the Commission 
determines that the cost of collecting the fee would equal or exceed the 
fee itself. In determining whether cost of collection would equal or 
exceed the fee, the allowance for 2 hours' search or 100 pages of 
duplication will be made before comparing the remaining fee and the cost 
of collection.
    (d) Records will be provided without charge or at a reduced charge 
if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is 
likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the 
operations or activities of the government and is not primarily

[[Page 405]]

in the commercial interest of the requester.
    (e) No requester will be charged a fee after any search or response 
which occurs after the applicable time limits as described in Sec. Sec. 
3004.43 and 3004.44, so long as there are no unusual or exceptional 
circumstances, such as those used to justify an extension of the time 
limit as described in Sec. 3004.45. The Commission may, however, charge 
fees for a partial grant of a request while it reviews records that may 
be exempt and may be responsive to the request, if it is made within the 
applicable time limits.


<R05>
Sec. 3004.53  Fee schedule.

    (a) Fees will be calculated as follows:
    (1) Manual search. At the salary rate (basic pay plus 16 percent) of 
the employee(s) making the search. Search time may be charged for even 
if the Commission fails to locate records or if records located are 
exempt from disclosure.
    (2) Computer search. At the direct cost of providing the search, 
including computer search time directly attributable to searching for 
records responsive to the request runs and employee salary apportionable 
to the search.
    (3) Review (commercial use). At the salary rate (basic pay plus 16 
percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review. Charges are imposed 
only for the review necessary at the initial administrative level to 
determine the applicability of any exemption, and not for review at the 
administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied.
    (4) Duplication. At 10 cents per page for paper copy, which the 
Commission has found to be the reasonable direct cost thereof. For 
copies of records prepared by computer the direct cost of production, 
including employee time, will be charged.
    (5) Additional services. Postage, insurance, and other additional 
services that may be arranged for by the requester will be charged at 
actually incurred cost.
    (b) In addition to the fee waiver provisions of Sec. 3004.52(d), 
fees may be waived at the discretion of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3004.54  Procedure for assessing and collecting fees.

    (a) Advance payment may be required if the requester failed to pay 
previous bills in a timely fashion or when the fees are likely to exceed 
$250.
    (1) Where the requester has previously failed to pay within 30 days 
of the billing date, the Commission may require the requester to pay an 
advance payment of the estimated fee together with either the past due 
fees (plus applicable interest) or proof that the past fees were paid.
    (2) When advance payment is required, the administrative time limits 
prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) (Sec. 3004.43) begin only after such 
payment has been received.
    (b) Interest at the rate published by the Secretary of the Treasury 
as prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 will be charged on unpaid fee bills 
starting on the 31st day after the bill was sent. Receipt of a fee by 
the Commission, whether processed or not, will stay the accrual of 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 3004.60  Chief Freedom of Information Act Officer.

    The Commission designates the Secretary of the Commission as the 
Chief FOIA Officer. The Chief FOIA Officer shall be responsible for the 
administration of and reporting on the Commission's Freedom of 
Information Act program.


<R05>
Sec. 3004.61  Freedom of Information Act Public Liaison.

    The Commission designates the Director of the Office of Public 
Affairs and Government Relations or his or her designee as the FOIA 
Public Liaison who shall assist in the resolution of any dispute between 
a requester and the Commission. The FOIA Public Liaison may be contacted 
via e-mail at PRC-PAGR@prc.gov or telephone at 202-789-6800.


<R05>
Sec. 3004.70  Third-party submission of non-public materials.

    (a) Overlap with treatment of non-public materials. Any person who 
submits materials to the Commission (submitter) that the submitter 
reasonably believes to be exempt from public disclosure may submit 
materials under

[[Page 406]]

seal and lodge an application for nonpublic treatment as described in 
Sec. 3007.10 of this chapter.
    (b) Notice of request. Except as provided in Sec. 3004.30(d), if a 
FOIA request seeks materials designated as nonpublic materials, the 
Commission will provide the submitter with notice of the request. The 
Commission may also provide notice when it has reason to believe that 
third-party materials possibly exempt from disclosure may fall within 
the scope of any FOIA request.
    (c) Objections to disclosure. A submitter may file written 
objections to the request specifying all grounds for withholding the 
information under FOIA within 7 days of the date of the notice. If the 
submitter fails to respond to the notice, the submitter will be 
considered to have no objection, beyond those objections articulated in 
its application for nonpublic treatment pursuant to Sec. 3007.10 of 
this chapter, to the disclosure of the information.
    (d) Notice of decision. If, after considering the submitter's 
objections to disclosure the Commission decides to disclose the 
information, it will give the submitter written notice of the decision 
and a brief explanation of the reasons for not sustaining the 
submitter's objections. The actual disclosure will not be made before 3 
days after publication of the Commission's decision.

participants before acting on the request. In making their 
determination, the Commissioners are not bound by any recommendation of 
a presiding officer.

Sec. 3007.1  Definitions for purposes of this part.

    (a) Authorized representative means any Commissioner designated by 
the Chairman, any administrative law judge appointed by the Commission 
under 5 U.S.C. 3105, and any employee of the Commission designated by 
the Commission. The authorized representative may administer oaths, 
examine witnesses, take depositions, and receive evidence with respect 
to any proceeding before the Commission under title 39 of the U.S. Code 
or obtain information to assist the Commission in the preparation of a 
report or performance of a function under title 39 of the U.S. Code.
    (b) Non-public materials means any information, documents, and 
things filed with the Commission which are claimed to be exempt from 
disclosure by the Postal Service pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 504(g), 3652(f) 
or 3654(f), or claimed to be protectable under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 26(c) by a third party with a proprietary interest in the 
materials. Non-public materials cease to be non-public if the status has 
expired or been terminated by the Commission pursuant to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.2  Scope.

    The Commission or its authorized representative may require the 
Postal Service to provide any information, documents, and things in its 
possession or control, or any information, documents, and things that it 
can obtain through reasonable effort and expense, that are likely to 
materially assist the Commission in its conduct of proceedings, in its 
preparation of reports,

[[Page 413]]

or in performance of its functions under title 39 of the U.S. Code. 
Information, documents, and things the Postal Service may be required to 
provide, include, but are not limited to, paper hard copy and 
electronically stored data and materials--including writings, notes, e-
mails, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, 
and other data or data compilations--stored in any medium from which 
information can be obtained either directly or, if necessary, after 
translation into a reasonably usable form; or any tangible things.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.3  Data or information requests.

    (a) The Commission or its authorized representative may issue data 
or information requests to the Postal Service seeking information, 
documents, and things covered by Sec. 3007.2. A data or information 
request shall describe the documents, information, and things sought, 
briefly explain the reason for the request, and specify a timeframe for 
receiving the requested information and materials.
    (b) The Commission or its authorized representative may issue data 
or information requests to third parties seeking any information, 
document or thing. A data information request shall describe the 
documents, information and things sought, briefly explain the reason for 
the request, and specify a timeframe for receiving the requested 
materials.
    (c) Any person may request that the Commission issue a data or 
information request by filing a motion with the Commission, pursuant to 
Sec. 3001.21 of this chapter, which describes the documents, 
information, and things sought, explains the reasons the Commission 
should make the request, and includes a statement of how the materials 
sought are relevant and material to the Commission's duties under title 
39 of the U.S. Code.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.10  Submission of non-public materials under seal.

    (a) Non-public materials shall not be filed electronically pursuant 
to Sec. 3001.9 of this chapter, but shall be filed in sealed envelopes 
clearly marked ``Confidential. Do Not Post on Web.'' The person filing 
the non-public materials shall submit two copies consisting, where 
practicable, of two paper hard copies as well as two copies in easily 
usable electronic form such as compact discs (CDs) or digital video 
discs (DVDs) of the non-public materials which shall also be clearly 
marked ``Confidential. Do Not Post on Web.'' Spreadsheets submitted in 
electronic form shall display the formulas used, their links to related 
spreadsheets, and shall not be password protected. All workpapers or 
data shall be submitted in a form, and be accompanied by sufficient 
explanation and documentation to allow them to be replicated using a 
publicly available PC application. Each page of any paper hard copy non-
public materials submitted shall be clearly marked as non-public.
    (b) The person submitting the non-public materials shall also file 
an electronic public (redacted) copy of the non-public materials 
pursuant to Sec. 3001.9 of this chapter. The electronic public 
(redacted) copy of the materials which are not spreadsheets, data files, 
or programs must be submitted in a searchable electronic format, but 
need not be submitted in its native format. As part of its publicly 
available electronic filing, the Postal Service must appropriately 
redact materials that contain both public and non-public information. 
For example, the Postal Service may not identify a whole page or a whole 
table as non-public materials if the page or table contains both public 
and non-public information, but must redact only the information it 
claims to be non-public. If practicable, the Postal Service shall 
sequentially number each page of the materials identified as non-public.
    (c) The Postal Service or third party shall use the graphical 
redaction (blackout) method for all redacted materials. Should the 
Postal Service wish to use any other method, it must state with 
particularity the competitive harm associated with use of the graphical 
redaction method to justify the use of any other method, and indicate 
the number of lines or pages removed at each redaction.
    (d) The Postal Service or third party shall mark each page, item, 
and thing,

[[Page 414]]

or portion thereof, that it seeks to protect from disclosure in a manner 
reasonably calculated to alert custodians to the confidential nature of 
the information or materials.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.20  Application for non-public treatment.

    (a) Whenever the Postal Service files non-public materials with the 
Commission, it shall at the same time file an application for non-public 
treatment under Sec. 3007.21.
    (b) Before the Postal Service files non-public materials with the 
Commission which the Postal Service has reason to believe may implicate 
a third-party proprietary interest, the Postal Service shall inform each 
such third party:
    (1) Of the nature and scope of the filing with the Commission, 
including the pertinent docket, and
    (2) That it may address its confidentiality concerns directly with 
the Commission.
    (c) A third party with a proprietary interest in the materials may, 
if it deems necessary, independently seek non-public treatment under 
Sec. 3007.22.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.21  Content of the Postal Service application for non-public treatment.

    (a) Whenever the Postal Service files non-public materials with the 
Commission, it must submit an application for non-public treatment that 
clearly identifies all non-public materials and describes the 
circumstances causing them to be submitted to the Commission.
    (b) An application for non-public treatment is to fulfill the burden 
of persuasion that the non-public materials should be withheld from the 
public.
    (c) The application for non-public treatment must include a specific 
and detailed statement setting forth:
    (1) The rationale for claiming that the materials are non-public, 
including the specific statutory basis for the claim, and a statement 
justifying application of the provision(s);
    (2) Identification, including name, phone number, and e-mail address 
for any third party who is known to have a proprietary interest in the 
materials, or if such an identification is sensitive, contact 
information for a Postal Service employee who shall provide notice to 
that third party;
    (3) A description of the materials claimed to be non-public in a 
manner that, without revealing the materials at issue, would allow a 
person to thoroughly evaluate the basis for the claim that they are non-
public;
    (4) Particular identification of the nature and extent of commercial 
harm alleged and the likelihood of such harm;
    (5) At least one specific hypothetical, illustrative example of each 
alleged harm;
    (6) The extent of protection from public disclosure deemed to be 
necessary;
    (7) The length of time deemed necessary for the non-public materials 
to be protected from public disclosure with justification thereof; and
    (8) Any other factors or reasons relevant to support the 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.22  Content of third-party application for non-public treatment.

    (a) The application for relief from public disclosure submitted by a 
party other than the Postal Service must clearly identify all materials 
believed to be protected from disclosure.
    (b) The application for non-public treatment must include a specific 
and detailed statement setting forth:
    (1) A description of the materials claimed to be non-public in a 
manner that, without revealing the materials at issue, would allow a 
person to thoroughly evaluate the basis for the claim that they are non-
public;
    (2) Particular identification of the nature and extent of the harm 
alleged and the likelihood of such harm; and
    (3) Any other factors or reasons relevant to support the 
application.


<R05>

    The Commission or its authorized representative will not publicly 
disclose or grant access to non-public materials except as provided in 
the rules of this part.

    (5) Court reporters, stenographers, or persons operating audio or 
video recording equipment for such court reporters or stenographers at

have access to any such materials.


<R05>

status.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.31  Request for early termination of non-public status.

    (a) Any person may make a request to the Commission that non-public 
materials be publicly disclosed. Each such request shall provide a 
specific and detailed statement justifying why the non-public materials 
should be made public, giving specific recognition to any pertinent 
rationale(s) provided in the application for relief submitted pursuant 
to Sec. 3007.21 or Sec. 3007.22. The request, however, shall not 
publicly disclose any of the non-public materials. If it is necessary to 
use the non-public materials to formulate the argument in favor of 
public disclosure, the argument utilizing the non-public materials shall 
be filed under seal.
    (b) Any interested person, including the Postal Service, may file a 
response to the request within 7 days after such a request is filed, 
unless a longer period is specified by the Commission.
    (c) Unless the Commission otherwise provides, no reply to a response 
filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed.
    (d) Following the filing of responses, if any, the Commission will 
issue an order determining the appropriate degree of protection, if any, 
to be accorded to the materials claimed to be non-public by the Postal 
Service or third party with a proprietary interest in the materials.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.32  Preliminary determination of non-public status.

    (a) Whenever the Postal Service files non-public materials, the 
Commission may issue a notice of preliminary determination concerning 
the appropriate degree of protection, if any, to be accorded to such

by the Postal Service against the public interest in maintaining the 
financial transparency of a government entity competing in commercial 
markets.
    (b) In determining whether to publicly disclose non-public materials 
in which the Commission determines a third party has a proprietary 
interest, the Commission shall balance the interests of the parties

Determination (ACD) or the person withdraws or is otherwise no longer 
involved in the relevant proceeding, whichever occurs first.
    (b) Access to non-public materials shall continue for persons 
seeking continued access under Sec. 3007.50.
    (c) Upon termination of access under paragraph (a) of this section, 
all non-public materials in a person's possession must be destroyed, and 
the form attached to the protective conditions certifying destruction 
must be executed and filed with the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.52  Standard for decision for request for access to non-public 

materials relevant to compliance.

    In determining whether to grant a request for access to non-public 
materials relevant to compliance, the Commission shall balance the 
interests of the parties based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c).


<R05>
Sec. 3007.60  Limitations on access to non-public materials.

    To afford appropriate confidentiality to non-public materials during 
any stage of a proceeding before the Commission, or in connection with 
any other purpose under title 39 of the U.S. Code, the Commission may, 
based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c):
    (a) Prohibit the public disclosure of the non-public materials;
    (b) Specify terms for public disclosure of the non-public materials;
    (c) Order a specific method for disclosing the non-public materials;
    (d) Restrict the scope of the disclosure of the non-public materials 
as they relate to certain matters;
    (e) Restrict who may have access to non-public materials;
    (f) Require that a trade secret be revealed only in a specific and 
limited manner or to limited or specified persons; and
    (g) Order other relief as appropriate including, but not limited to, 
sealing a deposition or part of a proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 3007.61  Continued effectiveness of protective conditions.

    (a) If a court or other administrative agency issues a subpoena or 
orders production of non-public materials which a person has obtained 
under protective conditions ordered by the Commission, the target of the 
subpoena or order shall, within 2 days of receipt of the subpoena or 
order for production, notify the Postal Service of the pendency of the 
subpoena or order to allow the Postal Service time to object to the 
production or to seek a protective order or seek such other relief as it 
deems appropriate.

[[Page 418]]

    (b) Any person seeking to disclose non-public materials shall make a 
good faith effort to obtain protective conditions at least as effective 
as those set forth in the Commission order establishing the protective 
conditions.
    (c) Protective conditions ordered by the Commission or its 
authorized representative shall remain in effect throughout any 
subsequent review unless overridden by the action of the reviewing 
court.


<R05>

    (a) No person who has been granted access to materials subject to 
protective conditions shall disseminate the materials in whole or in 
part to any person not authorized to obtain access under the protective 
conditions imposed by the Commission. If a person who has been granted 
access to such non-public materials under a protective order violates 
the terms of such order, the Commission or its authorized representative 
shall impose sanctions on the person who violated the protective order 
or the individuals or entities on whose behalf the person was acting, or 
both. The sanctions may include:
    (1) Dismissing the proceeding in whole or in part;
    (2) Ruling by default against the person who violated the protective 
order; and
    (3) Such other sanctions as the Commission or its authorized 
representative deems appropriate.
    (b) The Postal Service, in its discretion, may pursue any remedies 
available to it under the law against the individual who violated the 
protective order, or the individuals or entities on whose behalf the 
person was acting, or both.

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 3010.1  Applicability.

    The rules in this part implement provisions in the Postal 
Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) establishing ratesetting 
policies and procedures for market dominant products. With the exception 
of exigency-based rate adjustments, these procedures allow a minimum of 
45 days for advance public notice of the Postal Service's planned rate 
adjustments. Exigency-based rate adjustments require the Postal Service 
to file a formal request with the Commission and are subject to special 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.2  Types of rate adjustments for market dominant products.

    (a) There are four types of rate adjustments for market dominant 
products. A Type 1-A rate adjustment, authorized under 39 U.S.C. 
3622(d)(1)(D), is based on the statutory annual limitation. A Type 1-B 
rate adjustment, authorized under 39 U.S.C. 3622(d)(2)(C), is based on 
an exception to the annual limitation, and is referred to as unused rate 
adjustment authority. A Type 2 rate adjustment, authorized under 39 
U.S.C. 3622(c)(10), is based on a negotiated service agreement. A Type 3 
rate adjustment, authorized under 39 U.S.C. 3622(d)(1)(E), is based on 
exigent circumstances.
    (b) Upon the establishment of unused rate adjustment authority in 
any class, the Postal Service shall devise and maintain a schedule that 
tracks the establishment and subsequent use of unused rate adjustment 
authority.
    (c) The Postal Service may combine Types 1-A, 1-B and 2 rate 
adjustments for purposes of filing with the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.3  Type 1-A rate adjustment--in general.

    (a) A Type 1-A rate adjustment represents the usual type of 
adjustment to rates of general applicability.
    (b) A Type 1-A rate adjustment may result in a rate adjustment that 
is less than or equal to the annual limitation, but may not exceed the 
annual limitation.
    (c) A Type 1-A rate adjustment for any class that is less than the 
applicable change in CPI-U results in unused rate adjustment authority 
associated with that class. Part or all of the unused rate adjustment 
authority may be used in a subsequent adjustment for that class, subject 
to the expiration terms in Sec. 3010.26(d).


<R05>
Sec. 3010.4  Type 1-B rate adjustment--in general.

    (a) A Type 1-B rate adjustment is a rate adjustment which uses 
unused rate adjustment authority in whole or in part. A rate adjustment 
using unused rate adjustment authority may not result in an increase for 
the class that exceeds the applicable annual limitation plus 2 
percentage points.
    (b) Type 1-B rate adjustments filed within 12 months of each other 
may not apply more than 2 percentage points of unused rate authority to 
any class.
    (c) Unused rate adjustment authority in each class may be applied to 
rate adjustments in the same class for up to 5 years.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.5  Type 2 rate adjustment--in general.

    A negotiated service agreement rate adjustment entails a rate 
adjustment negotiated between the Postal Service and a customer or group 
of customers.

[[Page 424]]


<R05>
Sec. 3010.6  Type 3 adjustment--in general.

    (a) A Type 3 rate adjustment is a request for an exigency-based rate 
adjustment. It is authorized only when justified by exceptional or 
extraordinary circumstances.
    (b) An exigency-based rate adjustment is not subject to the 
inflation-based limitation or the restrictions on the use of unused rate 
adjustment authority, and does not implement a negotiated service 
agreement.
    (c) A Postal Service request for a Type 3 rate adjustment is subject 
to public participation and Commission review within 90 days.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.7  Schedule of regular rate changes.

    (a) The Postal Service shall maintain on file with the Commission a 
Schedule for Regular and Predictable Rate Changes. The Commission shall 
display the Schedule for Regular and Predictable Rate Changes on the 
Commission Web site, http:// www.prc.gov.
    (b) The Schedule for Regular and Predictable Rate Changes shall 
provide mailers with estimated implementation dates for future Type 1-A 
rate changes for each separate class of mail, should such changes be 
necessary and appropriate. Rate changes will be scheduled at specified 
regular intervals.
    (c) The Schedule for Regular and Predictable Rate Changes shall 
provide an explanation that will allow mailers to predict with 
reasonable accuracy the amounts of future scheduled rate changes.
    (d) The initial Schedule for Regular and Predictable Rate Changes 
must be filed within 90 days of the effective date of this rule. The 
Postal Service should balance its financial and operational needs with 
the convenience of mailers of each class of mail in developing the 
schedule.
    (e) Whenever the Postal Service deems it appropriate to change the 
Schedule for Regular and Predictable Rate Changes, it shall file a 
revised schedule and explanation with the Commission.
    (f) The Postal Service may, for good cause shown, vary rate 
adjustments from those estimated by the Schedule for Regular and 
Predictable Rate Changes. In such case, the Postal Service should 
provide a succinct explanation for such variation with its Type 1-A 
filing. No explanation is required for changes involving smaller than 
predicted rate adjustments.


<R04>
Subpart B_Rules for Rate Adjustments for Rates of General Applicability 
                   (Type 1	A and 1	B Rate Adjustments)


<R05>
Sec. 3010.10  Procedures.

    (a) The Postal Service, in every instance in which it determines to 
exercise its statutory authority to make a Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate 
adjustment for a market dominant postal product shall:
    (1) Provide public notice in a manner reasonably designed to inform 
the mailing community and the general public that it intends to change 
rates not later than 45 days prior to the intended implementation date; 
and
    (2) Transmit a notice of rate adjustment to the Commission no later 
than 45 days prior to the intended implementation date.
    (b) The Postal Service is encouraged to provide public notice and to 
submit its notice of rate adjustment as far in advance of the 45-day 
minimum as practicable, especially in instances where the intended price 
changes include classification changes or operations changes likely to 
have material impact on mailers.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.11  Limit on size of rate increases.

    (a) Rate increases for each class of market dominant products in any 
12-month period are limited.
    (b) Rates of general applicability are subject to an inflation-based 
limitation computed using CPI-U values as detailed in Sec. 3010.12.
    (c) An exception to the inflation-based limitation allows a limited 
annual recapture of unused rate authority. The amount of unused rate 
authority is measured separately for each class of mail.
    (d) In any 12-month period the inflation-based limitation combined 
with the allowable recapture of unused rate

[[Page 425]]

authority equals the price cap applicable to each class of mail.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.12  Source of CPI-U data for purposes of annual limitation.

    The monthly CPI-U values needed for the calculation of the annual 
limitation under this part shall be obtained from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index--All Urban Consumers, U.S. All 
Items, Not Seasonally Adjusted, Base Period 1982-84 = 100. The current 
Series ID for the index is ``CUUR0000SA0.''


<R05>
Sec. 3010.13  Proceedings for Type 1-A and Type 1-B rate adjustment filings.

    (a) The Commission will establish a docket for each rate adjustment 
filing, promptly publish notice of the filing in the Federal Register, 
and post the filing on its Web site. The notice shall include:
    (1) The general nature of the proceeding;
    (2) A reference to legal authority to which the proceeding is to be 
conducted;
    (3) A concise description of the planned for changes in rates, fees, 
and the Mail Classification Schedule;
    (4) The identification of an officer of the Commission to represent 
the interests of the general public in the docket;
    (5) A period of 20 days from the date of the filing for public 
comment; and
    (6) Such other information as the Commission deems appropriate.
    (b) Public comments should focus primarily on whether planned rate 
adjustments comply with the following mandatory requirements of 39 
U.S.C. chapter 36, subchapter 1:
    (1) Whether the planned rate adjustments measured using the formula 
established in Sec. 3010.23(b) are at or below the annual limitation 
established in Sec. 3010.11; and
    (2) Whether the planned rate adjustments measured using the formula 
established in Sec. 3010.23(b) are at or below the limitations 
established in Sec. 3010.28.
    (c) Within 14 days of the conclusion of the public comment period 
the Commission will determine, at a minimum, whether the planned rate 
adjustments are consistent with the annual limitation set forth in rule 
3010.11; the limitations set forth in rule 3010.28; and 39 U.S.C. 3626, 
3627, and 3629, and issue an order announcing its findings.
    (d) If the planned rate adjustments are found consistent with 
applicable law by the Commission, they may take effect pursuant to 
appropriate action by the Governors.
    (e) If planned rate adjustments are found inconsistent with 
applicable law by the Commission, the Postal Service will submit an 
amended notice of rate adjustment and describe the modifications to its 
planned rate adjustments that will bring its rate adjustments into 
compliance. An amended notice of rate adjustment shall be accompanied by 
sufficient explanatory information to show that all deficiencies 
identified by the Commission have been corrected.
    (f) The Commission will post any amended notice of rate adjustment 
filing on its Web site and allow a period of 10 days from the date of 
the filing for public comment. Comments in the amended notice of rate 
adjustment should address the subjects identified in rule 3010.13(b).
    (g) The Commission will review any amended notice of rate adjustment 
together with any comments filed for compliance and within 14 days issue 
an order announcing its findings.
    (h) If the planned rate adjustments as amended are found to be 
consistent with applicable law, they may take effect pursuant to 
appropriate action by the Governors. However, no rate shall take effect 
until 45 days after the Postal Service files a notice of rate adjustment 
specifying that rate.
    (i) If the planned rate adjustments in an amended notice of rate 
adjustment are found to be inconsistent with applicable law, the 
Commission shall explain the basis of its determination and suggest an 
appropriate remedy.
    (j) For purposes of subsequent Commission proceedings, findings that 
a planned Type 1 rate adjustment is in compliance with the annual 
limitation set forth in Sec. 3010.11; the limitations set forth in 
Sec. 3010.28; and 39 U.S.C. 3626, 3627, and 3629 are decided on the 
merits. A Commission finding that a planned Type 1 rate adjustment does 
not contravene other policies of 39 U.S.C.

[[Page 426]]

chapter 36, subchapter 1 is provisional and subject to subsequent 
review.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.14  Contents of notice of rate adjustment.

    (a) General. The Postal Service notice of rate adjustment must 
include the following information:
    (1) A schedule of the proposed rates;
    (2) The planned effective date(s) of the proposed rates;
    (3) A representation or evidence that public notice of the planned 
changes has been issued or will be issued at least 45 days before the 
effective date(s) for the proposed new rates; and
    (4) The identity of a responsible Postal Service official who will 
be available to provide prompt responses to requests for clarification 
from the Commission.
    (b) Supporting technical information and justifications. The notice 
of rate adjustment shall be accompanied by:
    (1) The amount of the applicable change in CPI-U calculated as 
required by Sec. 3010.21 or Sec. 3010.22, as appropriate. This 
information must be supported by workpapers in which all calculations 
are shown, and all input values including all relevant CPI-U values are 
listed with citations to the original sources;
    (2) A schedule showing unused rate authority available for each 
class of mail displayed by class and available amount for each of the 
preceding 5 years. This information must be supported by workpapers in 
which all calculations are shown;
    (3) The percentage change in rates for each class of mail calculated 
as required by Sec. 3010.23. This information must be supported by 
workpapers in which all calculations are shown, and all input values

with citations to the original sources;
    (4) The amount of new unused rate authority, if any, that will be 
generated by the rate adjustment calculated as required by Sec. 
3010.26. All calculations are to be shown with citations to the original 
sources. If new unused rate authority will be generated for a class of 
mail that is not expected to cover its attributable costs, the Postal 
Service must provide the rationale underlying this rate adjustment;
    (5) A schedule of the workshare discounts included in the proposed 
rates, and a companion schedule listing the avoided costs that underlie 
each such discount. The avoided cost figures must be developed from the 
most recent PRC Annual Compliance Report. This information must be 
supported by workpapers in which all calculations are shown, and all 
input values are listed with citations to the original sources;
    (6) Separate justification for all proposed workshare discounts that

below avoided costs and explain any relationship between discounts that 
are above and those that are below avoided costs;
    (7) A discussion that demonstrates how the planned rate adjustments 
are designed to help achieve the objectives listed in 39 U.S.C. 3622(b) 
and properly take into account the factors listed in 39 U.S.C. 3622(c);
    (8) A discussion that demonstrates the planned rate adjustments are 
consistent with 39 U.S.C. 3626, 3627, and 3629;
    (9) A schedule identifying every change to the Mail Classification 
Schedule that will be necessary to implement the planned rate 
adjustments; and
    (10) Such other information as the Postal Service believes will 
assist the Commission to issue a timely determination of whether the 
requested increases are consistent with applicable statutory policies.
    (c) New workshare discounts. Whenever the Postal Service establishes 
a new workshare discount rate, it must include with its filing:
    (1) A statement explaining its reasons for establishing the 
discount;
    (2) All data, economic analyses, and other information relied on to 
justify the discount; and
    (3) A certification based on comprehensive, competent analyses that 
the discount will not adversely affect either the rates or the service 
levels of users of postal services who do not take advantage of the 
discount.

[[Page 427]]

    (d) Information required only when Type 1-B rate adjustments are 
proposed. The notice of rate adjustment shall identify for each affected 
class how much existing unused rate authority is used in the proposed 
rates calculated as required by Sec. 3010.27. All calculations are to 
be shown, including citations to the original sources.


<R04>
               Subpart C_Rules for Applying the Price Cap


<R05>
Sec. 3010.20  Test for compliance with the annual limitation.

    The appropriate annual limitation shall be applied to a measure of 
the rates paid by mail sent in each class for which rate adjustments are 
to be made to determine whether planned rates are consistent with the 
annual limitation.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.21  Calculation of annual limitation.

    (a) The calculation of an annual limitation involves three steps. 
First, a simple average CPI-U index is calculated by summing the most 
recently available 12 monthly CPI-U values from the date the Postal 
Service files its notice of rate adjustment and dividing the sum by 12 
(Recent Average). Then, a second simple average CPI-U index is similarly 
calculated by summing the 12 monthly CPI-U values immediately preceding 
the Recent Average and dividing the sum by 12 (Base Average). Finally, 
the annual limitation is calculated by dividing the Recent Average by 
the Base Average and subtracting 1 from the quotient. The result is 
expressed as a percentage, rounded to three decimal places.
    (b) The formula for calculating an annual limitation is as follows: 
Annual Limitation = (Recent Average/Base Average)-1.

[74 FR 49327, Sept. 28, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 3010.22  Calculation of less than annual limitation.

    (a) If a notice of rate adjustment is filed less than 1 year after 
the last Type 1-A or Type 1-B notice of rate adjustment applicable to an 
affected class of mail, then the annual limitation will recognize the 
rate increases that have occurred during the preceding 12 months. When 
the effects of those increases are removed, the remaining partial year 
limitation is the applicable restriction on rate increases.
    (b) The applicable partial year limitation is calculated in two 
steps. First, a simple average CPI-U index is calculated by summing the 
12 most recently available monthly CPI-U values from the date the Postal 
Service files its notice of rate adjustment and dividing the sum by 12 
(Recent Average). The partial year limitation is then calculated by 
dividing the Recent Average by the Recent Average from the most recent 
previous notice of rate adjustment (Previous Recent Average) applicable 
to each affected class of mail and subtracting 1 from the quotient. The 
result is expressed as a percentage, rounded to three decimal places.
    (c) The formula for calculating the partial year limitation for a 
notice of rate adjustment filed less than 1 year after the last notice 
is as follows: Partial Year Limitation = (Recent Average/Previous Recent 
Average)-1.

[74 FR 49327, Sept. 28, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 3010.23  Calculation of percentage change in rates.

    (a) The term rate cell as applied in the test for compliance with 
the annual limitation shall apply to each and every separate rate 
identified in any applicable notice of rate adjustment for rates of 
general applicability. Thus, seasonal or temporary rates, for example, 
shall be identified and treated as rate cells separate and distinct from 
the corresponding non-seasonal or permanent rates.
    (b) For each class of mail, the percentage change in rates is 
calculated in three steps. First, the volume of each rate cell in the 
class is multiplied by the planned rate for the respective cell and the 
resulting products are summed. Then, the same set of rate cell volumes 
are multiplied by the corresponding current rate for each cell and the 
resulting products are summed. Finally, the percentage change in rates 
is calculated by dividing the results of the first step by the

[[Page 428]]

results of the second step and subtracting 1 from the quotient. The 
result is expressed as a percentage.
    (c) The formula for calculating the percentage change in rates for a 
class described in paragraph (b) of this section is as follows:
    Percentage change in rates =
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09NO07.000
    
Where,

N = number of rate cells in the class
i = denotes a rate cell (i = 1, 2, ..., N)
R<INF>i,n</INF> = planned rate of rate cell i
R<INF>i,c</INF> = current rate of rate cell i
V<INF>i</INF> = volume of rate cell i

    (d) The volumes for each rate cell shall be obtained from the most 
recent available 12 months of Postal Service billing determinants. The 
Postal Service shall make reasonable adjustments to the billing 
determinants to account for the effects of classification changes such 
as the introduction, deletion, or redefinition of rate cells. Whenever 
possible, adjustments shall be based on known mail characteristics. The 
Postal Service shall identify and explain all adjustments. All 
information and calculations relied upon to develop the adjustments 
shall be provided together with an explanation of why the adjustments 
are appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.24  Treatment of volume associated with negotiated service agreements.

    (a) Mail volumes sent at rates under negotiated service agreements 
are to be included in the calculation of percentage change in rates as 
though they paid the appropriate rates of general applicability. Where 
it is impractical to identify the rates of general applicability (e.g., 
because unique rate categories are created for a mailer), the volumes 
associated with the mail sent under the terms of the negotiated service 
agreement shall be excluded from the calculation of percentage change in 
rates.
    (b) The Postal Service shall identify and explain all assumptions it 
makes with respect to the treatment of negotiated service agreements in 
the calculation of the percentage change in rates and provide the 
rationale for its assumptions.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.25  Limitation on unused rate adjustment authority rate adjustments.

    Unused rate adjustment authority rate adjustments may only be 
applied together with inflation-based limitation rate adjustments or 
when inflation-based limitation rate adjustments are not possible. 
Unused rate adjustment authority rate adjustments may not be used in 
lieu of an inflation-based limitation rate adjustment.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.26  Calculation of unused rate adjustment authority.

    (a) Unused rate adjustment authority accrues during the entire 
period between notices of Type 1 rate adjustments.
    (b) When notices of Type 1 rate adjustments are filed 12 months 
apart or less, either the annual or partial year limitation (developed 
pursuant to Sec. 3010.21(a) or Sec. 3010.22(b) respectively) is used 
to measure the accrued unused rate authority. In either circumstance, 
the new unused rate authority for each class is equal to the difference 
between the maximum allowable percentage change in rates under the 
applicable rate limitation and the actual percentage change in rates for 
that class.
    (c) When a notice of rate adjustment is filed more than 12 months 
after the previous notice of rate adjustment, unused rate authority is 
computed in three steps:
    (1) The unused rate authority for the 12 months represented by the 
annual limitation is computed as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section;
    (2) The additional unused rate authority accrued is measured by 
dividing the Base Average applicable to the instant notice of rate 
adjustment (as developed pursuant to Sec. 3010.21(a)) by the Recent 
Average utilized in the previous notice of rate adjustment (as developed 
pursuant to Sec. 3010.21(a)) and subtracting 1 from the quotient. The 
result is expressed as a percentage; and
    (3) The results from step 1 and step 2 are added together.

[[Page 429]]

    (d) Unused rate adjustment authority lapses 5 years after the date 
of filing of the notice of rate adjustment leading to its computation.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.27  Application of unused rate adjustment authority.

    When the percentage change in rates for a class is greater than the 
applicable annual limitation, then the difference between the percentage 
change in rates for the class and the price cap shall be subtracted from 
the existing unused rate authority for the class, using a first-in, 
first-out (FIFO) method, beginning 5 years before the instant notice.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.28  Maximum size of unused rate adjustment authority rate adjustments.

    Unused rate adjustment authority exercised in notices of rate 
adjustments for any class in any 12-month period may not exceed the 
applicable limitations described in Sec. Sec. 3010.21 or 3010.22 plus 
the lesser of:
    (a) 2 percent; or
    (b) The sum of any unused rate adjustment authority for that class.


<R05>
Sec. 3010.29  Transition rule.

    If the Postal Service initial exercise of its authority to file a 
Type 1-A notice of rate adjustment is preceded by a transitional rate 
case filing under 39 U.S.C. 3622(f):
    (a) The annual limitation as calculated in Sec. 3010.21 is 
applicable if the notice of rate adjustment is 12 months or more after 
the date of the Decision of the Governors approving rate changes 
associated with the transitional filing; and
    (b) The annual limitation as calculated in Sec. 3010.22 is 
applicable if the notice of rate adjustment is 12 months or more after 
the date of the Decision of the Governors approving rate changes 
associated with the transitional filing. In such circumstances, the date 
of the Decision of the Governors approving rate changes associated with 
the transitional filing is the most recent previous notice of rate 
adjustment.

Service has or expects to obtain to support its factual allegations and 
defenses; and

Sec. 3050.10  Analytical principles to be applied in the Postal Service's 

annual periodic reports to the Commission.

    In its annual periodic reports to the Commission, the Postal Service 
shall use only accepted analytical principles. With respect to its 
submissions under Sec. 3050.26, however, the Postal Service may elect 
to use an analytical principle prior to its acceptance by the 
Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3050.11  Proposals to change an accepted analytical principle applied in

the Postal Service's annual periodic reports to the Commission.

    (a) To improve the quality, accuracy, or completeness of the data or 
analysis of data contained in the Postal Service's annual periodic 
reports to the Commission, the Commission, acting on its own behalf, may 
issue a notice of proceeding to change an accepted analytical principle. 
In addition, any interested person, including the Postal Service or a 
public representative, may submit a petition to the Commission to 
initiate such a proceeding.
    (b) Form and content of notice or petition. The notice of proceeding 
or petition shall identify the accepted analytical principle proposed 
for review, explain its perceived deficiencies, and suggest how those 
deficiencies should be remedied.
    (1) If the notice of proceeding or petition proposes that a specific 
alternative analytical principle be followed, it should include the 
data, analysis, and documentation on which the proposal is based, and, 
where feasible, include an estimate of the impact of the proposed change 
on the relevant characteristics of affected postal products, including 
their attributable cost, avoided cost, average revenue, or service 
attainment.
    (2) If the petitioner requests access to data from the Postal 
Service to support the assertions or conclusions in its petition, and 
such data are not otherwise available, it shall accompany the petition 
with a request to gain access to such data. The petitioner's request 
should identify the data sought, and include the reasons for believing 
that the data will support its petition. To expedite its evaluation of 
the data

[[Page 451]]

request, the Commission may, after reasonable public notice, order that 
answers or objections be presented orally or in writing.
    (c) Procedures for processing a notice or petition. To better 
evaluate a notice or petition to change an accepted analytical 
principle, the Commission may order that it be made the subject of 
discovery. By request of any interested person, or on its own behalf, 
the Commission may order that the petitioner and/or the Postal Service 
provide experts on the subject matter of the proposal to participate in 
technical conferences, prepare statements clarifying or supplementing 
their views, or answer questions posed by the Commission or its 
representatives.
    (d) Action on the notice or petition. (1) After the conclusion of 
discovery procedures, if any, the Commission shall determine whether to 
issue a notice of proposed rulemaking based on the petition and the 
supporting material received. Such notice shall be evaluated by 
procedures that are consistent with 5 U.S.C. 553. Interested parties 
will be afforded an opportunity to present written comments and reply 
comments, and, if the Commission so orders, to present oral comments as 
well.
    (2) If accepted by the Commission, the change proposed in the notice 
of proposed rulemaking shall be published in a final rule in the Federal 
Register and on the Commission's Web site.


<R05>
Sec. 3050.12  Obsolescence of special studies relied on to produce

    The Postal Service's Cost and Revenue Analysis (CRA) report shall be 
presented in a format reflecting the classification structure in the 
Mail Classification Schedule. It shall also be presented in an 
alternative, more disaggregated format capable of reflecting the 
classification structure in effect prior to the adoption of the Postal 
Accountability and Enhancement Act.


<R05>
Sec. 3050.20  Compliance and other analyses in the Postal Service's section 3652 report.

    (a) The Postal Service's section 3652 report shall include an 
analysis of the information that it contains in sufficient detail to 
demonstrate the degree to which, in the fiscal year covered by its 
report, each of its products (market dominant and competitive) comply 
with all of the applicable provisions of title 39 of the United States 
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and promote the public 
policy objectives set out in title 39 of the United States Code.
    (b) Its analysis shall be applied to products individually, and, 
where appropriate, to products collectively.
    (c) It shall address such matters as non-compensatory rates, 
discounts greater than avoided costs, and failures to achieve stated 
goals for on-time delivery standards. A more detailed analysis is 
required when the Commission observed and commented upon the same matter 
in its Annual Compliance Determination for the previous fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 3050.21  Content of the Postal Service's section 3652 report.

    (a) No later than 90 days after the close of each fiscal year, the 
Postal Service shall submit a report to the Commission analyzing its 
cost, volume, revenue, rate, and service information in sufficient 
detail to demonstrate that all products during such year comply with all 
applicable provisions of title 39

[[Page 452]]

of the United States Code. The report shall provide the items in 
paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section.
    (b) The volume and revenue generated by each product;
    (c) The attributable costs of, and the contribution to institutional 
costs made by, each product;

for its most recent year of operation. The year analyzed shall end on 
the anniversary of the negotiated service agreement that falls within 
the fiscal year covered by the Postal Service's annual periodic reports 
to the Commission and include the 12 preceding months. The analysis 
shall show all calculations and fully identify all inputs. Inputs used 
to estimate the effect on total contribution to the Postal Service, such 
as unit costs and price elasticities, shall be updated using fiscal year 
values; and
    (5) Analyze the effect of the negotiated service agreement (and 
other functionally equivalent negotiated service agreements) on the 
marketplace. If there were harmful effects, explain why those effects 
were not unreasonable.
    (g) For each competitive negotiated service agreement:
    (1) Identify its rates and service features; and
    (2) Estimate its costs, volumes, and revenues.
    (h) For market tests of experimental products:

an inappropriate competitive advantage for the Postal Service or any 
mailer.
    (i) For each nonpostal service, estimate its costs, volumes, and 
revenues; and
    (j) Provide any other information that the Postal Service believes 
will help the Commission evaluate the Postal Service's compliance with 
the applicable provisions of title 39 of the United States Code.
