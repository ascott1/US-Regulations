                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    Category:
    (1) As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, 
and limitations of airmen, means a broad classification of aircraft. 
Examples include: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; and lighter-than-air; 
and
    (2) As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a 
grouping of aircraft based upon intended use or operating limitations. 
Examples include: transport, normal, utility, acrobatic, limited, 
restricted, and provisional.
    Category A, with respect to transport category rotorcraft, means 
multiengine rotorcraft designed with engine and system isolation 
features specified in Part 29 and utilizing scheduled takeoff and 
landing operations under a critical engine failure concept which assures 
adequate designated surface area and adequate performance capability for 
continued safe flight in the event of engine failure.
    Category B, with respect to transport category rotorcraft, means 
single-engine or multiengine rotorcraft which do not fully meet all 
Category A standards. Category B rotorcraft have no guaranteed stay-up 
ability in the event of engine failure and unscheduled landing is 
assumed.
    Category II operations, with respect to the operation of aircraft, 
means a straight-in ILS approach to the runway of an airport under a 
Category II ILS instrument approach procedure issued by the 
Administrator or other appropriate authority.
    Category III operations, with respect to the operation of aircraft, 
means an ILS approach to, and landing on, the runway of an airport using 
a Category III ILS instrument approach procedure issued by the 
Administrator or other appropriate authority.
    Category IIIa operations, an ILS approach and landing with no 
decision height (DH), or a DH below 100 feet (30 meters), and 
controlling runway visual range not less than 700 feet (200 meters).
    Category IIIb operations, an ILS approach and landing with no DH, or 
with a DH below 50 feet (15 meters), and controlling runway visual range 
less than 700 feet (200 meters), but not less than 150 feet (50 meters).
    Category IIIc operations, an ILS approach and landing with no DH and 
no runway visual range limitation.
    Ceiling means the height above the earth's surface of the lowest 
layer of clouds or obscuring phenomena that is reported as ``broken'', 
``overcast'', or ``obscuration'', and not classified as ``thin'' or 
``partial''.
    Civil aircraft means aircraft other than public aircraft.
    Class:

[[Page 7]]

    (1) As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, 
and limitations of airmen, means a classification of aircraft within a 
category having similar operating characteristics. Examples include: 
single engine; multiengine; land; water; gyroplane; helicopter; airship; 
and free balloon; and
    (2) As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a 
broad grouping of aircraft having similar characteristics of propulsion, 
flight, or landing. Examples include: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; 
balloon; landplane; and seaplane.
    Clearway means:
    (1) For turbine engine powered airplanes certificated after August 
29, 1959, an area beyond the runway, not less than 500 feet wide, 
centrally located about the extended centerline of the runway, and under 
the control of the airport authorities. The clearway is expressed in 
terms of a clearway plane, extending from the end of the runway with an 
upward slope not exceeding 1.25 percent, above which no object nor any 
terrain protrudes. However, threshold lights may protrude above the 
plane if their height above the end of the runway is 26 inches or less 
and if they are located to each side of the runway.
    (2) For turbine engine powered airplanes certificated after 
September 30, 1958, but before August 30, 1959, an area beyond the 
takeoff runway extending no less than 300 feet on either side of the 
extended centerline of the runway, at an elevation no higher than the 
elevation of the end of the runway, clear of all fixed obstacles, and 
under the control of the airport authorities.
    Climbout speed, with respect to rotorcraft, means a referenced 
airspeed which results in a flight path clear of the height-velocity 
envelope during initial climbout.
    Commercial operator means a person who, for compensation or hire, 
engages in the carriage by aircraft in air commerce of persons or 
property, other than as an air carrier or foreign air carrier or under

<R05>
Sec. 11.15  Emergency exemptions.

    If, as a result of enemy attack on the United States, communication 
with Washington headquarters of FAA is or may be disrupted or materially 
impaired, petitions for exemptions from any rule issued under Titles III 
or VI of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (air safety rules and air 
traffic and airspace rules) may also be filed at the nearest FAA 
Regional Office, air traffic control facility or office, Flight 
Standards District Office, Aircraft Certification Directorate, Aircraft 
Certification Office, International Field Office or FAA Representative 
in the Europe, Africa, and Middle East Region, or in the Pacific Region. 
The procedural requirements of Secs. 11.53, 11.71, and 11.91, and the 
publication and comment procedures of Sec. 11.27 need not be followed. 
Under these emergency conditions, the FAA inspectors or officers in 
charge of these offices may grant, in whole or in part and subject to 
reasonable conditions or limitations, such exemptions or may deny 
petitions for such exemptions; may issue such exemptions to named 
persons or in blanket form on their own initiative; and may limit or 
terminate exemptions so issued by them or by offices whose jurisdiction 
they may have assumed. Exemptions issued under these circumstances are 
at all times subject to modification and termination by the Regional 
Administrator or Acting Regional Administrator or officer in charge of 
the Region concerned, subject to ultimate action by the Director or 
Acting Director of the Service concerned.

Amdt. 11-32, 54 FR 39289, Sept. 25, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 11.17  Direct final rule.

    Whenever the FAA anticipates that a proposed regulation is unlikely 
to result in adverse comment, it may choose to issue a direct final 
rule. The direct final rule will advise the public that no adverse or 
negative comments are anticipated, and that unless a written adverse or 
negative comment, or a written notice of intent to submit an adverse or 
negative comment is received within the comment period, the regulation 
will become effective on the date specified in the direct final rule. If 
no written adverse or negative comment, or notice of intent to submit 
such a comment is received within the

[[Page 19]]

comment period, the direct final rule will become effective on the date 
indicated in the direct final rule. The FAA will publish a document in 
the Federal Register indicating that no adverse or negative comments 
were received and confirming the date on which the final rule will 
become effective. If the FAA does receive, within the comment period, an 
adverse or negative comment, or written notice of intent to submit such 
a comment, a document withdrawing the direct final rule will be 
published in the Federal Register, and a notice of proposed rulemaking 
may be published with a new comment period. Normal procedures for the 
agency's receipt and consideration of comments will then apply.

[Doc. No. 27925, 61 FR 11282, Mar. 19, 1996]


<R04>
         Subpart B--Rules Other Than Airspace Assignment and Use


<R05>
Sec. 11.21  Scope.

    (a) This subpart applies to substantive rules, other than those 
relating to airspace assignment and use.
    (b) Unless the Administrator, for good cause, finds that notice is 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and 
incorporates that finding and a brief statement of the reasons for it in 
the rule, the FAA issues notices of proposed rulemaking and allows 
interested persons to participate in rulemaking procedings involving a 
substantive rule.
    (c) Unless the Administrator determines that notice and rulemaking 
procedures are to be followed, interpretive rules, general statements of 
policy, and rules of FAA organization, procedure, or practice are 
prescribed as final without notice or rulemaking procedures.
    (d) Whenever the Administrator so determines, the procedures 
prescribed in this subpart apply to exempting persons and classes from 
the requirements of a substantive rule.


<R05>
Sec. 11.23  Initiating rulemaking procedures.

    The Administrator initiates rulemaking procedures upon his own 
motion. However, in doing so, he considers the recommendations of other 
agencies of the United States and the petitions of other interested 
persons.


<R05>
Sec. 11.25  Petitions for rulemaking or exemptions.

    (a) Any interested person may petition the Administrator to issue, 
amend, or repeal a rule whether or not it is a substantive rule within 
the meaning of Sec. 11.21, or for a temporary or permanent exemption 
from any rule issued by the Federal Aviation Administration under 
statutory authority.
    (b) Each petition filed under this section must--
    (1) In the case of a petition for exemption, unless good cause is 
shown in that petition, be submitted at least 120 days before the 
proposed effective date of the exemption;
    (2) Be submitted in duplicate--
    (i) To the appropriate FAA airport field office in whose area the 
petitioner proposes to establish or has established its airport, in the 
case of any petition for exemption filed under Part 139 of this chapter;
    (ii) To the Director having Airworthiness Directive responsibility 
for the product involved in the case of petitions filed in accordance 
with Subpart D of this part.
    (iii) To the Federal Air Surgeon (AAM-1), Federal Aviation 
Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20591, in 
the case of a petition for exemption filed under Part 67 of this 
chapter; and
    (iv) To the Rules Docket (AGC-10), Federal Aviation Administration, 
800 Independence Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20591, in all other cases.

proposed, or of the rule or statute from which the exemption is sought, 
or specify the rule that the petitioner seeks to have repealed, as the 
case may be;
    (4) Explain the interests of the petitioner in the action requested 
including, in the case of a petition for an exemption, the nature and 
extent of the relief sought and a description of each aircraft or person 
to be covered by the exemption;
    (5) Contain any information, views, or arguments available to the 
petitioner to support the action sought,

[[Page 20]]

the reasons why the granting of the request would be in the public 
interest and, if appropriate, in the case of an exemption, the reason 
why the exemption would not adversely affect safety or the action to be 
taken by the petitioner to provide a level of safety equal to that 
provided by the rule from which the exemption is sought; and
    (6)(i) In the case of a unit of Federal, state, or local government 
that is applying for an exemption from any requirement of part A of 
subtitle VII of title 49, United States Code, that would otherwise be 
applicable to current or future aircraft of such unit of government as a 
result of the statutory change in the definition of public aircraft made 
by the Independent Safety Board Act Amendments of 1994, Public Law 103-
411, the petition for exemption must contain any information, views, 
analysis, or arguments available to the petitioner to show that:
    (A) The exemption is necessary to prevent an undue economic burden 
on the unit of government; and
    (B) The aviation safety program of the unit of government is 
effective and appropriate to ensure safe operations of the type of 
aircraft operated by the unit of government.
    (ii) The authority of the Administrator, under the Independent 
Safety Board Amendments of 1994, Pub. L. 103-411, to grant exemptions to 
units of government is delegated to the Director, Flight Standards 
Service, and the Director, Aircraft Certification Service.
    (c) A petition for rulemaking filed under this section must contain 
a summary, which may be published in the Federal Register as provided in 
Sec. 11.27(b), which includes--

petition for instituting rulemaking procedures.
    (d) A petition for exemption filed under this section must contain a 
summary, which may be published in the Federal Register as provided in 
Sec. 11.27(c), which includes--
    (1) A citation of each rule from which relief is requested; and

<R05>
Sec. 11.27  Action on petitions for rulemaking or exemptions.

    (a) General. Except for the publication and comment procedures 
provided for in this section, no public hearing, argument, or other 
formal proceeding is held directly on a petition, filed under 
Sec. 11.25, before its disposition by the FAA.
    (b) Publication of summary of petition for rulemaking. After receipt

Comments on the petition for exemption must be filed, in triplicate, 
within 20 days after the summary is published in the Federal Register 
unless the Administrator, for good cause, finds a different time period 
appropriate. Timely comments received will be considered by the 
Administrator before taking action on the petition.
    (d) Instituting rulemaking procedures based on a petition. If the 
Administrator determines, after consideration of any comments received 
in response to a summary of a petition for rulemaking, that the petition 
discloses adequate reasons, the FAA institutes rulemaking procedures.
    (e) Grant of petition for exemption--summary. If the Administrator 
determines, after consideration of any comments received in response to 
a summary of a petition for exemption, that the petition is in the 
public interest, the Administrator grants the exemption and, except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the FAA publishes a 
summary of the grant of the petition for exemption in the Federal 
Register. A summary of a grant of a petition for exemption includes--

    (4) A brief description of the general nature of the relief granted; 
and

    (f) Denial of petition for rulemaking. If the Administrator 
determines, after consideration of any comments received in response to 
a summary of a petition for rulemaking, that the petition does not 
justify instituting rulemaking procedures, the FAA notifies the 
petitioner to that effect. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i) 
of this section, the FAA publishes a summary of the denial of the 
petition for rulemaking in the Federal Register in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (g) Denial of petition for exemption. If the Administrator 
determines, after consideration of any comments received in response to 
a summary of a petition for exemption, that the petition does not 
justify granting the requested exemption, the FAA notifies the 
petitioner to that effect. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i) 
of this section, the FAA publishes a summary of the denial of the 
petition for exemption in the Federal Register in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this section.

chapter.
    (3) Whenever the head of the Office or Service concerned, subject to 
the approval of the Chief Counsel with respect to form and legality, 
finds for good cause shown in a petition for exemption that action on 
the petition should not be delayed by the publication and comment 
procedures. Factors that may be considered in determining whether good 
cause exists, include--
    (i) Whether a grant of exemption would set a precedent or whether 
the petition for exemption and the reasons presented in it are identical 
to exemptions previously granted;
    (ii) Whether the delay in acting on the petition for exemption that 
would

[[Page 22]]

result from publication would be detrimental to the petitioner; and
    (iii) Whether petitioner acted in a timely manner in filing the 
petition for exemption.
    (k) Status of petition for rulemaking. Within 120 days after 
publication in the Federal Register of a summary of petition for 
rulemaking and every 120 days thereafter, unless sooner denied under 
Sec. 11.51 or issued as a notice of proposed rulemaking under 
Sec. 11.65, the Office or Service concerned shall advise petitioner in 
writing of the status of the petition.
    (l) Additional specific provisions. Specific provisions covering 
actions on petitions are set forth in Subpart C of this part.

Sec. 11.85  Issue of notice of proposed rulemaking.

    Whenever he determines that a notice of proposed rulemaking is 
necessary or desirable, the Director may, subject to the approval of the 
Chief Counsel with respect to form and legality issue the notice 
provided for in Sec. 11.29. In addition, he may grant or deny petitions 
for extension of the time for comments on the notice, filed under 
Sec. 11.29(c).


<R05>
Sec. 11.87  Proceedings after notice of proposed rulemaking.

    (a) Each person who submits written information, views, or arguments 
in response to a notice of proposed rulemaking, or during additional 
rulemaking proceedings in connection with such a notice, must file the

proceedings of the kind described in Sec. 11.33 are necessary or 
desirable, he may designate representatives to conduct those

Sec. 11.89  Adoption of final rules.

    In any case in which a notice of proposed rulemaking was issued, the 
Director completes his analysis and evaluation of the information, 
views, and arguments submitted with respect to the proposed rule and 
studies the entire matter. In any case in which the subject matter is, 
for good cause, submitted to the rulemaking process without notice, the 
Director initiates the procedure. The Chief Counsel determines whether 
legal justification exists for the action proposed, and thereafter 
prepares an appropriate rule or notice of denial. The rule or notice of 
denial is then submitted to the Director for his action.


<R05>
Sec. 11.91  Grant or denial of exemption.

    (a) The Director may, subject to the approval of the Chief Counsel 
with respect to form and legality, grant or deny any petition for an

Director prepares, subject to the approval of the Chief Counsel with 
respect to form and legality, a notice to the petitioner informing him 
of the action taken.


<R05>
Sec. 11.93  Petitions for reconsideration of rules.

    (a) Any interested person may petition the Administrator for a 
rehearing on, or for reconsideration of, any Airworthiness Directive. 
Such a petition must be filed, in duplicate, within 30 days after the 
rule is published in the Federal Register. It must contain a brief 
statement of the complaint and an explanation as to how the rule is 
contrary to the public interest.
    (b) If the petitioner requests the consideration of additional 
facts, he must state their nature and purpose and the reason they were 
not presented at the hearing or in writing within the allotted time.
    (c) The Administrator does not consider repetitious petitions.
    (d) Unless the Administrator orders otherwise, the filing of a 
petition under this section does not stay the effect of a rule or order.

notice of proposed civil penalty.
    (3) Unless an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker in a timely 
manner, an initial decision or order of an administrative law judge 
shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if an 
administrative law judge finds that an alleged violation occurred and 
determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found appropriate by the 
administrative law judge, is warranted.
    (4) Unless a petition for review is filed with a U.S. Court of

civil penalty is warranted.
    (c) Delegation of authority. The authority of the Administrator, 
under section 901 and section 905 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 
as amended, and section 110 of the Hazardous Materials Transportation

Counsel, the Deputy Chief Counsel, the Assistant Chief Counsel for 
Regulations and Enforcement, and the Assistant Chief Counsel for a 
region or center.
    (d) Notice of proposed civil penalty. A civil penalty action is 
initiated by sending a notice of proposed civil penalty to the person 
charged with a violation of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as 
amended, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, or a rule, 
regulation, or order issued thereunder. A notice of proposed civil 
penalty will be sent to the individual charged with a violation or to 
the president of the corporation or company charged with a violation. In 
response to a notice of proposed civil penalty, a corporation or company 
may designate in writing another person to receive documents in that 
civil penalty action. The notice of proposed civil penalty contains a 
statement of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty. 
Not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice of proposed civil 
penalty, the person charged with a violation shall--
    (1) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-
upon amount, in which case either an order assessing civil penalty or 
compromise order shall be issued in that amount;
    (2) Submit to the agency attorney one of the following:

    (ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the 
amount of reduction, and the reasons and any documents supporting a 
reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including records indicating a 
financial inability to pay or records showing that payment of the 
proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in 
business.
    (iii) A written request for an informal conference to discuss the 
matter with the agency attorney and to submit relevant information or 
documents; or

[[Page 37]]

    (3) Request a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed with 
the hearing docket clerk.
    (e) Final notice of proposed civil penalty. A final notice of 
proposed civil penalty may be issued after participation in informal 
procedures provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or failure to 
respond in a time1y manner to a notice of proposed civil penalty. A 
final notice of proposed civil penalty will be sent to the individual 
charged with a violation, to the president of the corporation or company 
charged with a violation, or a person previously designated in writing 
by the individual, corporation, or company to receive documents in that 
civil penalty action. If not previously done in response to a notice of 
proposed civil penalty, a corporation or company may designate in 
writing another person to receive documents in that civil penalty 
action. The final notice of proposed civil penalty contains a statement 
of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty and, as a 
result of information submitted to the agency attorney during informal 
procedures, may modify an allegation or a proposed civil penalty 
contained in a notice of proposed civil penalty.
    (1) A final notice of proposed civil penalty may be issued--
    (i) If the person charged with a violation fails to respond to the 
notice of proposed civil penalty within 30 days after receipt of that 
notice; or
    (ii) If the parties participated in any informal procedures under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section and the parties have not agreed to 
compromise the action or the agency attorney has not agreed to withdraw 
the notice of proposed civil penalty.
    (2) Not later than 15 days after receipt of the final notice of 
proposed civil penalty, the person charged with a violation shall do one 
of the following--
    (i) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-
upon amount, in which case either an order assessing civil penalty or a 
compromise order shall be issued in that amount; or
    (ii) Request a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed with 
the hearing docket clerk.
    (f) Request for a hearing. Any person charged with a violation may 
request a hearing, pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) or paragraph (e)(2)(ii) 
of this section, to be conducted in accordance with the procedures in 
subpart G of this part. A person requesting a hearing shall file a 
written request for a hearing with the hearing docket clerk (Hearing 
Docket, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., 
Room 924A, Washington, DC 20591, Attention: Hearing Docket Clerk) and 
shall mail a copy of the request to the agency attorney. The request for 
a hearing may be in the form of a letter but must be dated and signed by 
the person requesting a hearing. The request for a hearing may be 
typewritten or may be legibly handwritten.
    (g) Hearing. If the person charged with a violation requests a 
hearing pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) or paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this 
section, the original complaint shall be filed with the hearing docket 
clerk and a copy shall be sent to the person requesting the hearing. The 
procedural rules in subpart G of this part apply to the hearing and any 
appeal. At the close of the hearing, the administrative law judge shall 
issue, either orally on the record or in writing, an initial decision, 
including the reasons for the decision, that contains findings or 
conclusions on the allegations contained, and the civil penalty sought, 
in the complaint.
    (h) Appeal. Either party may appeal the administrative law judge's 
initial decision to the FAA decisionmaker pursuant to the procedures in 
subpart G of this part. If a party files a notice of appeal pursuant to 
Sec. 13.233 of subpart G, the effectiveness of the initial decision is 
stayed until a final decision and order of the Administrator have been 
entered on the record. The FAA decisionmaker shall review the record and 
issue a final decision and order of the Administrator that affirm, 
modify, or reverse the initial decision. The FAA decisionmaker may 
assess a civil penalty but shall not assess a civil penalty in an amount 
greater than that sought in the complaint.
    (i) Payment. A person shall pay a civil penalty by sending a 
certified check or money order, payable to the Federal

[[Page 38]]

Aviation Administration, to the agency attorney.
    (j) Collection of civil penalties. If a person does not pay a civil 
penalty imposed by an order assessing civil penalty or a compromise 
order within 60 days after service of the order, the Administrator may 
refer the order to the United States Attorney General, or the delegate 
of the Attorney General, to begin proceedings to collect the civil 
penalty. The action shall be brought in a United States District Court, 
pursuant to the authority in section 903 of the Federal Aviation Act of 
1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1473), or section 110 of the Hazardous 
Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1809).
    (k) Exhaustion of administrative remedies. A party may only petition 
for review of a final decision and order of the Administrator to the 
courts of appeals of the United States or the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia pursuant to section 1006 of the 
Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. Neither an initial decision or 
order issued by an administrative law judge, that has not been appealed 
to the FAA decisionmaker, nor an order compromising a civil penalty 
action constitutes a final order of the Administrator for the purposes 
of judicial appellate review under section 1006 of the Federal Aviation 
Act of 1958, as amended.
    (l) Compromise. The FAA may compromise any civil penalty action 
initiated in accordance with section 901 and section 905 of the Federal 
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, involving an amount in controversy not 
exceeding $50,000, or any civil penalty action initiated in accordance 
with section 901 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, and 
section 110 of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, at any time 
before referring the action to the United States Attorney for 
collection.
    (1) An agency attorney may compromise any civil penalty action where 
a person charged with a violation agrees to pay a civil penalty and the 
FAA agrees to make no finding of violation. Pursuant to such agreement, 
a compromise order shall be issued, stating:
    (i) The person agrees to pay a civil penalty.
    (ii) The FAA makes no finding of a violation.
    (iii) The compromise order shall not be used as evidence of a prior 
violation in any subsequent civil penalty proceeding or certificate 
action proceeding.
    (2) An agency attorney may compromise the amount of any civil 
penalty proposed in a notice, assessed in an order, or imposed in a 
compromise order.

United States District Attorney for the judicial district in which it 
was seized, requesting the District Attorney to institute proceedings to 
enforce a lien against the aircraft.
    (e) The Regional Administrator or Chief Counsel directs the release 
of a seized aircraft whenever--
    (1) The alleged violator pays a civil penalty or an amount agreed 
upon in compromise, and the costs of seizing, storing, and maintaining 
the aircraft;
    (2) The aircraft is seized under an order of a Federal Court in 
proceedings in rem to enforce a lien against the aircraft, or the United 
States District Attorney for the judicial district concerned notifies 
the FAA that the District Attorney refuses to institute those 
proceedings; or

and may re-examine any civil airman. Under section 501(e) of the FA Act, 
any Certificate of Aircraft Registration may be suspended or revoked by 
the Administrator for any cause that renders the aircraft ineligible for 
registration.
    (b) If, as a result of such a reinspection re-examination, or other 
investigation made by the Administrator under section 609 of the FA Act, 
the Administrator determines that the public interest and safety in air 
commerce requires it, the Administrator may issue an order amending, 
suspending, or revoking, all or part of any type certificate, production 
certificate, airworthiness certificate, airman certificate, air carrier 
operating certificate, air navigation facility certificate, or air 
agency certificate. This authority may be exercised for remedial 
purposes in cases involving the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act 
(49 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) or regulations issued under that Act. This 
authority is also exercised by the Chief Counsel, the Assistant Chief 
Counsel for Regulations and Enforcement, and the Assistant Chief Counsel 
for the region or the Aeronautical Center. If the Administrator finds 
that any aircraft registered under Part 47 of this chapter is ineligible 
for registration or if the holder of a Certificate of Aircraft 
Registration has refused or failed to submit AC Form 8050-73, as 
required by Sec. 47.51 of this chapter, the Administrator issues an 
order suspending or revoking that certificate. This authority as to 
aircraft found ineligible for registration is also exercised by the 
Assistant Chief Counsel for the Aeronautical Center or for the region.
    (c) Before issuing an order under paragraph (b) of this section, the 
Chief Counsel, the Assistant Chief Counsel for Regulations and 
Enforcement, the Assistant Chief Counsel for the region or the Assistant 
Chief Counsel for the Aeronautical Center advises the certificate holder 
of the charges or other reasons upon which the Administrator bases the 
proposed action and, except in an emergency, allows the holder to answer 
any charges and to be heard as to why the certificate should not be 
amended, suspended, or revoked. The holder may, by checking the 
appropriate box on the form that is sent to the holder with the notice 
of proposed certificate action, elect to--
    (1) Admit the charges and surrender his or her certificate;
    (2) Answer the charges in writing;
    (3) Request that an order be issued in accordance with the notice of 
proposed certificate action so that the certificate holder may appeal to 
the National Transportation Safety Board, if the charges concerning a 
matter under Title VI of the FA Act;
    (4) Request an opportunity to be heard in an informal conference 
with the FAA counsel; or
    (5) Request a hearing in accordance with Subpart D of this part if 
the charges concern a matter under Title V of the FA Act.

Except as provided in Sec. 13.35(b), unless the certificate holder 
returns the form

[[Page 40]]

and, where required, an answer or motion, with a postmark of not later 
than 15 days after the date of receipt of the notice, the order of the 
Administrator is issued as proposed. If the certificate holder has 
requested an informal conference with the FAA counsel and the charges 
concern a matter under Title V of the FA Act, the holder may after that 
conference also request a formal hearing in writing with a postmark of 
not later than 10 days after the close of the conference. After 
considering any information submitted by the certificate holder, the 
Chief Counsel, the Assistant Chief Counsel for Regulations and 
Enforcement, the Regional Counsel concerned, or the Aeronautical Center 
Counsel (as to matters under Title V of the FA Act) issues the order of 
the Administrator, except that if the holder has made a valid request 
for a formal hearing on a matter under Title V of the FA Act initially 
or after an informal conference, Subpart D of this part governs further 
proceedings.
    (d) Any person whose certificate is affected by an order issued 
under this section may appeal to the National Transportation Safety 
Board. If the certificate holder files an appeal with the Board, the 
Administrator's order is stayed unless the Administrator advises the 
Board that an emergency exists and safety in air commerce requires that 
the order become effective immediately. If the Board is so advised, the 
order remains effective and the Board shall finally dispose of the 
appeal within 60 days after the date of the advice. This paragraph does 
not apply to any person whose Certificate of Aircraft Registration is 
affected by an order issued under this section.

dismissed, request a hearing in accordance with Subpart D of this part.
    (e) Failure to request a hearing within the period provided in 
paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section--
    (1) Constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal and the right to a 
hearing, and
    (2) Authorizes the official who issued the notice to find the facts 
to be as alleged in the notice, or as modified as the official may 
determine necessary based on any written response, and to issue an 
appropriate order, without further notice or proceedings.
    (f) If a hearing is requested in accordance with paragraph (c) or

affirming the order. The Administrator's order includes the reasons for 
the Administrator's action.
    (k) For good cause shown, requests for extensions of time to file 
any document under this section may be granted by--
    (1) The official who issued the order, if the request is filed prior 
to the designation of a Hearing Officer; or
    (2) The Hearing Officer, if the request is filed prior to the filing 
of a notice of appeal; or
    (3) The Administrator, if the request is filed after the filing of a 
notice of appeal.
    (l) Except in the case of an appeal from the decision of a Hearing 
Officer, the authority of the Administrator under this section is also 
exercised by the Chief Counsel, Deputy Chief Counsel, each Assistant 
Chief Counsel and the Assistant Chief Counsel for the region or the 
Aeronautical Center (as to matters under Title V of the Federal Aviation 
Act of 1958).

findings and issue an order terminating the notice. If the Hearing 
Officer finds that the allegations of the notice have not been proven,

Sec. 13.29  Civil penalties: Streamlined enforcement procedures for certain security violations.

    This section may be used, at the agency's discretion, in enforcement 
actions involving individuals presenting dangerous or deadly weapons for 
screening at airports or in checked baggage where the amount of the 
proposed civil penalty is less than $5,000. In these cases, sections 
13.16(a), 13.16(c), and 13.16 (f) through (l) of this chapter are used, 
as well as paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section:
    (a) Delegation of authority. The authority of the Administrator, 
under 49 U.S.C. 46301, to initiate the assessment of civil penalties for 
a violation of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, or a rule, regulation, or order 
issued thereunder, is delegated to the regional Civil Aviation Security 
Division Manager and the regional Civil Aviation Security Deputy 
Division Manager for the purpose of issuing notices of violation in 
cases involving violations of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII and the FAA's 
regulations by individuals presenting dangerous or deadly weapons for 
screening at airport checkpoints or in checked baggage. This authority 
may not be delegated below the level of the regional Civil Aviation 
Security Deputy Division Manager.
    (b) Notice of violation. A civil penalty action is initiated by 
sending a notice of violation to the person charged with the violation. 
The notice of violation contains a statement of the charges and the 
amount of the proposed civil penalty. Not later than 30 days after 
receipt of the notice of violation, the person charged with a violation 
shall:
    (1) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-
upon amount, in which case either an order assessing a civil penalty or 
a compromise order shall be issued in that amount; or
    (2) Submit to the agency attorney identified in the material 
accompanying the notice any of the following:
    (i) Written information, including documents and witness statements, 
demonstrating that a violation of the regulations did not occur or that 
a penalty or the penalty amount is not warranted by the circumstances; 
or
    (ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the 
amount of reduction, and the reasons and any documents supporting a 
reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including records indicating a 
financial inability to pay or records showing that payment of the 
proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in 
business; or
    (iii) A written request for an informal conference to discuss the 
matter with an agency attorney and submit relevant information or 
documents; or
    (3) Request a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed with 
the hearing docket clerk.
    (c) Final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order. A 
final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order (``final 
notice and order'') may be issued after participation in any informal 
proceedings as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or after 
failure of the respondent to respond in a timely manner to a notice of 
violation. A final notice and order will be sent to the individual 
charged with a violation. The final notice and order will contain a 
statement of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty 
and, as a result of information submitted to the agency attorney during 
any informal procedures, may reflect a modified allegation or proposed 
civil penalty.
    A final notice and order may be issued--
    (1) If the person charged with a violation fails to respond to the 
notice of violation within 30 days after receipt of that notice; or
    (2) If the parties participated in any informal procedures under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the parties have not agreed to 
compromise the action or the agency attorney has not agreed to withdraw 
the notice of violation.
    (d) Order assessing civil penalty. An order assessing civil penalty 
may be issued after notice and opportunity for a hearing. A person 
charged with a violation may be subject to an order assessing civil 
penalty in the following circumstances:
    (1) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person 
charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit, the amount of 
civil penalty proposed in the notice of violation.

[[Page 44]]

    (2) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person 
charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit, an agreed-upon 
amount of civil penalty that is not reflected in either the notice of 
violation or the final notice and order.
    (3) The final notice and order becomes (and contains a statement so 
indicating) an order assessing a civil penalty when the person charged 
with a violation submits the amount of the proposed civil penalty that 
is reflected in the final notice and order.
    (4) The final notice and order becomes (and contains a statement so 
indicating) an order assessing a civil penalty 16 days after receipt of 
the final notice and order, unless not later than 15 days after receipt 
of the final notice and order, the person charged with a violation does 
one of the following--
    (i) Submits an agreed-upon amount of civil penalty that is not 
reflected in the final notice and order, in which case an order 
assessing civil penalty or a compromise order shall be issued in that 
amount; or
    (ii) Requests a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed 
with the hearing docket clerk.
    (5) Unless an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker in a timely 
manner, an initial decision or order of an administrative law judge 
shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if an 
administrative law judge finds that an alleged violation occurred and 
determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found to be appropriate by 
the administrative law judge, is warranted.
    (6) Unless a petition for review is filed with a U.S. Court of 
Appeals in a timely manner, a final decision and order of the 
Administrator shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if 
the FAA decisionmaker finds that an alleged violation occurred and a 
civil penalty is warranted.

    (a) The Hearing Officer to whom a case is assigned may, upon 
application by any party to the proceeding, issue subpoenas requiring 
the attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary or tangible 
evidence at a hearing or for the purpose of taking depositions. However, 
the application for producing evidence must show its general relevance 
and reasonable scope. This paragraph does not apply to the attendance of 
FAA employees or to the production of documentary evidence in the 
custody of such an employee at a hearing.
    (b) A person who applies for the production of a document in the 
custody of an FAA employee must follow the procedure in Sec. 13.49(f). A

application, in writing, to the Hearing Officer setting forth the need 
for that employee's attendance.
    (c) A witness in a proceeding under this subpart is entitled to the 
same fees and mileage as is paid to a witness in a court of the United 
States under comparable circumstances. The party at whose instance the 
witness is subpoenaed or appears shall pay the witness fees.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
the FAA pays the witness fees and mileage if the Hearing Officer who 
issued the subpoena determines, on the basis of a written request and 
good cause shown, that--
    (1) The presence of the witness will materially advance the 
proceeding; and
    (2) The party at whose instance the witness is subpoenaed would 
suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and 
mileage.


<R05>
Sec. 13.59  Evidence.

    (a) Each party to a hearing may present the party's case or defense 
by oral or documentary evidence, submit evidence in rebuttal, and

the facts.
    (b) Except with respect to affirmative defenses and orders of 
denial, the

[[Page 47]]

burden of proof is upon the FAA counsel.
    (c) The Hearing Officer may order information contained in any 
report or document filed or in any testimony given pursuant to this 
subpart withheld from public disclosure when, in the judgment of the 
Hearing Officer, disclosure would adversely affect the interests of any 
person and is not required in the public interest or is not otherwise 
required by statute to be made available to the public. Any person may 
make written objection to the public disclosure of such information, 
stating the ground for such objection.


<R05>
Sec. 13.61  Argument and submittals.

    The Hearing Officer shall give the parties adequate opportunity to

part.
    (c) Failure of the alleged violator to file a reply or request a 
hearing within the period provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this

Assistant Chief Counsel for the region concerned may issue an order of 
immediate compliance, which is effective upon issuance, if the person 
who issues the order finds that--
    (1) There is strong probability that a violation is occurring or is 
about to occur;
    (2) The violation poses a substantial risk to health or to safety of

appropriate, may issue a notice of proposed order of compliance under 
Sec. 13.73 in lieu thereof.
    (d) If at any time in the course of a proceeding commenced in

    (e) Within three days after receipt of service of an order of 
immediate compliance, the alleged violator may request a hearing in

Sec. 13.219(b) of this subpart.
    (i) Motion to dismiss a request for a hearing. An agency attorney

complaint. If the motion to dismiss is not granted, the agency attorney 
shall file the complaint and shall serve a copy of the complaint on each 
party not later than 10 days after service of the administrative law 
judge's ruling or order on the motion to dismiss. If the motion to 
dismiss is granted and the proceedings are terminated without a hearing,

subpart. If required by the decision on appeal, the agency attorney 
shall file a complaint and shall serve a copy of the complaint on each 
party not later than 10 days after service of the decision on appeal.

to dismiss a complaint instead of filing an answer. If the motion to

pleading and shall submit the details that the party believes would make 
the allegation or response definite and certain.

definite statement of the allegations contained in the complaint instead 
of filing an answer. If the administrative law judge grants the motion, 
the agency attorney shall supply a more definite statement not later

agency attorney fails to supply a more definite statement, the 
administrative law judge shall strike the allegations in the complaint 
to which the motion is directed. If the administrative law judge denies 
the motion, the respondent shall file an answer and shall serve a copy 
of the answer on each party not later than 10 days after service of the

[[Page 60]]

definite statement if an answer fails to respond clearly to the 
allegations in the complaint. If the administrative law judge grants the 
motion, the respondent shall supply a more definite statement not later 
than 15 days after service of the ruling on the motion. If the 
respondent fails to supply a more definite statement, the administrative 
law judge shall strike those statements in the answer to which the 
motion is directed. The respondent's failure to supply a more definite 
statement may be deemed an admission of unanswered allegations in the 
complaint.
    (4) Motion to strike. Any party may make a motion to strike any 
insufficient allegation or defense, or any redundant, immaterial, or 
irrelevant matter in a pleading. A party shall file a motion to strike 
with the administrative law judge and shall serve a copy on each party 
before a response is required under this subpart or, if a response is 
not required, not later than 10 days after service of the pleading.

regarding all or any part of the proceedings, at any time before the 
administrative law judge has issued an initial decision in the 
proceedings. The administrative law judge shall grant a party's motion 
for decision if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, 
admissions, matters that the administrative law judge has officially 
noticed, or evidence introduced during the hearing show that there is no 
genuine issue of material fact and that the party making the motion is 
entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party making the motion 
for decision has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of 
material fact disputed by the parties.
    (6) Motion for disqualification. A party may file a motion for 
disqualification with the administrative law judge and shall serve a 
copy on each party. A party may file the motion at any time after the 
administrative law judge has been assigned to the proceedings but shall 
make the motion before the administrative law judge files an initial 
decision in the proceedings.
    (i) Motion and supporting affidavit. A party shall state the grounds 
for disqualification, including, but not limited to, personal bias, 
pecuniary interest, or other factors showing disqualification, in the 
motion for disqualification. A party shall submit an affidavit with the 
motion for disqualification that sets forth, in detail, the matters 
alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification.
    (ii) Answer. A party shall respond to the motion for 
disqualification not later than 5 days after service of the motion for 
disqualification.
    (iii) Decision on motion for disqualification. The administrative 
law judge shall render a decision on the motion for disqualification not 
later than 15 days after the motion has been filed. If the 
administrative law judge finds that the motion for disqualification and 
supporting affidavit show a basis for disqualification, the 
administrative law judge shall withdraw from the proceedings 
immediately. If the administrative law judge finds that disqualification 
is not warranted, the administrative law judge shall deny the motion and 
state the grounds for the denial on the record. If the administrative 
law judge fails to rule on a party's motion for disqualification within 
15 days after the motion has been filed, the motion is deemed granted.
    (iv) Appeal. A party may appeal the administrative law judge's 
denial of the motion for disqualification in accordance with 
Sec. 13.219(b) of this subpart.

issues a decision on the request. If the administrative law judge grants 
the request, the proceedings are stayed until the FAA decisionmaker 
issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. The administrative law 
judge shall grant an interlocutory appeal for cause if a party shows 
that delay of the appeal would be detrimental to the public interest or 
would result in undue prejudice to any party.
    (c) Interlocutory appeals of right. If a party notifies the 
administrative law judge of an interlocutory appeal of right, the 
proceedings are stayed until the FAA decisionmaker issues a decision on

Sec. 13.220  Discovery.

    (a) Initiation of discovery. Any party may initiate discovery 
described in this section, without the consent or approval of the 
administrative law judge, at any time after a complaint has been filed 
in the proceedings.
    (b) Methods of discovery. The following methods of discovery are 
permitted under this section: depositions on oral examination or written 
questions of any person; written interrogatories directed to a party; 
requests for production of documents or tangible items to any person; 
and requests for admission by a party. A party is not required to file 
written interrogatories and responses, requests for production of 
documents or tangible items and responses, and requests for admission 
and response with the administrative law judge or the hearing docket 
clerk. In the event of a discovery dispute, a party shall attach a copy 
of these documents in support of a motion made under this section.
    (c) Service on the agency. A party shall serve each discovery 
request directed to the agency or any agency employee on the agency 
attorney of record.
    (d) Time for response to discovery requests. Unless otherwise 
directed by this subpart or agreed by the parties, a party shall respond 
to a request for discovery, including filing objections to a request for 
discovery, not later than 30 days of service of the request.
    (e) Scope of discovery. Subject to the limits on discovery set forth 
in paragraph (f) of this section, a party may discover any matter that 
is not privileged and that is relevant to the subject matter of the 
proceeding. A party may discover information that relates

[[Page 62]]

to the claim or defense of any party including the existence, 
description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any document or 
other tangible item and the identity and location of any person having 
knowledge of discoverable matter. A party may discover facts known, or 
opinions held, by an expert who any other party expects to call to 
testify at the hearing. A party has no ground to object to a discovery 
request on the basis that the information sought would not be admissible 
at the hearing if the information sought during discovery is reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (f) Limiting discovery. The administrative law judge shall limit the 
frequency and extent of discovery permitted by this section if a party 
shows that--
    (1) The information requested is cumulative or repetitious;
    (2) The information requested can be obtained from another less 
burdensome and more convenient source;
    (3) The party requesting the information has had ample opportunity 
to obtain the information through other discovery methods permitted 
under this section; or
    (4) The method or scope of discovery requested by the party is 
unduly burdensome or expensive.
    (g) Confidential orders. A party or person who has received a 
discovery request for information that is related to a trade secret, 
confidential or sensitive material, competitive or commercial 
information, proprietary data, or information on research and 
development, may file a motion for a confidential order with the 
administrative law judge and shall serve a copy of the motion for a 
confidential order on each party.
    (1) The party or person making the motion must show that the 
confidential order is necessary to protect the information from 
disclosure to the public.
    (2) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested 
material is not necessary to decide the case, the administrative law 
judge shall preclude any inquiry into the matter by any party.
    (3) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested 
material may be disclosed during discovery, the administrative law judge 
may order that the material may be discovered and disclosed under 
limited conditions or may be used only under certain terms and 
conditions.
    (4) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested 
material is necessary to decide the case and that a confidential order 
is warranted, the administrative law judge shall provide:
    (i) An opportunity for review of the document by the parties off the 
record;
    (ii) Procedures for excluding the information from the record; and
    (iii) Order that the parties shall not disclose the information in 
any manner and the parties shall not use the information in any other 
proceeding.
    (h) Protective orders. A party or a person who has received a 
request for discovery may file a motion for protective order with the 
administrative law judge and shall serve a copy of the motion for 
protective order on each party. The party or person making the motion 
must show that the protective order is necessary to protect the party or 
the person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or 
expense. As part of the protective order, the administrative law judge 
may:
    (1) Deny the discovery request;
    (2) Order that discovery be conducted only on specified terms and 
conditions, including a designation of the time or place for discovery 
or a determination of the method of discovery; or
    (3) Limit the scope of discovery or preclude any inquiry into 
certain matters during discovery.
    (i) Duty to supplement or amend responses. A party who has responded 
to a discovery request has a duty to supplement or amend the response, 
as soon as the information is known, as follows:
    (1) A party shall supplement or amend any response to a question 
requesting the identity and location of any person having knowledge of 
discoverable matters.
    (2) A party shall supplement or amend any response to a question 
requesting the identity of each person who will be called to testify at 
the hearing as an expert witness and the subject matter and substance of 
that witness' testimony.

[[Page 63]]

    (3) A party shall supplement or amend any response that was 
incorrect when made or any response that was correct when made but is no 
longer correct, accurate, or complete.
    (j) Depositions. The following rules apply to depositions taken 
pursuant to this section:
    (1) Form. A deposition shall be taken on the record and reduced to 
writing. The person being deposed shall sign the deposition unless the 
parties agree to waive the requirement of a signature.
    (2) Administration of oaths. Within the United States, or a 
territory or possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, a party shall take a deposition before a person authorized to 
administer oaths by the laws of the United States or authorized by the 
law of the place where the examination is held. In foreign countries, a 
party shall take a deposition in any manner allowed by the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure.
    (3) Notice of deposition. A party shall serve a notice of 
deposition, stating the time and place of the deposition and the name 
and address of each person to be examined, on the person to be deposed, 
on the administrative law judge, on the hearing docket clerk, and on 
each party not later than 7 days before the deposition. A party may 
serve a notice of deposition less than 7 days before the deposition only 
with consent of the administrative law judge. If a subpoena duces tecum 
is to be served on the person to be examined, the party shall attach a 
copy of the subpoena duces tecum that describes the materials to be 
produced at the deposition to the notice of deposition.
    (4) Use of depositions. A party may use any part or all of a 
deposition at a hearing authorized under this subpart only upon a 
showing of good cause. The deposition may be used against any party who 
was present or represented at the deposition or who had reasonable 
notice of the deposition.
    (k) Interrogatories. A party, the party's attorney, or the party's 
representative may sign the party's responses to interrogatories. A 
party shall answer each interrogatory separately and completely in 
writing.If a party objects to an interrogatory, the party shall state 
the objection and the reasons for the objection. An opposing party may 
use any part or all of a party's responses to interrogatories at a 
hearing authorized under this subpart to the extent that the response is 
relevant, material, and not repetitious.
    (1) A party shall not serve more than 30 interrogatories to each 
other party. Each subpart of an interrogatory shall be counted as a 
separate interrogatory.
    (2) A party shall file a motion for leave to serve additional 
interrogatories on a party with the administrative law judge before 
serving additional interrogatories on a party. The administrative law 
judge shall grant the motion only if the party shows good cause for the 
party's failure to inquire about the information previously and that the 
information cannot reasonably be obtained using less burdensome 
discovery methods or be obtained from other sources.
    (l) Requests for admission. A party may serve a written request for 
admission of the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery under 
this section or the authenticity of any document described in the 
request. A party shall set forth each request for admission separately. 
A party shall serve copies of documents referenced in the request for 
admission unless the documents have been provided or are reasonably 
available for inspection and copying.
    (1) Time. A party's failure to respond to a request for admission, 
in writing and signed by the attorney or the party, not later than 30 
days after service of the request, is deemed an admission of the truth 
of the statement or statements contained in the request for admission. 
The administrative law judge may determine that a failure to respond to 
a request for admission is not deemed an admission of the truth if a 
party shows that the failure was due to circumstances beyond the control 
of the party or the party's attorney.
    (2) Response. A party may object to a request for admission and 
shall state the reasons for objection. A party may specifically deny the 
truth of the matter or describe the reasons why the party is unable to 
truthfully deny or admit the matter. If a party is unable to deny or 
admit the truth of the matter, the party shall show that the party

[[Page 64]]

has made reasonable inquiry into the matter or that the information 
known to, or readily obtainable by, the party is insufficient to enable 
the party to admit or deny the matter. A party may admit or deny any 
part of the request for admission. If the administrative law judge 
determines that a response does not comply with the requirements of this 
rule or that the response is insufficient, the matter is deemed 
admitted.
    (3) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted or deemed admitted 
under this section is conclusively established for the purpose of the 
hearing and appeal.
    (m) Motion to compel discovery. A party may make a motion to compel 
discovery if a person refuses to answer a question during a deposition, 
a party fails or refuses to answer an interrogatory, if a person gives 
an evasive or incomplete answer during a deposition or when responding 
to an interrogatory, or a party fails or refuses to produce documents or 
tangible items. During a deposition, the proponent of a question may 
complete the deposition or may adjourn the examination before making a 
motion to compel if a person refuses to answer.
    (n) Failure to comply with a discovery order or order to compel. If 
a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to compel, 
the administrative law judge, limited to the extent of the party's 
failure to comply with the discovery order or motion to compel, may:
    (1) Strike that portion of a party's pleadings;
    (2) Preclude prehearing or discovery motions by that party;
    (3) Preclude admission of that portion of a party's evidence at the 
hearing; or
    (4) Preclude that portion of the testimony of that party's witnesses 
at the hearing.

convenience of the parties, the location where the majority of the 
witnesses reside or work, and whether the location is served by a

demonstrative evidence introduced by a party but shall exclude 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
    (c) Hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings 
governed by this subpart. The fact that evidence submitted by a party is 
hearsay goes only to the weight of the evidence and does not affect its 
admissibility.


<R05>
Sec. 13.223  Standard of proof.

    The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision or 
shall rule in a party's favor only if the decision or ruling is

    (a) The administrative law judge may order that any information 
contained in the record be withheld from public disclosure. Any person 
may object to disclosure of information in the record by filing a 
written motion to withhold specific information with the administrative 
law judge and serving a copy of the motion on each party. The party 
shall state the specific grounds for nondisclosure in the motion.
    (b) The administrative law judge shall grant the motion to withhold 
information in the record if, based on the motion and any response to 
the motion, the administrative law judge determines that disclosure 
would be detrimental to aviation safety, disclosure would not be in the 
public interest, or that the information is not otherwise required to be 
made available to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 13.227  Expert or opinion witnesses.

    An employee of the agency may not be called as an expert or opinion 
witness, for any party other than the FAA, in any proceeding governed by

upon whom a subpoena has been served, may file a motion to quash or 
modify the subpoena with the administrative law judge at or before the 
time specified in the subpoena for compliance. The applicant shall 
describe, in detail, the basis for the application to quash or modify 
the supoena including, but not limited to, a statement that the 
testimony, document, or tangible evidence is not relevant to the 
proceeding, that the subpoena is not reasonably tailored to the scope of 
the proceeding, or that the subpoena is unreasonable and oppressive. A 
motion to quash or modify the subpoena will stay the effect of the 
subpoena pending a decision by the administrative law judge on the 
motion.
    (c) Enforcement of subpoena. Upon a showing that a person has failed 
or refused to comply with a subpoena, a party may apply to the local 
Federal district court to seek judicial enforcement of the subpoena in 
accordance with section 1004 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as 
amended.

any orders in the proceeding. Any proceedings regarding the 
disqualification of an administrative law judge shall be included in the 
record.
    (b) Examination and copying of record. Any person may examine the 
record at the Hearing Docket, Federal Aviation Administration, 800

decision, the administrative law judge shall include findings of fact 
and conclusions of law, and the grounds supporting those findings and 
conclusions, upon all material issues of fact, the credibility of 
witnesses, the applicable law, any exercise of the administrative law 
judge's discretion, the amount of any civil penalty found appropriate by 
the administrative law judge, and a discussion of the basis for any 
order issued in the proceedings. The administrative law judge is not 
required to provide a written explanation for rulings on objections, 
procedural motions, and other matters not directly relevant to the 
substance of the initial decision. If the administrative law judge 
refers to any previous unreported or unpublished initial decision, the 
administrative law judge shall make copies of that initial decision

    (b) Issues on appeal. A party may appeal only the following issues:
    (1) Whether each filing of fact is supported by a preponderance of 
reliable, probative, and substantial evidence;

applicable law, precedent, and public policy; and
    (3) Whether the administrative law judge committed any prejudicial 
errors during the hearing that support the appeal.
    (c) Perfecting an appeal. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a 
party shall perfect an appeal, not later than 50 days after entry of the 
oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial 
decision on the party, by filing an appeal brief with the FAA 
decisionmaker.
    (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may 
agree to extend the time for perfecting the appeal with the consent of 
the FAA decisionmaker. If the FAA decisionmaker grants an extension of 
time to perfect the appeal, the appellate docket clerk shall serve a 
letter confirming the extension of time on each party.
    (2) Written motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an 
extension of time for perfecting an appeal, a party desiring an 
extension of time may file a written motion for an extension with the 
FAA decisionmaker and shall serve a copy of the motion on each party. 
The FAA decisionmaker may grant an extension if good cause for the 
extension is shown in the motion.
    (d) Appeal briefs. A party shall file the appeal brief with the FAA 
decisionmaker and shall serve a copy of the appeal brief on each party.
    (1) A party shall set forth, in detail, the party's specific 
objections to the initial decision or rulings in the appeal brief. A 
party also shall set forth, in detail, the basis for the appeal, the 
reasons supporting the appeal, and the relief requested in the appeal. 
If the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the appeal, 
the party shall specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained 
in the transcript in the appeal brief.
    (2) The FAA decisionmaker may dismiss an appeal, on the FAA 
decisionmaker's own initiative or upon motion of any other party, where 
a party has filed a notice of appeal but fails to perfect the appeal by 
timely filing an appeal brief with the FAA decisionmaker.
    (e) Reply brief. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any party 
may file a reply brief with the FAA decisionmaker not later than 35 days 
after the appeal brief has been served on that party. The party filing 
the reply brief shall serve a copy of the reply brief on each party. If 
the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the reply, the 
party shall specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained in 
the transcript in the reply brief.
    (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may 
agree to extend the time for filing a reply brief with the consent of 
the FAA decisionmaker. If the FAA decisionmaker grants an extension of 
time to file the reply brief, the appellate docket clerk shall serve a 
letter confirming the extension of time on each party.
    (2) Written motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an 
extension of time for filing a reply brief, a party desiring an 
extension of time may file a written motion for an extension with the 
FAA decisionmaker and shall serve a copy of the motion on each party.

[[Page 68]]

The FAA decisionmaker may grant an extension if good cause for the 
extension is shown in the motion.
    (f) Other briefs. The FAA decisionmaker may allow any person to 
submit an amicus curiae brief in an appeal of an initial decision. A 
party may not file more than one appeal brief or reply brief. A party 
may petition the FAA decisionmaker, in writing, for leave to file an 
additional brief and shall serve a copy of the petition on each party. 
The party may not file the additional brief with the petition. The FAA 
decisionmaker may grant leave to file an additional brief if the party 
demonstrates good cause for allowing additional argument on the appeal. 
The FAA decisionmaker will allow a reasonable time for the party to file 
the additional brief.
    (g) Number of copies. A party shall file the original appeal brief 
or the original reply brief, and two copies of the brief, with the FAA 
decisionmaker.
    (h) Oral argument. The FAA decisionmaker has sole discretion to 
permit oral argument on the appeal. On the FAA decisionmaker's own 
initiative or upon written motion by any party, the FAA decisionmaker 
may find that oral argument will contribute substantially to the 
development of the issues on appeal and may grant the parties an 
opportunity for oral argument.
    (i) Waiver of objections on appeal. If a party fails to object to 
any alleged error regarding the proceedings in an appeal or a reply 
brief, the party waives any objection to the alleged error. The FAA 
decisionmaker is not required to consider any objection in an appeal 
brief or any argument in the reply brief if a party's objection is based 
on evidence contained on the record and the party does not specifically 
refer to the pertinent evidence from the record in the brief.
    (j) FAA decisionmaker's decision on appeal. The FAA decisionmaker 
will review the briefs on appeal and the oral argument, if any, to 
determine if the administrative law judge committed prejudicial error in 
the proceedings or that the initial decision should be affirmed, 
modified, or reversed. The FAA decisionmaker may affirm, modify, or 
reverse the initial decision, make any necessary findings, or may remand 
the case for any proceedings that the FAA decisionmaker determines may 
be necessary.
    (1) The FAA decisionmaker may raise any issue, on the FAA 
decisionmaker's own initiative, that is required for proper disposition 
of the proceedings. The FAA decisionmaker will give the parties a 
reasonable opportunity to submit arguments on the new issues before 
making a decision on appeal. If an issue raised by the FAA decisionmaker 
requires the consideration of additional testimony or evidence, the FAA 
decisionmaker will remand the case to the administrative law judge for 
further proceedings and an initial decision related to that issue. If an 
issue raised by the FAA decisionmaker is solely an issue of law or the 
issue was addressed at the hearing but was not raised by a party in the 
briefs on appeal, a remand of the case to the administrative law judge 
for further proceedings is not required but may be provided in the 
discretion of the FAA decisionmaker.
    (2) The FAA decisionmaker will issue the final decision and order of 
the Administrator on appeal in writing and will serve a copy of the 
decision and order on each party. Unless a petition for review is filed 
pursuant to Sec. 13.235, a final decision and order of the Administrator 
shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the FAA 
decisionmaker finds that an alleged violation occurred and a civil 
penalty is warranted.
    (3) A final decision and order of the Administrator after appeal is 
precedent in any other civil penalty action. Any issue, finding or 
conclusion, order, ruling, or initial decision of an administrative law 
judge that has not been appealed to the FAA decisionmaker is not 
precedent in any other civil penalty action.

         Subpart H--Civil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment

     Source: Docket No. 28762, 61 FR 67445, Dec. 20, 1996, unless 
otherwise noted.

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 67445, Dec. 20, 1996, Subpart H was 
added, effective Jan. 21, 1997.


<R05>
Sec. 13.301  Scope and purpose.

    (a) This subpart provides a mechanism for the regular adjustment for 
inflation of civil monetary penalties in conformity with the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. 2461 (note), 
as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 
104-134, April 26, 1996, in order to maintain the deterrent effect of 
civil monetary penalties and to promote compliance with the law. This 
subpart also sets out the current adjusted maximum civil monetary 
penalties or range of minimum and maximum civil monetary penalties for 
each

[[Page 70]]

statutory civil penalty subject to the FAA's jurisdiction.
    (b) Each adjustment to the maximum civil monetary penalty or the 
range of minimum and maximum civil monetary penalties, as applicable, 
made in accordance with this subpart applies prospectively from the date 
it becomes effective to actions initiated under this part, 
notwithstanding references to a specific maximum civil monetary penalty 
or range of minimum and maximum civil monetary penalties contained 
elsewhere in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 13.303  Definitions.

    (a) Civil Monetary Penalty means any penalty, fine, or other 
sanction that:
    (1) Is for a specific monetary amount as provided by Federal law or 
has a maximum amount provided by Federal law;
    (2) Is assessed or enforced by the FAA pursuant to Federal law; and
    (3) Is assessed or enforced pursuant to an administrative proceeding 
or a civil action in the Federal courts.
    (b) Consumer Price Index means the Consumer Price Index for all 
urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.


<R05>
Sec. 13.305  Cost of living adjustments of civil monetary penalties.

    (a) Except for the limitation to the initial adjustment to statutory 
maximum civil monetary penalties or range of minimum and maximum civil 
monetary penalties set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
inflation adjustment under this subpart is determined by increasing the 
maximum civil monetary penalty or range of minimum and maximum civil 
monetary penalty for each civil monetary penalty by the cost-of-living 
adjustment. Any increase determined under paragraph (a) of this section 
is rounded to the nearest:
    (1) Multiple of $10 in the case of penalties less than or equal to 
$100;
    (2) Multiple of $100 in the case of penalties greater than $100 but 
less than or equal to $1,000;
    (3) Multiple of $1,000 in the case of penalties greater than $1,000 
but less than or equal to $10,000;
    (4) Multiple of $5,000 in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 
but less than or equal to $100,000;
    (5) Multiple of $10,000 in the case of penalties greater than 
$100,000 but less than or equal to $200,000; and
    (6) Multiple of $25,000 in the case of penalties greater than 
$200,000.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term ``cost-
of-living adjustment'' means the percentage (if any) for each civil 
monetary penalty by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June 
of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price 
Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the amount of 
such civil monetary penalty was last set or adjusted pursuant to law.
    (c) Limitation on initial adjustment. The initial adjustment of 
maximum civil penalty or range of minimum and maximum civil monetary 
penalties made pursuant to this subpart does not exceed 10 percent of 
the statutory maximum civil penalty before an adjustment under this 
subpart is made. This limitation applies only to the initial adjustment, 
effective on January 21, 1997.
    (d) Inflation adjustment. Minimum and maximum civil monetary 
penalties within the jurisdiction of the FAA are adjusted for inflation 
as follows:

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 14.01  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (the Act), provides 
for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible 
individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative 
proceedings (adversary adjudications) before the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). An eligible party may receive an award when it 
prevails over the FAA, unless the agency's position in the proceeding 
was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award 
unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards 
and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for 
awards, and the procedures and standards that the FAA Decisionmaker will 
use to make them. As used hereinafter, the term ``agency'' applies to 
the FAA.


<R05>
Sec. 14.02  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The Act applies to certain adversary adjudications conducted by 
the FAA. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the 
position of the FAA is represented by an attorney or other 
representative who enters an appearance and participates in the 
proceeding. This subpart applies to proceedings under 49 U.S.C. App. 
1475 and 49 U.S.C. App. 1471(a).
    (b) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include 
only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
    (c) Fees and other expenses may not be awarded to a party for any 
portion of the adversary adjudication in which such party has 
unreasonably protracted the proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 14.03  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term ``party'' is defined 
in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions 
or eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B of this part.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million at 
the time the adversary adjudication was initiated;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees at the time the adversary 
adjudication was initiated;
    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication 
was initiated; and
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees at

[[Page 73]]

the time the adversary adjudication was initiated; and
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or 
private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and 
not more than 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was 
initiated.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an 
unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interest.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
part, unless the administrative law judge determines that such treatment 
would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the 
actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
administrative law judge may determine that financial relationships of 
the applicant, other than those described in this paragraph, constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
if not itself eligible for an award.


<R05>
Sec. 14.04  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for attorney fees 
and other expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a 
significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless 
the position of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was 
substantially justified. Whether or not the position of the FAA was 
substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the record 
(including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by 
the agency upon which the civil action is based) which was made in the 
civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought. The burden of 
proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing 
applicant is on the agency counsel, who may avoid an award by showing 
that the agency's position was reasonable in law and fact.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 14.05  Allowance fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
a reduced rate to the applicant.
    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may 
exceed the highest rate at which the agency pays expert witnesses. 
However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the 
attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, 
or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent, or expert witness, the administrative law judge shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his 
or her customary fee for similar services, or if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;

[[Page 74]]

    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
     (e) Fees may be awarded only for work performed after the issuance 
of a complaint.


[Amdt. 13-18, 53 FR 34655, Sept. 7, 1988, as amended by Amdt. 14-1, 55 
FR 15131, Apr. 20, 1990]


<R04>
             Subpart B--Information Required From Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 14.10  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act 
shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is 
sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and 
identify the position of the agency in the proceeding that the applicant 
alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an 
individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of 
the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its 
organization or business.
    (b) The application shall also include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or 
$7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates) at the 
time the adversary adjudication was initiated. However, an applicant may 
omit this statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), or in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under 
such section; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes this agency to consider in determining whether and in 
what amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney for the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.
    (f) If the applicant is a partnership, corporation, association, 
organization, or sole owner of an unincorporated business, the 
application shall state that the applicant did not have more than 500 
employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated, giving 
the number of its employees and describing briefly the type and purpose 
of its organization or business.


<R05>
Sec. 14.11  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates when 
the proceeding was initiated. If any individual, corporation, or other 
entity directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting 
shares or other interest of the applicant, or if the applicant directly 
or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other 
interest of any corporation or other entity, the exhibit must include a 
showing of the net worth of all such affiliates or of the applicant 
including the affiliates. The exhibit may be in any form convenient

[[Page 75]]

to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and 
its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine 
whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The 
administrative law judge may require an applicant to file additional 
information to determine the eligibility for an award.
    (b) The net worth exhibit shall describe any transfers of assets 
from, or obligations incurred by, the applicant or any affiliate, 
occurring in the one-year period prior to the date on which the 
proceeding was initiated, that reduced the net worth of the applicant 
and its affiliates below the applicable net worth ceiling. If there were 
no such transactions, the applicant shall so state.
    (c) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that portion of the exhibit directly to the administrative law judge in 
a sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' 
accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public 
disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be 
withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the 
specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the 
information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is 
not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be 
served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant 
seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the 
proceeding. If the administrative law judge finds that the information 
should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public 
record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the 
exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the FAA's established 
procedures under the Freedom of Information Act as implemented by 49 CFR 
part 7, appendix C of the FAA's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 14.12  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceedings 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The administrative law judge may require the 
applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any 
expenses claimed.


<R04>
           Subpart C--Procedures for Considering Applications


<R05>
Sec. 14.20  When an application may be filed.

     (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has 
prevailed in the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the 
FAA Decisionmaker's final disposition of the proceeding.
     (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision 
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the 
award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the 
underlying controversy.
     (c) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the later 
of:
    (1) The date on which an unappealed initial decision becomes 
administratively final;
     (2) Issuance of an order disposing of any petitions for 
reconsideration of the FAA Decisionmaker's Final order in the 
proceeding;
     (3) If no petition for reconsideration is filed, the last date on 
which such a petition could have been filed; or
    (4) Issuance of a final order or any other final resolution of a 
proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, which is not 
subject to a petition for reconsideration.

[[Page 76]]


<R05>
Sec. 14.21  Filing and service of documents.

     Any application for an award or other pleading or document related 
to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the 
proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, 
except as provided in Sec. 14.11(b) for confidential financial 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 14.22  Answer to application.

     (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel 
representing the agency against which an award is sought may file an 
answer to the application. Unless agency counsel requests an extension 
of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under 
paragraph (b) of the section, failure to file an answer within the 30-
day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.
     (b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement 
shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, 
and further extensions may be granted by the administrative law judge 
upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.
     (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency 
counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not 
already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include 
with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 14.26.


<R05>
Sec. 14.23  Reply.

     Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply 
either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under 
Sec. 14.26.


<R05>
Sec. 14.24  Comments by other parties.

     Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and agency 
counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is 
served or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting 
party may not participate further in proceedings on the application 
unless the administrative law judge determines that the public interest 
requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of 
matters raised in the comments.


<R05>
Sec. 14.25  Settlement.

     The applicant and agency counsel may agree on a proposed settlement 
of the award before final action on the application, either in 
connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the 
underlying proceeding has been concluded. If a prevailing party and 
agency counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an 
application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the 
proposed settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 14.26  Further proceedings.

     (a) Ordinarily the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis of the written record; however, on request of either the applicant 
or agency counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the administrative 
law judge assigned to the matter may order further proceedings, such as 
an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, 
or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only 
when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from 
the application and shall be conducted as promptly as possible.
     (b) A request that the administrative law judge order further 
proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the 
information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the 
additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.


<R05>
Sec. 14.27  Decision.

     The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision on the 
application within 60 days after completion of proceedings on the 
application. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions 
on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party and an 
explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount 
requested and the amount

[[Page 77]]

awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on 
whether the agency's position was substantially justified, whether the 
applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special 
circumstances make an award unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 14.28  Review by FAA decisionmaker.

     Either the applicant or the FAA counsel may seek review of the 
initial decision on the fee application in accordance with subpart G of 
part 13 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, specifically 14 CFR 13.233. 
Additionally, the FAA Decisionmaker may decide to review the decision on 
its own initiative. If neither the applicant nor the agency counsel 
seeks review within 30 days after the decision is issued, it shall 
become final. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the 
discretion of the FAA Decisionmaker. If review is taken, the FAA 
Decisionmaker will issue a final decision on the application or remand 
the application to the administrative law judge who issued the initial 
fee award determination for further proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 14.29  Judicial review.

     If an applicant is dissatisfied with the determination of fees and 
other expenses made under this subsection, pursuant 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2), 
that applicant may, within thirty (30) days after the determination is 
made, appeal the determination to the court of the United States having 
jurisdiction to review the merits of the underlying decision of the FAA 
adversary adjudication. The court's determination on any appeal heard 
under this paragraph shall be based solely on the factual record made 
before the FAA. The court may modify the determination of fees and other 
expenses only if the court finds that the failure to make an award of 
fees and other expenses, or the calculation of the amount of the award, 
was unsupported by substantial evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 14.30  Payment of award.

     An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the 
disbursing official of the FAA a copy of the FAA Decisionmaker's final 
decision granting the award, accompanied by a statement that the 
applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States 
courts. Applications for award grants in cases involving the FAA shall 
be sent to: The Office of Accounting and Audit, AAA-1, Federal Aviation 
Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591. The 
agency will pay the amount awarded to the applicant within 60 days, 
unless judicial review of the award or of the underlying decision of the 
adversary adjudication has been sought by the applicant or any other 
party to the proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 15.1  Scope of regulations.

    (a) These regulations apply to claims asserted under the Federal 
Tort Claims Act, as amended, for money damages against the United States 
for injury to, or loss of property, or for personal injury or death, 
caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of 
the FAA acting within the scope of office or employment. The regulations 
in this part supplement the Attorney General's regulations in 28

[[Page 78]]

CFR Part 14, as amended. The regulations in 28 CFR Part 14, as amended, 
and the regulations in this part apply to consideration by the FAA of 
administrative claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act.


<R05>
Sec. 15.3  Administrative claim, when presented; appropriate office.

    (a) A claim is deemed to have been presented when the FAA receives, 
at a place designated in paragraph (b) of this section, an executed 
Standard Form 95 or other written notification of an incident, 
accompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain for injury to, 
or loss of, property or for personal injury or death, alleged to have 
occurred by reason of the incident. A claim which should have been 
presented to the FAA but which was mistakenly filed with another Federal 
agency, is deemed presented to the FAA on the date the claim is received 
by the FAA at a place designated in paragraph (b) of this section. A 
claim addressed to, or filed with, the FAA by mistake will be 
transferred to the appropriate Federal agency, if that agency can be 
determined, or returned to the claimant.
    (b) Claims shall be delivered or mailed to: Assistant Chief Counsel 
for Litigation, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue 
SW., Washington, DC 20591.
    Alternatively, claims may be delivered or mailed to: Office of the 
Regional Counsel, in any of the FAA Regional Offices.
    (c) Claim forms are available at each location listed in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (d) A claim presented in accordance with this section may be amended 
by the claimant at any time prior to final FAA action or prior to the 
exercise of the claimant's option, under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a), to deem the 
agency's failure to make a final disposition of his or her claim within 
6 months after it was filed as a final denial. Each amendment to a claim 
shall be submitted in writing and signed by the claimant or the 
claimant's duly authorized agent or legal representative. Upon the 
timely filing of an amendment to a pending claim, the FAA has 6 months 
thereafter in which to make a final disposition of the claim as amended, 
and the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) does not accrue until 
6 months after the filing of the amendment.

<R05>
Sec. 15.5  Administrative claim, who may file.

    (a) A claim for injury to, or loss of, property may be presented by 
the owner of the property interest which is the subject of the claim or 
by the owner's duly authorized agent or legal representative.
    (b) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the injured 
person or that person's duly authorized agent or legal representative.
    (c) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or 
administrator of the decedent's estate or by any other person legally 
entitled to assert such a claim under applicable State law.
    (d) A claim for loss wholly compensated by an insurer with the 
rights of a subrogee may be presented by the insurer. A claim for loss 
partially compensated by an insurer with the rights of a subrogee may be 
presented by the insurer or the insured individually, as their 
respective interest appear, or jointly. Whenever an insurer presents a 
claim asserting the rights of a subrogee, it shall present with its 
claim appropriate evidence that it has the rights of a subrogee.
    (e) A claim presented by an agent or legal representative shall be 
presented in the name of the claimant, be signed by the agent or legal 
representative, show the title or legal capacity of the person signing, 
and be accompanied by evidence of authority to present a claim on behalf 
of the claimant as agent, executor, administrator, parent, guardian, or 
other representative.


<R05>

dependent upon decedent for support at the time of death.
    (5) Decedent's general, physical, and mental conditions before

duration of pain and suffering, any drugs administered for pain, and the 
decedent's physical condition in the interval between injury and death.
    (8) Any other evidence or information which may have a bearing on 
either the responsibility of the United States for the death or the

property, real or personal, the claimant may be required to submit the 
following evidence or information:

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 16.1  Applicability and description of part.

    (a) General. The provisions of this part govern all proceedings 
involving Federally-assisted airports, except for disputes between U.S. 
and foreign air carriers and airport proprietors concerning the 
reasonableness of airport fees covered by 14 CFR part 302, whether the 
proceedings are instituted by order of the FAA or by filing with the FAA 
a complaint, under the following authorities:
    (1) 49 U.S.C. 40103(e), prohibiting the grant of exclusive rights 
for the use of any landing area or air navigation facility on which 
Federal funds have been expended (formerly section 308 of the Federal 
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended).
    (2) Requirements of the Anti-Head Tax Act, 49 U.S.C. 40116.
    (3) The assurances contained in grant-in-aid agreements issued under 
the Federal Airport Act of 1946, 49 U.S.C. 1101 et seq (repealed 1970).
    (4) The assurances contained in grant-in-aid agreements issued under 
the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.
    (5) The assurances contained in grant-in-aid agreements issued under 
the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (AAIA), as amended, 49 
U.S.C. 47101 et seq., specifically section 511(a), 49 U.S.C. 47107(a) 
and (b).
    (6) Section 505(d) of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 
1982, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 47113.
    (7) Obligations contained in property deeds for property transferred 
pursuant to section 16 of the Federal Airport Act (49 U.S.C. 1115),

47125).
    (8) Obligations contained in property deeds for property transferred 
under the Surplus Property Act (49 U.S.C. 47151-47153).
    (b) Other agencies. Where a grant assurance concerns a statute, 
executive order, regulation, or other authority that provides an 
administrative process for the investigation or adjudication of 
complaints by a Federal agency other than the FAA, persons shall use the 
administrative process established by those authorities. Where a grant 
assurance concerns a statute, executive order, regulation, or other 
authority that enables a Federal agency other than the FAA to 
investigate, adjudicate, and enforce compliance under those authorities 
on its own initiative, the FAA may defer to that Federal agency.
    (c) Other enforcement. If a complaint or action initiated by the FAA 
involves a violation of the 49 U.S.C. subtitle VII or FAA regulations, 
except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, the 
FAA may take investigative and enforcement action under 14 CFR part 13, 
``Investigative and Enforcement Procedures.''
    (d) Effective date. This part applies to a complaint filed with the 
FAA and to an investigation initiated by the FAA on or after December 
16, 1996.

FAA. The respondent may elect or waive a hearing as provided in subpart 
E of this part.


<R05>

Administrator. Such briefs shall be filed and served on all parties in 
the same manner as the parties' post hearing briefs are filed.
    (d) Participation under this section is at the discretion of the 
FAA, and no decision permitting participation shall be deemed to 
constitute an expression by the FAA that the participant has such a 
substantial interest in the proceeding as would entitle it to judicial 
review of such decision.


<R05>
Sec. 16.209  Extension of time.

    (a) Extension by oral agreement. The parties may agree to extend for 
a reasonable period of time for filing a document under this part. If 
the parties agree, the hearing officer shall grant one extension of time 
to each party. The party seeking the extension of time shall submit a 
draft order to the hearing officer to be signed by the hearing officer 
and filed with the hearing docket. The hearing officer may grant 
additional oral requests for an extension of time where the parties 
agree to the extension.
    (b) Extension by motion. A party shall file a written motion for an 
extension of time with the hearing officer not later than 7 days before 
the document is due unless good cause for the late filing is shown. A 
party filing a written motion for an extension of time shall serve a 
copy of the motion on each party.
    (c) Failure to rule. If the hearing officer fails to rule on a 
written motion for an extension of time by the date the document was 
due, the motion for an extension of time is deemed denied.
    (d) Effect on time limits. In a hearing required by section 519(b) 
of the Airport and Airways Improvement Act, as amended in 1987, 49 
U.S.C. 47106(e) and 47111(d), the due date for the hearing officer's 
initial decision and for the final agency decision are extended by the 
length of the extension granted by the hearing officer only if the 
hearing officer grants an extension of time as a result of an agreement 
by the parties as specified in paragraph (a) of this section or, if the 
hearing officer grants an extension of time as a result of the sponsor's 
failure to adhere to the hearing schedule. In any other hearing, an 
extension of time granted by the hearing officer for any reason extends 
the due date for the hearing officer's initial decision and for the 
final agency decision by the length of time of the hearing officer's 
decision.


<R05>
16.211  Prehearing conference.

    (a) Prehearing conference notice. The hearing officer schedules a 
prehearing conference and serves a prehearing conference notice on the 
parties promptly after being designated as a hearing officer.
    (1) The prehearing conference notice specifies the date, time, 
place, and manner (in person or by telephone) of the prehearing 
conference.
    (2) The prehearing conference notice may direct the parties to 
exchange proposed witness lists, requests for evidence and the 
production of documents in the possession of another party, responses to 
interrogatories, admissions, proposed procedural schedules, and proposed 
stipulations before the date of the prehearing conference.
    (b) The prehearing conference. The prehearing conference is 
conducted by

[[Page 92]]

telephone or in person, at the hearing officer's discretion. The 
prehearing conference addresses matters raised in the prehearing 
conference notice and such other matters as the hearing officer 
determines will assist in a prompt, full and fair hearing of the issues.
    (c) Prehearing conference report. At the close of the prehearing 
conference, the hearing officer rules on any requests for evidence and 
the production of documents in the possession of other parties, 
responses to interrogatories, and admissions; on any requests for 
depositions; on any proposed stipulations; and on any pending 
applications for subpoenas as permitted by Sec. 16.219. In addition, the 
hearing officer establishes the schedule, which shall provide for the 
issuance of an initial decision not later than 110 days after issuance 
of the Director's determination order unless otherwise provided in the 
hearing order.


<R05>
Sec. 16.213  Discovery.

    (a) Discovery is limited to requests for admissions, requests for 
production of documents, interrogatories, and depositions as authorized 
by Sec. 16.215.
    (b) The hearing officer shall limit the frequency and extent of 
discovery permitted by this section if a party shows that--
    (1) The information requested is cumulative or repetitious;
    (2) The information requested may be obtained from another less 
burdensome and more convenient source;
    (3) The party requesting the information has had ample opportunity 
to obtain the information through other discovery methods permitted 
under this section; or
    (4) The method or scope of discovery requested by the party is 
unduly burdensome or expensive.


<R05>
Sec. 16.215  Depositions.

    (a) General. For good cause shown, the hearing officer may order 
that the testimony of a witness may be taken by deposition and that the 
witness produce documentary evidence in connection with such testimony. 
Generally, an order to take the deposition of a witness is entered only 
if:
    (1) The person whose deposition is to be taken would be unavailable 
at the hearing;
    (2) The deposition is deemed necessary to perpetuate the testimony 
of the witness; or
    (3) The taking of the deposition is necessary to prevent undue and 
excessive expense to a party and will not result in undue burden to 
other parties or in undue delay.
    (b) Application for deposition. Any party desiring to take the 
deposition of a witness shall make application therefor to the hearing 
officer in writing, with a copy of the application served on each party. 
The application shall include:
    (1) The name and residence of the witness;
    (2) The time and place for the taking of the proposed deposition;
    (3) The reasons why such deposition should be taken; and
    (4) A general description of the matters concerning which the 
witness will be asked to testify.
    (c) Order authorizing deposition. If good cause is shown, the 
hearing officer, in his or her discretion, issues an order authorizing 
the deposition and specifying the name of the witness to be deposed, the 
location and time of the deposition and the general scope and subject 
matter of the testimony to be taken.
    (d) Procedures for deposition.
    (1) Witnesses whose testimony is taken by deposition shall be sworn 
or shall affirm before any questions are put to them. Each question 
propounded shall be recorded and the answers of the witness transcribed 
verbatim.
    (2) Objections to questions or evidence shall be recorded in the 
transcript of the deposition. The interposing of an objection shall not 
relieve the witness of the obligation to answer questions, except where 
the answer would violate a privilege.
    (3) The written transcript shall be subscribed by the witness, 
unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing, or the witness is 
ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. The reporter shall note the 
reason for failure to sign.

[[Page 93]]


<R05>
Sec. 16.217  Witnesses.

    (a) Each party may designate as a witness any person who is able and 
willing to give testimony that is relevant and material to the issues in 
the hearing case, subject to the limitation set forth in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) The hearing officer may exclude testimony of witnesses that 
would be irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious.
    (c) Any witness may be accompanied by counsel. Counsel representing 
a nonparty witness has no right to examine the witness or otherwise 
participate in the development of testimony.


<R05>
Sec. 16.219  Subpoenas.

    (a) Request for subpoena. A party may apply to the hearing officer, 
within the time specified for such applications in the prehearing 
conference report, for a subpoena to compel testimony at a hearing or to 
require the production of documents only from the following persons:
    (1) Another party;
    (2) An officer, employee, or agent of another party;
    (3) Any other person named in the complaint as participating in or 
benefiting from the actions of the respondent alleged to have violated 
any Act;
    (4) An officer, employee, or agent of any other person named in the 
complaint as participating in or benefiting from the actions of the 
respondent alleged to have violated any Act.
    (b) Issuance and service of subpoena.
    (1) The hearing officer issues the subpoena if the hearing officer 
determines that the evidence to be obtained by the subpoena is relevant 
and material to the resolution of the issues in the case.
    (2) Subpoenas shall be served by personal service, or upon an agent 
designated in writing for the purpose, or by certified mail, return 
receipt addressed to such person or agent. Whenever service is made by 
registered or certified mail, the date of mailing shall be considered as 
the time when service is made.
    (3) A subpoena issued under this part is effective throughout the 
United States or any territory or possession thereof.
    (c) Motions to quash or modify subpoena.
    (1) A party or any person upon whom a subpoena has been served may 
file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena with the hearing officer 
at or before the time specified in the subpoena for the filing of such 
motions. The applicant shall describe in detail the basis for the 
application to quash or modify the subpoena including, but not limited 
to, a statement that the testimony, document, or tangible evidence is 
not relevant to the proceeding, that the subpoena is not reasonably 
tailored to the scope of the proceeding, or that the subpoena is 
unreasonable and oppressive.
    (2) A motion to quash or modify the subpoena stays the effect of the 
subpoena pending a decision by the hearing officer on the motion.


<R05>
Sec. 16.221  Witness fees.

    (a) The party on whose behalf a witness appears is responsible for 
paying any witness fees and mileage expenses.
    (b) Except for employees of the United States summoned to testify as 
to matters related to their public employment, witnesses summoned by 
subpoena shall be paid the same fees and mileage expenses as are paid to 
a witness in a court of the United States in comparable circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 16.223  Evidence.

    (a) General. A party may submit direct and rebuttal evidence in 
accordance with this section.
    (b) Requirement for written testimony and evidence. Except in the 
case of evidence obtained by subpoena, or in the case of a special 
ruling by the hearing officer to admit oral testimony, a party's direct 
and rebuttal evidence shall be submitted in written form in advance of 
the oral hearing pursuant to the schedule established in the hearing 
officer's prehearing conference report. Written direct and rebuttal fact 
testimony shall be certified by the witness as true and correct. Subject 
to the same exception (for evidence obtained by subpoena or subject to a 
special ruling by the hearing officer), oral examination of a party's 
own witness is limited to certification of the accuracy of written 
evidence, including correction

[[Page 94]]

and updating, if necessary, and reexamination following cross-
examination by other parties.
    (c) Subpoenaed testimony. Testimony of witnesses appearing under 
subpoena may be obtained orally.
    (d) Cross-examination. A party may conduct cross-examination that 
may be required for disclosure of the facts, subject to control by the 
hearing officer for fairness, expedition and exclusion of extraneous 
matters.
    (e) Hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings 
governed by this part. The fact that evidence is hearsay goes to the 
weight of evidence and does not affect its admissibility.
    (f) Admission of evidence. The hearing officer admits evidence 
introduced by a party in support of its case in accordance with this 
section, but may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious 
evidence.
    (g) Expert or opinion witnesses. An employee of the FAA or DOT may 
not be called as an expert or opinion witness for any party other than 
the agency except as provided in Department of Transportation 
regulations at 49 CFR part 9.


<R05>
Sec. 16.225  Public disclosure of evidence.

    (a) Except as provided in this section, the hearing shall be open to 
the public.
    (b) The hearing officer may order that any information contained in 
the record be withheld from public disclosure. Any person may object to 
disclosure of information in the record by filing a written motion to 
withhold specific information with the hearing officer. The person shall 
state specific grounds for nondisclosure in the motion.
    (c) The hearing officer shall grant the motion to withhold 
information from public disclosure if the hearing officer determines 
that disclosure would be in violation of the Privacy Act, would reveal 
trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial 
information, or is otherwise prohibited by law.


<R05>
Sec. 16.227  Standard of proof.

    The hearing officer shall issue an initial decision or shall rule in 
a party's favor only if the decision or ruling is supported by, and in 
accordance with, reliable, probative, and substantial evidence contained 
in the record and is in accordance with law.


<R05>
Sec. 16.229  Burden of proof.

    (a) The burden of proof of noncompliance with an Act or any 
regulation, order, agreement or document of conveyance issued under the 
authority of an Act is on the agency.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute or rule, the proponent 
of a motion, request, or order has the burden of proof.
    (c) A party who has asserted an affirmative defense has the burden 
of proving the affirmative defense.

    A party whose evidence has been excluded by a ruling of the hearing 
officer may offer the evidence on the record when filing an appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 16.233  Record.

    (a) Exclusive record. The transcript of all testimony in the 
hearing, all exhibits received into evidence, all motions, applications 
requests and rulings, and all documents included in the hearing record 
shall constitute the exclusive record for decision in the proceedings 
and the basis for the issuance of any orders.
    (b) Examination and copy of record. Any interested person may 
examine the record at the Part 16 Airport Proceedings Docket, AGC-600, 
Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., 
Washington, DC 20591. Any person may have a copy of the record after 
payment of reasonable costs for search and reproduction of the record.


<R05>
Sec. 16.235  Argument before the hearing officer.

    (a) Argument during the hearing. During the hearing, the hearing 
officer shall give the parties reasonable opportunity to present oral 
argument on the record supporting or opposing motions, objections, and 
rulings if the parties request an opportunity for argument. The hearing 
officer may direct written argument during the hearing if the hearing 
officer finds that submission of

[[Page 95]]

written arguments would not delay the hearing.
    (b) Posthearing briefs. The hearing officer may request or permit 
the parties to submit posthearing briefs. The hearing officer may 
provide for the filing of simultaneous reply briefs as well, if such 
filing will not unduly delay the issuance of the hearing officer's 
initial decision. Posthearing briefs shall include proposed findings of 
fact and conclusions of law; exceptions to rulings of the hearing 
officer; references to the record in support of the findings of fact; 
and supporting arguments for the proposed findings, proposed 
conclusions, and exceptions.


<R05>
Sec. 16.237  Waiver of procedures.

    (a) The hearing officer shall waive such procedural steps as all 
parties to the hearing agree to waive before issuance of an initial 
decision.
    (b) Consent to a waiver of any procedural step bars the raising of 
this issue on appeal.
    (c) The parties may not by consent waive the obligation of the 
hearing officer to enter an initial decision on the record.


<R04>
            Subpart G--Initial Decisions, Orders and Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 16.241  Initial decisions, order, and appeals.

    (a) The hearing officer shall issue an initial decision based on the 
record developed during the proceeding and shall send the initial 
decision to the parties not later than 110 days after the Director's 
determination unless otherwise provided in the hearing order.
    (b) Each party adversely affected by the hearing officer's initial 
decision may file an appeal with the Associate Administrator within 15 
days of the date the initial decision is issued. Each party may file a 
reply to an appeal within 10 days after it is served on the party. 
Filing and service of appeals and replies shall be by personal delivery.
    (c) If an appeal is filed, the Associate Administrator reviews the 
entire record and issues a final agency decision and order within 30 
days of the due date of the reply. If no appeal is filed, the Associate 
Administrator may take review of the case on his or her own motion. If 
the Associate Administrator finds that the respondent is not in 
compliance with any Act or any regulation, agreement, or document of 
conveyance issued or made under such Act, the final agency order 
includes a statement of corrective action, if appropriate, and 
identifies sanctions for continued noncompliance.
    (d) If no appeal is filed, and the Associate Administrator does not 
take review of the initial decision on the Associate Administrator's own 
motion, the initial decision shall take effect as the final agency 
decision and order on the sixteenth day after the actual date the 
initial decision is issued.
    (e) The failure to file an appeal is deemed a waiver of any rights 
to seek judicial review of an initial decision that becomes a final 
agency decision by operation of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) If the Associate Administrator takes review on the Associate 
Administrator's own motion, the Associate Administrator issues a notice 
of review by the sixteenth day after the actual date the initial 
decision is issued.
    (1) The notice sets forth the specific findings of fact and 
conclusions of law in the initial decision that are subject to review by 
the Associate Administrator.
    (2) Parties may file one brief on review to the Associate 
Administrator or rely on their posthearing briefs to the hearing 
officer. Briefs on review shall be filed not later than 10 days after 
service of the notice of review. Filing and service of briefs on review 
shall be by personal delivery.
    (3) The Associate Administrator issues a final agency decision and 
order within 30 days of the due date of the briefs on review. If the 
Associate Administrator finds that the respondent is not in compliance 
with any Act or any regulation, agreement or document of conveyance 
issued under such Act, the final agency order includes a statement of 
corrective action, if appropriate, and identifies sanctions for 
continued noncompliance.


<R05>
Sec. 16.243  Consent orders.

    (a) The agency attorney and the respondents may agree at any time 
before the issuance of a final decision and

[[Page 96]]

order to dispose of the case by issuance of a consent order. Good faith 
efforts to resolve a complaint through issuance of a consent order may 
continue throughout the administrative process. Except as provided in 
Sec. 16.209, such efforts may not serve as the basis for extensions of 
the times set forth in this part.
    (b) A proposal for a consent order, specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section, shall include:
    (1) A proposed consent order;
    (2) An admission of all jurisdictional facts;
    (3) An express waiver of the right to further procedural steps and 
of all rights of judicial review; and
    (4) The hearing order, if issued, and an acknowledgment that the 
hearing order may be used to construe the terms of the consent order.
    (c) If the issuance of a consent order has been agreed upon by all 
parties to the hearing, the proposed consent order shall be filed with 
the hearing officer, along with a draft order adopting the consent 
decree and dismissing the case, for the hearing officer's adoption.
    (d) The deadline for the hearing officer's initial decision and the 
final agency decision is extended by the amount of days elapsed between 
the filing of the proposed consent order with the hearing officer and 
the issuance of the hearing officer's order continuing the hearing.
    (e) If the agency attorney and sponsor agree to dispose of a case by 
issuance of a consent order before the FAA issues a hearing order, the 
proposal for a consent order is submitted jointly to the official 
authorized to issue a hearing order, together with a request to adopt 
the consent order and dismiss the case. The official authorized to issue 
the hearing order issues the consent order as an order of the FAA and 
terminates the proceeding.

provided in 49 U.S.C. 46110 or section 519(b)(4) of the Airport and 
Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended, (AAIA), 49 U.S.C. 47106(d) 
and 47111(d). A party seeking judicial review of a final decision and 
order shall file a petition for review with the Court not later than 60 
days after a final decision and order under the AAIA has been served on 
the party or within 60 days after the entry of an order under 49 U.S.C. 
40101 et seq.
    (b) The following do not constitute final decisions and orders 
subject to judicial review:
    (1) An FAA decision to dismiss a complaint without prejudice, as set 
forth in Sec. 16.27;
    (2) A Director's determination;
    (3) An initial decision issued by a hearing officer at the 
conclusion of a hearing;
    (4) A Director's determination or an initial decision of a hearing 
officer that becomes the final decision of the Associate Administrator 
because it was not appealed within the applicable time periods provided 
under Secs. 16.33(b) and 16.241(b).


<R04>
                   Subpart I--Ex Parte Communications

    Decisional employee means the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, 
Associate Administrator, Director, hearing officer, or other FAA 
employee who is or who may reasonably be expected to be involved in the 
decisional process of the proceeding.
    Ex parte communication means an oral or written communication not on 
the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice to all 
parties is not given, but it shall not include requests for status 
reports on any matter or proceeding covered by this part, or 
communications between FAA employees who participate as parties to a 
hearing pursuant to 16.203(b) of this part and other parties to a 
hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 16.303  Prohibited ex parte communications.

    (a) The prohibitions of this section shall apply from the time a 
proceeding is noticed for hearing unless the person responsible for the 
communication has

[[Page 97]]

knowledge that it will be noticed, in which case the prohibitions shall 
apply at the time of the acquisition of such knowledge.
    (b) Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte 
matters as authorized by law:
    (1) No interested person outside the FAA and no FAA employee 
participating as a party shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any 
decisional employee an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of 
the proceeding;
    (2) No FAA employee shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any 
interested person outside the FAA an ex parte communication relevant to 
the merits of the proceeding; or
    (3) Ex parte communications regarding solely matters of agency 
procedure or practice are not prohibited by this section.


<R05>
Sec. 16.305  Procedures for handling ex parte communications.

    A decisional employee who receives or who makes or knowingly causes 
to be made a communication prohibited by Sec. 16.303 shall place in the 
public record of the proceeding:
    (a) All such written communications;
    (b) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; 
and
    (c) All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of 
all oral responses, to the materials described in paragraphs (a) and (b)

Sec. 16.307  Requirement to show cause and imposition of sanction.

    (a) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or knowingly 
caused to be made by a party in violation of Sec. 16.303, the Associate 
Administrator or his designee or the hearing officer may, to the extent 
consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the 
underlying statutes, require the party to show cause why his or her 
claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, 
disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of such 
violation.
    (b) The Associate Administrator may, to the extent consistent with 
the interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes 
administered by the FAA, consider a violation of this subpart sufficient 
grounds for a decision adverse to a party who has knowingly committed 
such violation or knowingly caused such violation to occur.

following at takeoff weights in excess of 12,500 pounds:

                                 Landing

    (a) The landing distance must be determined for standard atmosphere 
at each weight, altitude, and wind within the operational limits 
established by the applicant in accordance with Sec. 23.75(a) of this 
chapter. Instead of a gliding approach specified in Sec. 23.75(a), the 
landing may be preceded by a steady approach down to the 50-foot height 
at a gradient of descent not greater than 5.2 percent (3 deg.) at a 
calibrated airspeed not less than 1.3 V<INF>S1</INF>.
    (b) The landing distance data must include correction factors for 
not more than 50 percent of the nominal wind components along the 
landing path opposite to the direction of landing, and not less than 150 
percent of the nominal wind components along the landing path in the 
direction of landing.
    (d) In lieu of compliance with section 28 of Appendix A of Part 135 
of the Federal Aviation Regulations, comply with the following:
    Fatigue evaluation of flight structure. Unless it is shown that the 
structure, operating stress levels, materials, and expected use are 
comparable from a fatigue standpoint to a similar design which has had 
substantial satifactory service experience, the strength, detail design, 
and the fabrication of those parts of the wing, wing carrythrough, 
vertical fin, horizortal stabilizer, and attaching

[[Page 103]]

structure whose failure would be catastrophic must be evaluted under 
either--
    (a) A fatigue strength investigation in which the structure is shown 
by analysis, tests, or both, to be able to withstand the repeated loads 
of variable magnitude expected in service. Analysis alone is acceptable 
only when it is conservative and applied to simple structures; or
    (b) A fail-safe strength investigation in which it is shown by 
analysis, tests, or both, that catastrophic failure of the structure is 
not probable after fatigue, or obvious partial failure, of a principal 
structural element, and that the remaining structure is able to 
withstand a static ultimate load factor of 75 percent of the critical 
limit load factor at V<INF>C</INF>. These loads must be multiplied by a 
factor of 1.15 unless the dynamic effects of failure under static load 
are otherwise considered.
    (e) In lieu of compliance with section 32 of Appendix A of Part 135 
of the Federal Aviation Regulations, comply with the following:
    Doors and exits. The airplane must meet the requirements of 
Secs. 23.783 and 23.807 (a)(3), (b), and (c) of this chapter, and in 
addition the following requirements:
    (a) Each cabin must have at least one easily accessible external 
door.
    (b) There must be a means to lock and safeguard each external door 
against opening in flight (either inadvertently by persons or as a 
result of mechanical failure or failure of a single structural element). 
Each external door must be operable from both the inside and the 
outside, even though persons may be crowded against the door on the 
inside of the airplane. Inward opening doors may be used if there are 
means to prevent occupants from crowding against the door to an extent 
that would interfere with the opening of the door. The means of opening 
must be simple and obvious and must be arranged and marked so that it 
can be readily located and operated, even in darkness. Auxiliary locking 
devices may be used.
    (c) Each external door must be reasonably free from jamming as a 
result of fuselage deformation in a minor crash.
    (d) Each external door must be located where persons using it will 
not be endangered by the propellers when appropriate operating 
procedures are used.
    (e) There must be a provision for direct visual inspection of the 
locking mechanism by crewmembers to determine whether external doors, 
for which the initial opening movement is outward (including passenger, 
crew, service, and cargo doors), are fully locked. In addition, there 
must be a visual means to signal to appropriate crewmembers when 
normally used external doors are closed and fully locked.
    (f) Cargo and service doors not suitable for use as exits in an 
emergency need only meet paragraph (e) of section 5(e) of this 
regulation and be safeguarded against opening in flight as a result of 
mechanical failure or failure of a single structural element.
    (g) The passenger entrance door must qualify as a floor level 
emergency exit. If an integral stair is installed at such a passenger 
entry door, the stair must be designed so that when subjected to the 
inertia forces specified in Sec. 23.561 of this chapter, and following 
the collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear, it will not 
interfere to an extent that will reduce the effectiveness of emergency 
egress through the passenger entry door. Each additional required 
emergency exit except floor level exits must be located over the wing or 
must be provided with acceptable means to assist the occupants in 
descending to the ground. In addition to the passenger entrance door--
    (1) For a total passenger seating capacity of 15 or less, an 
emergency exit, as defined in Sec. 23.807(b) of this chapter, is 
required on each side of the cabin; and
    (2) For a total passenger seating capacity of 16 through 19, three 
emergency exits, as defined in Sec. 23.807(b) of this chapter, are 
required with one on the same side as the door and two on the side 
opposite the door.
    (h) An evacuation demonstration must be conducted utilizing the 
maximum number of occupants for which certification is desired. It must 
be conducted under simulated night conditions utilizing only the 
emergency exits on the most critical side of the aircraft. The 
participants must be representative of average airline passengers with 
no prior practice or rehearsal for the demonstration. Evacuation must be 
completed within 90 seconds.
    (i) Each emergency exit must be marked with the word ``Exit'' by a 
sign which has white letters 1 inch high on a red background 2 inches 
high, be self-illuminated or independently internally electrically 
illuminated, and have a minimum luminescence (brightness) of at least 
160 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed if the passenger 
compartment illumination is essentially the same.
    (j) Access to window type emergency exits may not be obstructed by 
seats or seat backs.
    (k) The width of the main passenger aisle at any point between seats 
must equal or exceed the values in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Minimum main passenger aisle width  
                                 ---------------------------------------
    Number of passenger seats        Less than 25     25 inches and more
                                   inches from floor      from floor    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
10 through 19...................  9 inches..........  15 inches.        
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) In lieu of compliance with Section 45 of Appendix A of Part 135 
of the Federal Aviation Regulations, comply with Sec. 23.954 of this 
chapter.

[[Page 104]]

    (g) In lieu of compliance with Section 56 of Appendix A of Part 135 
of the Federal Aviation Regulations, comply with the following:
    Cowlings. The airplane must be designed and constructed so that no 
fire originating in any engine compartment can enter, either through 
openings or by burn through, any other region where it would create 
additional hazards.
    (h) In lieu of complaince with Section 57 of Appendix A of Part 135 
of the Federal Aviation Regulations, comply with Sec. 25.863 of this 
chapter.
    6. Additional requirements--general. The additional requirements 
specified in sections 7 through 14 apply to the certification of 
airplanes pursuant to section 1.(b) of this Special Federal Aviation 
Regulation.
    7. Compartment interiors.
    (a) If smoking is to be prohibited, there must be a placard so 
stating, and if smoking is to be allowed--
    (1) There must be an adequate number of self-contained removable 
ashtrays; and
    (2) Where the crew compartment is separated from the passenger 
compartment, there must be at least one sign (using either letters or

the engines or propellers were type certificated under Part 33 or 35 of 
the Federal Aviation Regulations.
    (d) The Administrator may relieve an applicant from strict 
compliance with a specific provision of the applicable requirements in 
paragraph (f) of this section, if the Administrator finds that the 
method of compliance proposed by the applicant provides substantially 
the same level of airworthiness and that strict compliance with those 
regulations would impose a severe burden on the applicant. The 
Administrator may use experience that was satisfactory to an Armed Force 
of the United States in making such a determination.
    (e) The Administrator may require an applicant to comply with 
special conditions and later requirements than those in paragraphs (c) 
and (f) of this section, if the Administrator finds that compliance with 
the listed regulations would not ensure an adequate level of 
airworthiness for the aircraft.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this 
section, an applicant for a type certificate under this section must 
comply with the appropriate regulations listed in the following table:

                 Subpart D--Changes to Type Certificates

    Source: Docket No. 5085, 29 FR 14567, Oct. 24, 1964, unless 
otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 21.91  Applicability.

    This subpart prescribes procedural requirements for the approval of 
changes to type certificates.


<R05>
Sec. 21.93  Classification of changes in type design.

    (a) In addition to changes in type design specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section, changes in type design are classified as minor and 
major. A ``minor change'' is one that has no appreciable effect on the 
weight, balance,

[[Page 118]]

structural strength, reliability, operational characteristics, or other 
characteristics affecting the airworthiness of the product. All other 
changes are ``major changes'' (except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section).
    (b) For the purpose of complying with Part 36 of this chapter, and 
except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this 
section, any voluntary change in the type design of an aircraft that may 
increase the noise levels of that aircraft is an ``acoustical change'' 
(in addition to being a minor or major change as classified in paragraph 
(a) of this section) for the following aircraft:
    (1) Transport category large airplanes.
    (2) Turbojet powered airplanes (regardless of category). For 
airplanes to which this paragraph applies, ``acoustical changes'' do not 
include changes in type design that are limited to one of the 
following--
    (i) Gear down flight with one or more retractable landing gear down 
during the entire flight, or
    (ii) Spare engine and nacelle carriage external to the skin of the 
airplane (and return of the pylon or other external mount), or
    (iii) Time-limited engine and/or nacelle changes, where the change 
in type design specifies that the airplane may not be operated for a 
period of more than 90 days unless compliance with the applicable 
acoustical change provisions of Part 36 of this chapter is shown for 
that change in type design.
    (3) Propeller driven commuter category and small airplanes in the 
primary, normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, and restricted 
categories, except for airplanes that are:
    (i) Designated for ``agricultural aircraft operations'' (as defined 
in Sec. 137.3 of this chapter, effective January 1, 1966) to which 
Sec. 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or
    (ii) Designated for dispensing fire fighting materials to which 
Sec. 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or
    (iii) U.S. registered, and that had flight time prior to January 1, 
1955 or
    (iv) Land configured aircraft reconfigured with floats or skis. This 
reconfiguration does not permit further exception from the requirements 
of this section upon any acoustical change not enumerated in 
Sec. 21.93(b).
    (4) Helicopters except:
    (i) Those helicopters that are designated exclusively:
    (A) For ``agricultural aircraft operations'', as defined in 
Sec. 137.3 of this chapter, as effective on January 1, 1966;
    (B) For dispensing fire fighting materials; or
    (C) For carrying external loads, as defined in Sec. 133.1(b) of this 
chapter, as effective on December 20, 1976.
    (ii) Those helicopters modified by installation or removal of 
external equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, ``external 
equipment'' means any instrument, mechanism, part, apparatus, 
appurtenance, or accessory that is attached to, or extends from, the 
helicopter exterior but is not used nor is intended to be used in 
operating or controlling a helicopter in flight and is not part of an 
airframe or engine. An ``acoustical change'' does not include:
    (A) Addition or removal of external equipment;
    (B) Changes in the airframe made to accommodate the addition or 
removal of external equipment, to provide for an external load attaching 
means, to facilitate the use of external equipment or external loads, or 
to facilitate the safe operation of the helicopter with external 
equipment mounted to, or external loads carried by, the helicopter;
    (C) Reconfiguration of the helicopter by the addition or removal of 
floats and skis;
    (D) Flight with one or more doors and/or windows removed or in an 
open position; or
    (E) Any changes in the operational limitations placed on the 
helicopter as a consequence of the addition or removal of external 
equipment, floats, and skis, or flight operations with doors and/or 
windows removed or in an open position.
    (c) For purposes of complying with part 34 of this chapter, any 
voluntary change in the type design of the airplane or engine which may 
increase

[[Page 119]]

fuel venting or exhaust emissions is an ``emissions change.''

    Minor changes in a type design may be approved under a method 
acceptable to the Administrator before submitting to the Administrator 
any substantiating or descriptive data.


<R05>
Sec. 21.97  Approval of major changes in type design.

    (a) In the case of a major change in type design, the applicant must 
submit substantiating data and necessary descriptive data for inclusion 
in the type design.
    (b) Approval of a major change in the type design of an aircraft 
engine is limited to the specific engine configuration upon which the 
change is made unless the applicant identifies in the necessary 
descriptive data for inclusion in the type design the other 
configurations of the same engine type for which approval is requested 
and shows that the change is compatible with the other configurations.

<R05>
Sec. 21.99  Required design changes.

    (a) When an Airworthiness Directive is issued under Part 39 the 
holder of the type certificate for the product concerned must--
    (1) If the Administrator finds that design changes are necessary to 
correct the unsafe condition of the product, and upon his request, 
submit appropriate design changes for approval; and
    (2) Upon approval of the design changes, make available the 
descriptive data covering the changes to all operators of products 
previously certificated under the type certificate.
    (b) In a case where there are no current unsafe conditions, but the 
Administrator or the holder of the type certificate finds through 
service experience that changes in type design will contribute to the 
safety of the product, the holder of the type certificate may submit 
appropriate design changes for approval. Upon approval of the changes, 
the manufacturer shall make information on the design changes available 
to all operators of the same type of product.

<R05>
Sec. 21.101  Designation of applicable regulations.

    (a) Except as provided in Secs. 23.2, Sec. 25.2, 27.2 and 29.2 and 
parts 34 and 36 of this chapter, an applicant for a change to a type 
certificate must comply with either--
    (1) The regulations incorporated by reference in the type 
certificate; or
    (2) The applicable regulations in effect on the date of the 
application, plus any other amendments the Administrator finds to be 
directly related.
    (b) If the Administrator finds that a proposed change consists of a 
new design or a substantially complete redesign of a component, 
equipment installation, or system installation, and that the regulations 
incorporated by reference in the type certificate for the product do not 
provide adequate standards with respect to the proposed change, the 
applicant must comply with--
    (1) The applicable provisions of this subchapter, in effect on the 
date of the application for the change, that the Administrator finds 
necessary to provide a level of safety equal to that established by the 
regulations incorporated by reference in the type certificate for the 
product; and
    (2) Any special conditions, and amendments to those special 
conditions, prescribed by the Administrator to provide a level of safety 
equal to that established by the regulations incorporated by reference 
in the type certificate for the product.
    (c) Unless otherwise required by Sec. 21.19(a), an applicant for a 
change to a type certificate for a transport category airplane involving 
the replacement of reciprocating engines with the

[[Page 120]]

same number of turbopropeller powerplants must comply with the 
requirements of Part 25 of this chapter applicable to the airplane as 
type certificated with reciprocating engines, and with the following:
    (1) The certification performance requirements prescribed in 
Secs. 25.101 through 25.125 and 25.149, 25.1533, 25.1583, and 25.1587.
    (2) The powerplant requirements of Part 25 of this chapter 
applicable to turbopropeller engine-powered airplanes.
    (3) The requirements of Part 25 of this chapter for the 
standardization of cockpit controls and instruments, unless the 
Administrator finds that compliance with a particular detailed 
requirement would be impractical and would not contribute materially to 
standardization.
    (4) Any other requirement of Part 25 of this chapter applicable to 
turbopropeller engine-powered airplanes that the Administrator finds to 
be related to the changes in engines and that are necessary to ensure a 
level of safety equal to that of the airplane certificated with 
reciprocating engines.

For each new limitation established with respect to weight, speed, or 
altitude that is significantly altered from those approved for the 
airplane with reciprocating engines, the applicant must show compliance 
with the requirements of Part 25 of this chapter applicable to the 
limitations being changed.

to the appropriate Flight Standards District Office or the nearest 
international field office for export airworthiness approval of a Class 
II product approved under his production certificate.
    (c) Application for export airworthiness approval of Class III 
products is made to the designated representative of the Administrator 
authorized to issue those approvals.
    (d) A separate application must be made for--
    (1) Each aircraft;
    (2) Each engine and propeller, except that one application may be 
made for more than one engine or propeller, if all are of the same type 
and model and are exported to the same purchaser and country; and
    (3) Each type of Class II product, except that one application may 
be used for more than one type of Class II product when--
    (i) They are separated and identified in the application as to the 
type and model of the related Class I product; and
    (ii) They are to be exported to the same purchaser and country.
    (e) Each application must be accompanied by a written statement from 
the importing country that will validate the export airworthiness 
approval if the product being exported is--

[[Page 140]]

    (1) An aircraft manufactured outside the United States and being 
exported to a country with which the United States has a reciprocal 
agreement concerning the validation of export certificates;
    (2) An unassembled aircraft which has not been flight-tested;
    (3) A product that does not meet the special requirement of the 
importing country; or
    (4) A product that does not meet a requirement specified in 
Secs. 21.329, 21.331, or 21.333, as applicable, for the issuance of an 
export airworthiness approval. The written statement must list the 
requirements not met.
    (f) Each application for export airworthiness approval of a Class I 
product must include, as applicable:
    (1) A Statement of Conformity, FAA Form 8130-9, for each new product

applicable, for each aircraft in accordance with Part 43 of this 
chapter. For transport aircraft and commuter category airplanes this 
report must be based on an actual weighing of the aircraft within the 
preceding twelve months, but after any major repairs or alterations to 
the aircraft. Changes in equipment not classed as major changes that are 
made after the actual weighing may be accounted for on a ``computed'' 
basis and the report revised accordingly. Manufacturers of new 
nontransport category airplanes, normal category rotorcraft, and gliders 
may submit reports having computed weight and balance data, in place of 
an actual weighing of the aircraft, if fleet weight control procedures 
approved by the FAA have been established for such aircraft. In such a 
case, the following statement must be entered in each report: ``The 
weight and balance data shown in this report are computed on the basis 
of Federal Aviation Administration approved procedures for establishing 
fleet weight averages.'' The weight and balance report must include an 
equipment list showing weights and moment arms of all required and 
optional items of equipment that are included in the certificated empty 
weight.
    (3) A maintenance manual for each new product when such a manual is 
required by the applicable airworthiness rules.
    (4) Evidence of compliance with the applicable airworthiness 
directives. A suitable notation must be made when such directives are 
not complied with.
    (5) When temporary installations are incorporated in an aircraft for 
the purpose of export delivery, the application form must include a 
general description of the installations together with a statement that 
the installation will be removed and the aircraft restored to the 
approved configuration upon completion of the delivery flight.
    (6) Historical records such as aircraft and engine log books, repair 
and alteration forms, etc., for used aircraft and newly overhauled 
products.
    (7) For products intended for overseas shipment, the application 
form must describe the methods used, if any, for the preservation and 
packaging of such products to protect them against corrosion and damage 
while in transit or storage. The description must also indicate the 
duration of the effectiveness of such methods.
    (8) The Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual when such material is 
required by the applicable airworthiness regulations for the particular 
aircraft.
    (9) A statement as to the date when title passed or is expected to 
pass to a foreign purchaser.
    (10) The data required by the special requirements of the importing 
country.

showing compliance with FAR 23.175(a), an applicant must in lieu of the 
power specified in FAR 23.175(a)(4), use the maximum power or thrust 
selected by the applicant as an operating limitation for use during 
climb at the best rate of climb speed except that the speed need not be 
less than 1.4 V<INF>s1</INF>.

drag limiting system, considering the probable pilot corrective action 
on the flight controls.
    (1) At speeds between V<INF>MC!</INF>and V<INF>D</INF>, the loads 
resulting from power failure because of fuel flow interruption are 
considered to be limit loads.
    (2) At speeds between V<INF>MC!</INF>and V<INF>C</INF>, the loads

particular engine-propeller-airplane combination.
    (b) Pilot corrective action may be assumed to be initiated at the 
time maximum yawing velocity is reached, but not earlier than two 
seconds after the engine failure. The magnitude of the corrective action 
may be based on the control forces specified in FAR 23.397 except that 
lower forces may be assumed where it is shown by analysis or test that 
these forces can control the yaw and roll resulting from the prescribed 
engine failure conditions.

                              Ground Loads 

    27. Dual wheel landing gear units. Each dual wheel landing gear unit

is shown that the structure, operating stress levels, materials, and 
expected use are comparable from a fatigue standpoint to a similar 
design which has had substantial satisfactory service experience, the 
strength, detail design, and the fabrication of those parts of the wing, 
wing carrythrough, and attaching structure whose failure would be 
catastrophic must be evaluated under either--
    (a) A fatigue strength investigation in which the structure is shown 
by analysis, tests, or both to be able to withstand the repeated loads 
of variable magnitude expected in service; or
    (b) A fail-safe strength investigation in which it is shown by 
analysis, tests, or both that catastrophic failure of the structure is 
not probable after fatigue, or obvious partial failure, of a principal 
structural element, and that the remaining structure is able to 
withstand a static ultimate load factor of 75 percent of the critical 
limit load factor at V<INF>c</INF>. These loads must be multiplied by a 
factor of 1.15 unless the dynamic effects of failure under static load 
are otherwise considered.

appropriate to the particular configuration.

                              Landing Gear

    30. Flap operated landing gear warning device. Airplanes having 
retractable landing gear and wing flaps must be equipped with a warning 
device that functions continuously when the wing flaps are extended to a 
flap position that activates the warning device to give adequate warning 
before landing, using normal landing procedures, if the landing gear is 
not fully extended and locked. There may not be a manual shut off for 
this warning device. The flap position sensing unit may be installed at 
any suitable location. The system for this device may use any part of 
the system (including the aural warning device) provided for other 
landing gear warning devices.

normally used external doors are closed and fully locked.
    (c) The passenger entrance door must qualify as a floor level 
emergency exit. Each additional required emergency exit except floor 
level exits must be located over the wing or must be provided with 
acceptable means to assist the occupants in descending to the ground. In 
addition to the passenger entrance door:
    (1) For a total seating capacity of 15 or less, an emergency exit as 
defined in FAR 23.807(b) is required on each side of the cabin.
    (2) For a total seating capacity of 16 through 23, three emergency 
exits as defined in 23.807(b) are required with one on the same side as 
the door and two on the side opposite the door.

                              Miscellaneous

    33. Lightning strike protection. Parts that are electrically 
insulated from the basic airframe must be connected to it through 
lightning arrestors unless a lightning strike on the insulated part--
    (a) Is improbable because of shielding by other parts; or
    (b) Is not hazardous.
    34. Ice protection. If certification with ice protection provisions 
is desired, compliance with the following requirements must be shown:
    (a) The recommended procedures for the use of the ice protection 
equipment must be set forth in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (b) An analysis must be performed to establish, on the basis of the 
airplane's operational needs, the adequacy of the ice protection system 
for the various components of the airplane. In addition, tests of the 
ice protection system must be conducted to demonstrate that the airplane 
is capable of operating safely in continuous maximum and

[[Page 160]]

intermittent maximum icing conditions as described in FAR 25, Appendix 
C.
    (c) Compliance with all or portions of this section may be 
accomplished by reference, where applicable because of similarity of the 
designs, to analysis and tests performed by the applicant for a type 
certificated model.
    35. Maintenance information. The applicant must make available to 
the owner at the time of delivery of the airplane the information he 
considers essential for the proper maintenance of the airplane. That 
information must include the following:
    (a) Description of systems, including electrical, hydraulic, and 
fuel controls.
    (b) Lubrication instructions setting forth the frequency and the 
lubricants and fluids which are to be used in the various systems.
    (c) Pressures and electrical loads applicable to the various 
systems.
    (d) Tolerances and adjustments necessary for proper functioning.
    (e) Methods of leveling, raising, and towing.

                               Propulsion

                                 general

    36. Vibration characteristics. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, 
the engine installation must not result in vibration characteristics of 
the engine exceeding those established during the type certification of 
the engine.
    37. In-flight restarting of engine. If the engine on turbopropeller 
powered airplanes cannot be restarted at the maximum cruise altitude, a 
determination must be made of the altitude below which restarts can be 
consistently accomplished. Restart information must be provided in the 
Airplane Flight Manual.
    38. Engines--(a) For turbopropeller powered airplanes. The engine 
installation must comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Engine isolation. The powerplants must be arranged and isolated 
from each other to allow operation, in at least one configuration, so 
that the failure or malfunction of any engine, or of any system that can 
affect the engine, will not--
    (i) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; 
or
    (ii) Require immediate action by any crewmember for continued safe 
operation.
    (2) Control of engine rotation. There must be a means to 
individually stop and restart the rotation of any engine in flight 
except that engine rotation need not be stopped if continued rotation 
could not jeopardize the safety of the airplane. Each component of the 
stopping and restarting system on the engine side of the firewall, and 
that might be exposed to fire, must be at least fire resistant. If 
hydraulic propeller feathering systems are used for this purpose, the 
feathering lines must be at least fire resistant under the operating 
conditions that may be expected to exist during feathering.
    (3) Engine speed and gas temperature control devices. The powerplant 
systems associated with engine control devices, systems, and 
instrumentation must provide reasonable assurance that those engine 
operating limitations that adversely affect turbine rotor structural 
integrity will not be exceeded in service.
    (b) For reciprocating-engine powered airplanes.  To provide engine 
isolation, the powerplants must be arranged and isolated from each other 
to allow operation, in at least one configuration, so that the failure 
or malfunction of any engine, or of any system that can affect that 
engine, will not--
    (1) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; 
or
    (2) Require immediate action by any crewmember for continued safe 
operation.
    39. Turbopropeller reversing systems. (a) Turbopropeller reversing 
systems intended for ground operation must be designed so that no single 
failure or malfunction of the system will result in unwanted reverse 
thrust under any expected operating condition. Failure of structural 
elements need not be considered if the probability of this kind of 
failure is extremely remote.
    (b) Turbopropeller reversing systems intended for in-flight use must 
be designed so that no unsafe condition will result during normal 
operation of the system, or from any failure (or reasonably likely 
combination of failures) of the reversing system, under any anticipated 
condition of operation of the airplane. Failure of structural elements 
need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is 
extremely remote.
    (c) Compliance with this section may be shown by failure analysis, 
testing, or both for propeller systems that allow propeller blades to 
move from the flight low-pitch position to a position that is 
substantially less than that at the normal flight low-pitch stop 
position. The analysis may include or be supported by the analysis made 
to show compliance with the type certification of the propeller and 
associated installation components. Credit will be given for pertinent 
analysis and testing completed by the engine and propeller 
manufacturers.
    40. Turbopropeller drag-limiting systems.  Turbopropeller drag-
limiting systems must be

[[Page 161]]

designed so that no single failure or malfunction of any of the systems 
during normal or emergency operation results in propeller drag in excess 
of that for which the airplane was designed. Failure of structural 
elements of the drag-limiting systems need not be considered if the 
probability of this kind of failure is extremely remote.
    41. Turbine engine powerplant operating characteristics. For 
turbopropeller powered airplanes, the turbine engine powerplant 
operating characteristics must be investigated in flight to determine 
that no adverse characteristics (such as stall, surge, or flameout) are 
present to a hazardous degree, during normal and emergency operation 
within the range of operating limitations of the airplane and of the 
engine.
    42. Fuel flow. (a) For turbopropeller powered airplanes--
    (1) The fuel system must provide for continuous supply of fuel to 
the engines for normal operation without interruption due to depletion 
of fuel in any tank other than the main tank; and
    (2) The fuel flow rate for turbopropeller engine fuel pump systems 
must not be less than 125 percent of the fuel flow required to develop 
the standard sea level atmospheric conditions takeoff power selected and 
included as an operating limitation in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (b) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, it is acceptable for 
the fuel flow rate for each pump system (main and reserve supply) to be 
125 percent of the takeoff fuel consumption of the engine.

                         Fuel System Components

    43. Fuel pumps. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, a reliable and 
independent power source must be provided for each pump used with 
turbine engines which do not have provisions for mechanically driving 
the main pumps. It must be demonstrated that the pump installations 
provide a reliability and durability equivalent to that provided by FAR 
23.991(a).
    44. Fuel strainer or filter. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, 
the following apply:
    (a) There must be a fuel strainer or filter between the tank outlet 
and the fuel metering device of the engine. In addition, the fuel 
strainer or filter must be--
    (1) Between the tank outlet and the engine-driven positive 
displacement pump inlet, if there is an engine-driven positive 
displacement pump;
    (2) Accessible for drainage and cleaning and, for the strainer 
screen, easily removable; and
    (3) Mounted so that its weight is not supported by the connecting 
lines or by the inlet or outlet connections of the strainer or filter 
itself.
    (b) Unless there are means in the fuel system to prevent the 
accumulation of ice on the filter, there must be means to automatically 
maintain the fuel flow if ice-clogging of the filter occurs; and
    (c) The fuel strainer or filter must be of adequate capacity (with 
respect to operating limitations established to insure proper service) 
and of appropriate mesh to insure proper engine operation, with the fuel 
contaminated to a degree (with respect to particle size and density) 
that can be reasonably expected in service. The degree of fuel filtering 
may not be less than that established for the engine type certification.
    45. Lightning strike protection. Protection must be provided against 
the ignition of flammable vapors in the fuel vent system due to 
lightning strikes.

                                 Cooling

    46. Cooling test procedures for turbopropeller powered airplanes. 
(a) Turbopropeller powered airplanes must be shown to comply with the 
requirements of FAR 23.1041 during takeoff, climb en route, and landing 
stages of flight that correspond to the applicable performance 
requirements. The cooling test must be conducted with the airplane in 
the configuration and operating under the conditions that are critical 
relative to cooling during each stage of flight. For the cooling tests a 
temperature is ``stabilized'' when its rate of change is less than 
2 deg. F. per minute.
    (b) Temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which 
entry is made into each stage of flight being investigated unless the 
entry condition is not one during which component and engine fluid 
temperatures would stabilize, in which case, operation through the full 
entry condition must be conducted before entry into the stage of flight 
being investigated in order to allow temperatures to reach their natural 
levels at the time of entry. The takeoff cooling test must be preceded 
by a period during which the powerplant component and engine fluid 
temperatures are stabilized with the engines at ground idle.
    (c) Cooling tests for each stage of flight must be continued until--
    (1) The component and engine fluid temperatures stabilize;
    (2) The stage of flight is completed; or
    (3) An operating limitation is reached.

                            Induction System

    47. Air induction. For turbopropeller powered airplanes--
    (a) There must be means to prevent hazardous quantities of fuel 
leakage or overflow from drains, vents, or other components of flammable 
fluid systems from entering the engine intake system; and
    (b) The air inlet ducts must be located or protected so as to 
minimize the ingestion of foreign matter during takeoff, landing, and 
taxiing.

[[Page 162]]

    48. Induction system icing protection. For turbopropeller powered 
airplanes, each turbine engine must be able to operate throughout its 
flight power range without adverse effect on engine operation or serious 
loss of power or thrust, under the icing conditions specified in 
Appendix C of FAR 25. In addition, there must be means to indicate to 
appropriate flight crewmembers the functioning of the powerplant ice 
protection system.
    49. Turbine engine bleed air systems. Turbine engine bleed air 
systems of turbopropeller powered airplanes must be investigated to 
determine--
    (a) That no hazard to the airplane will result if a duct rupture 
occurs. This condition must consider that a failure of the duct can 
occur anywhere between the engine port and the airplane bleed service; 
and
    (b) That if the bleed air system is used for direct cabin 
pressurization, it is not possible for hazardous contamination of the 
cabin air system to occur in event of lubrication system failure.

                             Exhaust System

    50. Exhaust system drains. Turbopropeller engine exhaust systems 
having low spots or pockets must incorporate drains at such locations. 
These drains must discharge clear of the airplane in normal and ground 
attitudes to prevent the accumulation of fuel after the failure of an 
attempted engine start.

                   Powerplant Controls and Accessories

    51. Engine controls. If throttles or power levers for turbopropeller 
powered airplanes are such that any position of these controls will 
reduce the fuel flow to the engine(s) below that necessary for 
satisfactory and safe idle operation of the engine while the airplane is 
in flight, a means must be provided to prevent inadvertent movement of 
the control into this position. The means provided must incorporate a 
positive lock or stop at this idle position and must require a separate 
and distinct operation by the crew to displace the control from the 
normal engine operating range.
    52. Reverse thrust controls. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, 
the propeller reverse thrust controls must have a means to prevent their 
inadvertent operation. The means must have a positive lock or stop at 
the idle position and must require a separate and distinct operation by 
the crew to displace the control from the flight regime.
    53. Engine ignition systems. Each turbopropeller airplane ignition 
system must be considered an essential electrical load.
    54. Powerplant accessories. The powerplant accessories must meet the 
requirements of FAR 23.1163, and if the continued rotation of any 
accessory remotely driven by the engine is hazardous when malfunctioning 
occurs, there must be means to prevent rotation without interfering with 
the continued operation of the engine.

                       Powerplant Fire Protection 

    55. Fire detector system. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the 
following apply:
    (a) There must be a means that ensures prompt detection of fire in 
the engine compartment. An overtemperature switch in each engine cooling 
air exit is an acceptable method of meeting this requirement.
    (b) Each fire detector must be constructed and installed to 
withstand the vibration, inertia, and other loads to which it may be 
subjected in operation.
    (c) No fire detector may be affected by any oil, water, other 
fluids, or fumes that might be present.
    (d) There must be means to allow the flight crew to check, in 
flight, the functioning of each fire detector electric circuit.
    (e) Wiring and other components of each fire detector system in a 
fire zone must be at least fire resistant.
    56. Fire protection, cowling and nacelle skin. For reciprocating 
engine powered airplanes, the engine cowling must be designed and 
constructed so that no fire originating in the engine compartment can 
enter, either through openings or by burn through, any other region 
where it would create additional hazards.
    57. Flammable fluid fire protection. If flammable fluids or vapors 
might be liberated by the leakage of fluid systems in areas other than 
engine compartments, there must be means to--
    (a) Prevent the ignition of those fluids or vapors by any other 
equipment; or
    (b) Control any fire resulting from that ignition.

                               Equipment 

    58. Powerplant instruments. (a) The following are required for 
turbopropeller airplanes:
    (1) The instruments required by FAR 23.1305 (a)(1) through (4), 
(b)(2) and (4).
    (2) A gas temperature indicator for each engine.
    (3) Free air temperature indicator.
    (4) A fuel flowmeter indicator for each engine.
    (5) Oil pressure warning means for each engine.
    (6) A torque indicator or adequate means for indicating power output 
for each engine.
    (7) Fire warning indicator for each engine.
    (8) A means to indicate when the propeller blade angle is below the 
low-pitch position corresponding to idle operation in flight.
    (9) A means to indicate the functioning of the ice protection system 
for each engine.
    (b) For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the turbopropeller blade 
position indicator must begin indicating when the blade has moved below 
the flight low-pitch position.

[[Page 163]]

    (c) The following instruments are required for reciprocating-engine 
powered airplanes:
    (1) The instruments required by FAR 23.1305.
    (2) A cylinder head temperature indicator for each engine.
    (3) A manifold pressure indicator for each engine.

                         Systems and Equipments 

                                general 

    59. Function and installation. The systems and equipment of the 
airplane must meet the requirements of FAR 23.1301, and the following:
    (a) Each item of additional installed equipment must--
    (1) Be of a kind and design appropriate to its intended function;
    (2) Be labeled as to its identification, function, or operating 
limitations, or any applicable combination of these factors, unless 
misuse or inadvertent actuation cannot create a hazard;
    (3) Be installed according to limitations specified for that 
equipment; and
    (4) Function properly when installed.
    (b) Systems and installations must be designed to safeguard against 
hazards to the aircraft in the event of their malfunction or failure.
    (c) Where an installation, the functioning of which is necessary in 
showing compliance with the applicable requirements, requires a power 
supply, such installation must be considered an essential load on the 
power supply, and the power sources and the distribution system must be 
capable of supplying the following power loads in probable operation 
combinations and for probable durations:
    (1) All essential loads after failure of any prime mover, power 
converter, or energy storage device.
    (2) All essential loads after failure of any one engine on two-
engine airplanes.
    (3) In determining the probable operating combinations and durations 
of essential loads for the power failure conditions described in 
subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, it is permissible to assume 
that the power loads are reduced in accordance with a monitoring 
procedure which is consistent with safety in the types of operations 
authorized.
    60. Ventilation. The ventilation system of the airplane must meet 
the requirements of FAR 23.831, and in addition, for pressurized 
aircraft the ventilating air in flight crew and passenger compartments 
must be free of harmful or hazardous concentrations of gases and vapors 
in normal operation and in the event of reasonably probable failures or 
malfunctioning of the ventilating, heating, pressurization, or other 
systems, and equipment. If accumulation of hazardous quantities of smoke 
in the cockpit area is reasonably probable, smoke evacuation must be 
readily accomplished.

                    Electrical Systems and Equipment 

    61. General. The electrical systems and equipment of the airplane 
must meet the requirements of FAR 23.1351, and the following:
    (a) Electrical system capacity. The required generating capacity, 
and number and kinds of power sources must--
    (1) Be determined by an electrical load analysis, and
    (2) Meet the requirements of FAR 23.1301.
    (b) Generating system. The generating system includes electrical 
power sources, main power busses, transmission cables, and associated 
control, regulation, and protective devices. It must be designed so 
that--
    (1) The system voltage and frequency (as applicable) at the 
terminals of all essential load equipment can be maintained within the 
limits for which the equipment is designed, during any probable 
operating conditions;
    (2) System transients due to switching, fault clearing, or other 
causes do not make essential loads inoperative, and do not cause a smoke 
or fire hazard;
    (3) There are means, accessible in flight to appropriate 
crewmembers, for the individual and collective disconnection of the 
electrical power sources from the system; and
    (4) There are means to indicate to appropriate crewmembers the 
generating system quantities essential for the safe operation of the 
system, including the voltage and current supplied by each generator.
    62. Electrical equipment and installation.  Electrical equipment 
controls, and wiring must be installed so that operation of any one unit 
or system of units will not adversely affect the simultaneous operation 
of to the safe operation.
    63. Distribution system. (a) For the purpose of complying with this 
section, the distribution system includes the distribution busses, their 
associated feeders and each control and protective device.
    (b) Each system must be designed so that essential load circuits can 
be supplied in the event of reasonably probable faults or open circuits, 
including faults in heavy current carrying cables.
    (c) If two independent sources of electrical power for particular 
equipment or systems are required by this regulation, their electrical 
energy supply must be insured by means such as duplicate electrical 
equipment, throwover switching, or multichannel or loop circuits 
separately routed.
    64. Circuit protective devices. The circuit protective devices for 
the electrical circuits of the airplane must meet the requirements of 
FAR 23.1357, and in addition circuits for loads which are essential to 
safe operation

[[Page 164]]

must have individual and exclusive circuit protection.

<R05>
Sec. 23.21  Proof of compliance.

    (a) Each requirement of this subpart must be met at each appropriate 
combination of weight and center of gravity within the range of loading 
conditions for which certification is requested. This must be shown--
    (1) By tests upon an airplane of the type for which certification is

    (i) A speed that is shown to be safe for continued flight (or 
emergency landing, if applicable) under all reasonably expected 
conditions, including turbulence and complete failure of the critical 
engine;

engine is assumed to fail. V<INF>EF</INF> must be selected by the 
applicant but must not be less than 1.05 V<INF>MC</INF> determined under 
Sec. 23.149(b) or, at the option of the applicant, not less than 
V<INF>MCG</INF> determined under Sec. 23.149(f).
    (ii) The takeoff decision speed, V<INF>1</INF>, is the calibrated 
airspeed on the ground at which, as a result of engine failure or other 
reasons, the pilot is assumed to have made a decision to continue or

[[Page 169]]

discontinue the takeoff. The takeoff decision speed, V<INF>1</INF>, must 
be selected by the applicant but must not be less than V<INF>EF</INF> 
plus the speed gained with the critical engine inoperative during the 
time interval between the instant at which the critical engine is failed

airspeed, must be selected by the applicant and must not be less than 
the greatest of the following:

    (iv) The speed that allows attaining the initial climb-out speed, 
V<INF>2</INF>, before reaching a height of 35 feet above the takeoff 
surface in accordance with Sec. 23.57(c)(2).
    (3) For any given set of conditions, such as weight, altitude, 
temperature, and configuration, a single value of V<INF>R</INF> must be 
used to show compliance with both the one-engine-inoperative takeoff and 
all-engines-operating takeoff requirements.
    (4) The takeoff safety speed, V<INF>2</INF>, in terms of calibrated 
airspeed, must be selected by the applicant so as to allow the gradient 
of climb required in Sec. 23.67 (c)(1) and (c)(2) but mut not be less 
than 1.10 V<INF>MC</INF> or less than 1.20 V<INF>S1</INF>.
    (5) The one-engine-inoperative takeoff distance, using a normal 
rotation rate at a speed 5 knots less than V<INF>R</INF>, established in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, must be shown not to 
exceed the corresponding one-engine-inoperative takeoff distance, 
determined in accordance with Sec. 23.57 and Sec. 23.59(a)(1), using the 
established V<INF>R</INF>. The takeoff, otherwise performed in 
accordance with Sec. 23.57, must be continued safely from the point at 
which the airplane is 35 feet above the takeoff surface and at a speed 
not less than the established V<INF>2</INF> minus 5 knots.
    (6) The applicant must show, with all engines operating, that marked 
increases in the scheduled takeoff distances, determined in accordance 
with Sec. 23.59(a)(2), do not result from over-rotation of the airplane 
or out-of-trim conditions.

operating limitation and the information necessary to display the 
gradient must be available to the pilot by an appropriate instrument.

conditions of Sec. 23.77 can be made from the conditions that exist at 
the 50 foot height, at maximum landing weight, or at the maximum landing 
weight for altitude and temperature of Sec. 23.63 (c)(2) or (d)(2), as 
appropriate.
    (e) The brakes must be used so as to not cause excessive wear of 
brakes or tires.
    (f) Retardation means other than wheel brakes may be used if that 
means--
    (1) Is safe and reliable; and
    (2) Is used so that consistent results can be expected in service.
    (g) If any device is used that depends on the operation of any 
engine, and the landing distance would be increased when a landing is 
made with that engine inoperative, the landing distance must be 
determined with that engine inoperative unless the use of other 
compensating means will result in a landing distance not more than that 
with each engine operating.

    (a) With the airplane as nearly as possible in trim at 1.3 
V<INF>S1</INF>, it must be possible, at speeds below the trim speed, to 
pitch the nose downward so that the rate of increase in airspeed allows 
prompt acceleration to the trim speed with--
    (1) Maximum continuous power on each engine;
    (2) Power off; and
    (3) Wing flap and landing gear--
    (i) retracted, and

following maneuvers without requiring the application of single-handed 
control forces exceeding those specified in Sec. 23.143(c). The trimming 
controls must not be adjusted during the maneuvers:
    (1) With the landing gear extended, the flaps retracted, and the 
airplanes as nearly as possible in trim at 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>, extend 
the flaps as rapidly as possible and allow the airspeed to transition 
from 1.4V<INF>S1</INF> to 1.4 V<INF>SO</INF>:
    (i) With power off; and
    (ii) With the power necessary to maintain level flight in the 
initial condition.
    (2) With landing gear and flaps extended, power off, and the 
airplane as nearly as possible in trim at 1.3 V<INF>SO</INF>, quickly 
apply takeoff power and retract the flaps as rapidly as possible to the 
recommended go around setting and allow the airspeed to transition from 
1.3 V<INF>SO</INF> to 1.3 V<INF>S1</INF>. Retract the gear when a 
positive rate of climb is established.
    (3) With landing gear and flaps extended, in level flight, power 
necessary to attain level flight at 1.1 V<INF>SO</INF>, and the airplane 
as nearly as possible in trim,

[[Page 176]]

it must be possible to maintain approximately level flight while 
retracting the flaps as rapidly as possible with simultaneous 
application of not more than maximum continuous power. If gated flat 
positions are provided, the flap retraction may be demonstrated in 
stages with power and trim reset for level flight at 1.1 V<INF>S1</INF>, 
in the initial configuration for each stage--
    (i) From the fully extended position to the most extended gated 
position;
    (ii) Between intermediate gated positions, if applicable; and

airplane as nearly as possible in trim at 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>, apply 
takeoff power rapidly while maintaining the same airspeed.
    (5) With power off, landing gear and flaps extended, and the 
airplane as nearly as possible in trim at V<INF>REF</INF>, obtain and 
maintain airspeeds between 1.1 V<INF>SO</INF>, and either 1.7 
V<INF>SO</INF> or V<INF>FE</INF>, whichever is lower without requiring 
the application of two-handed control forces exceeding those specified 
in Sec. 23.143(c).
    (6) With maximum takeoff power, landing gear retracted, flaps in the 
takeoff position, and the airplane as nearly as possible in trim at 
V<INF>FE</INF> appropriate to the takeoff flap position, retract the 
flaps as rapidly as possible while maintaining constant speed.
    (c) At speeds above V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF>, and up to the 
maximum speed shown under Sec. 23.251, a maneuvering capability of 1.5 g 
must be demonstrated to provide a margin to recover from upset or 
inadvertent speed increase.
    (d) It must be possible, with a pilot control force of not more than 
10 pounds, to maintain a speed of not more than V<INF>REF</INF> during a 
power-off glide with landing gear and wing flaps extended, for any 
weight of the airplane, up to and including the maximum weight.
    (e) By using normal flight and power controls, except as otherwise 
noted in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, it must be 
possible to establish a zero rate of descent at an attitude suitable for 
a controlled landing without exceeding the operational and structural 
limitations of the airplane, as follows:
    (1) For single-engine and multiengine airplanes, without the use of 
the primary longitudinal control system.
    (2) For multiengine airplanes--

would affect both the longitudinal and directional primary control 
system, without the primary longitudinal and directional control system.

holding the wings level within five degrees, to make sudden changes in 
heading safely in both directions. This ability must be shown at 1.4 
V<INF>S1</INF> with heading changes up to 15 degrees, except that the 
heading change at which the rudder force corresponds to the limits 
specified in Sec. 23.143 need not be exceeded, with the--

    (b) For each multiengine airplane, it must be possible to regain 
full control of the airplane without exceeding a bank angle of 45 
degrees, reaching a dangerous attitude or encountering dangerous 
characteristics, in the event of a sudden and complete failure of the 
critical engine, making allowance for a delay of two seconds in the 
initiation of recovery action appropriate to the situation, with the 
airplane initially in trim, in the following condition:
    (1) Maximum continuous power on each engine;
    (2) The wing flaps retracted;
    (3) The landing gear retracted;
    (4) A speed equal to that at which compliance with Sec. 23.69(a) has 
been shown; and

    (5) All propeller controls in the position at which compliance with 
Sec. 23.69(a) has been shown.
    (c) For all airplanes, it must be shown that the airplane is safely 
controllable without the use of the primary lateral control system in 
any all-engine configuration(s) and at any speed or altitude within the 
approved operating envelope. It must also be shown that the airplane's 
flight characteristics are not impaired below a level needed to permit 
continued safe flight and the ability to maintain attitudes suitable for 
a controlled landing without exceeding the operational and structural 
limitations of the airplane. If a single failure of any one connecting 
or transmitting link in the lateral control system would also cause the 
loss of additional control system(s), compliance with the above 
requirement must be shown with those additional systems also assumed to 
be inoperative.

Sec. 23.149  Minimum control speed.

    (a) V<INF>MC</INF> is the calibrated airspeed at which, when the

control of the airplane with that engine still inoperative, and 
thereafter maintain straight flight at the same speed with an angle of 
bank of not more than 5 degrees. The method used to simulate critical 
engine failure must represent the most critical mode of powerplant 
failure expected in service with respect to controllability.
    (b) V<INF>MC</INF> for takeoff must not exceed 1.2 V<INF>S1</INF>, 
where V<INF>S1</INF> is determined at the maximum takeoff weight. 
V<INF>MC</INF> must be determined with the most unfavorable weight and 
center of gravity position and with the airplane airborne and the ground 
effect negligible, for the takeoff configuration(s) with--
    (1) Maximum available takeoff power initially on each engine;
    (2) The airplane trimmed for takeoff;
    (3) Flaps in the takeoff position(s);
    (4) Landing gear retracted; and
    (5) All propeller controls in the recommended takeoff position 
throughout.
    (c) For all airplanes except reciprocating engine-powered airplanes 
of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, the conditions of paragraph (a) 
of this section must also be met for the landing configuration with--
    (1) Maximum available takeoff power initially on each engine;
    (2) The airplane trimmed for an approach, with all engines 
operating, at V<INF>REF</INF>, at an approach gradient equal to the 
steepest used in the landing distance demonstration of Sec. 23.75;
    (3) Flaps in the landing position;
    (4) Landing gear extended; and
    (5) All propeller controls in the position recommended for approach 
with all engines operating.
    (d) A minimum speed to intentionally render the critical engine 
inoperative must be established and designated as the safe, intentional, 
one-engine-inoperative speed, V<INF>SSE</INF>.
    (e) At V<INF>MC</INF>, the rudder pedal force required to maintain 
control must not exceed 150 pounds and it must not be necessary to 
reduce power of the operative engine(s). During the maneuver, the 
airplane must not assume any dangerous attitude and it must be possible 
to prevent a heading change of more than 20 degrees.
    (f) At the option of the applicant, to comply with the requirements 
of Sec. 23.51(c)(1), V<INF>MCG</INF> may be determined. V<INF>MCG</INF> 
is the minimum control speed on the ground, and is the calibrated 
airspeed during the takeoff run at which, when the critical engine is 
suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the 
airplane using the rudder control alone (without the use of nosewheel 
steering), as limited by 150 pounds of force, and using the lateral 
control to the extent of keeping the wings level to enable the takeoff 
to be safely continued. In the determination of V<INF>MCG</INF>, 
assuming that the path of the airplane accelerating with all engines 
operating is along the centerline of the runway, its path from the point 
at which the critical engine is made inoperative to the point at which 
recovery to a direction parallel to the centerline is completed may not 
deviate more than 30 feet laterally from the centerline at any point. 
V<INF>MCG</INF> must be established with--
    (1) The airplane in each takeoff configuration or, at the option of 
the applicant, in the most critical takeoff configuration;

[[Page 178]]

    (2) Maximum available takeoff power on the operating engines;
    (3) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
    (4) The airplane trimmed for takeoff; and
    (5) The most unfavorable weight in the range of takeoff weights.

                                  Trim


<R05>
Sec. 23.161  Trim.

    (a) General. Each airplane must meet the trim requirements of this 
section after being trimmed and without further pressure upon, or 
movement of, the primary controls or their corresponding trim controls 
by the pilot or the automatic pilot. In addition, it must be possible, 
in other conditions of loading, configuration, speed and power to ensure 
that the pilot will not be unduly fatigued or distracted by the need to 
apply residual control forces exceeding those for prolonged application 
of Sec. 23.143(c). This applies in normal operation of the airplane and, 
if applicable, to those conditions associated with the failure of one 
engine for which performance characteristics are established.
    (b) Lateral and directional trim. The airplane must maintain lateral 
and directional trim in level flight with the landing gear and wing 
flaps retracted as follows:
    (1) For normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, at a 
speed of 0.9 V<INF>H</INF>, V<INF>C</INF>, or V<INF>MO</INF>/
M<INF>O</INF>, whichever is lowest; and
    (2) For commuter category airplanes, at all speeds from 1.4 
V<INF>S1</INF> to the lesser of V<INF>H</INF> or V<INF>MO</INF>/
M<INF>MO</INF>.
    (c) Longitudinal trim. The airplane must maintain longitudinal trim 
under each of the following conditions:
    (1) A climb with--
    (i) Takeoff power, landing gear retracted, wing flaps in the takeoff 
position(s), at the speeds used in determining the climb performance 
required by Sec. 23.65; and
    (ii) Maximum continuous power at the speeds and in the configuration 
used in determining the climb performance required by Sec. 23.69(a).
    (2) Level flight at all speeds from the lesser of V<INF>H</INF> and 
either V<INF>NO</INF> or V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF> (as appropriate), 
to 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>, with the landing gear and flaps retracted.
    (3) A descent at V<INF>NO</INF> or V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF>, 
whichever is applicable, with power off and with the landing gear and 
flaps retracted.
    (4) Approach with landing gear extended and with--
    (i) A 3 degree angle of descent, with flaps retracted and at a speed 
of 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>;
    (ii) A 3 degree angle of descent, flaps in the landing position(s) 
at V<INF>REF</INF>; and
    (iii) An approach gradient equal to the steepest used in the landing 
distance demonstrations of Sec. 23.75, flaps in the landing position(s) 
at V<INF>REF</INF>.
    (d) In addition, each multiple airplane must maintain longitudinal 
and directional trim, and the lateral control force must not exceed 5 
pounds at the speed used in complying with Sec. 23.67(a), (b)(2), or 
(c)(3), as appropriate, with--
    (1) The critical engine inoperative, and if applicable, its 
propeller in the minimum drag position;
    (2) The remaining engines at maximum continuous power;
    (3) The landing gear retracted;
    (4) Wing flaps retracted; and
    (5) An angle of bank of not more than five degrees.
    (e) In addition, each commuter category airplane for which, in the 
determination of the takeoff path in accordance with Sec. 23.57, the 
climb in the takeoff configuration at V<INF>2</INF> extends beyond 400 
feet above the takeoff surface, it must be possible to reduce the 
longitudinal and lateral control forces to 10 pounds and 5 pounds, 
respectively, and the directional control force must not exceed 50 
pounds at V<INF>2</INF> with--
    (1) The critical engine inoperative and its propeller in the minimum 
drag position;
    (2) The remaining engine(s) at takeoff power;

    (3) Landing gear retracted;
    (4) Wing flaps in the takeoff position(s); and
    (5) An angle of bank not exceeding 5 degrees.

                                Stability


<R05>
Sec. 23.171  General.

    The airplane must be longitudinally, directionally, and laterally 
stable under Secs. 23.173 through 23.181. In addition, the airplane must 
show suitable stability and control ``feel'' (static stability) in any 
condition normally encountered in service, if flight tests show it is 
necessary for safe operation.


<R05>
Sec. 23.173  Static longitudinal stability.

    Under the conditions specified in Sec. 23.175 and with the airplane 
trimmed as indicated, the characteristics of the elevator control forces 
and the friction within the control system must be as follows:
    (a) A pull must be required to obtain and maintain speeds below the 
specified trim speed and a push required to obtain and maintain speeds 
above the specified trim speed. This must be shown at any speed that can 
be obtained, except that speeds requiring a control force in excess of 
40 pounds or speeds above the maximum allowable speed or below the 
minimum speed for steady unstalled flight, need not be considered.
    (b) The airspeed must return to within the tolerances specified for 
applicable categories of airplanes when the control force is slowly 
released at any speed within the speed range specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section. The applicable tolerances are--
    (1) The airspeed must return to within plus or minus 10 percent of 
the original trim airspeed; and
    (2) For commuter category airplanes, the airspeed must return to 
within plus or minus 7.5 percent of the original trim airspeed for the 
cruising condition specified in Sec. 23.175(b).
    (c) The stick force must vary with speed so that any substantial 
speed change results in a stick force clearly perceptible to the pilot.

<R05>
Sec. 23.175  Demonstration of static longitudinal stability.

    Static longitudinal stability must be shown as follows:
    (a) Climb. The stick force curve must have a stable slope at speeds 
between 85 and 115 percent of the trim speed, with--
    (1) Flaps retracted;
    (2) Landing gear retracted;
    (3) Maximum continuous power; and
    (4) The airplane trimmed at the speed used in determining the climb 
performance required by Sec. 23.69(a).
    (b) Cruise. With flaps and landing gear retracted and the airplane 
in trim with power for level flight at representative cruising speeds at 
high and low altitudes, including speeds up to V<INF>NO</INF> or 
V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF>, as appropriate, except that the speed 
need not exceed V<INF>H</INF>--
    (1) For normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, the stick 
force curve must have a stable slope at all speeds within a range that 
is the greater of 15 percent of the trim speed plus the resulting free 
return speed range, or 40 knots plus the resulting free return speed 
range, above and below the trim speed, except that the slope need not be 
stable--
    (i) At speeds less than 1.3 V<INF>S1</INF>; or
    (ii) For airplanes with V<INF>NE</INF> established under 
Sec. 23.1505(a), at speeds greater than V<INF>NE</INF>; or
    (iii) For airplanes with V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF> established 
under Sec. 23.1505(c), at speeds greater than V<INF>FC</INF>/
M<INF>FC</INF>.
    (2) For commuter category airplanes, the stick force curve must have 
a stable slope at all speeds within a range of 50 knots plus the 
resulting free return speed range, above and below the trim speed, 
except that the slope need not be stable--
    (i) At speeds less than 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>; or
    (ii) At speeds greater than V<INF>FC</INF>/M<INF>FC</INF>; or
    (iii) At speeds that require a stick force greater than 50 pounds.

[[Page 181]]

    (c) Landing. The stick force curve must have a stable slope at 
speeds between 1.1 V<INF>S1</INF> and 1.8 V<INF>S1</INF> with--
    (1) Flaps in the landing position;
    (2) Landing gear extended; and
    (3) The airplane trimmed at--
    (i) V<INF>REF</INF>, or the minimum trim speed if higher, with power 
off; and
    (ii) V<INF>REF</INF> with enough power to maintain a 3 degree angle 
of descent.

<R05>
Sec. 23.177  Static directional and lateral stability.

    (a) The static directional stability, as shown by the tendency to 
recover from a wings level sideslip with the rudder free, must be 
positive for any landing gear and flap position appropriate to the 
takeoff, climb, cruise, approach, and landing configurations. This must 
be shown with symmetrical power up to maximum continuous power, and at 
speeds from 1.2 V<INF>S1</INF> up to the maximum allowable speed for the 
condition being investigated. The angel of sideslip for these tests must 
be appropriate to the type of airplane. At larger angles of sideslip, up 
to that at which full rudder is used or a control force limit in 
Sec. 23.143 is reached, whichever occurs first, and at speeds from 1.2 
V<INF>S1</INF> to V<INF>O</INF>, the rudder pedal force must not 
reverse.
    (b) The static lateral stability, as shown by the tendency to raise 
the low wing in a sideslip, must be positive for all landing gear and 
flap positions. This must be shown with symmetrical power up to 75 
percent of maximum continuous power at speeds above 1.2 V<INF>S1</INF> 
in the take off configuration(s) and at speeds above 1.3 V<INF>S1</INF> 
in other configurations, up to the maximum allowable speed for the 
configuration being investigated, in the takeoff, climb, cruise, and 
approach configurations. For the landing configuration, the power must 
be that necessary to maintain a 3 degree angle of descent in coordinated 
flight. The static lateral stability must not be negative at 1.2 
V<INF>S1</INF> in the takeoff configuration, or at 1.3 V<INF>S1</INF> in 
other configurations. The angle of sideslip for these tests must be 
appropriate to the type of airplane, but in no case may the constant 
heading sideslip angle be less than that obtainable with a 10 degree 
bank, or if less, the maximum bank angle obtainable with full rudder 
deflection or 150 pound rudder force.
    (c) Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to acrobatic 
category airplanes certificated for inverted flight.
    (d) In straight, steady slips at 1.2 V<INF>S1</INF> for any landing 
gear and flap positions, and for any symmetrical power conditions up to 
50 percent of maximum continuous power, the aileron and rudder control 
movements and forces must increase steadily, but not necessarily in 
constant proportion, as the angle of sideslip is increased up to the 
maximum appropriate to the type of airplane. At larger slip angles, up 
to the angle at which full rudder or aileron control is used or a 
control force limit contained in Sec. 23.143 is reached, the aileron and 
rudder control movements and forces must not reverse as the angle of 
sideslip is increased. Rapid entry into, and recovery from, a maximum 
sideslip considered appropriate for the airplane must not result in 
uncontrollable flight characteristics.

<R05>
Sec. 23.181  Dynamic stability.

    (a) Any short period oscillation not including combined lateral-
directional oscillations occurring between the stalling speed and the 
maximum allowable speed appropriate to the configuration of the airplane 
must be heavily damped with the primary controls--
    (1) Free; and
    (2) In a fixed position.
    (b) Any combined lateral-directional oscillations (``Dutch roll'') 
occurring between the stalling speed and the maximum allowable speed 
appropriate to the configuration of the airplane must be damped to 1/10 
amplitude in 7 cycles with the primary controls--
    (1) Free; and
    (2) In a fixed position.
    (c) If it is determined that the function of a stability 
augmentation system, reference Sec. 23.672, is needed to meet the flight 
characteristic requirements of this part, the primary control 
requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of this section are not 
applicable to the tests needed to verify the acceptability of that 
system.

[[Page 182]]

    (d) During the conditions as specified in Sec. 23.175, when the 
longitudinal control force required to maintain speeds differing from 
the trim speed by at least plus and minus 15 percent is suddenly 
released, the response of the airplane must not exhibit any dangerous 
characteristics nor be excessive in relation to the magnitude of the 
control force released. Any long-period oscillation of flight path, 
phugoid oscillation, that results must not be so unstable as to increase 
the pilot's workload or otherwise endanger the airplane.

    (a) It must be possible to produce and to correct roll by unreversed 
use of the rolling control and to produce and to correct yaw by 
unreversed use of the directional control, up to the time the airplane 
stalls.
    (b) The wings level stall characteristics must be demonstrated in 
flight as follows. Starting from a speed at least 10 knots above the 
stall speed, the elevator control must be pulled back so that the rate 
of speed reduction will not exceed one knot per second until a stall is 
produced, as shown by either:
    (1) An uncontrollable downward pitching motion of the airplane;
    (2) A downward pitching motion of the airplane that results from the 
activation of a stall avoidance device (for example, stick pusher); or
    (3) The control reaching the stop.
    (c) Normal use of elevator control for recovery is allowed after the 
downward pitching motion of paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section 
has unmistakably been produced, or after the control has been held 
against the stop for not less than the longer of two seconds or the time 
employed in the minimum steady slight speed determination of Sec. 23.49.
    (d) During the entry into and the recovery from the maneuver, it 
must be possible to prevent more than 15 degrees of roll or yaw by the 
normal use of controls.
    (e) Compliance with the requirements of this section must be shown 
under the following conditions:
    (1) Wing flaps. Retracted, fully extended, and each intermediate 
normal operating position.
    (2) Landing gear. Retracted and extended.
    (3) Cowl flaps. Appropriate to configuration.
    (4) Power:
    (i) Power off; and
    (ii) 75 percent of maximum continuous power. However, if the power-
to-weight ratio at 75 percent of maximum continuous power result in 
extreme nose-up attitudes, the test may be carried out with the power 
required for level flight in the landing configuration at maximum 
landing weight and a speed of 1.4 V<INF>SO</INF>, except that the power 
may not be less than 50 percent of maximum continuous power.
    (5) Trim. The airplane trimmed at a speed as near 1.5 V<INF>S1</INF> 
as practicable.
    (6) Propeller. Full increase r.p.m. position for the power off 
condition.

Sec. 23.203  Turning flight and accelerated turning stalls.

    Turning flight and accelerated turning stalls must be demonstrated 
in tests as follows:
    (a) Establish and maintain a coordinated turn in a 30 degree bank. 
Reduce speed by steadily and progressively tightening the turn with the 
elevator until the airplane is stalled, as defined in Sec. 23.201(b). 
The rate of speed reduction must be constant, and--
    (1) For a turning flight stall, may not exceed one knot per second; 
and
    (2) For an accelerated turning stall, be 3 to 5 knots per second 
with steadily increasing normal acceleration.
    (b) After the airplane has stalled, as defined in Sec. 23.201(b), it 
must be possible to regain wings level flight by normal use of the 
flight controls, but without increasing power and without--
    (1) Excessive loss of altitude;
    (2) Undue pitchup;
    (3) Uncontrollable tendency to spin;
    (4) Exceeding a bank angle of 60 degrees in the original direction 
of the turn or 30 degrees in the opposite direction in the case of 
turning flight stalls;
    (5) Exceeding a bank angle of 90 degrees in the original direction 
of the

[[Page 183]]

turn or 60 degrees in the opposite direction in the case of accelerated 
turning stalls; and
    (6) Exceeding the maximum permissible speed or allowable limit load 
factor.
    (c) Compliance with the requirements of this section must be shown 
under the following conditions:
    (1) Wing flaps: Retracted, fully extended, and each intermediate 
normal operating position;
    (2) Landing gear: Retracted and extended;
    (3) Cowl flaps: Appropriate to configuration;
    (4) Power:
    (i) Power off; and
    (ii) 75 percent of maximum continuous power. However, if the power-
to-weight ratio at 75 percent of maximum continuous power results in 
extreme nose-up attitudes, the test may be carried out with the power 
required for level flight in the landing configuration at maximum 
landing weight and a speed of 1.4 V<INF>SO</INF>, except that the power 
may not be less than 50 percent of maximum continuous power.
    (5) Trim: The airplane trimmed at a speed as near 1.5

Sec. 23.207  Stall warning.

    (a) There must be a clear and distinctive stall warning, with the 
flaps and landing gear in any normal position, in straight and turning 
flight.
    (b) The stall warning may be furnished either through the inherent 
aerodynamic qualities of the airplane or by a device that will give 
clearly distinguishable indications under expected conditions of flight. 
However, a visual stall warning device that requires the attention of 
the crew within the cockpit is not acceptable by itself.
    (c) During the stall tests required by Sec. 23.201(b) and 
Sec. 23.203(a)(1), the stall warning must begin at a speed exceeding the 
stalling speed by a margin of not less than 5 knots and must continue 
until the stall occurs.
    (d) When following procedures furnished in accordance with 
Sec. 23.1585, the stall warning must not occur during a takeoff with all 
engines operating, a takeoff continued with one engine inoperative, or 
during an approach to landing.
    (e) During the stall tests required by Sec. 23.203(a)(2), the stall 
warning must begin sufficiently in advance of the stall for the stall to 
be averted by pilot action taken after the stall warning first occurs.
    (f) For acrobatic category airplanes, an artificial stall warning 
may be mutable, provided that it is armed automatically during takeoff 
and rearmed automatically in the approach configuration.

                                Spinning


<R05>
Sec. 23.221  Spinning.

    (a) Normal category airplanes. A single-engine, normal category 
airplane must be able to recover from a one-turn spin or a three-second 
spin, whichever takes longer, in not more than one additional turn after 
initiation of the first control action for recovery, or demonstrate 
compliance with the optional spin resistant requirements of this 
section.
    (1) The following apply to one turn or three second spins:
    (i) For both the flaps-retracted and flaps-extended conditions, the 
applicable airspeed limit and positive limit maneuvering load factor 
must not be exceeded;
    (ii) No control forces or characteristic encountered during the spin 
or recovery may adversely affect prompt recovery;
    (iii) It must be impossible to obtain unrecoverable spins with any 
use of the flight or engine power controls either at the entry into or 
during the spin; and
    (iv) For the flaps-extended condition, the flaps may be retracted 
during the recovery but not before rotation has ceased.
    (2) At the applicant's option, the airplane may be demonstrated to 
be spin resistant by the following:
    (i) During the stall maneuver contained in Sec. 23.201, the pitch 
control

[[Page 184]]

must be pulled back and held against the stop. Then, using ailerons and 
rudders in the proper direction, it must be possible to maintain wings-
level flight within 15 degrees of bank and to roll the airplane from a 
30 degree bank in one direction to a 30 degree bank in the other 
direction;
    (ii) Reduce the airplane speed using pitch control at a rate of 
approximately one knot per second until the pitch control reaches the 
stop; then, with the pitch control pulled back and held against the 
stop, apply full rudder control in a manner to promote spin entry for a 
period of seven seconds or through a 360 degree heading change, 
whichever occurs first. If the 360 degree heading change is reached 
first, it must have taken no fewer than four seconds. This maneuver must 
be performed first with the ailerons in the neutral position, and then 
with the ailerons deflected opposite the direction of turn in the most 
adverse manner. Power and airplane configuration must be set in 
accordance with Sec. 23.201(e) without change during the maneuver. At 
the end of seven seconds or a 360 degree heading change, the airplane 
must respond immediately and normally to primary flight controls applied 
to regain coordinated, unstalled flight without reversal of control 
effect and without exceeding the temporary control forces specified by 
Sec. 23.143(c); and
    (iii) Compliance with Secs. 23.201 and 23.203 must be demonstrated 
with the airplane in uncoordinated flight, corresponding to one ball 
width displacement on a slip-skid indicator, unless one ball width 
displacement cannot be obtained with full rudder, in which case the 
demonstration must be with full rudder applied.
    (b) Utility category airplanes. A utility category airplane must 
meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 23.807(b)(7) must 
be met if approval for spinning is requested.
    (c) Acrobatic category airplanes. An acrobatic category airplane 
must meet the spin requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and 
Sec. 23.807(b)(6). In addition, the following requirements must be met 
in each configuration for which approval for spinning is requested:
    (1) The airplane must recover from any point in a spin up to and 
including six turns, or any greater number of turns for which 
certification is requested, in not more than one and one-half additional 
turns after initiation of the first control action for recovery. 
However, beyond three turns, the spin may be discontinued if spiral 
characteristics appear.
    (2) The applicable airspeed limits and limit maneuvering load 
factors must not be exceeded. For flaps-extended configurations for 
which approval is requested, the flaps must not be retracted during the 
recovery.
    (3) It must be impossible to obtain unrecoverable spins with any use 
of the flight or engine power controls either at the entry into or 
during the spin.
    (4) There must be no characteristics during the spin (such as 
excessive rates of rotation or extreme oscillatory motion) that might 
prevent a successful recovery due to disorientation or incapacitation of 
the pilot.

    (a) A 90 degree cross-component of wind velocity, demonstrated to be 
safe for taxiing, takeoff, and landing must be established and must be 
not less than 0.2 V<INF>SO</INF>.
    (b) The airplane must be satisfactorily controllable in power-off 
landings at normal landing speed, without using brakes or engine power 
to maintain a straight path until the speed has decreased to at least 50 
percent of the speed at touchdown.

[[Page 185]]

    (c) The airplane must have adequate directional control during 
taxiing.

                    Miscellaneous Flight Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 23.251  Vibration and buffeting.

    There must be no vibration or buffeting severe enough to result in 
structural damage, and each part of the airplane must be free from 
excessive vibration, under any appropriate speed and power conditions up 
to V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF>. In addition, there must be no buffeting 
in any normal flight condition severe enough to interfere with the 
satisfactory control of the airplane or cause excessive fatigue to the 
flight crew. Stall warning buffeting within these limits is allowable.

<R05>
Sec. 23.253  High speed characteristics.

    If a maximum operating speed V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO!</INF>is 
established under Sec. 23.1505(c), the following speed increase and 
recovery characteristics must be met:
    (a) Operating conditions and characteristics likely to cause 
inadvertent speed increases (including upsets in pitch and roll) must be 
simulated with the airplane trimmed at any likely speed up to 
V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF>. These conditions and characteristics 
include gust upsets, inadvertent control movements, low stick force 
gradients in relation to control friction, passenger movement, leveling 
off from climb, and descent from Mach to airspeed limit altitude.
    (b) Allowing for pilot reaction time after occurrence of the 
effective inherent or artificial speed warning specified in 
Sec. 23.1303, it must be shown that the airplane can be recovered to a 
normal attitude and its speed reduced to V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF>, 
without--
    (1) Exceeding V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF>, the maximum speed shown 
under Sec. 23.251, or the structural limitations; or
    (2) Buffeting that would impair the pilot's ability to read the 
instruments or to control the airplane for recovery.
    (c) There may be no control reversal about any axis at any speed up 
to the maximum speed shown under Sec. 23.251. Any reversal of elevator 
control force or tendency of the airplane to pitch, roll, or yaw must be 
mild and readily controllable, using normal piloting techniques.

<R05>
Sec. 23.301  Loads.

    (a) Strength requirements are specified in terms of limit loads (the 
maximum loads to be expected in service) and ultimate loads (limit loads 
multiplied by prescribed factors of safety). Unless otherwise provided, 
prescribed loads are limit loads.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided, the air, ground, and water loads must 
be placed in equilibrium with inertia forces, considering each item of 
mass

[[Page 186]]

in the airplane. These loads must be distributed to conservatively 
approximate or closely represent actual conditions. Methods used to 
determine load intensities and distribution on canard and tandem wing 
configurations must be validated by flight test measurement unless the 
methods used for determining those loading conditions are shown to be 
reliable or conservative on the configuration under consideration.
    (c) If deflections under load would significantly change the 
distribution of external or internal loads, this redistribution must be 
taken into account.
    (d) Simplified structural design criteria may be used if they result 
in design loads not less than those prescribed in Secs. 23.331 through 
23.521. For airplane configurations described in appendix A, Sec. 23.1, 
the design criteria of appendix A of this part are an approved 
equivalent of Secs. 23.321 through 23.459. If appendix A of this part is 
used, the entire appendix must be substituted for the corresponding 
sections of this part.

    (a) The structure must be able to support limit loads without 
detrimental, permanent deformation. At any load up to limit loads, the 
deformation may not interfere with safe operation.
    (b) The structure must be able to support ultimate loads without 
failure for at least three seconds, except local failures or structural 
instabilities between limit and ultimate load are acceptable only if the 
structure can sustain the required ultimate load for at least three 
seconds. However when proof of strength is shown by dynamic tests 
simulating actual load conditions, the three second limit does not 
apply.

analysis may be used only if the structure conforms to those for which 
experience has shown this method to be reliable. In other cases, 
substantiating load tests must be made. Dynamic tests, including 
structural flight tests, are acceptable if the design load conditions 
have been simulated.
    (b) Certain parts of the structure must be tested as specified in 
Subpart D of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 23.321  General.

    (a) Flight load factors represent the ratio of the aerodynamic force 
component (acting normal to the assumed longitudinal axis of the 
airplane) to the weight of the airplane. A positive flight load factor 
is one in which the aerodynamic force acts upward, with respect to the 
airplane.
    (b) Compliance with the flight load requirements of this subpart 
must be shown--
    (1) At each critical altitude within the range in which the airplane 
may be expected to operate;
    (2) At each weight from the design minimum weight to the design 
maximum weight; and
    (3) For each required altitude and weight, for any practicable 
distribution of disposable load within the operating limitations 
specified in Secs. 23.1583 through 23.1589.
    (c) When significant, the effects of compressibility must be taken 
into account.

for in a rational or conservative manner when determining the wing loads 
and linear inertia loads corresponding to any of the symmetrical flight 
conditions specified in Secs. 23.333 through 23.341.
    (b) The incremental horizontal tail loads due to maneuvering and 
gusts must be reacted by the angular inertia of the airplane in a 
rational or conservative manner.
    (c) Mutual influence of the aerodynamic surfaces must be taken into 
account when determining flight loads.

Sec. 23.333  Flight envelope.

    (a) General. Compliance with the strength requirements of this 
subpart must be shown at any combination of airspeed and load factor on 
and within the boundaries of a flight envelope (similar to the one in 
paragraph (d) of this section) that represents the envelope of the 
flight loading conditions specified by the maneuvering and gust criteria 
of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section respectively.
    (b) Maneuvering envelope. Except where limited by maximum (static) 
lift coefficients, the airplane is assumed to be subjected to 
symmetrical maneuvers resulting in the following limit load factors:
    (1) The positive maneuvering load factor specified in Sec. 23.337 at 
speeds up to V<INF>D</INF>;
    (2) The negative maneuvering load factor specified in Sec. 23.337 at 
V<INF>C</INF>; and
    (3) Factors varying linearly with speed from the specified value at 
V<INF>C!</INF>to 0.0 at V<INF>D!</INF>for the normal and commuter 
category, and --1.0 at V<INF>D!</INF>for the acrobatic and utility 
categories.
    (c) Gust envelope. (1) The airplane is assumed to be subjected to 
symmetrical vertical gusts in level flight. The resulting limit load 
factors must correspond to the conditions determined as follows:
    (i) Positive (up) and negative (down) gusts of 50 f.p.s. at V<INF>C
!</INF>must be considered at altitudes between sea level and 20,000 
feet. The gust velocity may be reduced linearly from 50 f.p.s. at 20,000 
feet to 25 f.p.s. at 50,000 feet.
    (ii) Positive and negative gusts of 25 f.p.s. at V<INF>D!</INF>must 
be considered at altitudes between sea level and 20,000 feet. The gust 
velocity may be reduced linearly from 25 f.p.s. at 20,000 feet to 12.5 
f.p.s. at 50,000 feet.
    (iii) In addition, for commuter category airplanes, positive (up) 
and negative (down) rough air gusts of 66 f.p.s. at V<greek-B> must be 
considered at altitudes between sea level and 20,000 feet. The gust 
velocity may be reduced linearly from 66 f.p.s. at 20,000 feet to 38 
f.p.s. at 50,000 feet.
    (2) The following assumptions must be made:
    (i) The shape of the gust is--

Where--

s =Distance penetrated into gust (ft.);
C =Mean geometric chord of wing (ft.); and

following apply:
    (1) Where W/S'=wing loading at the design maximum takeoff weight, 
V<INF>c</INF> (in knots) may not be less than--
    (i) 33 <radical>(W/S) (for normal, utility, and commuter category 
airplanes);
    (ii) 36 <radical>(W/S) (for acrobatic category airplanes).
    (2) For values of W/S more than 20, the multiplying factors may be 
decreased linearly with W/S to a value of 28.6 where W/S =100.
    (3) V<INF>C</INF> need not be more than 0.9 V<INF>H!</INF>at sea 
level.
    (4) At altitudes where an M<INF>D!</INF>is established, a cruising 
speed M<INF>C!</INF>limited by compressibility may be selected.
    (b) Design dive speed V<INF>D</INF>. For V<INF>D</INF>, the 
following apply:
    (1) V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF> may not be less than 1.25 
V<INF>C</INF>/M<INF>C</INF>; and
    (2) With V<INF>C!min,!</INF>the required minimum design cruising 
speed, V<INF>D!</INF>(in knots) may not be less than--
    (i) 1.40 V<INF>c</INF> min (for normal and commuter category 
airplanes);
    (ii) 1.50 V<INF>C!min!</INF>(for utility category airplanes); and
    (iii) 1.55 V<INF>C!min!</INF>(for acrobatic category airplanes).
    (3) For values of W/S more than 20, the multiplying factors in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be decreased linearly with W/S to a 
value of 1.35 where W/S=100.
    (4) Compliance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section need 
not be shown if V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D!</INF>is selected so that the 
minimum speed margin between V<INF>C</INF>/M<INF>C!</INF>and 
V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D!</INF>is the greater of the following:
    (i) The speed increase resulting when, from the initial condition of 
stabilized flight at V<INF>C</INF>/M<INF>C,!</INF>the airplane is 
assumed to be upset, flown for 20 seconds along a flight path 7.5 deg. 
below the initial path, and then pulled up with a load factor of 1.5 
(0.5 g. acceleration increment). At least 75 percent maximum continuous 
power for reciprocating engines, and maximum cruising power for 
turbines, or, if less, the power required for V<INF>C</INF>/M<INF>C</INF> 
for both kinds of engines, must be assumed until the pullup is 
initiated, at which point power reduction and pilot-controlled drag 
devices may be used; and either--

[[Page 189]]

    (ii) Mach 0.05 for normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes 
(at altitudes where M<INF>D</INF> is established); or
    (iii) Mach 0.07 for commuter category airplanes (at altitudes where 
M<INF>D</INF> is established) unless a rational analysis, including the 
effects of automatic systems, is used to determine a lower margin. If a 
rational analysis is used, the minimum speed margin must be enough to 
provide for atmospheric variations (such as horizontal gusts), and the 
penetration of jet streams or cold fronts), instrument errors, airframe 
production variations, and must not be less than Mach 0.05.
    (c) Design maneuvering speed V<INF>A.!</INF>For V<INF>A,!</INF>the 
following applies:
    (1) V<INF>A!</INF>may not be less than V<INF>S</INF><radical>n 
where--
    (i) V<INF>S!</INF>is a computed stalling speed with flaps retracted 
at the design weight, normally based on the maximum airplane normal 
force coefficients, C<INF>NA</INF>; and
    (ii) n is the limit maneuvering load factor used in design
    (2) The value of V<INF>A!</INF>need not exceed the value of V<INF>C
!</INF>used in design.
    (d) Design speed for maximum gust intensity, V<INF>B</INF>. For 
V<INF>B</INF>, the following apply:
    (1) V<INF>B</INF> may not be less than the speed determined by the 
intersection of the line representing the maximum positive lift, 
C<INF>N MAX</INF>, and the line representing the rough air gust velocity 
on the gust V-n diagram, or V<INF>S1 </INF><radical>n<INF>g,</INF> 
whichever is less, where:
    (i) n<INF>g</INF> the positive airplane gust load factor due to 
gust, at speed V<INF>C</INF> (in accordance with Sec. 23.341), and at 
the particular weight under consideration; and
    (ii) V<INF>S1</INF> is the stalling speed with the flaps retracted 
at the particular weight under consideration.
    (2) V<INF>B</INF> need not be greater than V<INF>C</INF>.

    (b) If fuel is carried in the wings, the maximum allowable weight of 
the airplane without any fuel in the wing tank(s) must be established as

condition for showing compliance with the flight load requirements 
prescribed in this part and--
    (1) The structure must be designed to withstand a condition of zero 
fuel in the wing at limit loads corresponding to:
    (i) Ninety percent of the maneuvering load factors defined in

    (2) Positive and negative gust of 25 feet per second acting normal 
to the flight path in level flight.
    (b) V<INF>F</INF> must be assumed to be not less than 1.4 
V<INF>S</INF> or 1.8 V<INF>SF</INF>, whichever is greater, where--
    (1) V<INF>S</INF> is the computed stalling speed with flaps 
retracted at the design weight; and
    (2) V<INF>SF</INF> is the computed stalling speed with flaps fully 
extended at the design weight.
    (3) If an automatic flap load limiting device is used, the airplane 
may be designed for the critical combinations of airspeed and flap 
position allowed by that device.
    (c) In determining external loads on the airplane as a whole, 
thrust, slipstream, and pitching acceleration may be assumed to be zero.

Sec. 23.349  Rolling conditions.

    The wing and wing bracing must be designed for the following loading 
conditions:
    (a) Unsymmetrical wing loads appropriate to the category. Unless the 
following values result in unrealistic loads, the rolling accelerations 
may be obtained by modifying the symmetrical flight conditions in 
Sec. 23.333(d) as follows:
    (1) For the acrobatic category, in conditions A and F, assume that 
100 percent of the semispan wing airload acts on one side of the plane 
of symmetry and 60 percent of this load acts on the other side.
    (2) For normal, utility, and commuter categories, in Condition A, 
assume that 100 percent of the semispan wing airload acts on one side of 
the airplane and 75 percent of this load acts on the other side.
    (b) The loads resulting from the aileron deflections and speeds 
specified in Sec. 23.455, in combination with an airplane load factor of 
at least two thirds of the positive maneuvering load factor used for 
design. Unless the following values result in unrealistic loads, the 
effect of aileron displacement on wing torsion may be accounted for by 
adding the following increment to the basic airfoil moment coefficient 
over the aileron portion of the span in the critical condition 
determined in Sec. 23.333(d):

    <greek-D>c<INF>m</INF>=--0.01<greek-d>

where--

<greek-D>c<INF>m</INF> is the moment coefficient increment; and
<greek-d> is the down aileron deflection in degrees in the critical

    (2) A limit engine torque corresponding to maximum continuous power 
and propeller speed acting simultaneously with the limit loads from 
flight condition A of Sec. 23.333(d); and

specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a limit 
engine torque corresponding to takeoff power and propeller speed, 
multiplied by a factor accounting for propeller control system 
malfunction, including quick feathering, acting simultaneously with lg 
level flight loads. In the absence of a rational analysis, a factor of 
1.6 must be used.
    (b) For turbine engine installations, the engine mounts and 
supporting structure must be designed to withstand each of the 
following:
    (1) A limit engine torque load imposed by sudden engine stoppage due 
to malfunction or structural failure (such as compressor jamming).
    (2) A limit engine torque load imposed by the maximum acceleration 
of the engine.
    (c) The limit engine torque to be considered under paragraph (a) of 
this section must be obtained by multiplying the mean torque by a factor 
of--
    (1) 1.25 for turbopropeller installations;
    (2) 1.33 for engines with five or more cylinders; and

Sec. 23.365  Pressurized cabin loads.

    For each pressurized compartment, the following apply:
    (a) The airplane structure must be strong enough to withstand the 
flight loads combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to 
the maximum relief valve setting.
    (b) The external pressure distribution in flight, and any stress 
concentrations, must be accounted for.
    (c) If landings may be made with the cabin pressurized, landing 
loads must be combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to 
the maximum allowed during landing.
    (d) The airplane structure must be strong enough to withstand the 
pressure differential loads corresponding to the maximum relief valve 
setting multiplied by a factor of 1.33, omitting other loads.
    (e) If a pressurized cabin has two or more compartments separated by 
bulkheads or a floor, the primary structure must be designed for the 
effects of sudden release of pressure in any compartment with external 
doors or windows. This condition must be investigated for the effects of 
failure of the largest opening in the compartment. The effects of 
intercompartmental venting may be considered.

Sec. 23.367  Unsymmetrical loads due to engine failure.

    (a) Turbopropeller airplanes must be designed for the unsymmetrical 
loads resulting from the failure of the critical engine including the 
following conditions in combination with a single malfunction of the 
propeller drag limiting system, considering the probable pilot 
corrective action on the flight controls:
    (1) At speeds between V<INF>MC!</INF>and V<INF>D,!</INF>the loads 
resulting from power failure because of fuel flow interruption are 
considered to be limit loads.
    (2) At speeds between V<INF>MC!</INF>and V<INF>C</INF>, the loads 
resulting from the disconnection of the engine compressor from the 
turbine or from loss of the turbine blades are considered to be ultimate 
loads.
    (3) The time history of the thrust decay and drag buildup occurring 
as a result of the prescribed engine failures must be substantiated by 
test or other data applicable to the particular engine-propeller 
combination.
    (4) The timing and magnitude of the probable pilot corrective action 
must be conservatively estimated, considering the characteristics of the 
particular engine-propeller-airplane combination.
    (b) Pilot corrective action may be assumed to be initiated at the 
time maximum yawing velocity is reached, but not earlier than 2 seconds 
after the engine failure. The magnitude of the corrective action may be 
based on the limit pilot forces specified in Sec. 23.397 except that 
lower forces may be assumed where it is shown by analysis or test that 
these forces can control the yaw and roll resulting from the prescribed 
engine failure conditions.

hinge moments of the movable control surface in the conditions 
prescribed in Secs. 23.391 through 23.459. In addition, the following 
apply:
    (1) The system limit loads need not exceed the higher of the loads 
that can be produced by the pilot and automatic devices operating the 
controls. However, autopilot forces need not be added to pilot forces. 
The system must be designed for the maximum effort of the pilot or 
autopilot, whichever is higher. In addition, if the pilot and the 
autopilot act in opposition, the part of the system between them may be 
designed for the maximum effort of the one that imposes the lesser load. 
Pilot forces used for design need not exceed the maximum forces 
prescribed in Sec. 23.397(b).
    (2) The design must, in any case, provide a rugged system for 
service use, considering jamming, ground gusts, taxiing downwind, 
control inertia, and friction. Compliance with this subparagraph may be 
shown by designing for loads resulting from application of the minimum 
forces prescribed in Sec. 23.397(b).
    (b) A 125 percent factor on computed hinge moments must be used to 
design elevator, aileron, and rudder systems. However, a factor as low 
as 1.0 may be

used if hinge moments are based on accurate flight test data, the exact 
reduction depending upon the accuracy and reliability of the data.

within the ranges specified in paragraph (b) of this section. In 
applying this criterion, the effects of control system boost and servo-

maximum pilot effort. In these cases, the tabs are considered to be 
deflected in the direction that would assist the pilot. These 
deflections must correspond to the maximum degree of ``out of trim'' 
expected at the speed for the condition under consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 23.409  Tabs.

    Control surface tabs must be designed for the most severe 
combination of airspeed and tab deflection likely to be obtained within 
the flight envelope for any usable loading condition.


<R05>
Sec. 23.415  Ground gust conditions.

    (a) The control system must be investigated as follows for control 
surface loads due to ground gusts and taxiing downwind:

[[Page 195]]

    (1) If an investigation of the control system for ground gust loads 
is not required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but the applicant 
elects to design a part of the control system of these loads, these 
loads need only be carried from control surface horns through the 
nearest stops or gust locks and their supporting structures.
    (2) If pilot forces less than the minimums specified in 
Sec. 23.397(b) are used for design, the effects of surface loads due to 
ground gusts and taxiing downwind must be investigated for the entire 
control system according to the formula:

H = K c S q

where--
H = limit hinge moment (ft.-lbs.);
c = mean chord of the control surface aft of the hinge line (ft.);
S = area of control surface aft of the hinge line (sq. ft.);
q = dynamic pressure (p.s.f.) based on a design speed not less than 14.6 
<radical>(W/S) + 14.6 (f.p.s.) where W/S = wing loading at design 
maximum weight, except that the design speed need not exceed 88 
(f.p.s.);
K = limit hinge moment factor for ground gusts derived in paragraph (b) 
of this section. (For ailerons and elevators, a positive value of K 
indicates a moment tending to depress the surface and a negative value 
of K indicates a moment tending to raise the surface).
    (b) The limit hinge moment factor K  for ground gusts must be 
derived as follows:

    (c) At all weights between the empty weight and the maximum weight 
declared for tie-down stated in the appropriate manual, any declared 
tie-down points and surrounding structure, control system, surfaces and 
associated gust locks, must be designed to withstand the limit load 
conditions that exist when the airplane is tied down and that result 
from wind speeds of up to 65 knots horizontally from any direction.

    (a) A horizontal surface balancing load is a load necessary to 
maintain equilibrium in any specified flight condition with no pitching 
acceleration.
    (b) Horizontal balancing surfaces must be designed for the balancing 
loads occurring at any point on the limit maneuvering envelope and in 
the flap conditions specified in Sec. 23.345.

Sec. 23.423  Maneuvering loads.

    Each horizontal surface and its supporting structure, and the main 
wing of a canard or tandem wing configuration, if that surface has pitch 
control, must be designed for the maneuvering loads imposed by the 
following conditions:
    (a) A sudden movement of the pitching control, at the speed 
V<INF>A</INF>, to the maximum aft movement, and the maximum forward 
movement, as limited by the control stops, or pilot effort, whichever is 
critical.
    (b) A sudden aft movement of the pitching control at speeds above 
V<INF>A</INF>, followed by a forward movement of the pitching control 
resulting in the following combinations of normal and angular 
acceleration:

[[Page 196]]

that may occur in a ``checked maneuver'' (a maneuver in which the 
pitching control is suddenly displaced in one direction and then 
suddenly moved in the opposite direction). The deflections and timing of 
the ``checked maneuver'' must avoid exceeding the limit maneuvering load 
factor. The total horizontal surface load for both nose-up and nose-down 
pitching conditions is the sum of the balancing loads at V and the 
specified value of the normal load factor n, plus the maneuvering load 
increment due to the specified value of the angular acceleration.

Sec. 23.425  Gust loads.

    (a) Each horizontal surface, other than a main wing, must be 
designed for loads resulting from--
    (1) Gust velocities specified in Sec. 23.333(c) with flaps 
retracted; and
    (2) Positive and negative gusts of 25 f.p.s. nominal intensity at 
V<INF>F!</INF>corresponding to the flight conditions specified in 
Sec. 23.345(a)(2).
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) When determining the total load on the horizontal surfaces for 
the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the initial 
balancing loads for steady unaccelerated flight at the pertinent design 
speeds V<INF>F,</INF> V<INF>C</INF>, and V<INF>D</INF> must first be 
determined. The incremental load resulting from the gusts must be added 
to the initial balancing load to obtain the total load.
    (d) In the absence of a more rational analysis, the incremental load 
due to the gust must be computed as follows only on airplane 
configurations with aft-mounted, horizontal surfaces, unless its use 
elsewhere is shown to be conservative:

Sec. 23.427  Unsymmetrical loads.

    (a) Horizontal surfaces other than main wing and their supporting 
structure must be designed for unsymmetrical loads arising from yawing 
and slipstream effects, in combination with the loads prescribed for the 
flight conditions set forth in Secs. 23.421 through 23.425.
    (b) In the absence of more rational data for airplanes that are 
conventional in regard to location of engines, wings, horizontal 
surfaces other than main wing, and fuselage shape:
    (1) 100 percent of the maximum loading from the symmetrical flight 
conditions may be assumed on the surface on one side of the plane of 
symmetry; and
    (2) The following percentage of that loading must be applied to the 
opposite side:

    Percent=100-10 (n-1), where n is the specified positive maneuvering 
load factor, but this value may not be more than 80 percent.

    (c) For airplanes that are not conventional (such as airplanes with 
horizontal surfaces other than main wing having appreciable dihedral or 
supported by the vertical tail surfaces) the surfaces and supporting 
structures must be designed for combined vertical and horizontal surface 
loads resulting from each prescribed flight condition taken separately.

    (a) At speeds up to V<INF>A,!</INF>the vertical surfaces must be 
designed to withstand the following conditions. In computing

[[Page 197]]

the loads, the yawing velocity may be assumed to be zero:
    (1) With the airplane in unaccelerated flight at zero yaw, it is 
assumed that the rudder control is suddenly displaced to the maximum 
deflection, as limited by the control stops or by limit pilot forces.
    (2) With the rudder deflected as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, it is assumed that the airplane yaws to the overswing 
sideslip angle. In lieu of a rational analysis, an overswing angle equal 
to 1.5 times the static sideslip angle of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section may be assumed.
    (3) A yaw angle of 15 degrees with the rudder control maintained in 
the neutral position (except as limited by pilot strength).
    (b) For commuter category airplanes, the loads imposed by the 
following additional maneuver must be substantiated at speeds from 
V<INF>A</INF> to V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF>. When computing the tail 
loads--
    (1) The airplane must be yawed to the largest attainable steady 
state sideslip angle, with the rudder at maximum deflection caused by 
any one of the following:
    (i) Control surface stops;
    (ii) Maximum available booster effort;
    (iii) Maximum pilot rudder force as shown below:

    (2) The rudder must be suddenly displaced from the maximum 
deflection to the neutral position.
    (c) The yaw angles specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section may 
be reduced if the yaw angle chosen for a particular speed cannot be 
exceeded in--
    (1) Steady slip conditions;
    (2) Uncoordinated rolls from steep banks; or
    (3) Sudden failure of the critical engine with delayed corrective 
action.

    (b) If outboard fins or winglets extend above and below the 
horizontal surface, the critical vertical surface loading (the load per

<R05>
Sec. 23.471  General.

    The limit ground loads specified in this subpart are considered to 
be external loads and inertia forces that act upon an airplane 
structure. In each specified ground load condition, the external 
reactions must be placed in equilibrium with the linear and angular 
inertia forces in a rational or conservative manner.


<R05>
Sec. 23.473  Ground load conditions and assumptions.

    (a) The ground load requirements of this subpart must be complied 
with at the design maximum weight except that Secs. 23.479, 23.481, and 
23.483 may be complied with at a design landing weight (the highest 
weight for landing conditions at the maximum descent velocity) allowed 
under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) The design landing weight may be as low as--
    (1) 95 percent of the maximum weight if the minimum fuel capacity is 
enough for at least one-half hour of operation at maximum continuous 
power plus a capacity equal to a fuel weight which is the difference 
between the design maximum weight and the design landing weight; or
    (2) The design maximum weight less the weight of 25 percent of the 
total fuel capacity.
    (c) The design landing weight of a multiengine airplane may be less 
than that allowed under paragraph (b) of this section if--
    (1) The airplane meets the one-engine-inoperative climb requirements 
of Sec. 23.67(b)(1) or (c); and
    (2) Compliance is shown with the fuel jettisoning system 
requirements of Sec. 23.1001.
    (d) The selected limit vertical inertia load factor at the center of 
gravity of the airplane for the ground load conditions prescribed in 
this subpart may not be less than that which would be obtained when 
landing with a descent velocity (V), in feet per second, equal to 4.4 
(W/S)\1/4\, except that this velocity need not be more than 10 feet per 
second and may not be less than seven feet per second.
    (e) Wing lift not exceeding two-thirds of the weight of the airplane 
may be assumed to exist throughout the landing impact and to act through 
the center of gravity. The ground reaction load factor may be equal to 
the inertia load factor minus the ratio of the above assumed wing lift 
to the airplane weight.
    (f) If energy absorption tests are made to determine the limit load 
factor corresponding to the required limit descent velocities, these 
tests must be made under Sec. 23.723(a).
    (g) No inertia load factor used for design purposes may be less than 
2.67, nor may the limit ground reaction load factor be less than 2.0 at 
design maximum weight, unless these lower values will not be exceeded in 
taxiing at speeds up to takeoff speed over terrain as rough as that 
expected in service.

Sec. 23.477  Landing gear arrangement.

apply to airplanes with conventional arrangements of main and nose gear, 
or main and tail gear.


<R05>
Sec. 23.479  Level landing conditions.

    (a) For a level landing, the airplane is assumed to be in the 
following attitudes:
    (1) For airplanes with tail wheels, a normal level flight attitude.
    (2) For airplanes with nose wheels, attitudes in which--
    (i) The nose and main wheels contact the ground simultaneously; and
    (ii) The main wheels contact the ground and the nose wheel is just 
clear of the ground.

The attitude used in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section may be used in 
the analysis required under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (b) When investigating landing conditions, the drag components 
simulating the forces required to accelerate the tires and wheels up to 
the landing speed (spin-up) must be properly combined with the 
corresponding instantaneous vertical ground reactions, and the forward-
acting horizontal loads resulting from rapid reduction of the spin-up 
drag loads (spring-back) must be combined with vertical ground reactions 
at the instant of the peak forward load, assuming wing lift and a tire-
sliding coefficient of friction of 0.8. However, the drag loads may not 
be less than 25 percent of the maximum vertical ground reactions 
(neglecting wing lift).
    (c) In the absence of specific tests or a more rational analysis for 
determining the wheel spin-up and spring-back loads for landing 
conditions, the method set forth in appendix D of this part must be 
used. If appendix D of this part is used, the drag components used for 
design must not be less than those given by appendix C of this part.
    (d) For airplanes with tip tanks or large overhung masses (such as 
turbo-propeller or jet engines) supported by the wing, the tip tanks and 
the structure supporting the tanks or overhung masses must be designed 
for the effects of dynamic responses under the level landing conditions 
of either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section. In evaluating 
the effects of dynamic response, an airplane lift equal to the weight of 
the airplane may be assumed.

Sec. 23.481  Tail down landing conditions.

    (a) For a tail down landing, the airplane is assumed to be in the 
following attitudes:
    (1) For airplanes with tail wheels, an attitude in which the main 
and tail wheels contact the ground simultaneously.
    (2) For airplanes with nose wheels, a stalling attitude, or the 
maximum angle allowing ground clearance by each part of the airplane, 
whichever is less.
    (b) For airplanes with either tail or nose wheels, ground reactions 
are assumed to be vertical, with the wheels up to speed before the 
maximum vertical load is attained.


<R05>
Sec. 23.483  One-wheel landing conditions.

    For the one-wheel landing condition, the airplane is assumed to be 
in the level attitude and to contact the ground on one side of the main 
landing gear. In this attitude, the ground reactions must be the same as 
those obtained on that side under Sec. 23.479.


<R05>
Sec. 23.485  Side load conditions.

    (a) For the side load condition, the airplane is assumed to be in a 
level attitude with only the main wheels contacting the ground and with 
the shock absorbers and tires in their static positions.

    The towing loads of this section must be applied to the design of 
tow fittings and their immediate attaching structure.

be considered separately. These loads must be applied at the towing 
fittings and must act parallel to the ground. In addition:
    (1) A vertical load factor equal to 1.0 must be considered acting at 
the center of gravity; and
    (2) The shock struts and tires must be in there static positions.
    (b) For towing points not on the landing gear but near the plane of 
symmetry of the airplane, the drag and side tow load components 
specified for the auxiliary gear apply. For towing points located 
outboard of the main gear, the drag and side tow load components 
specified for the main gear apply. Where the specified angle of swivel 
cannot be reached, the maximum obtainable angle must be used.
    (c) The towing loads specified in paragraph (d) of this section must 
be reacted as follows:
    (1) The side component of the towing load at the main gear must be 
reacted by a side force at the static ground line of the wheel to which

Enough airplane inertia to achieve equilibrium must be applied.
    (ii) The loads must be reacted by airplane inertia.

weight (the maximum weight for water taxi and takeoff run) must be used.

obtain the minimum value of step load factor of 2.33).
    (3) V<INF>SO</INF>=seaplane stalling speed in knots with flaps 
extended in the appropriate landing position and with no slipstream 
effect.
    (4) <greek-b>=Angle of dead rise at the longitudinal station at 
which the load factor is being determined in accordance with figure 1 of

    (5) W=seaplane landing weight in pounds.
    (6) K<INF>1</INF>=empirical hull station weighing factor, in

reference axis, from the center of gravity of the seaplane to the hull 
longitudinal station at which the load factor is being computed to the 
radius of gyration in pitch of the seaplane, the hull reference axis 
being a straight line, in the plane of symmetry, tangential to the keel 
at the main step.
    (c) For a twin float seaplane, because of the effect of flexibility 
of the attachment of the floats to the seaplane, the factor K<INF>1</INF>

computed under Sec. 23.527. In addition--
    (1) For symmetrical step landings, the resultant water load must be 
applied at the keel, through the center of gravity, and must be directed 
perpendicularly to the keel line;
    (2) For symmetrical bow landings, the resultant water load must be 
applied at the keel, one-fifth of the longitudinal distance from the bow 
to the step, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line; and
    (3) For symmetrical stern landings, the resultant water load must be 
applied at the keel, at a point 85 percent of the longitudinal distance 
from the step to the stern post, and must be directed perpendicularly to 
the keel line.
    (b) Unsymmetrical landing for hull and single float seaplanes. 
Unsymmetrical step, bow, and stern landing conditions must be 
investigated. In addition--
    (1) The loading for each condition consists of an upward component 
and a side component equal, respectively, to 0.75 and 0.25 tan <greek-b> 
times the resultant load in the corresponding symmetrical landing 
condition; and
    (2) The point of application and direction of the upward component 
of the load is the same as that in the symmetrical condition, and the 
point of application of the side component is at the same longitudinal 
station as the upward component but is directed inward perpendicularly 
to the plane of symmetry at a point midway between the keel and chine 
lines.
    (c) Unsymmetrical landing; twin float seaplanes. The unsymmetrical 
loading consists of an upward load at the step of each float of 0.75 and 
a side load of 0.25 tan <greek-b> at one float times the step landing 
load reached under Sec. 23.527. The

Sec. 23.533  Hull and main float bottom pressures.

    (a) General. The hull and main float structure, including frames and 
bulkheads, stringers, and bottom plating, must be designed under this 
section.
    (b) Local pressures. For the design of the bottom plating and 
stringers and their attachments to the supporting structure, the 
following pressure distributions must be applied:
    (1) For an unflared bottom, the pressure at the chine is 0.75 times 
the pressure at the keel, and the pressures between the keel and chine 
vary linearly, in accordance with figure 3 of appendix I of this part. 
The pressure at the keel (p.s.i.) is computed as follows:

where--
P<INF>k</INF>=pressure (p.s.i.) at the keel;
C<INF>2</INF>=0.00213;
K<INF>2</INF>=hull station weighing factor, in accordance with figure 2 
    of appendix I of this part;
V<INF>S1</INF>=seaplane stalling speed (knots) at the design water 
    takeoff weight with flaps extended in the appropriate takeoff 
    position; and
<greek-b><INF>K</INF>=angle of dead rise at keel, in accordance with 
    figure 1 of appendix I of this part.

    (2) For a flared bottom, the pressure at the beginning of the flare 
is the same as that for an unflared bottom, and the pressure between the 
chine and the beginning of the flare varies linearly, in accordance with 
figure 3 of appendix I of this part. The pressure distribution is the 
same as that prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for an 
unflared bottom except that the pressure at the chine is computed as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.008

where--
P<INF>ch</INF>=pressure (p.s.i.) at the chine;
C<INF>3</INF>=0.0016;
K<INF>2</INF>=hull station weighing factor, in accordance with figure 2 
    of appendix I of this part;
V<INF>S1</INF>=seaplane stalling speed (knots) at the design water 
    takeoff weight with flaps extended in the appropriate takeoff 
    position; and
<greek-b>=angle of dead rise at appropriate station.

    The area over which these pressures are applied must simulate 
pressures occurring during high localized impacts on the hull or float, 
but need not extend over an area that would induce critical stresses in 
the frames or in the overall structure.
    (c) Distributed pressures. For the design of the frames, keel, and 
chine structure, the following pressure distributions apply:

<greek-b>=angle of dead rise at appropriate station.

    (2) The unsymmetrical pressure distribution consists of the 
pressures prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on one side of 
the hull or main float centerline and one-half of that pressure on the 
other side of the hull or main float centerline, in accordance with 
figure 3 of appendix I of this part.
    (3) These pressures are uniform and must be applied simultaneously 
over the entire hull or main float bottom. The loads obtained must be 
carried into the sidewall structure of the hull proper, but need not be 
transmitted in a fore and aft direction as shear and bending loads.

Sec. 23.535  Auxiliary float loads.

    (a) General. Auxiliary floats and their attachments and supporting 
structures must be designed for the conditions prescribed in this 
section. In the cases specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this 
section, the prescribed water loads may be distributed over the float 
bottom to avoid excessive local loads, using bottom pressures not less 
than those prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (b) Step loading. The resultant water load must be applied in the 
plane of symmetry of the float at a point three-fourths of the distance 
from the bow to the step and must be perpendicular to the keel. The 
resultant limit load is computed as follows, except that the value of L 
need not exceed three times the weight of the displaced water when the 
float is completely submerged:

where--
L=limit load (lbs.);
C<INF>5</INF>=0.0053;

    extended in the appropriate position and with no slipstream effect;
W=seaplane design landing weight in pounds;
<greek-b><INF>s</INF>=angle of dead rise at a station \3/4\ of the 
    distance from the bow to the step, but need not be less than 15 
    degrees; and
r<INF>y</INF>=ratio of the lateral distance between the center of 
    gravity and the plane of symmetry of the float to the radius of 
    gyration in roll.

    (c) Bow loading. The resultant limit load must be applied in the 
plane of symmetry of the float at a point one-fourth of the distance 
from the bow to the step and must be perpendicular to the tangent to the 
keel line at that point. The magnitude of the resultant load is that 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Unsymmetrical step loading. The resultant water load consists of 
a component equal to 0.75 times the load specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section and a side component equal to 0.025 tan <greek-b> times the 
load specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The side load must be 
applied perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry of the float at a point 
midway between the keel and the chine.
    (e) Unsymmetrical bow loading. The resultant water load consists of 
a component equal to 0.75 times the load specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section and a side component equal to 0.25 tan <greek-b> times the 
load specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The side load must be 
applied perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry at a point midway 
between the keel and the chine.
    (f) Immersed float condition. The resultant load must be applied at 
the centroid of the cross section of the

[[Page 208]]

float at a point one-third of the distance from the bow to the step. The 
limit load components are as follows:

C<INF>X</INF>=coefficient of drag force, equal to 0.133;
C<INF>y</INF>=coefficient of side force, equal to 0.106;
K=0.8, except that lower values may be used if it is shown that the 
    floats are incapable of submerging at a speed of 0.8 V<INF>so</INF> 
    in normal operations;
V<INF>so</INF>=seaplane stalling speed (knots) with landing flaps 
    extended in the appropriate position and with no slipstream effect; 
    and
g=acceleration due to gravity (ft/sec<SUP>2</SUP>).
    (g) Float bottom pressures. The float bottom pressures must be 
established under Sec. 23.533, except that the value of K<INF>2</INF> in 
the formulae may be taken as 1.0. The angle of dead rise to be used in 
determining the float bottom pressures is set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section.

Sec. 23.562  Emergency landing dynamic conditions.

    (a) Each seat/restraint system for use in a normal, utility, or 
acrobatic category airplane must be designed to protect each occupant 
during an emergency landing when--
    (1) Proper use is made of seats, safety belts, and shoulder 
harnesses provided for in the design; and
    (2) The occupant is exposed to the loads resulting from the 
conditions prescribed in this section.
    (b) Except for those seat/restraint systems that are required to 
meet paragraph (d) of this section, each seat/restraint system for crew 
or passenger occupancy in a normal, utility, or acrobatic category 
airplane, must successfully complete dynamic tests or be demonstrated by 
rational analysis supported by dynamic tests, in accordance with each of 
the following conditions. These tests must be conducted with an occupant 
simulated by an anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD) defined by 49 CFR Part 
572, Subpart B, or an FAA-approved equivalent, with a nominal weight of 
170 pounds and seated in the normal upright position.
    (1) For the first test, the change in velocity may not be less than 
31 feet per second. The seat/restraint system must be oriented in its 
nominal position with respect to the airplane and with the horizontal 
plane of the airplane pitched up 60 degrees, with no yaw, relative to 
the impact vector. For seat/restraint systems to be installed in the 
first row of the airplane, peak deceleration must occur in not more than 
0.05 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 19g. For all other 
seat/restraint systems, peak deceleration must occur in not more than 
0.06 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 15g.
    (2) For the second test, the change in velocity may not be less than 
42 feet per second. The seat/restraint system must be oriented in its 
nominal position with respect to the airplane and with the vertical 
plane of the airplane yawed 10 degrees, with no pitch, relative to the 
impact vector in a direction that results in the greatest load on the 
shoulder harness. For seat/restraint systems to be installed in the 
first row of the airplane, peak deceleration must occur in not more than 
0.05 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 26g. For all other 
seat/restraint systems, peak deceleration must occur in not more than 
0.06 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 21g.
    (3) To account for floor warpage, the floor rails or attachment 
devices used to attach the seat/restraint system to the airframe 
structure must be preloaded to misalign with respect to each other by at 
least 10 degrees vertically (i.e., pitch out of parallel) and one of the 
rails or attachment devices must be preloaded to misalign by 10 degrees 
in roll prior to conducting the test defined by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (c) Compliance with the following requirements must be shown during 
the dynamic tests conducted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section:
    (1) The seat/restraint system must restrain the ATD although seat/
restraint system components may experience deformation, elongation, 
displacement, or crushing intended as part of the design.
    (2) The attachment between the seat/restraint system and the test 
fixture must remain intact, although the seat structure may have 
deformed.
    (3) Each shoulder harness strap must remain on the ATD's shoulder 
during the impact.
    (4) The safety belt must remain on the ATD's pelvis during the 
impact.
    (5) The results of the dynamic tests must show that the occupant is 
protected from serious head injury.

[[Page 210]]

    (i) When contact with adjacent seats, structure, or other items in 
the cabin can occur, protection must be provided so that the head impact 
does not exceed a head injury criteria (HIC) of 1,000.
    (ii) The value of HIC is defined as--
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.012
    
Where: t<INF>1</INF> is the initial integration time, expressed in 
          seconds, t<INF>2</INF> is the final integration time, 
          expressed in seconds, (t<INF>2-</INF>t<INF>1</INF>) is the 
          time duration of the major head impact, expressed in seconds, 
          and a(t) is the resultant deceleration at the center of 
          gravity of the head form expressed as a multiple of g (units 
          of gravity).

    (iii) Compliance with the HIC limit must be demonstrated by 
measuring the head impact during dynamic testing as prescribed in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section or by a separate showing of 
compliance with the head injury criteria using test or analysis 
procedures.
    (6) Loads in individual shoulder harness straps may not exceed 1,750 
pounds. If dual straps are used for retaining the upper torso, the total 
strap loads may not exceed 2,000 pounds.
    (7) The compression load measured between the pelvis and the lumbar 
spine of the ATD may not exceed 1,500 pounds.
    (d) For all single-engine airplanes with a V<INF>SO</INF> of more 
than 61 knots at maximum weight, and those multiengine airplanes of 
6,000 pounds or less maximum weight with a V<INF>SO</INF> of more than 
61 knots at maximum weight that do not comply with Sec. 23.67(a)(1);
    (1) The ultimate load factors of Sec. 23.561(b) must be increased by 
multiplying the load factors by the square of the ratio of the increased 
stall speed to 61 knots. The increased ultimate load factors need not 
exceed the values reached at a V<INF>S0</INF> of 79 knots. The upward 
ultimate load factor for acrobatic category airplanes need not exceed 
5.0g.
    (2) The seat/restraint system test required by paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section must be conducted in accordance with the following 
criteria:
    (i) The change in velocity may not be less than 31 feet per second.
    (ii)(A) The peak deceleration (g<INF>p</INF>) of 19g and 15g must be 
increased and multiplied by the square of the ratio of the increased 
stall speed to 61 knots:

g<INF>p</INF>=19.0 (V<INF>S0</INF>/61)<SUP>2</SUP> or g<INF>p</INF>=15.0 
          (V<INF>S0</INF>/61)<SUP>2</SUP>

    (B) The peak deceleration need not exceed the value reached at a 
V<INF>S0</INF> of 79 knots.
    (iii) The peak deceleration must occur in not more than time 
(t<INF>r</INF>), which must be computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.013

where--

g<INF>p</INF>=The peak deceleration calculated in accordance with 
          paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section
t<INF>r</INF>=The rise time (in seconds) to the peak deceleration.
    (e) An alternate approach that achieves an equivalent, or greater, 
level of occupant protection to that required by this section may be 
used if substantiated on a rational basis.

Sec. 23.571  Metallic pressurized cabin structures.

    For normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, the strength, 
detail design, and fabrication of the metallic structure of the pressure 
cabin must be evaluated under one of the following:
    (a) A fatigue strength investigation in which the structure is shown 
by tests, or by analysis supported by test evidence, to be able to 
withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in service; 
or
    (b) A fail safe strength investigation, in which it is shown by 
analysis, tests, or both that catastrophic failure of the structure is 
not probable after fatigue failure, or obvious partial failure, of a 
principal structural element, and that the remaining structures are able 
to withstand a static ultimate load factor of 75 percent of the limit 
load factor at V<INF>C</INF>, considering the combined effects of normal 
operating pressures, expected

structure whose failure would be catastrophic must be evaluated under 
one of the following unless it is shown that the structure, operating 
stress level, materials and expected uses are comparable, from a fatigue 
standpoint, to a similar design that has had extensive satisfactory 
service experience:
    (1) A fatigue strength investigation in which the structure is shown 
by tests, or by analysis supported by test evidence, to be able to 
withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in service; 
or
    (2) A fail-safe strength investigation in which it is shown by 
analysis, tests, or both, that catastrophic failure of the structure is 
not probable after fatigue failure, or obvious partial failure, of a 
principal structural element, and that the remaining structure is able 
to withstand a static ultimate load factor of 75 percent of the critical 
limit load factor at V<INF>c</INF>. These loads must be multiplied by a 
factor of 1.15 unless the dynamic effects of failure under static load 
are otherwise considered.

    (b) Each evaluation required by this section must--
    (1) Include typical loading spectra (e.g. taxi, ground-air-ground 
cycles, maneuver, gust);
    (2) Account for any significant effects due to the mutual influence 
of aerodynamic surfaces; and
    (3) Consider any significant effects from propeller slipstream 
loading, and buffet from vortex impingements.

<R05>
Sec. 23.573  Damage tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure.

    (a) Composite airframe structure. Composite airframe structure must 
be evaluated under this paragraph instead of Secs. 23.571 and 23.572. 
The applicant must evaluate the composite airframe structure, the 
failure of which would result in catastrophic loss of the airplane, in 
each wing (including canards, tandem wings, and winglets), empennage, 
their carrythrough and attaching structure, moveable control surfaces 
and their attaching structure fuselage, and pressure cabin using the 
damage-tolerance criteria prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) 
of this section unless shown to be impractical. If the applicant 
establishes that damage-tolerance criteria is impractical for a 
particular structure, the structure must be evaluated in accordance with 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(6) of this section. Where bonded joints are 
used, the structure must also be evaluated in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section. The effects of material variability and 
environmental conditions on the strength and durability properties of 
the composite materials must be accounted for in the evaluations 
required by this section.
    (1) It must be demonstrated by tests, or by analysis supported by 
tests, that the structure is capable of carrying ultimate load with 
damage up to the threshold of detectability considering the inspection 
procedures employed.
    (2) The growth rate or no-growth of damage that may occur from 
fatigue, corrosion, manufacturing flaws or impact damage, under repeated 
loads expected in service, must be established by tests or analysis 
supported by tests.
    (3) The structure must be shown by residual strength tests, or 
analysis supported by residual strength tests, to be able to withstand 
critical limit flight loads, considered as ultimate loads,

[[Page 212]]

with the extent of detectable damage consistent with the results of the 
damage tolerance evaluations. For pressurized cabins, the following 
loads must be withstood:
    (i) Critical limit flight loads with the combined effects of normal 
operating pressure and expected external aerodynamic pressures.
    (ii) The expected external aerodynamic pressures in 1g flight 
combined with a cabin differential pressure equal to 1.1 times the 
normal operating differential pressure without any other load.
    (4) The damage growth, between initial detectability and the value 
selected for residual strength demonstrations, factored to obtain 
inspection intervals, must allow development of an inspection program 
suitable for application by operation and maintenance personnel.
    (5) For any bonded joint, the failure of which would result in 
catastrophic loss of the airplane, the limit load capacity must be 
substantiated by one of the following methods--
    (i) The maximum disbonds of each bonded joint consistent with the 
capability to withstand the loads in paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
must be determined by analysis, tests, or both. Disbonds of each bonded 
joint greater than this must be prevented by design features; or
    (ii) Proof testing must be conducted on each production article that 
will apply the critical limit design load to each critical bonded joint; 
or
    (iii) Repeatable and reliable non-destructive inspection techniques 
must be established that ensure the strength of each joint.
    (6) Structural components for which the damage tolerance method is 
shown to be impractical must be shown by component fatigue tests, or 
analysis supported by tests, to be able to withstand the repeated loads 
of variable magnitude expected in service. Sufficient component, 
subcomponent, element, or coupon tests must be done to establish the 
fatigue scatter factor and the environmental effects. Damage up to the 
threshold of detectability and ultimate load residual strength 
capability must be considered in the demonstration.
    (b) Metallic airframe structure. If the applicant elects to use 
Sec. 23.571(a)(3) or Sec. 23.572(a)(3), then the damage tolerance 
evaluation must include a determination of the probable locations and 
modes of damage due to fatigue, corrosion, or accidental damage. The 
determination must be by analysis supported by test evidence and, if 
available, service experience. Damage at multiple sites due to fatigue 
must be included where the design is such that this type of damage can 
be expected to occur. The evaluation must incorporate repeated load and 
static analyses supported by test evidence. The extent of damage for 
residual strength evaluation at any time within the operational life of 
the airplane must be consistent with the initial detectability and 
subsequent growth under repeated loads. The residual strength evaluation 
must show that the remaining structure is able to withstand critical 
limit flight loads, considered as ultimate, with the extent of 
detectable damage consistent with the results of the damage tolerance 
evaluations. For pressurized cabins, the following load must be 
withstood:
    (1) The normal operating differential pressure combined with the 
expected external aerodynamic pressures applied simultaneously with the 
flight loading conditions specified in this part, and
    (2) The expected external aerodynamic pressures in 1g flight 
combined with a cabin differential pressure equal to 1.1 times the 
normal operating differential pressure without any other load.

fatigue, corrosion, defects, or damage will be avoided throughout the 
operational life of the airplane. This evaluation must be conducted in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 23.573, except as specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section, for each

part of the structure that could contribute to a catastrophic failure.
    (b) Fatigue (safe-life) evaluation. Compliance with the damage 
tolerance requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not required 
if the applicant establishes that the application of those requirements 
is impractical for a particular structure. This structure must be shown, 
by analysis supported by test evidence, to be able to withstand the 
repeated loads of variable magnitude expected during its service life 
without detectable cracks. Appropriate safe-life scatter factors must be 
applied.

material

[[Page 214]]

meeting specifications to establish design values on a statistical 
basis.
    (b) Design values must be chosen to minimize the probability of 
structural failure due to material variability. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section, compliance with this paragraph must be 
shown by selecting design values that ensure material strength with the 
following probability:
    (1) Where applied loads are eventually distributed through a single 
member within an assembly, the failure of which would result in loss of 
structural integrity of the component; 99 percent probability with 95 
percent confidence.
    (2) For redundant structure, in which the failure of individual 
elements would result in applied loads being safely distributed to other 
load carrying members; 90 percent probability with 95 percent 
confidence.
    (c) The effects of temperature on allowable stresses used for design 
in an essential component or structure must be considered where thermal 
effects are significant under normal operating conditions.
    (d) The design of the structure must minimize the probability of 
catastrophic fatigue failure, particularly at points of stress 
concentration.
    (e) Design values greater than the guaranteed minimums required by 
this section may be used where only guaranteed minimum values are 
normally allowed if a ``premium selection'' of the material is made in 
which a specimen of each individual item is tested before use to 
determine that the actual strength properties of that particular item 
will equal or exceed those used in design.

paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section--
    (1) Need not exceed 1.25 with respect to bearing stresses regardless 
of the method of inspection used; and

percent visual inspection and 100 percent approved non-destructive 
inspection. When an approved quality control procedure is established 
and an acceptable statistical analysis supports reduction, non-
destructive inspection may be reduced from 100 percent, and applied on a 
sampling basis.
    (2) For each critical casting with a casting factor less than 1.50, 
three sample castings must be static tested and shown to meet--
    (i) The strength requirements of Sec. 23.305 at an ultimate load 
corresponding to a casting factor of 1.25; and

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The percentage of castings inspected by nonvisual methods may be 
reduced below that specified in subparagraph (d)(1) of this section when 
an approved quality control procedure is established.
    (3) For castings procured to a specification that guarantees the 
mechanical properties of the material in the casting and provides for 
demonstration of these properties by test of coupons cut from the 
castings on a sampling basis--
    (i) A casting factor of 1.0 may be used; and
    (ii) The castings must be inspected as provided in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section for casting factors of ``1.25 through 1.50'' and tested

Secs. 23.571 and 23.572, the airplane must be shown by analysis to be 
free from flutter up to V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF> after fatigue 
failure, or obvious partial failure, of a principal structural element.
    (h) For airplanes showing compliance with the damage tolerance 
criteria of Sec. 23.573, the airplane must be shown by analysis to be

indicator must be clearly marked with a position or range within which 
it has been demonstrated that take-off is safe for all center of gravity 
positions and each flap position approved for takeoff.

or
    (2) For multiengine airplanes, the longitudinal and directional 
trimming devices.
    (c) Tab controls must be irreversible unless the tab is properly

and that the pilot can perform all maneuvers and operations necessary to 
effect a safe landing following any probable powered trim system runaway 
that reasonably might be expected in service, allowing for appropriate 
time delay after pilot recognition of the trim system runaway. The 
demonstration must be conducted at critical airplane weights and center

    (a) Each cable, cable fitting, turnbuckle, splice, and pulley used 
must meet approved specifications. In addition--
    (1) No cable smaller than \1/8\ inch diameter may be used in primary 
control systems;
    (2) Each cable system must be designed so that there will be no 
hazardous change in cable tension throughout the range of travel under 
operating conditions and temperature variations; and
    (3) There must be means for visual inspection at each fairlead, 
pulley, terminal, and turnbuckle.
    (b) Each kind and size of pulley must correspond to the cable with 
which it is used. Each pulley must have closely fitted guards to prevent 
the cables from being misplaced or fouled, even when slack. Each pulley 
must lie in the plane passing through the cable so that the cable does 
not rub against the pulley flange.
    (c) Fairleads must be installed so that they do not cause a change 
in cable direction of more than three degrees.
    (d) Clevis pins subject to load or motion and retained only by 
cotter pins may not be used in the control system.
    (e) Turnbuckles must be attached to parts having angular motion in a 
manner that will positively prevent binding throughout the range of 
travel.

[[Page 220]]

    (f) Tab control cables are not part of the primary control system 
and may be less than \1/8\ inch diameter in airplanes that are safely 
controllable with the tabs in the most adverse positions.

Sec. 23.691  Artificial stall barrier system.

    If the function of an artificial stall barrier, for example, stick 
pusher, is used to show compliance with Sec. 23.201(c), the system must 
comply with the following:
    (a) With the system adjusted for operation, the plus and minus 
airspeeds at which downward pitching control will be provided must be 
established.
    (b) Considering the plus and minus airspeed tolerances established 
by paragraph (a) of this section, an airspeed must be selected for the 
activation of the downward pitching control that provides a safe margin 
above any airspeed at which any unsatisfactory stall characteristics 
occur.
    (c) In addition to the stall warning required Sec. 23.07, a warning 
that is clearly distinguishable to the pilot under all expected flight 
conditions without requiring the pilot's attention, must be provided for 
faults that would prevent the system from providing the required 
pitching motion.
    (d) Each system must be designed so that the artificial stall 
barrier can be quickly and positively disengaged by the pilots to 
prevent unwanted downward pitching of the airplane by a quick release 
(emergency) control that meets the requirements of Sec. 23.1329(b).
    (e) A preflight check of the complete system must be established and 
the procedure for this check made available in the Airplane Flight 
Manual (AFM). Preflight checks that are critical to the safety of the 
airplane must be included in the limitations section of the AFM.
    (f) For those airplanes whose design includes an autopilot system:
    (1) A quick release (emergency) control installed in accordance with 
Sec. 23.1329(b) may be used to meet the requirements of paragraph (d), 
of this section, and
    (2) The pitch servo for that system may be used to provide the stall 
downward pitching motion.
    (g) In showing compliance with Sec. 23.1309, the system must be 
evaluated to determine the effect that any announced or unannounced 
failure may have on the continued safe flight and landing of the 
airplane or the ability of the crew to cope with any adverse conditions 
that may result from such failures. This evaluation must consider the 
hazards that would result from the airplane's flight characteristics if 
the system was not provided, and the hazard that may result from 
unwanted downward pitching motion, which could result from a failure at 
airspeeds above the selected stall speed.

Sec. 23.693  Joints.

    Control system joints (in push-pull systems) that are subject to 
angular motion, except those in ball and roller bearing systems, must 
have a special factor of safety of not less than 3.33 with respect to 
the ultimate bearing strength of the softest material used as a bearing. 
This factor may be reduced to 2.0 for joints in cable control systems. 
For ball or roller bearings, the approved ratings may not be exceeded.


<R05>
Sec. 23.697  Wing flap controls.

    (a) Each wing flap control must be designed so that, when the flap 
has been placed in any position upon which compliance with the 
performance requirements of this part is based, the flap will not move 
from that position unless the control is adjusted or is moved by the 
automatic operation of a flap load limiting device.
    (b) The rate of movement of the flaps in response to the operation 
of the pilot's control or automatic device must give satisfactory flight 
and performance characteristics under steady or changing conditions of 
airspeed, engine power, and attitude.
    (c) If compliance with Sec. 23.145(b)(3) necessitates wing flap 
retraction to positions that are not fully retracted, the wing flap 
control lever settings corresponding to those positions must be 
positively located such that a definite change of direction of movement 
of the

[[Page 221]]

lever is necessary to select settings beyond those settings.

<R05>
Sec. 23.699  Wing flap position indicator.

    There must be a wing flap position indicator for--
    (a) Flap installations with only the retracted and fully extended 
position, unless--
    (1) A direct operating mechanism provides a sense of ``feel'' and 
position (such as when a mechanical linkage is employed); or
    (2) The flap position is readily determined without seriously 
detracting from other piloting duties under any flight condition, day or 
night; and
    (b) Flap installation with intermediate flap positions if--
    (1) Any flap position other than retracted or fully extended is used 
to show compliance with the performance requirements of this part; and
    (2) The flap installation does not meet the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 23.701  Flap interconnection.

    (a) The main wing flaps and related movable surfaces as a system 
must--
    (1) Be synchronized by a mechanical interconnection between the 
movable flap surfaces that is independent of the flap drive system; or 
by an approved equivalent means; or
    (2) Be designed so that the occurrence of any failure of the flap 
system that would result in an unsafe flight characteristic of the 
airplane is extremely improbable; or
    (b) The airplane must be shown to have safe flight characteristics 
with any combination of extreme positions of individual movable surfaces 
(mechanically interconnected surfaces are to be considered as a single 
surface).
    (c) If an interconnection is used in multiengine airplanes, it must 
be designed to account for the unsummetrical loads resulting from flight 
with the engines on one side of the plane of symmetry inoperative and 
the remaining engines at takeoff power. For single-engine airplanes, and 
multiengine airplanes with no slipstream effects on the flaps, it may be 
assumed that 100 percent of the critical air load acts on one side and 
70 percent on the other.

Sec. 23.703  Takeoff warning system.

    For commuter category airplanes, unless it can be shown that a lift 
or longitudinal trim device that affects the takeoff performance of the 
aircraft would not give an unsafe takeoff configuration when selection 
out of an approved takeoff position, a takeoff warning system must be 
installed and meet the following requirements:
    (a) The system must provide to the pilots an aural warning that is 
automatically activated during the initial portion of the takeoff role 
if the airplane is in a configuration that would not allow a safe 
takeoff. The warning must continue until--
    (1) The configuration is changed to allow safe takeoff, or
    (2) Action is taken by the pilot to abandon the takeoff roll.
    (b) The means used to activate the system must function properly for 
all authorized takeoff power settings and procedures and throughout the 
ranges of takeoff weights, altitudes, and temperatures for which 
certification is requested.

<R05>
Sec. 23.721  General.

    For commuter category airplanes that have a passenger seating 
configuration, excluding pilot seats, of 10 or more, the following 
general requirements for the landing gear apply:
    (a) The main landing-gear system must be designed so that if it 
fails due to overloads during takeoff and landing (assuming the 
overloads to act in the upward and aft directions), the failure mode is 
not likely to cause the spillage of enough fuel from any part of the 
fuel system to consitute a fire hazard.
    (b) Each airplane must be designed so that, with the airplane under 
control, it can be landed on a paved runway with any one or more 
landing-gear legs

[[Page 222]]

not extended without sustaining a structural component failure that is 
likely to cause the spillage of enough fuel to consitute a fire hazard.
    (c) Compliance with the provisions of this section may be shown by 
analysis or tests, or both.

    (a) It must be shown that the limit load factors selected for design 
in accordance with Sec. 23.473 for takeoff and landing weights, 
respectively, will not be exceeded. This must be shown by energy 
absorption tests except that analysis based on tests conducted on a 
landing gear system with identical energy absorption characteristics may 
be used for increases in previously approved takeoff and landing 
weights.
    (b) The landing gear may not fail, but may yield, in a test showing 
its reserve energy absorption capacity, simulating a descent velocity of 
1.2 times the limit descent velocity, assuming wing lift equal to the 
weight of the airplane.

Sec. 23.725  Limit drop tests.

    (a) If compliance with Sec. 23.723(a) is shown by free drop tests, 
these tests must be made on the complete airplane, or on units 
consisting of wheel, tire, and shock absorber, in their proper relation, 
from free drop heights not less than those determined by the following 
formula:

                 h (inches) = 3.6 (W/S) \<INF>1/2</INF>\

However, the free drop height may not be less than 9.2 inches and need 
not be more than 18.7 inches.
    (b) If the effect of wing lift is provided for in free drop tests, 
the landing gear must be dropped with an effective weight equal to

where--

W<INF>e!</INF>=the effective weight to be used in the drop test (lbs.);
h = specified free drop height (inches);
d = deflection under impact of the tire (at the approved inflation 
          pressure) plus the vertical component of the axle travel 
          relative to the drop mass (inches);
W=W<INF>M</INF> for main gear units (lbs), equal to the static weight on 
          that unit with the airplane in the level attitude (with the 
          nose wheel clear in the case of nose wheel type airplanes);
W=W<INF>T</INF> for tail gear units (lbs.), equal to the static weight 
          on the tail unit with the airplane in the tail-down attitude;

          center of gravity and exerts a force of 1.0 g downward and 
          0.33 g forward; and
L= the ratio of the assumed wing lift to the airplane weight, but not 
          more than 0.667.

    (c) The limit inertia load factor must be determined in a rational 
or conservative manner, during the drop test, using a landing gear unit 
attitude, and applied drag loads, that represent the landing conditions.
    (d) The value of d used in the computation of W<INF>e</INF> in 
paragraph (b) of this section may not exceed the value actually obtained

<R05>
Sec. 23.729  Landing gear extension and retraction system.

    (a) General. For airplanes with retractable landing gear, the 
following apply:
    (1) Each landing gear retracting mechanism and its supporting 
structure must be designed for maximum flight load factors with the gear 
retracted and must be designed for the combination of friction, inertia, 
brake torque, and air loads, occurring during retraction at any airspeed 
up to 1.6 V<INF>S1</INF> with flaps retracted, and for any load factor 
up to those specified in Sec. 23.345 for the flaps-extended condition.
    (2) The landing gear and retracting mechanism, including the wheel 
well doors, must withstand flight loads, including loads resulting from 
all yawing conditions specified in Sec. 23.351, with the landing gear 
extended at any speed up to at least 1.6 V<INF>S1</INF> with the flaps 
retracted.
    (b) Landing gear lock. There must be positive means (other than the 
use of hydraulic pressure) to keep the landing gear extended.
    (c) Emergency operation. For a landplane having retractable landing 
gear that cannot be extended manually, there must be means to extend the 
landing gear in the event of either--
    (1) Any reasonably probable failure in the normal landing gear 
operation system; or
    (2) Any reasonably probable failure in a power source that would 
prevent the operation of the normal landing gear operation system.
    (d) Operation test. The proper functioning of the retracting 
mechanism must be shown by operation tests.
    (e) Position indicator. If a retractable landing gear is used, there 
must be a landing gear position indicator (as well as necessary switches 
to actuate the indicator) or other means to inform the pilot that each 
gear is secured in the extended (or retracted) position. If switches are 
used, they must be located and coupled to the landing gear mechanical 
system in a manner that prevents an erroneous indication of either 
``down and locked'' if each gear is not in the fully extended position, 
or ``up and locked'' if each landing gear is not in the fully retracted 
position.
    (f) Landing gear warning. For landplanes, the following aural or 
equally effective landing gear warning devices must be provided:
    (1) A device that functions continuously when one or more throttles 
are closed beyond the power settings normally used for landing approach 
if the landing gear is not fully extended and locked. A throttle stop 
may not be used in place of an aural device. If there is a manual 
shutoff for the warning device prescribed in this paragraph, the warning 
system must be designed so that when the warning has been suspended 
after one or more throttles are closed, subsequent retardation of any 
throttle to, or beyond, the position for normal landing approach will 
activate the warning device.
    (2) A device that functions continuously when the wing flaps are 
extended beyond the maximum approach flap position, using a normal 
landing procedure, if the landing gear is not fully extended and locked. 
There may not be a manual shutoff for this warning device. The flap 
position sensing unit may be installed at any suitable location. The 
system for this device may use any part of the system (including the 
aural warning device) for the device required in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section.

[[Page 224]]

    (g) Equipment located in the landing gear bay. If the landing gear 
bay is used as the location for equipment other than the landing gear, 
that equipment must be designed and installed to minimize damage from 
items such as a tire burst, or rocks, water, and slush that may enter 
the landing gear bay.

ratings (static and dynamic) are not exceeded--
    (1) By a load on each main wheel tire) to be compared to the static 
rating approved for such tires) equal to the corresponding static ground 
reaction under the design maximum weight and critical center of gravity; 
and
    (2) By a load on nose wheel tires (to be compared with the dynamic 
rating approved for such tires) equal to the reaction obtained at the 
nose wheel, assuming the mass of the airplane to be concentrated at the 
most critical center of gravity and exerting a force of 1.0 W downward 
and 0.31 W forward (where W is the design maximum weight), with the 
reactions distributed to the nose and main wheels by the principles of 
statics and with the drag reaction at the ground applied only at wheels 
with brakes.
    (b) If specially constructed tires are used, the wheels must be 
plainly and conspicuously marked to that effect. The markings must 
include the make, size, number of plies, and identification marking of 
the proper tire.
    (c) Each tire installed on a retractable landing gear system must, 
at the maximum size of the tire type expected in service, have a 
clearance to surrounding structure and systems that is adequate to 
prevent contact between the tire and any part of the structure of 
systems.

the following methods:
    (1) The brake kinetic energy absorption requirements must be based 
on a conservative rational analysis of the sequence of events expected 
during landing at the design landing weight.
    (2) Instead of a rational analysis, the kinetic energy absorption 
requirements for each main wheel brake assembly may be derived from the 
following formula:

    KE=0.0443 WV<SUP>2</SUP>/N

where--

KE=Kinetic energy per wheel (ft.-lb.);
W=Design landing weight (lb.);
V=Airplane speed in knots. V must be not less than

          airplane at sea level, at the design landing weight, and in 
          the landing configuration; and
N=Number of main wheels with brakes.

    (b) Brakes must be able to prevent the wheels from rolling on a 
paved runway with takeoff power on the critical engine, but need not 
prevent movement of the airplane with wheels locked.
    (c) During the landing distance determination required by 
Sec. 23.75, the pressure on the wheel braking system must not exceed the 
pressure specified by the brake manufacturer.
    (d) If antiskid devices are installed, the devices and associated 
systems must be designed so that no single

[[Page 225]]

probable malfunction or failure will result in a hazardous loss of 
braking ability or directional control of the airplane.
    (e) In addition, for commuter category airplanes, the rejected 
takeoff brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake 
assembly must not be less than the kinetic energy absorption 
requirements determined under either of the following methods--
    (1) The brake kinetic energy absorption requirements must be based 
on a conservative rational analysis of the sequence of events expected 
during a rejected takeoff at the design takeoff weight.
    (2) Instead of a rational analysis, the kinetic energy absorption 
requirements for each main wheel brake assembly may be derived from the 
following formula--

KE=0.0443 WV\2\N

where,
KE=Kinetic energy per wheel (ft.-lbs.);
W=Design takeoff weight (lbs.);
V=Ground speed, in knots, associated with the maximum value of 
V<INF>1</INF> selected in accordance with Sec. 23.51(c)(1);

that float to support its portion of the maximum weight of the seaplane 
or amphibian in fresh water; and
    (2) Enough watertight compartments to provide reasonable assurance 
that the seaplane or amphibian will stay afloat without capsizing if any 
two compartments of any main float are flooded.

Sec. 23.771  Pilot compartment.

    For each pilot compartment--
    (a) The compartment and its equipment must allow each pilot to 
perform his duties without unreasonable concentration or fatigue;
    (b) Where the flight crew are separated from the passengers by a 
partition, an opening or openable window or door must be provided to 
facilitate communication between flight crew and the passengers; and
    (c) The aerodynamic controls listed in Sec. 23.779, excluding cables 
and control rods, must be located with respect to the propellers so that 
no part of the pilot or the controls lies in the region between the

Sec. 23.773  Pilot compartment view.

    (a) Each pilot compartment must be--
    (1) Arranged with sufficiently extensive, clear and undistorted view 
to enable the pilot to safely taxi, takeoff, approach, land, and perform 
any maneuvers within the operating limitations of the airplane.
    (2) Free from glare and reflections that could interfere with the 
pilot's vision. Compliance must be shown in all operations for which 
certification is requested; and
    (3) Designed so that each pilot is protected from the elements so 
that moderate rain conditions do not unduly impair the pilot's view of 
the flight path in normal flight and while landing.
    (b) Each pilot compartment must have a means to either remove or 
prevent the formation of fog or frost on an area of the internal portion 
of the windshield and side windows sufficiently large to provide the 
view specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Compliance must be 
shown under all expected external and internal ambient operating 
conditions, unless it can be shown that the windshield and side windows 
can be easily cleared by the pilot without interruption of moral pilot 
duties.

Sec. 23.775  Windshields and windows.

    (a) The internal panels of windshields and windows must be 
constructed of a nonsplintering material, such as nonsplintering safety 
glass.
    (b) The design of windshields, windows, and canopies in pressurized 
airplanes must be based on factors peculiar to high altitude operation, 
including--
    (1) The effects of continuous and cyclic pressurization loadings;
    (2) The inherent characteristics of the material used; and
    (3) The effects of temperatures and temperature gradients.
    (c) On pressurized airplanes, if certification for operation up to 
and including 25,000 feet is requested, an enclosure canopy including a 
representative part of the installation must be subjected to special 
tests to account for the combined effects of continuous and cyclic 
pressurization loadings and flight loads, or compliance with the fail-
safe requirements of paragraph (d) of this section must be shown.
    (d) If certification for operation above 25,000 feet is requested 
the windshields, window panels, and canopies must be strong enough to 
withstand the maximum cabin pressure differential loads combined with 
critical aerodynamic pressure and temperature effects, after failure of 
any load-carrying element of the windshield, window panel, or canopy.
    (e) The windshield and side windows forward of the pilot's back when 
the pilot is seated in the normal flight position must have a luminous 
transmittance value of not less than 70 percent.
    (f) Unless operation in known or forecast icing conditions is 
prohibited by operating limitations, a means must be provided to prevent 
or to clear accumulations of ice from the windshield so that the pilot 
has adequate view for taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and to perform 
any maneuvers within the operating limitations of the airplane.

[[Page 227]]

    (g) In the event of any probable single failure, a transparency 
heating system must be incapable of raising the temperature of any 
windshield or window to a point where there would be--
    (1) Structural failure that adversely affects the integrity of the 
cabin; or
    (2) There would be a danger of fire.
    (h) In addition, for commuter category airplanes, the following 
applies:
    (1) Windshield panes directly in front of the pilots in the normal 
conduct of their duties, and the supporting structures for these panes, 
must withstand, without penetration, the impact of a two-pound bird when 
the velocity of the airplane (relative to the bird along the airplane's 
flight path) is equal to the airplane's maximum approach flap speed.
    (2) The windshield panels in front of the pilots must be arranged so 
that, assuming the loss of vision through any one panel, one or more 
panels remain available for use by a pilot seated at a pilot station to 
permit continued safe flight and landing.

Sec. 23.777  Cockpit controls.

    (a) Each cockpit control must be located and (except where its 
function is obvious) identified to provide convenient operation and to 
prevent confusion and inadvertent operation.
    (b) The controls must be located and arranged so that the pilot, 
when seated, has full and unrestricted movement of each control without 
interference from either his clothing or the cockpit structure.
    (c) Powerplant controls must be located--
    (1) For multiengine airplanes, on the pedestal or overhead at or 
near the center of the cockpit;
    (2) For single and tandem seated single-engine airplanes, on the 
left side console or instrument panel;
    (3) For other single-engine airplanes at or near the center of the 
cockpit, on the pedestal, instrument panel, or overhead; and
    (4) For airplanes, with side-by-side pilot seats and with two sets 
of powerplant controls, on left and right consoles.
    (d) The control location order from left to right must be power 
(thrust) lever, propeller (rpm control), and mixture control (condition 
lever and fuel cutoff for turbine-powered airplanes). Power (thrust) 
levers must be at least one inch higher or longer to make them more 
prominent than propeller (rpm control) or mixture controls. Carburetor 
heat or alternate air control must be to the left of the throttle or at 
least eight inches from the mixture control when located other than on a 
pedestal. Carburetor heat or alternate air control, when located on a 
pedestal must be aft or below the power (thrust) lever. Supercharger 
controls must be located below or aft of the propeller controls. 
Airplanes with tandem seating or single-place airplanes may utilize 
control locations on the left side of the cabin compartment; however, 
location order from left to right must be power (thrust) lever, 
propeller (rpm control) and mixture control.
    (e) Identical powerplant controls for each engine must be located to 
prevent confusion as to the engines they control.
    (1) Conventional multiengine powerplant controls must be located so 
that the left control(s) operates the left engines(s) and the right 
control(s) operates the right engine(s).
    (2) On twin-engine airplanes with front and rear engine locations 
(tandem), the left powerplant controls must operate the front engine and 
the right powerplant controls must operate the rear engine.
    (f) Wing flap and auxiliary lift device controls must be located--
    (1) Centrally, or to the right of the pedestal or powerplant 
throttle control centerline; and
    (2) Far enough away from the landing gear control to avoid 
confusion.
    (g) The landing gear control must be located to the left of the 
throttle centerline or pedestal centerline.
    (h) Each fuel feed selector control must comply with Sec. 23.995 and 
be located and arranged so that the pilot can see and reach it without 
moving any seat or primary flight control when his seat is at any 
position in which it can be placed.

[[Page 228]]

    (1) For a mechanical fuel selector:
    (i) The indication of the selected fuel valve position must be by 
means of a pointer and must provide positive identification and feel 
(detent, etc.) of the selected position.

propeller disk or any other potential hazard so as to endanger persons 
using the door.
    (c) Each external passenger or crew door must comply with the 
following requirements:
    (1) There must be a means to lock and safeguard the door against 
inadvertent opening during flight by persons, by cargo, or as a result 
of mechanical failure.
    (2) The door must be openable from the inside and the outside when 
the internal locking mechanism is in the locked position.
    (3) There must be a means of opening which is simple and obvious and 
is arranged and marked inside and outside so that the door can be 
readily located, unlocked, and opened, even in darkness.
    (4) The door must meet the marking requirements of Sec. 23.811 of 
this part.
    (5) The door must be reasonably free from jamming as a result of 
fuselage deformation in an emergency landing.
    (6) Auxiliary locking devices that are actuated externally to the 
airplane may be used but such devices must be overridden by the normal 
internal opening means.
    (d) In addition, each external passenger or crew door, for a 
commuter category airplane, must comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Each door must be openable from both the inside and outside, 
even though persons may be crowded against the door on the inside of the 
airplane.
    (2) If inward opening doors are used, there must be a means to 
prevent occupants from crowding against the door to the extent that 
would interfere with opening the door.
    (3) Auxiliary locking devices may be used.
    (e) Each external door on a commuter category airplane, each 
external door forward of any engine or propeller on a normal, utility, 
or acrobatic category airplane, and each door of the pressure vessel on 
a pressurized airplane must comply with the following requirements:
    (1) There must be a means to lock and safeguard each external door, 
including cargo and service type doors, against inadvertent opening in 
flight, by persons, by cargo, or as a result of mechanical failure or 
failure of a single structural element, either during or after closure.
    (2) There must be a provision for direct visual inspection of the 
locking mechanism to determine if the external door, for which the 
initial opening movement is not inward, is fully closed and locked. The 
provisions must be discernible, under operating lighting conditions, by 
a crewmember using a flashlight or an equivalent lighting source.
    (3) There must be a visual warning means to signal a flight 
crewmember if the external door is not fully closed and locked. The 
means must be designed so that any failure, or combination of failures, 
that would result in an erroneous closed and locked indication is 
improbable for doors for which the initial opening movement is not 
inward.
    (f) In addition, for commuter category airplanes, the following 
requirements apply:
    (1) Each passenger entry door must qualify as a floor level 
emergency exit. This exit must have a rectangular opening of not less 
than 24 inches wide by 48 inches high, with corner radii not greater 
than one-third the width of the exit.
    (2) If an integral stair is installed at a passenger entry door, the 
stair must be designed so that, when subjected to the inertia loads 
resulting from the ultimate static load factors in Sec. 23.561(b)(2) and 
following the collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear, it will 
not reduce the effectiveness of emergency egress through the passenger 
entry door.
    (g) If lavatory doors are installed, they must be designed to 
preclude an occupant from becoming trapped inside the lavatory. If a 
locking mechanism is

[[Page 232]]

installed, it must be capable of being unlocked from outside of the 
lavatory.

Sec. 23.785  Seats, berths, litters, safety belts, and shoulder harnesses.

    There must be a seat or berth for each occupant that meets the 
following:
    (a) Each seat/restraint system and the supporting structure must be 
designed to support occupants weighing at least 215 pounds when 
subjected to the maximum load factors corresponding to the specified 
flight and ground load conditions, as defined in the approved operating 
envelope of the airplane. In addition, these loads must be multiplied by 
a factor of 1.33 in determining the strength of all fittings and the 
attachment of--
    (1) Each seat to the structure; and
    (2) Each safety belt and shoulder harness to the seat or structure.
    (b) Each forward-facing or aft-facing seat/restraint system in 
normal, utility, or acrobatic category airplanes must consist of a seat, 
a safety belt, and a shoulder harness, with a metal-to-metal latching 
device, that are designed to provide the occupant protection provisions 
required in Sec. 23.562. Other seat orientations must provide the same 
level of occupant protection as a forward-facing or aft-facing seat with 
a safety belt and a shoulder harness, and must provide the protection 
provisions of Sec. 23.562.
    (c) For commuter category airplanes, each seat and the supporting 
structure must be designed for occupants weighing at least 170 pounds 
when subjected to the inertia loads resulting from the ultimate static 
load factors prescribed in Sec. 23.561(b)(2) of this part. Each occupant 
must be protected from serious head injury when subjected to the inertia 
loads resulting from these load factors by a safety belt and shoulder 
harness, with a metal-to-metal latching device, for the front seats and 
a safety belt, or a safety belt and shoulder harness, with a metal-to-
metal latching device, for each seat other than the front seats.
    (d) Each restraint system must have a single-point release for 
occupant evacuation.
    (e) The restraint system for each crewmember must allow the 
crewmember, when seated with the safety belt and shoulder harness 
fastened, to perform all functions necessary for flight operations.
    (f) Each pilot seat must be designed for the reactions resulting 
from the application of pilot forces to the primary flight controls as 
prescribed in Sec. 23.395 of this part.
    (g) There must be a means to secure each safety belt and shoulder 
harness, when not in use, to prevent interference with the operation of 
the airplane and with rapid occupant egress in an emergency.
    (h) Unless otherwise placarded, each seat in a utility or acrobatic 
category airplane must be designed to accommodate an occupant wearing a 
parachute.
    (i) The cabin area surrounding each seat, including the structure, 
interior walls, instrument panel, control wheel, pedals, and seats 
within striking distance of the occupant's head or torso (with the 
restraint system fastened) must be free of potentially injurious 
objects, sharp edges, protuberances, and hard surfaces. If energy 
absorbing designs or devices are used to meet this requirement, they 
must protect the occupant from serious injury when the occupant is 
subjected to the inertia loads resulting from the ultimate static load 
factors prescribed in Sec. 23.561(b)(2) of this part, or they must 
comply with the occupant protection provisions of Sec. 23.562 of this 
part, as required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 23.841  Pressurized cabins.

    (a) If certification for operation over 25,000 feet is requested, 
the airplane must be able to maintain a cabin pressure altitude of not 
more than 15,000 feet in event of any probable failure or malfunction in 
the pressurization system.
    (b) Pressurized cabins must have at least the following valves, 
controls, and indicators, for controlling cabin pressure:
    (1) Two pressure relief valves to automatically limit the positive 
pressure differential to a predetermined value at the maximum rate of 
flow delivered by the pressure source. The combined capacity of the 
relief valves must be large enough so that the failure of any one valve 
would not cause an appreciable rise in the pressure differential. The 
pressure differential is positive when the internal pressure is greater 
than the external.
    (2) Two reverse pressure differential relief valves (or their 
equivalent) to automatically prevent a negative pressure differential 
that would damage the structure. However, one valve is enough if it is 
of a design that reasonably precludes its malfunctioning.
    (3) A means by which the pressure differential can be rapidly 
equalized.
    (4) An automatic or manual regulator for controlling the intake or 
exhaust airflow, or both, for maintaining the required internal 
pressures and airflow rates.
    (5) Instruments to indicate to the pilot the pressure differential, 
the cabin pressure altitude, and the rate of change of cabin pressure 
altitude.
    (6) Warning indication at the pilot station to indicate when the 
safe or preset pressure differential is exceeded and when a cabin 
pressure altitude of 10,000 feet is exceeded.
    (7) A warning placard for the pilot if the structure is not designed 
for pressure differentials up to the maximum

[[Page 239]]

relief valve setting in combination with landing loads.
    (8) A means to stop rotation of the compressor or to divert airflow 
from the cabin if continued rotation of an engine-driven cabin 
compressor or continued flow of any compressor bleed air will create a 
hazard if a malfunction occurs.

cannot introduce flammable fluids or vapors into the ventilating 
airstream.
    (c) Combustion air ducts. Each combustion air duct must be fireproof 
for a

[[Page 242]]

distance great enough to prevent damage from backfiring or reverse flame 
propagation. In addition--
    (1) No combustion air duct may have a common opening with the 
ventilating airstream unless flames from backfires or reverse burning 
cannot enter the ventilating airstream under any operating condition, 
including reverse flow or malfunctioning of the heater or its associated 
components; and
    (2) No combustion air duct may restrict the prompt relief of any 
backfire that, if so restricted, could cause heater failure.
    (d) Heater controls: general. Provision must be made to prevent the 
hazardous accumulation of water or ice on or in any heater control 
component, control system tubing, or safety control.

    (D) The ventilating airflow becomes inadequate for safe operation.
    (ii) Means to warn the crew when any heater whose heat output is 
essential for safe operation has been shut off by the automatic means 
prescribed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) The means for complying with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section 
for any individual heater must--
    (i) Be independent of components serving any other heater whose heat 
output is essential for safe operations; and
    (ii) Keep the heater off until restarted by the crew.
    (f) Air intakes. Each combustion and ventilating air intake must be 
located so that no flammable fluids or vapors can enter the heater 
system under any operating condition--
    (1) During normal operation; or
    (2) As a result of the malfunctioning of any other component.
    (g) Heater exhaust. Heater exhaust systems must meet the provisions 
of Secs. 23.1121 and 23.1123. In addition, there must be provisions in 
the design of the heater exhaust system to safely expel the products of 
combustion to prevent the occurrence of--
    (1) Fuel leakage from the exhaust to surrounding compartments;
    (2) Exhaust gas impingement on surrounding equipment or structure;
    (3) Ignition of flammable fluids by the exhaust, if the exhaust is 
in a compartment containing flammable fluid lines; and
    (4) Restrictions in the exhaust system to relieve backfires that, if 
so restricted, could cause heater failure.
    (h) Heater fuel systems. Each heater fuel system must meet each 
powerplant fuel system requirement affecting safe heater operation. Each 
heater fuel system component within the ventilating airstream must be 
protected by shrouds so that no leakage from those components can enter 
the ventilating airstream.
    (i) Drains. There must be means to safely drain fuel that might 
accumulate within the combustion chamber or the heater exchanger. In 
addition--
    (1) Each part of any drain that operates at high temperatures must 
be protected in the same manner as heater exhausts; and
    (2) Each drain must be protected from hazardous ice accumulation 
under any operating condition.

from each other to allow operation, in at least one configuration, so 
that the failure or malfunction of any engine, or the failure or 
malfunction (including destruction by fire in the engine compartment) of 
any system that can affect an engine (other than a fuel tank if only one 
fuel tank is installed), will not:
    (1) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; 
or
    (2) Require immediate action by any crewmember for continued safe 
operation of the remaining engines.
    (d) Starting and stopping (piston engine). (1) The design of the 
installation must be such that risk of fire or mechanical damage to the

following a false start, all fuel or vapor is discharged in such a way 
that it does not constitute a fire hazard.
    (f) Restart envelope. An altitude and airspeed envelope must be 
established for the airplane for in-flight engine restarting and each 
installed engine must have a restart capability within that envelope.
    (g) Restart capability. For turbine engine powered airplanes, if the 
minimum windmilling speed of the engines, following the in-flight 
shutdown of all engines, is insufficient to provide the necessary 
electrical power for engine ignition, a power source independent of the 
engine-driven electrical power generating system must be provided to 
permit in-flight engine ignition for restarting.

its normal engine installation and operating in the engine environment--
    (1) Can withstand, without defect, an endurance test of 150 hours 
that meets the applicable requirements of Sec. 33.49 of this subchapter; 
and
    (2) Will have no adverse effect upon the engine.
    (b) Control system malfunctions, vibrations, and abnormal speeds and

withstand the loads imposed on the system;
    (2) It must be shown that, under the installed vibration 
environment, the intercooler will not fail in a manner allowing portions 
of the intercooler to be ingested by the engine; and
    (3) Airflow through the intercooler must not discharge directly on 
any airplane component (e.g., windshield) unless such discharge is shown 
to cause no hazard to the airplane under all operating conditions.
    (e) Engine power, cooling characteristics, operating limits, and 
procedures affected by the turbocharger system installations must be 
evaluated. Turbocharger operating procedures and limitations must be 
included in the Airplane Flight Manual in accordance with Sec. 23.1581.

Sec. 23.925  Propeller clearance.

    Unless smaller clearances are substantiated, propeller clearances, 
with the airplane at the most adverse combination of weight and center 
of gravity, and with the propeller in the most adverse pitch position, 
may not be less than the following:
    (a) Ground clearance. There must be a clearance of at least seven 
inches (for each airplane with nose wheel landing gear) or nine inches 
(for each airplane with tail wheel landing gear) between each propeller 
and the ground with the landing gear statically deflected and in the 
level, normal takeoff, or taxing attitude, whichever is most critical. 
In addition, for each airplane with conventional landing gear struts 
using fluid or mechanical means for absorbing landing shocks, there must 
be positive clearance between the propeller and the ground in the level 
takeoff attitude with the critical tire completely deflated and the 
corresponding landing gear strut bottomed. Positive clearance for 
airplanes using leaf spring struts is shown with a deflection 
corresponding to 1.5g.
    (b) Aft-mounted propellers. In addition to the clearances specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section, an airplane with an aft mounted 
propeller must be designed such that the propeller will not contact the 
runway surface when the airplane is in the maximum pitch attitude 
attainable during normal takeoffs and landings.
    (c) Water clearance. There must be a clearance of at least 18 inches 
between each propeller and the water, unless compliance with Sec. 23.239 
can be shown with a lesser clearance.
    (d) Structural clearance. There must be--
    (1) At least one inch radial clearance between the blade tips and 
the airplane structure, plus any additional radial clearance necessary 
to prevent harmful vibration;
    (2) At least one-half inch longitudinal clearance between the 
propeller blades or cuffs and stationary parts of the airplane; and
    (3) Positive clearance between other rotating parts of the propeller 
or spinner and stationary parts of the airplane.

Sec. 23.933  Reversing systems.

    (a) For turbojet and turbofan reversing systems. (1) Each system 
intended for ground operation only must be designed so that, during any 
reversal in flight, the engine will produce no more than flight idle 
thrust. In addition, it must be shown by analysis or test, or both, 
that--
    (i) Each operable reverser can be restored to the forward thrust 
position; or
    (ii) The airplane is capable of continued safe flight and landing 
under any possible position of the thrust reverser.
    (2) Each system intended for in-flight use must be designed so that 
no unsafe condition will result during normal operation of the system, 
or from any failure, or likely combination of failures, of the reversing 
system under any operating condition including ground operation. Failure 
of structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this 
type of failure is extremely remote.
    (3) Each system must have a means to prevent the engine from 
producing more than idle thrust when the reversing system malfunctions; 
except that it may produce any greater thrust that is shown to allow 
directional control to be maintained, with aerodynamic means alone, 
under the most critical reversing condition expected in operation.
    (b) For propeller reversing systems. (1) Each system must be 
designed so that no single failure, likely combination of failures or 
malfunction of the system will result in unwanted reverse thrust under 
any operating condition. Failure of structural elements need not be 
considered if the probability of this type of failure is extremely 
remote.
    (2) Compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be shown 
by failure analysis, or testing, or both, for propeller systems that 
allow the propeller blades to move from the flight low-pitch position to 
a position that is substantially less than the normal flight, low-pitch 
position. The analysis may include or be supported by the analysis made 
to show compliance with Sec. 35.21 for the type certification of the 
propeller and associated installation components. Credit will be given 
for pertinent analysis and testing completed by the engine and propeller 
manufacturers.

Sec. 23.937  Turbopropeller-drag limiting systems.

    (a) Turbopropeller-powered airplane propeller-drag limiting systems 
must be designed so that no single failure or malfunction of any of the 
systems during normal or emergency operation results in propeller drag 
in excess of that for which the airplane was designed under the 
structural requirements of this part. Failure of structural elements of 
the drag limiting systems need not be considered if the probability of 
this kind of failure is extremely remote.
    (b) As used in this section, drag limiting systems include manual or 
automatic devices that, when actuated after engine power loss, can move 
the propeller blades toward the feather position to reduce windmilling 
drag to a safe level.

Sec. 23.939  Powerplant operating characteristics.

    (a) Turbine engine powerplant operating characteristics must be 
investigated in flight to determine that no adverse characteristics 
(such as stall, surge, or flameout) are present, to a hazardous degree, 
during normal and emergency operation within the range of operating 
limitations of the airplane and of the engine.
    (b) Turbocharged reciprocating engine operating characteristics must 
be investigated in flight to assure that no adverse characteristics, as 
a result of an inadvertent overboost, surge, flooding, or vapor lock, 
are present during normal or emergency operation of the engine(s) 
throughout the range of operating limitations of both airplane and 
engine.
    (c) For turbine engines, the air inlet system must not, as a result 
of airflow distortion during normal operation, cause vibration harmful 
to the engine.

any maneuver for which certification is requested and during which the 
engine or auxiliary power unit is permitted to be in operation.
    (b) Each fuel system must be arranged so that--
    (1) No fuel pump can draw fuel from more than one tank at a time; or
    (2) There are means to prevent introducing air into the system.
    (c) Each fuel system for a turbine engine must be capable of 
sustained operation throughout its flow and pressure range with fuel 
initially saturated with water at 80 deg. F and having 0.75cc of free

Sec. 23.953  Fuel system independence.

    (a) Each fuel system for a multiengine airplane must be arranged so 
that, in at least one system configuration, the failure of any one 
component (other than a fuel tank) will not result in the loss of power 
of more than one engine or require immediate action by the pilot to 
prevent the loss of power of more than one engine.
    (b) If a single fuel tank (or series of fuel tanks interconnected to 
function as a single fuel tank) is used on a multiengine airplane, the 
following must be provided:
    (1) Independent tank outlets for each engine, each incorporating a 
shut-off valve at the tank. This shutoff valve may also serve as the 
fire wall shutoff valve required if the line between the valve and the 
engine compartment does not contain more than one quart of fuel (or any 
greater amount shown to be safe) that can escape into the engine 
compartment.
    (2) At least two vents arranged to minimize the probability of both 
vents becoming obstructed simultaneously.
    (3) Filler caps designed to minimize the probability of incorrect 
installation or inflight loss.
    (4) A fuel system in which those parts of the system from each tank 
outlet to any engine are independent of each

<R05>
Sec. 23.955  Fuel flow.

    (a) General. The ability of the fuel system to provide fuel at the 
rates specified in this section and at a pressure sufficient for proper 
engine operation must be shown in the attitude that is most critical 
with respect to fuel feed and quantity of unusable fuel. These 
conditions may be simulated in a suitable mockup. In addition--
    (1) The quantity of fuel in the tank may not exceed the amount 
established as the unusable fuel supply for that tank under 
Sec. 23.959(a) plus that quantity necessary to show compliance with this 
section.
    (2) If there is a fuel flowmeter, it must be blocked during the flow 
test and the fuel must flow through the meter or its bypass.
    (3) If there is a flowmeter without a bypass, it must not have any 
probable failure mode that would restrict fuel flow below the level 
required for this fuel demonstration.
    (4) The fuel flow must include that flow necessary for vapor return 
flow, jet pump drive flow, and for all other purposes for which fuel is 
used.
    (b) Gravity systems. The fuel flow rate for gravity systems (main 
and reserve supply) must be 150 percent of the takeoff fuel consumption 
of the engine.
    (c) Pump systems. The fuel flow rate for each pump system (main and 
reserve supply) for each reciprocating engine must be 125 percent of the 
fuel flow required by the engine at the maximum takeoff power approved 
under this part.
    (1) This flow rate is required for each main pump and each emergency 
pump, and must be available when the pump is operating as it would 
during takeoff;
    (2) For each hand-operated pump, this rate must occur at not more 
than 60 complete cycles (120 single strokes) per minute.
    (3) The fuel pressure, with main and emergency pumps operating 
simultaneously, must not exceed the fuel inlet pressure limits of the 
engine unless it can be shown that no adverse effect occurs.
    (d) Auxiliary fuel systems and fuel transfer systems. Paragraphs 
(b), (c), and (f) of this section apply to each auxiliary and transfer 
system, except that--
    (1) The required fuel flow rate must be established upon the basis 
of maximum continuous power and engine rotational speed, instead of 
takeoff power and fuel consumption; and
    (2) If there is a placard providing operating instructions, a lesser 
flow rate may be used for transferring fuel from any auxiliary tank into 
a larger main tank. This lesser flow rate must be adequate to maintain 
engine maximum continuous power but the flow rate must not overfill the 
main tank at lower engine powers.
    (e) Multiple fuel tanks. For reciprocating engines that are supplied 
with fuel from more than one tank, if engine power loss becomes apparent 
due to fuel depletion from the tank selected, it must be possible after 
switching to any full tank, in level flight, to obtain 75 percent 
maximum continuous power on that engine in not more than--
    (1) 10 seconds for naturally aspirated single-engine airplanes;
    (2) 20 seconds for turbocharged single-engine airplanes, provided 
that 75 percent maximum continuous naturally aspirated power is regained 
within 10 seconds; or
    (3) 20 seconds for multiengine airplanes.
    (f) Turbine engine fuel systems. Each turbine engine fuel system 
must provide at least 100 percent of the fuel flow required by the 
engine under each intended operation condition and maneuver. The 
conditions may be simulated in a suitable mockup. This flow must--

[[Page 250]]

    (1) Be shown with the airplane in the most adverse fuel feed 
condition (with respect to altitudes, attitudes, and other conditions) 
that is expected in operation; and
    (2) For multiengine airplanes, notwithstanding the lower flow rate 
allowed by paragraph (d) of this section, be automatically uninterrupted 
with respect to any engine until all the fuel scheduled for use by that 
engine has been consumed. In addition--
    (i) For the purposes of this section, ``fuel scheduled for use by 
that engine'' means all fuel in any tank intended for use by a specific 
engine.
    (ii) The fuel system design must clearly indicate the engine for 
which fuel in any tank is scheduled.
    (iii) Compliance with this paragraph must require no pilot action 
after completion of the engine starting phase of operations.
    (3) For single-engine airplanes, require no pilot action after 
completion of the engine starting phase of operations unless means are 
provided that unmistakenly alert the pilot to take any needed action at 
least five minutes prior to the needed action; such pilot action must 
not cause any change in engine operation; and such pilot action must not 
distract pilot attention from essential flight duties during any phase 
of operations for which the airplane is approved.

Sec. 23.957  Flow between interconnected tanks.

    (a) It must be impossible, in a gravity feed system with 
interconnected tank outlets, for enough fuel to flow between the tanks 
to cause an overflow of fuel from any tank vent under the conditions in 
Sec. 23.959, except that full tanks must be used.
    (b) If fuel can be pumped from one tank to another in flight, the 
fuel tank vents and the fuel transfer system must be designed so that no 
structural damage to any airplane component can occur because of 
overfilling of any tank.

not less than that quantity at which the first evidence of 
malfunctioning occurs under the most adverse fuel feed condition 
occurring under each intended operation and flight maneuver involving 
that tank. Fuel system component failures need not be considered.
    (b) The effect on the usable fuel quantity as a result of a failure 
of any pump shall be determined.

which approval is requested. For turbine fuel, the initial temperature 
must be 110  deg.F, -0  deg., +5  deg.F or the maximum outside air 
temperature for which approval is requested, whichever is more critical.

    (a) Each fuel tank must be able to withstand the following pressures 
without failure or leakage:
    (1) For each conventional metal tank and nonmetallic tank with walls 
not supported by the airplane structure, a pressure of 3.5 p.s.i., or 
that pressure developed during maximum ultimate acceleration with a full 
tank, whichever is greater.
    (2) For each integral tank, the pressure developed during the 
maximum limit acceleration of the airplane with a full tank, with 
simultaneous application of the critical limit structural loads.
    (3) For each nonmetallic tank with walls supported by the airplane 
structure and constructed in an acceptable manner using acceptable basic 
tank material, and with actual or simulated support conditions, a 
pressure of 2 p.s.i. for the first tank of a specific design. The 
supporting structure must be designed for the critical loads occurring 
in the flight or landing strength conditions combined with the fuel 
pressure loads resulting from the corresponding accelerations.
    (b) Each fuel tank with large, unsupported, or unstiffened flat 
surfaces,whose failure or deformation could cause fuel leakage, must be 
able to withstand the following test without leakage, failure, or 
excessive deformation of the tank walls:
    (1) Each complete tank assembly and its support must be vibration 
tested while mounted to simulate the actual installation.
    (2) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the 
tank assembly must be vibrated for 25 hours at a total displacement of 
not less than \1/32\ of an inch (unless another displacement is 
substantiated) while \2/3\ filled with water or other suitable test 
fluid.
    (3) The test frequency of vibration must be as follows:
    (i) If no frequency of vibration resulting from any rpm within the 
normal operating range of engine or propeller speeds is critical, the 
test frequency of vibration is:
    (A) The number of cycles per minute obtained by multiplying the 
maximum continuous propeller speed in rpm by 0.9 for propeller-driven 
airplanes, and
    (B) For non-propeller driven airplanes the test frequency of 
vibration is 2,000 cycles per minute.
    (ii) If only one frequency of vibration resulting from any rpm 
within the normal operating range of engine or propeller speeds is 
critical, that frequency of vibration must be the test frequency.
    (iii) If more than one frequency of vibration resulting from any rpm 
within the normal operating range of engine or propeller speeds is 
critical, the most critical of these frequencies must be the test 
frequency.
    (4) Under paragraph (b)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section, the time 
of test must be adjusted to accomplish the same number of vibration 
cycles that would be accomplished in 25 hours at the frequency specified 
in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
    (5) During the test, the tank assembly must be rocked at a rate of 
16 to 20 complete cycles per minute, through an angle of 15 deg. on 
either side of the horizontal (30 deg. total), about an axis parallel to 
the axis of the fuselage, for 25 hours.
    (c) Each integral tank using methods of construction and sealing not 
previously proven to be adequate by test data or service experience must 
be able to withstand the vibration test specified in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (4) of this section.
    (d) Each tank with a nonmetallic liner must be subjected to the 
sloshing test outlined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, with the 
fuel at room temperature. In addition, a specimen liner of the same 
basic construction as that to be used in the airplane must, when 
installed in a suitable test tank, withstand the sloshing test with fuel 
at a temperature of 110 deg. F.

Sec. 23.967  Fuel tank installation.

    (a) Each fuel tank must be supported so that tank loads are not 
concentrated. In addition--
    (1) There must be pads, if necessary, to prevent chafing between 
each tank and its supports;
    (2) Padding must be nonabsorbent or treated to prevent the 
absorption of fuel;
    (3) If a flexible tank liner is used, it must be supported so that 
it is not required to withstand fluid loads;
    (4) Interior surfaces adjacent to the liner must be smooth and free 
from projections that could cause wear, unless--
    (i) Provisions are made for protection of the liner at those points; 
or
    (ii) The construction of the liner itself provides such protection; 
and
    (5) A positive pressure must be maintained within the vapor space of 
each bladder cell under any condition of operation, except for a 
particular condition for which it is shown that a zero or negative 
pressure will not cause the bladder cell to collapse; and
    (6) Syphoning of fuel (other than minor spillage) or collapse of 
bladder fuel cells may not result from improper securing or loss of the 
fuel filler cap.
    (b) Each tank compartment must be ventilated and drained to prevent 
the accumulation of flammable fluids or vapors. Each compartment 
adjacent to a tank that is an integral part of the airplane structure 
must also be ventilated and drained.
    (c) No fuel tank may be on the engine side of the firewall. There 
must be at least one-half inch of clearance between the fuel tank and 
the firewall. No part of the engine nacelle skin that lies immediately 
behind a major air opening from the engine compartment may act as the

jettisoning system installed that is able to jettison enough fuel to 
bring the maximum weight down to the design landing weight. The average 
rate of fuel jettisoning must be at least 1 percent of the maximum 
weight per minute, except that the time required to jettison the fuel 
need not be less than 10 minutes.
    (b) Fuel jettisoning must be demonstrated at maximum weight with 
flaps and landing gear up and in--
    (1) A power-off glide at 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>;
    (2) A climb, at the speed at which the one-engine-inoperative 
enroute climb data have been established in accordance with 
Sec. 23.69(b), with the critical engine inoperative and the remaining 
engines at maximum continuous power; and
    (3) Level flight at 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>, if the results of the tests 
in the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
show that this condition could be critical.
    (c) During the flight tests prescribed in paragraph (b) of this 
section, it must be shown that--
    (1) The fuel jettisoning system and its operation are free from fire 
hazard;
    (2) The fuel discharges clear of any part of the airplane;
    (3) Fuel or fumes do not enter any parts of the airplane; and
    (4) The jettisoning operation does not adversely affect the 
controllability of the airplane.
    (d) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, the jettisoning 
system must be designed so that it is not possible to jettison the fuel 
in the tanks used for takeoff and landing below the level allowing 45 
minutes flight at 75 percent maximum continuous power. However, if there 
is an auxiliary control independent of the main jettisoning control, the 
system may be designed to jettison all the fuel.
    (e) For turbine engine powered airplanes, the jettisoning system 
must be designed so that it is not possible to jettison fuel in the 
tanks used for takeoff and landing below the level allowing climb from 
sea level to 10,000 feet and thereafter allowing 45 minutes cruise at a 
speed for maximum range.
    (f) The fuel jettisoning valve must be designed to allow flight 
crewmembers to close the valve during any part of the jettisoning 
operation.
    (g) Unless it is shown that using any means (including flaps, slots, 
and slats) for changing the airflow across or around the wings does not 
adversely affect fuel jettisoning, there must be a placard, adjacent to 
the jettisoning control, to warn flight crewmembers against jettisoning 
fuel while the means that change the airflow are being used.
    (h) The fuel jettisoning system must be designed so that any 
reasonably

[[Page 257]]

probable single malfunction in the system will not result in a hazardous 
condition due to unsymmetrical jettisoning of, or inability to jettison, 
fuel.

Sec. 23.1309  Equipment, systems, and installations.

    (a) Each item of equipment, each system, and each installation:
    (1) When performing its intended function, may not adversely affect 
the response, operation, or accuracy of any--
    (i) Equipment essential to safe operation; or
    (ii) Other equipment unless there is a means to inform the pilot of 
the effect.
    (2) In a single-engine airplane, must be designed to minimize 
hazards to the airplane in the event of a probable malfunction or 
failure.
    (3) In a multiengine airplane, must be designed to prevent hazards 
to the airplane in the event of a probable malfunction or failure.
    (4) In a commuter category airplane, must be designed to safeguard 
against hazards to the airplane in the event of their malfunction or 
failure.
    (b) The design of each item of equipment, each system, and each 
installation must be examined separately and in relationship to other 
airplane systems and installations to determine if the airplane is 
dependent upon its function for continued safe flight and landing and, 
for airplanes not limited to VFR conditions, if failure of a system 
would significantly reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability 
of the crew to cope with adverse operating conditions. Each item of 
equipment,

[[Page 274]]

each system, and each installation identified by this examination as one 
upon which the airplane is dependent for proper functioning to ensure 
continued safe flight and landing, or whose failure would significantly 
reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of the crew to cope 
with adverse operating conditions, must be designed to comply with the 
following additional requirements:
    (1) It must perform its intended function under any foreseeable 
operating condition.
    (2) When systems and associated components are considered separately 
and in relation to other systems--
    (i) The occurrence of any failure condition that would prevent the 
continued safe flight and landing of the airplane must be extremely 
improbable; and
    (ii) The occurrence of any other failure condition that would 
significantly reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of 
the crew to cope with adverse operating conditions must be improbable.
    (3) Warning information must be provided to alert the crew to unsafe 
system operating conditions and to enable them to take appropriate 
corrective action. Systems, controls, and associated monitoring and 
warning means must be designed to minimize crew errors that could create 
additional hazards.
    (4) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section may be shown by analysis and, where necessary, by appropriate 
ground, flight, or simulator tests. The analysis must consider--
    (i) Possible modes of failure, including malfunctions and damage 
from external sources;
    (ii) The probability of multiple failures, and the probability of 
undetected faults.;
    (iii) The resulting effects on the airplane and occupants, 
considering the stage of flight and operating conditions; and
    (iv) The crew warning cues, corrective action required, and the 
crew's capability of determining faults.
    (c) Each item of equipment, each system, and each installation whose 
functioning is required by this chapter and that requires a power supply 
is an ``essential load'' on the power supply. The power sources and the 
system must be able to supply the following power loads in probable 
operating combinations and for probable durations:
    (1) Loads connected to the power distribution system with the system 
functioning normally.
    (2) Essential loads after failure of--
    (i) Any one engine on two-engine airplanes; or
    (ii) Any two engines on an airplane with three or more engines; or
    (iii) Any power converter or energy storage device.
    (3) Essential loads for which an alternate source of power is 
required, as applicable, by the operating rules of this chapter, after 
any failure or malfunction in any one power supply system, distribution 
system, or other utilization system.
    (d) In determining compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
the power loads may be assumed to be reduced under a monitoring 
procedure consistent with safety in the kinds of operations authorized. 
Loads not required in controlled flight need not be considered for the 
two-engine-inoperative condition on airplanes with three or more 
engines.
    (e) In showing compliance with this section with regard to the 
electrical power system and to equipment design and installation, 
critical environmental and atmospheric conditions, including radio 
frequency energy and the effects (both direct and indirect) of lightning 
strikes, must be considered. For electrical generation, distribution, 
and utilization equipment required by or used in complying with this 
chapter, the ability to provide continuous, safe service under 
forseeable environmental conditions may be shown by environmental tests, 
design analysis, or reference to previous comparable service experience 
on other airplanes.
    (f) As used in this section, ``system'' refers to all pneumatic 
systems, fluid systems, electrical systems, mechanical systems, and 
powerplant systems included in the airplane design, except for the 
following:
    (1) Powerplant systems provided as part of the certificated engine.

systems impractical, must:
    (1) Meet the arrangement and visibility requirements of 
Sec. 23.1321.
    (2) Be easily legible under all lighting conditions encountered in 
the cockpit, including direct sunlight, considering the expected 
electronic display brightness level at the end of an electronic display 
indictor's useful life. Specific limitations on display system useful 
life must be contained in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness 
required by Sec. 23.1529.
    (3) Not inhibit the primary display of attitude, airspeed, altitude, 
or powerplant parameters needed by any pilot to set power within 
established limitations, in any normal mode of operation.

any pilot to properly set or monitor powerplant limitations during the 
engine starting mode of operation.
    (5) Have an independent magnetic direction indicator and either an 
independent secondary mechanical altimeter, airspeed indicator, and 
attitude instrument or individual electronic display indicators for the 
altitude, airspeed, and attitude that are independent from the 
airplane's primary electrical power system. These secondary instruments 
may be installed in panel positions that are displaced from the primary 
positions specified by Sec. 23.1321(d), but must be located where they 
meet the pilot's visibility requirements of Sec. 23.1321(a).
    (6) Incorporate sensory cues for the pilot that are equivalent to 
those in the instrument being replaced by the electronic display 
indicators.
    (7) Incorporate visual displays of instrument markings, required by 
Secs. 23.1541 through 23.1553, or visual displays that alert the pilot 
to abnormal operational values or approaches to established limitation 
values, for each parameter required to be displayed by this part.
    (b) The electronic display indicators, including their systems and 
installations, and considering other airplane systems, must be designed 
so that one display of information essential for continued safe flight 
and landing will remain available to the crew, without need for 
immediate action by any pilot for continued safe operation, after any 
single failure or probable combination of failures.
    (c) As used in this section, ``instrument'' includes devices that 
are physically contained in one unit, and devices that are composed of 
two or more physically separate units or components connected together 
(such as a remote indicating gyroscopic direction indicator that 
includes a magnetic sensing element, a gyroscopic unit, an amplifier, 
and an indicator connected together). As used in this section, 
``primary'' display refers to the display of a parameter that is located 
in the instrument panel such that the pilot looks at it first when 
wanting to view that parameter.

Sec. 23.1321  Arrangement and visibility.

    (a) Each flight, navigation, and powerplant instrument for use by 
any required pilot during takeoff, initial climb, final approach, and 
landing must be located so that any pilot seated at the controls can 
monitor the airplane's flight path and these instruments with minimum 
head and eye movement. The powerplant instruments for these flight 
conditions are those needed to set power within powerplant limitations.
    (b) For each multiengine airplane, identical powerplant instruments 
must be located so as to prevent confusion as to which engine each 
instrument relates.

[[Page 276]]

    (c) Instrument panel vibration may not damage, or impair the 
accuracy of, any instrument.
    (d) For each airplane, the flight instruments required by 
Sec. 23.1303, and, as applicable, by the operating rules of this 
chapter, must be grouped on the instrument panel and centered as nearly 
as practicable about the vertical plane of each required pilot's forward 
vision. In addition:
    (1) The instrument that most effectively indicates the attitude must 
be on the panel in the top center position;
    (2) The instrument that most effectively indicates airspeed must be 
adjacent to and directly to the left of the instrument in the top center 
position;
    (3) The instrument that most effectively indicates altitude must be

center position;
    (4) The instrument that most effectively indicates direction of 
flight, other than the magnetic direction indicator required by 
Sec. 23.1303(c), must be adjacent to and directly below the instrument 
in the top center position; and
    (5) Electronic display indicators may be used for compliance with 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section when such displays 
comply with requirements in Sec. 23.1311.
    (e) If a visual indicator is provided to indicate malfunction of an 
instrument, it must be effective under all probable cockpit lighting 
conditions.

Sec. 23.1323  Airspeed indicating system.

    (a) Each airspeed indicating instrucment must be calibrated to 
indicate true airspeed (at sea level with a standard atmosphere) with a 
minimum practicable instrument calibration error when the corresponding 
pitot and static pressures are applied.
    (b) Each airspeed system must be calibrated in flight to determine 
the system error. The system error, including position error, but 
excluding the airspeed indicator instrument calibration error, may not 
exceed three percent of the calibrated airspeed or five knots, whichever 
is greater, throughout the following speed ranges:
    (1) 1.3 V<INF>S1</INF> to V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF> or 
V<INF>NE</INF>, whichever is appropriate with flaps retracted.
    (2) 1.3 V<INF>S1</INF> to V<INF>FE</INF> with flaps extended.
    (c) The design and installation of each airspeed indicating system 
must provide positive drainage of moisture from the pitot static 
plumbing.
    (d) If certification for instrument flight rules or flight in icing 
conditions is requested, each airspeed system must have a heated pitot 
tube or an equivalent means of preventing malfunction due to icing.
    (e) In addition, for commuter category airplanes, the airspeed 
indicating system must be calibrated to determine the system error 
during the accelerate-takeoff ground run. The ground run calibration 
must be obtained between 0.8 of the minimum value of V<INF>1</INF>, and 
1.2 times the maximum value of V<INF>1</INF> considering the approved 
ranges of altitude and weight. The ground run calibration must be 
determined assuming an engine failure at the minimum value of 
V<INF>1</INF>.
    (f) For commuter category airplanes, where duplicate airspeed 
indicators are

Sec. 23.1325  Static pressure system.

    (a) Each instrument provided with static pressure case connections 
must be so vented that the influence of airplane speed, the opening and 
closing of windows, airflow variations, moisture, or other foreign 
matter will least affect the accuracy of the instruments except as noted 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (b) If a static pressure system is necessary for the functioning of 
instruments, systems, or devices, it must comply with the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) The design and installation of a static pressure system must be 
such that--
    (i) Positive drainage of moisture is provided;
    (ii) Chafing of the tubing, and excessive distortion or restriction 
at bends in the tubing, is avoided; and
    (iii) The materials used are durable, suitable for the purpose 
intended, and protected against corrosion.
    (2) A proof test must be conducted to demonstrate the integrity of 
the static pressure system in the following manner:
    (i) Unpressurized airplanes. Evacuate the static pressure system to 
a pressure differential of approximately 1 inch of mercury or to a 
reading on the altimeter, 1,000 feet above the aircraft elevation at the 
time of the test. Without additional pumping for a period of 1 minute, 
the loss of indicated altitude must not exceed 100 feet on the 
altimeter.
    (ii) Pressurized airplanes. Evacuate the static pressure system 
until a pressure differential equivalent to the maximum cabin pressure 
differential for which the airplane is type certificated is achieved. 
Without additional pumping for a period of 1 minute, the loss of 
indicated altitude must not exceed 2 percent of the equivalent altitude 
of the maximum cabin differential pressure or 100 feet, whichever is 
greater.
    (3) If a static pressure system is provided for any instrument, 
device, or system required by the operating rules of this chapter, each 
static pressure port must be designed or located in such a manner that 
the correlation between air pressure in the static pressure system and 
true ambient atmospheric static pressure is not altered when the 
airplane encounters icing conditions. An antiicing means or an alternate 
source of static pressure may be used in showing compliance with this 
requirement. If the reading of the altimeter, when on the alternate 
static pressure system differs from the reading of the altimeter when on 
the primary static system by more than 50 feet, a correction card must 
be provided for the alternate static system.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if the 
static pressure system incorporates both a primary and an alternate 
static pressure source, the means for selecting one or the other source 
must be designed so that--
    (1) When either source is selected, the other is blocked off; and
    (2) Both sources cannot be blocked off simultaneously.
    (d) For unpressurized airplanes, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
does not apply if it can be demonstrated that the static pressure system 
calibration, when either static pressure source is selected, is not 
changed by the other static pressure source being open or blocked.
    (e) Each static pressure system must be calibrated in flight to 
determine the system error. The system error, in indicated pressure 
altitude, at sea-level, with a standard atmosphere, excluding instrument 
calibration error, may not exceed <plus-minus>30 feet per 100 knot speed 
for the appropriate configuration in the speed range between 1.3 
V<INF>S0</INF> with flaps extended, and 1.8 V<INF>S1</INF> with flaps 
retracted. However, the error need not be less than 30 feet.

Sec. 23.1385  Position light system installation.

    (a) General. Each part of each position light system must meet the 
applicable requirements of this section and each system as a whole must 
meet the requirements of Secs. 23.1387 through 23.1397.
    (b) Left and right position lights. Left and right position lights 
must consist of a red and a green light spaced laterally as far apart as 
practicable and installed on the airplane such that, with the airplane 
in the normal flying position, the red light is on the left side and the 
green light is on the right side.
    (c) Rear position light. The rear position light must be a white 
light mounted as far aft as practicable on the tail or on each wing tip.
    (d) Light covers and color filters.  Each light cover or color 
filter must be at least flame resistant and may not change color or 
shape or lose any appreciable light transmission during normal use.

Sec. 23.1387  Position light system dihedral angles.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each 
position light must, as installed, show unbroken light within the 
dihedral angles described in this section.
    (b) Dihedral angle L (left) is formed by two intersecting vertical 
planes, the first parallel to the longitudinal axis of the airplane, and 
the other at 110 degrees to the left of the first, as viewed when 
looking forward along the longitudinal axis.
    (c) Dihedral angle R (right) is formed by two intersecting vertical 
planes, the first parallel to the longitudinal axis of the airplane, and 
the other at 110 degrees to the right of the first, as viewed when 
looking forward along the longitudinal axis.
    (d) Dihedral angle A (aft) is formed by two intersecting vertical 
planes making angles of 70 degrees to the right and to the left, 
respectively, to a vertical plane passing through the longitudinal axis, 
as viewed when looking aft along the longitudinal axis.

practicable in accordance with Sec. 23.1385(c), cannot show unbroken 
light within dihedral angle A (as defined in paragraph (d) of this 
section), a solid angle or angles of obstructed visibility totaling not 
more than 0.04 steradians is allowable within that dihedral angle, if 
such solid angle is within a cone whose apex is at the rear position 
light and whose elements make an angle of 30 deg. with a vertical line 
passing through the rear position light.

Sec. 23.1389  Position light distribution and intensities.

    (a) General. The intensities prescribed in this section must be 
provided by new equipment with each light cover and color filter in 
place. Intensities must be determined with the light source operating at 
a steady value equal to the average luminous output of the source at the 
normal operating voltage of the airplane. The light distribution and 
intensity of each position light must meet the requirements of paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (b) Position lights. The light distribution and intensities of 
position lights must be expressed in terms of minimum intensities in the 
horizontal plane, minimum intensities in any vertical plane, and maximum 
intensities in overlapping beams, within dihedral angles L, R, and A, 
and must meet the following requirements:
    (1) Intensities in the horizontal plane.  Each intensity in the 
horizontal plane (the plane containing the longitudinal

[[Page 285]]

axis of the airplane and perpendicular to the plane of symmetry of the 
airplane) must equal or exceed the values in Sec. 23.1391.
    (2) Intensities in any vertical plane.  Each intensity in any 
vertical plane (the plane perpendicular to the horizontal plane) must 
equal or exceed the appropriate value in Sec. 23.1393, where I is the 
minimum intensity prescribed in Sec. 23.1391 for the corresponding 
angles in the horizontal plane.
    (3) Intensities in overlaps between adjacent signals. No intensity 
in any overlap between adjacent signals may exceed the values in 
Sec. 23.1395, except that higher intensities in overlaps may be used 
with main beam intensities substantially greater than the minima 
specified in Secs. 23.1391 and 23.1393, if the overlap intensities in 
relation to the main beam intensities do not adversely affect signal 
clarity. When the peak intensity of the left and right position lights 
is more than 100 candles, the maximum overlap intensities between them 
may exceed the values in Sec. 23.1395 if the overlap intensity in Area A 
is not more than 10 percent of peak position light intensity and the 
overlap intensity in Area B is not more than 2.5 percent of peak 
position light intensity.
    (c) Rear position light installation. A single rear position light 
may be installed in a position displaced laterally from the plane of 
symmetry of an airplane if--
    (1) The axis of the maximum cone of illumination is parallel to the 
flight path in level flight; and
    (2) There is no obstruction aft of the light and between planes 70 
degrees to the right and left of the axis of maximum illumination.

    (a) Each riding (anchor) light required for a seaplane or amphibian, 
must be installed so that it can--
    (1) Show a white light for at least two miles at night under clear 
atmospheric conditions; and
    (2) Show the maximum unbroken light practicable when the airplane is 
moored or drifting on the water.
    (b) Externally hung lights may be used.


<R05>
Sec. 23.1401  Anticollision light system.

    (a) General. The airplane must have an anticollision light system 
that:
    (1) Consists of one or more approved anticollision lights located so 
that their light will not impair the flight crewmembers' vision or 
detract from the conspicuity of the position lights; and
    (2) Meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section.
    (b) Field of coverage. The system must consist of enough lights to 
illuminate the vital areas around the airplane, considering the physical 
configuration and flight characteristics of the airplane. The field of 
coverage must extend in each direction within at least 75 degrees above 
and 75 degrees below the horizontal plane of the airplane, except that 
there may be solid angles of obstructed visibility totaling not more 
than 0.5 steradians.
    (c) Flashing characteristics. The arrangement of the system, that 
is, the number of light sources, beam width, speed of rotation, and 
other characteristics, must give an effective flash frequency of not 
less than 40, nor more than 100, cycles per minute. The effective flash 
frequency is the frequency at which the airplane's complete 
anticollision light system is observed from a distance, and applies to 
each sector of light including any overlaps that exist when the system 
consists of more than one light source. In overlaps, flash frequencies 
may exceed 100, but not 180, cycles per minute.
    (d) Color. Each anticollision light must be either aviation red or 
aviation white and must meet the applicable requirements of 
Sec. 23.1397.
    (e) Light intensity. The minimum light intensities in any vertical 
plane, measured with the red filter (if used) and expressed in terms of 
``effective'' intensities, must meet the requirements of paragraph (f) 
of this section. The following relation must be assumed:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.018

where:

I<INF>e</INF> =effective intensity (candles).
I(t) =instantaneous intensity as a function of time.
t<INF>2</INF>-t<INF>1</INF> =flash time interval (seconds).

Normally, the maximum value of effective intensity is obtained when 
t<INF>2</INF> and t<INF>1</INF> are chosen so that the effective 
intensity is equal to the instantaneous intensity at t<INF>2</INF> and 
t<INF>1</INF>.
    (f) Minimum effective intensities for anticollision lights. Each 
anticollision light effective intensity must equal or

[[Page 287]]

exceed the applicable values in the following table.

sections of this part must be shown:
    (a) An analysis must be performed to establish, on the basis of the 
airplane's operational needs, the adequacy of the ice protection system 
for the various components of the airplane. In addition, tests of the 
ice protection system must be conducted to demonstrate that the airplane 
is capable of operating safely in continuous maximum and intermittent 
maximum icing conditions, as described in appendix C of part 25 of this 
chapter. As used in this section, ``Capable of operating safely,'' means 
that airplane performance, controllability, maneuverability, and 
stability must not be less than that required in part 23, subpart B.
    (b) Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, in addition 
to the analysis and physical evaluation prescribed in paragraph (a) of 
this section, the effectiveness of the ice protection system and its 
components must be shown by flight tests of the airplane or its 
components in measured natural atmospheric icing conditions and by one 
or more of the following tests, as found necessary to determine the 
adequacy of the ice protection system--
    (1) Laboratory dry air or simulated icing tests, or a combination of 
both, of the components or models of the components.

[[Page 288]]

    (2) Flight dry air tests of the ice protection system as a whole, or 
its individual components.
    (3) Flight test of the airplane or its components in measured 
simulated icing conditions.
    (c) If certification with ice protection has been accomplished on 
prior type certificated airplanes whose designs include components that 
are thermodynamically and aerodynamically equivalent to those used on a 
new airplane design, certification of these equivalent components may be 
accomplished by reference to previously accomplished tests, required in 
Sec. 23.1419 (a) and (b), provided that the applicant accounts for any 
differences in installation of these components.
    (d) A means must be identified or provided for determining the 
formation of ice on the critical parts of the airplane. Adequate 
lighting must be provided for the use of this means during night 
operation. Also, when monitoring of the external surfaces of the 
airplane by the flight crew is required for operation of the ice 
protection equipment, external lighting must be provided that is 
adequate to enable the monitoring to be done at night. Any illumination 
that is used must be of a type that will not cause glare or reflection 
that would handicap crewmembers in the performance of their duties. The 
Airplane Flight Manual or other approved manual material must describe 
the means of determining ice formation and must contain information for 
the safe operation of the airplane in icing conditions.

electronic unit, or system of units, required by this chapter.
    (c) For those airplanes required to have more than one flightcrew 
member, or whose operation will require more than one flightcrew member, 
the cockpit must be evaluated to determine if the flightcrew members, 
when seated at their duty station, can converse without difficulty under 
the actual cockpit noise conditions when the airplane is being operated. 
If the airplane design includes provision for the use of communication 
headsets, the evaluation must also consider conditions where headsets 
are being used. If the evaluation shows conditions under which it will 
be difficult to converse, an intercommunication system must be provided.
    (d) If installed communication equipment includes transmitter ``off-
on'' switching, that switching means must be designed to return from the 
``transmit'' to the ``off'' position when it is released and ensure that 
the transmitter will return to the off (non transmitting) state.

    (4) The minimum design burst pressure must be 2.5 times the 
operating pressure.
    (b) Tests. Each system must be substantiated by proof pressure 
tests. When proof tested, no part of any system may fail, malfunction, 
or experience a permanent set. The proof load of each system must be at 
least 1.5 times the maximum operating pressure of that system.
    (c) Accumulators. A hydraulic accumulator or reservoir may be 
installed on the engine side of any firewall if--
    (1) It is an integral part of an engine or propeller system, or
    (2) The reservoir is nonpressurized and the total capacity of all 
such nonpressurized reservoirs is one quart or less.

         Appendix A to Part 23--Simplified Design Load Criteria

                             A23.1  General.

    (a) The design load criteria in this appendix are an approved 
equivalent of those in Secs. 23.321 through 23.459 of this subchapter 
for an airplane having a maximum weight of 6,000 pounds or less and the 
following configuration:
    (1) A single engine excluding turbine powerplants;
    (2) A main wing located closer to the airplane's center of gravity 
than to the aft, fuselage-mounted, empennage;
    (3) A main wing that contains a quarter-chord sweep angle of not 
more than 15 degrees fore or aft;
    (4) A main wing that is equipped with trailing-edge controls 
(ailerons or flaps, or both);
    (5) A main wing aspect ratio not greater than 7;
    (6) A horizontal tail aspect ratio not greater than 4;
    (7) A horizontal tail volume coefficient not less than 0.34;
    (8) A vertical tail aspect ratio not greater than 2;
    (9) A vertical tail platform area not greater than 10 percent of the 
wing platform area; and
    (10) Symmetrical airfoils must be used in both the horizontal and 
vertical tail designs.
    (b) Appendix A criteria may not be used on any airplane 
configuration that contains any of the following design features:
    (1) Canard, tandem-wing, close-coupled, or tailless arrangements of 
the lifting surfaces;

[[Page 305]]

    (2) Biplane or multiplane wing arrangements;
    (3) T-tail, V-tail, or cruciform-tail (+) arrangements;

A23.5  Certification in more than one category.

    The criteria in this appendix may be used for certification in the 
normal, utility, and acrobatic categories, or in any combination of 
these categories. If certification in more than one category is desired, 
the design category weights must be selected to make the term `` 
n<INF>1</INF>W '' constant for all categories or greater for one desired 
category than for others. The wings and control surfaces (including wing 
flaps and tabs) need only be investigated for the maximum value of `` 
n<INF>1</INF>W '', or for the category corresponding to the maximum 
design weight, where `` n<INF>1</INF>W '' is constant. If the acrobatic 
category is selected, a special unsymmetrical flight load investigation 
in accordance with paragraphs A23.9(c)(2) and A23.11(c)(2) of this 
appendix must be completed. The wing, wing carrythrough, and the 
horizontal tail structures must be checked for this condition. The basic 
fuselage structure need only be investigated for the highest load factor 
design category selected. The local supporting structure for dead weight 
items need only be designed for the highest load factor imposed when the 
particular items are installed in the airplane. The engine mount, 
however, must be designed for a higher side load factor, if 
certification in the acrobatic category is desired, than that required 
for certification in the normal and utility categories. When designing 
for landing loads, the landing gear and the airplane as a whole need 
only be investigated for the category corresponding to the maximum 
design weight. These simplifications apply to single-engine aircraft of 
conventional types for which experience is available, and the 
Administrator may require additional investigations for aircraft with 
unusual design features.

A23.7  Flight loads.

    (a) Each flight load may be considered independent of altitude and, 
except for the local supporting structure for dead weight items, only 
the maximum design weight conditions must be investigated.
    (b) Table 1 and figures 3 and 4 of this Appendix must be used to 
determine values of n<INF>1</INF>, n<INF>2</INF>, n<INF>3</INF>, and 
n<INF>4</INF>, corresponding to the maximum design weights in the 
desired categories.
    (c) Figures 1 and 2 of this Appendix must be used to determine 
values of n<INF>3</INF> and n<INF>4</INF>  corresponding to the minimum 
flying weights in the desired categories, and, if these load factors are 
greater than the load factors at the design weight, the supporting 
structure for dead weight items must be substantiated for the resulting 
higher load factors.
    (d) Each specified wing and tail loading is independent of the 
center of gravity range. The applicant, however, must select a c.g. 
range, and the basic fuselage structure must be investigated for the 
most adverse dead weight loading conditions for the c.g. range selected.
    (e) The following loads and loading conditions are the minimums for 
which strength must be provided in the structure:
    (1) Airplane equilibrium. The aerodynamic wing loads may be 
considered to act normal to the relative wind, and to have a magnitude 
of 1.05 times the airplane normal loads (as determined from paragraphs 
A23.9 (b) and (c) of this appendix) for the positive flight conditions 
and a magnitude equal to the airplane normal loads for the negative 
conditions. Each chordwise and normal component of this wing load must 
be considered.
    (2) Minimum design airspeeds. The minimum design airspeeds may be 
chosen by the applicant except that they may not be less than the 
minimum speeds found by using figure 3 of this Appendix. In addition, 
V<INF>Cmin</INF> need not exceed values of 0.9 V<INF>H</INF> actually 
obtained at sea level for the lowest design weight category for which 
certification is desired. In computing these minimum design airspeeds, 
n<INF>1</INF> may not be less than 3.8.
    (3) Flight load factor. The limit flight load factors specified in 
Table 1 of this Appendix represent the ratio of the aerodynamic force 
component (acting normal to the assumed longitudinal axis of the 
airplane) to the weight of the airplane. A positive flight load

[[Page 306]]

factor is an aerodynamic force acting upward, with respect to the 
airplane.

A23.9  Flight conditions.

    (a) General. Each design condition in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section must be used to assure sufficient strength for each condition of 
speed and load factor on or within the boundary of a V-n diagram for the 
airplane similar to the diagram in figure 4 of this Appendix. This 
diagram must also be used to determine the airplane structural operating 
limitations as specified in Secs. 23.1501(c) through 23.1513 and 
Sec. 23.1519.
    (b) Symmetrical flight conditions. The airplane must be designed for 
symmetrical flight conditions as follows:
    (1) The airplane must be designed for at least the four basic flight 
conditions, ``A'', ``D'', ``E'', and ``G'' as noted on the flight 
envelope of figure 4 of this Appendix. In addition, the following 
requirements apply:
    (i) The design limit flight load factors corresponding to conditions 
``D'' and ``E'' of figure 4 must be at least as great as those specified 
in Table 1 and figure 4 of this Appendix, and the design speed for these 
conditions must be at least equal to the value of V<INF>D</INF> found 
from figure 3 of this Appendix.
    (ii) For conditions ``A'' and ``G'' of figure 4, the load factors 
must correspond to those specified in Table 1 of this Appendix, and the 
design speeds must be computed using these load factors with the maximum 
static lift coefficient C<INF>NA</INF> determined by the applicant. 
However, in the absence of more precise computations, these latter 
conditions may be based on a value of C<INF>NA</INF> 
=<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1.35 and the design speed for condition ``A'' may 
be less than V<INF>Amin</INF>.
    (iii) Conditions ``C'' and ``F'' of figure 4 need only be 
investigated when n<INF>3</INF>W/S or n<INF>4</INF>W/S are greater than 
n<INF>1</INF>W/S or n<INF>2</INF>W/S  of this Appendix, respectively.
    (2) If flaps or other high lift devices intended for use at the 
relatively low airspeed of approach, landing, and takeoff, are 
installed, the airplane must be designed for the two flight conditions 
corresponding to the values of limit flap-down factors specified in 
Table 1 of this Appendix with the flaps fully extended at not less than 
the design flap speed V<INF>Fmin!</INF>from figure 3 of this Appendix.
    (c) Unsymmetrical flight conditions. Each affected structure must be 
designed for unsymmetrical loadings as follows:
    (1) The aft fuselage-to-wing attachment must be designed for the 
critical vertical surface load determined in accordance with paragraph 
SA23.11(c)(1) and (2) of this Appendix.
    (2) The wing and wing carry-through structures must be designed for 
100 percent of condition ``A'' loading on one side of the plane of 
symmetry and 70 percent on the opposite side for certification in the 
normal and utility categories, or 60 percent on the opposite side for 
certification in the acrobatic category.
    (3) The wing and wing carry-through structures must be designed for 
the loads resulting from a combination of 75 percent of the positive 
maneuvering wing loading on both sides of the plane of symmetry and the 
maximum wing torsion resulting from aileron displacement. The effect of 
aileron displacement on wing torsion at V<INF>C</INF> or V<INF>A</INF> 
using the basic airfoil moment coefficient modified over the aileron 
portion of the span, must be computed as follows:
    (i) Cm=Cm +0.01<greek-d><greek-m> (up aileron side) wing basic 
airfoil.
    (ii) Cm=Cm -0.01<greek-d><greek-m>(down aileron side) wing basic 
airfoil, where <greek-d><greek-m> is the up aileron deflection and 
<greek-d>d is the down aileron deflection.
    (4) <greek-D> critical, which is the sum of 
<greek-d><greek-m>+<greek-d>d must be computed as follows:
    (i) Compute <greek-D><greek-a> and <greek-D><INF>b</INF> from the 
formulas:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.021

Where <greek-D><INF>p</INF> = the maximum total deflection (sum of both 
aileron deflections) at V<INF>A</INF> with V<INF>A</INF>, V<INF>C</INF>, 
and V<INF>D</INF> described in subparagraph (2) of Sec. 23.7(e) of this 
Appendix.

    (ii) Compute K from the formula:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.022
    
where <greek-d><greek-a> is the down aileron deflection corresponding to 
<greek-D><greek-a>, and <greek-d>b is the down aileron deflection 
corresponding to <greek-D>b as computed in step (i).
    (iii) If K is less than 1.0, <greek-D><greek-a> is <greek-D> 
critical and must be used to determine <greek-d><INF>u</INF> and 
<greek-d>d. In this case, V<INF>C</INF> is the critical speed which must 
be used in computing the wing torsion loads over the aileron span.
    (iv) If K is equal to or greater than 1.0, <greek-D><INF>b</INF> is 
<greek-D> critical and must be used to determine <greek-d><INF>u</INF> 
and <greek-d><INF>d</INF>. In this case, V<INF>d</INF> is the critical 
speed which must be used in computing the wing torsion loads over the 
aileron span.
    (d) Supplementary conditions; rear lift truss; engine torque; side 
load on engine mount. Each of the following supplementary conditions 
must be investigated:
    (1) In designing the rear lift truss, the special condition 
specified in Sec. 23.369 may be investigated instead of condition ``G'' 
of figure 4 of this Appendix. If this is done, and if certification in 
more than one category is desired, the value of W/S used in the formula

[[Page 307]]

appearing in Sec. 23.369 must be that for the category corresponding to 
the maximum gross weight.
    (2) Each engine mount and its supporting structures must be designed 
for the maximum limit torque corresponding to METO power and propeller 
speed acting simultaneously with the limit loads resulting from the 
maximum positive maneuvering flight load factor n<INF>1</INF>. The limit 
torque must be obtained by multiplying the mean torque by a factor of 
1.33 for engines with five or more cylinders. For 4, 3, and 2 cylinder 
engines, the factor must be 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
    (3) Each engine mount and its supporting structure must be designed 
for the loads resulting from a lateral limit load factor of not less 
than 1.47 for the normal and utility categories, or 2.0 for the 
acrobatic category.

A23.11  Control surface loads.

    (a) General. Each control surface load must be determined using the 
criteria of paragraph (b) of this section and must lie within the 
simplified loadings of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Limit pilot forces. In each control surface loading condition 
described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, the airloads on 
the movable surfaces and the corresponding deflections need not exceed 
those which could be obtained in flight by employing the maximum limit 
pilot forces specified in the table in Sec. 23.397(b). If the surface 
loads are limited by these maximum limit pilot forces, the tabs must 
either be considered to be deflected to their maximum travel in the 
direction which would assist the pilot or the deflection must correspond 
to the maximum degree of ``out of trim'' expected at the speed for the 
condition under consideration. The tab load, however, need not exceed 
the value specified in Table 2 of this Appendix.
    (c) Surface loading conditions. Each surface loading condition must 
be investigated as follows:
    (1) Simplified limit surface loadings for the horizontal tail, 
vertical tail, aileron, wing flaps, and trim tabs are specified in 
figures 5 and 6 of this appendix.
    (i) The distribution of load along the span of the surface, 
irrespective of the chordwise load distribution, must be assumed 
proportional to the total chord, except on horn balance surfaces.
    (ii) The load on the stabilizer and elevator, and the load on fin 
and rudder, must be distributed chordwise as shown in figure 7 of this 
appendix.
    (iii) In order to ensure adequate torsional strength and to account 
for maneuvers and gusts, the most severe loads must be considered in 
association with every center of pressure position between the leading 
edge and the half chord of the mean chord of the surface (stabilizer and 
elevator, or fin and rudder).
    (iv) To ensure adequate strength under high leading edge loads, the 
most severe stabilizer and fin loads must be further considered as being 
increased by 50 percent over the leading 10 percent of the chord with 
the loads aft of this appropriately decreased to retain the same total 
load.
    (v) The most severe elevator and rudder loads should be further 
considered as being distributed parabolically from three times the mean 
loading of the surface (stabilizer and elevator, or fin and rudder) at 
the leading edge of the elevator and rudder, respectively, to zero at 
the trailing edge according to the equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09FE96.004


[[Page 308]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09FE96.007



Where--
P(x)=local pressure at the chordwise stations x,
c=chord length of the tail surface,
c<INF>f</INF>=chord length of the elevator and rudder respectively, and
w=average surface loading as specified in Figure A5.

    (vi) The chordwise loading distribution for ailerons, wing flaps, 
and trim tabs are specified in Table 2 of this appendix.
    (2) If certification in the acrobatic category is desired, the 
horizontal tail must be investigated for an unsymmetrical load of 100 
percent w on one side of the airplane centerline and 50 percent on the 
other side of the airplane centerline.
    (d) Outboard fins. Outboard fins must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 23.445.
    (e) Special devices. Special devices must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 23.459.

A23.13  Control system loads.

    (a) Primary flight controls and systems. Each primary flight control 
and system must be designed as follows:
    (1) The flight control system and its supporting structure must be 
designed for loads corresponding to 125 percent of the computed hinge 
moments of the movable control surface in the conditions prescribed in 
A23.11 of this Appendix. In addition--
    (i) The system limit loads need not exceed those that could be 
produced by the pilot and automatic devices operating the controls; and
    (ii) The design must provide a rugged system for service use, 
including jamming, ground gusts, taxiing downwind, control inertia, and 
friction.
    (2) Acceptable maximum and minimum limit pilot forces for elevator, 
aileron, and rudder controls are shown in the table in Sec. 23.397(b). 
These pilots loads must be assumed to act at the appropriate control 
grips or pads as they would under flight conditions, and to be reacted 
at the attachments of the control system to the control surface horn.
    (b) Dual controls. If there are dual controls, the systems must be 
designed for pilots operating in opposition, using individual pilot 
loads equal to 75 percent of those obtained in accordance with paragraph 
(a) of this section, except that individual pilot loads may not be less 
than the minimum limit pilot forces shown in the table in 
Sec. 23.397(b).
    (c) Ground gust conditions. Ground gust conditions must meet the 
requirements of Sec. 23.415.
    (d) Secondary controls and systems. Secondary controls and systems 
must meet the requirements of Sec. 23.405.

       Appendix D to Part 23--Wheel Spin-Up and Spring-Back Loads

D23.1 Wheel spin-up loads.

    (a) The following method for determining wheel spin-up loads for 
landing conditions is based on NACA T.N. 863. However, the drag 
component used for design may not be less than the drag load prescribed 
in Sec. 23.479(b).

              F<INF>Hmax</INF> =1/r<INF>e</INF> <radical> 
  2I<INF>w</INF>(V<INF>H</INF>--V<INF>c</INF>)nF<INF>Vmax</INF>/t<INF>S

</INF>where--

F<INF>Hmax</INF>=maximum rearward horizontal force acting on the wheel 
          (in pounds);
r<INF>e</INF>=effective rolling radius of wheel under impact based on 
          recommended operating tire pressure (which may be assumed to 
          be equal to the rolling radius under a static load of 
          n<INF>j</INF>W<INF>e</INF>) in feet;
I<INF>w</INF>=rotational mass moment of inertia of rolling assembly (in 
          slug feet);
V<INF>H</INF>=linear velocity of airplane parallel to ground at instant 
          of contact (assumed to be 1.2 V<INF>S0</INF>, in feet per 
          second);
V<INF>c</INF>=peripheral speed of tire, if prerotation is used (in feet 
          per second) (there must be a positive means of pre-rotation 
          before pre-rotation may be considered);
n=equals effective coefficient of friction (0.80 may be used);
F<INF>Vmax</INF>=maximum vertical force on wheel (pounds)= 
          n<INF>j</INF>W<INF>e</INF>, where W<INF>e</INF> and n<INF>j</INF> 
          are defined in Sec. 23.725;
t<INF>s</INF>=time interval between ground  contact and attainment of 
          maximum vertical force on wheel (seconds). (However, if the 
          value of F<INF>Vmax</INF>, from the above equation exceeds 0.8 
          F<INF>Vmax</INF>, the latter value must be used for 
          F<INF>Hmax</INF>.)

    (b) The equation assumes a linear variation of load factor with time 
until the peak load is reached and under this assumption, the equation 
determines the drag force at the time that the wheel peripheral velocity 
at radius r<INF>e</INF> equals the airplane velocity. Most shock 
absorbers do not exactly follow a linear variation of load factor with 
time. Therefore, rational or conservative allowances must be made to 
compensate for these variations. On most landing gears, the time for 
wheel spin-up will be less than the time

[[Page 320]]

required to develop maximum vertical load factor for the specified rate 
of descent and forward velocity. For exceptionally large wheels, a wheel 
peripheral velocity equal to the ground speed may not have been attained 
at the time of maximum vertical gear load. However, as stated above, the 
drag spin-up load need not exceed 0.8 of the maximum vertical loads.
    (c) Dynamic spring-back of the landing gear and adjacent structure 
at the instant just after the wheels come up to speed may result in 
dynamic forward acting loads of considerable magnitude. This effect must 
be determined, in the level landing condition, by assuming that the 
wheel spin-up loads calculated by the methods of this appendix are 
reversed. Dynamic spring-back is likely to become critical for landing 
gear units having wheels of large mass or high landing speeds.

                    Appendix E to Part 23--[Reserved]

                  Appendix F to Part 23--Test Procedure

    Acceptable test procedure for self-extinguishing materials for 
showing compliance with Secs. 23.853, 23.855 and 23.1359.
    (a) Conditioning. Specimens must be conditioned to 70 degrees F, 
plus or minus 5 degrees, and at 50 percent plus or minus 5 percent 
relative humidity until moisture equilibrium is reached or for 24 hours. 
Only one specimen at a time may be removed from the conditioning 
environment immediately before subjecting it to the flame.
    (b) Specimen configuration. Except as provided for materials used in 
electrical wire and cable insulation and in small parts, materials must 
be tested either as a section cut from a fabricated part as installed in 
the airplane or as a specimen simulating a cut section, such as: a 
specimen cut from a flat sheet of the material or a model of the 
fabricated part. The specimen may be cut from any location in a 
fabricated part; however, fabricated units, such as sandwich panels, may 
not be separated for a test. The specimen thickness must be no thicker 
than the minimum thickness to be qualified for use in the airplane, 
except that: (1) Thick foam parts, such as seat cushions, must be tested 
in \1/2\ inch thickness; (2) when showing compliance with 
Sec. 23.853(d)(3)(v) for materials used in small parts that must be 
tested, the materials must be tested in no more than \1/8\ inch 
thickness; (3) when showing compliance with Sec. 23.1359(c) for 
materials used in electrical wire and cable insulation, the wire and 
cable specimens must be the same size as used in the airplane. In the 
case of fabrics, both the warp and fill direction of the weave must be 
tested to determine the most critical flammability conditions. When 
performing the tests prescribed in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
appendix, the specimen must be mounted in a metal frame so that (1) in 
the vertical tests of paragraph (d) of this appendix, the two long edges 
and the upper edge are held securely; (2) in the horizontal test of 
paragraph (e) of this appendix, the two long edges and the edge away 
from the flame are held securely; (3) the exposed area of the specimen 
is at least 2 inches wide and 12 inches long, unless the actual size 
used in the airplane is smaller; and (4) the edge to which the burner 
flame is applied must not consist of the finished or protected edge of 
the specimen but must be representative of the actual cross section of 
the material or part installed in the airplane. When performing the test 
prescribed in paragraph (f) of this appendix, the specimen must be 
mounted in metal frame so that all four edges are held securely and the 
exposed area of the specimen is at least 8 inches by 8 inches.
    (c) Apparatus. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this Appendix, 
tests must be conducted in a draft-free cabinet in accordance with 
Federal Test Method Standard 191 Method 5903 (revised Method 5902) which 
is available from the General Services Administration, Business Service 
Center, Region 3, Seventh and D Streets SW., Washington, D.C. 20407, or 
with some other approved equivalent method. Specimens which are too 
large for the cabinet must be tested in similar draft-free conditions.
    (d) Vertical test. A minimum of three specimens must be tested and 
the results averaged. For fabrics, the direction of weave corresponding 
to the most critical flammability conditions must be parallel to the 
longest dimension. Each specimen must be supported vertically. The 
specimen must be exposed to a Bunsen or Tirrill burner with a nominal 
\3/8\-inch I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame of 1\1/2\ inches in 
height. The minimum flame temperature measured by a calibrated 
thermocouple pryometer in the center of the flame must be 1550 deg. F. 
The lower edge of the specimen must be three-fourths inch above the top 
edge of the burner. The flame must be applied to the center line of the 
lower edge of the specimen. For materials covered by 
Secs. 23.853(d)(3)(i) and 23.853(f), the flame must be applied for 60 
seconds and then removed. For materials covered by 
Sec. 23.853(d)(3)(ii), the flame must be applied for 12 seconds and then 
removed. Flame time, burn length, and flaming time of drippings, if any, 
must be recorded. The burn length determined in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this Appendix must be measured to the nearest one-tenth 
inch.
    (e) Horizontal test. A minimum of three specimens must be tested and 
the results averaged. Each specimen must be supported

[[Page 321]]

horizontally. The exposed surface when installed in the airplane must be 
face down for the test. The specimen must be exposed to a Bunsen burner 
or Tirrill burner with a nominal \3/8\-inch I.D. tube adjusted to give a 
flame of 1\1/2\ inches in height. The minimum flame temperature measured 
by a calibrated thermocouple pyrometer in the center of the flame must 
be 1550 deg. F. The specimen must be positioned so that the edge being 
tested is three-fourths of an inch above the top of, and on the center 
line of, the burner. The flame must be applied for 15 seconds and then 
removed. A minimum of 10 inches of the specimen must be used for timing 
purposes, approximately 1\1/2\ inches must burn before the burning front 
reaches the timing zone, and the average burn rate must be recorded.
    (f) Forty-five degree test. A minimum of three specimens must be 
tested and the results averaged. The specimens must be supported at an 
angle of 45 degrees to a horizontal surface. The exposed surface when 
installed in the aircraft must be face down for the test. The specimens 
must be exposed to a Bunsen or Tirrill burner with a nominal \3/8\ inch 
I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame of 1\1/2\ inches in height. The 
minimum flame temperature measured by a calibrated thermocouple 
pyrometer in the center of the flame must be 1550 deg.F. Suitable 
precautions must be taken to avoid drafts. The flame must be applied for 
30 seconds with one-third contacting the material at the center of the 
specimen and then removed. Flame time, glow time, and whether the flame 
penetrates (passes through) the specimen must be recorded.
    (g) Sixty-degree test. A minimum of three specimens of each wire 
specification (make and size) must be tested. The specimen of wire or 
cable (including insulation) must be placed at an angle of 60 degrees 
with the horizontal in the cabinet specified in paragraph (c) of this 
appendix, with the cabinet door open during the test or placed within a 
chamber approximately 2 feet high  x  1 foot  x  1 foot, open at the top 
and at one vertical side (front), that allows sufficient flow of air for 
complete combustion but is free from drafts. The specimen must be 
parallel to and approximately 6 inches from the front of the chamber. 
The lower end of the specimen must be held rigidly clamped. The upper 
end of the specimen must pass over a pulley or rod and must have an 
appropriate weight attached to it so that the specimen is held tautly 
throughout the flammability test. The test specimen span between lower 
clamp and upper pulley or rod must be 24 inches and must be marked 8 
inches from the lower end to indicate the central point for flame 
application. A flame from a Bunsen or Tirrill burner must be applied for 
30 seconds at the test mark. The burner must be mounted underneath the 
test mark on the specimen, perpendicular to the specimen and at an angle 
of 30 degrees to the vertical plane of the specimen. The burner must 
have a nominal bore of three-eighths inch, and must be adjusted to 
provide a three-inch-high flame with an inner cone approximately one-
third of the flame height. The minimum temperature of the hottest 
portion of the flame, as measured with a calibrated thermocouple 
pyrometer, may not be less than 1,750  deg.F. The burner must be 
positioned so that the hottest portion of the flame is applied to the 
test mark on the wire. Flame time, burn length, and flaming time 
drippings, if any, must be recorded. The burn length determined in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of this appendix must be measured to the 
nearest one-tenth inch. Breaking of the wire specimen is not considered 
a failure.
    (h) Burn length. Burn length is the distance from the original edge 
to the farthest evidence of damage to the test specimen due to flame 
impingement, including areas of partial or complete consumption, 
charring, or embrittlement, but not including areas sooted, stained, 
warped, or discolored, nor areas where material has shrunk or melted 
away from the heat source.

Appendix H to Part 23--Installation of An Automatic Power Reserve (APR) 
                                 System

    H23.1, General.
    (a) This appendix specifies requirements for installation of an APR 
engine power control system that automatically advances power or thrust 
on the operating engine(s) in the event any engine fails during takeoff.
    (b) With the APR system and associated systems functioning normally, 
all applicable requirements (except as provided in this appendix) must 
be met without requiring any action by the crew to increase power or 
thrust.
    H23.2, Definitions.

[[Page 323]]

    (a) Automatic power reserve system means the entire automatic system 
used only during takeoff, including all devices both mechanical and 
electrical that sense engine failure, transmit signals, actuate fuel 
controls or power levers on operating engines, including power sources, 
to achieve the scheduled power increase and furnish cockpit information 
on system operation.
    (b) Selected takeoff power, notwithstanding the definition of 
``Takeoff Power'' in part 1 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, means 
the power obtained from each initial power setting approved for takeoff.
    (c) Critical Time Interval, as illustrated in figure H1, means that 
period starting at V<INF>1</INF> minus one second and ending at the 
intersection of the engine and APR failure flight path line with the 
minimum performance all engine flight path line. The engine and APR 
failure flight path line intersects the one-engine-inoperative flight 
path line at 400 feet above the takeoff surface. The engine and APR 
failure flight path is based on the airplane's performance and must have 
a positive gradient of at least 0.5 percent at 400 feet above the 
takeoff surface.

[[Page 324]]


    H23.3, Reliability and performance requirements.
    (a) It must be shown that, during the critical time interval, an APR 
failure that increases or does not affect power on either engine will 
not create a hazard to the airplane, or it must be shown that such 
failures are improbable.
    (b) It must be shown that, during the critical time interval, there 
are no failure modes of the APR system that would result in a failure 
that will decrease the power on either engine or it must be shown that 
such failures are extremely improbable.
    (c) It must be shown that, during the critical time interval, there 
will be no failure of the APR system in combination with an engine 
failure or it must be shown that such failures are extremely improbable.
    (d) All applicable performance requirements must be met with an 
engine failure occurring at the most critical point during takeoff with 
the APR system functioning normally.
    H23.4, Power setting.
    The selected takeoff power set on each engine at the beginning of 
the takeoff roll may not be less than--
    (a) The power necessary to attain, at V<INF>1</INF>, 90 percent of 
the maximum takeoff power approved for the airplane for the existing 
conditions;
    (b) That required to permit normal operation of all safety-related 
systems and equipment that are dependent upon engine power or power 
lever position; and
    (c) That shown to be free of hazardous engine response 
characteristics when power is advanced from the selected takeoff power 
level to the maximum approved takeoff power.
    H23.5, Powerplant controls--general.
    (a) In addition to the requirements of Sec. 23.1141, no single 
failure or malfunction (or probable combination thereof) of the APR, 
including associated systems, may cause the failure of any powerplant 
function necessary for safety.
    (b) The APR must be designed to--
    (1) Provide a means to verify to the flight crew before takeoff that 
the APR is in an operating condition to perform its intended function;
    (2) Automatically advance power on the operating engines following 
an engine failure during takeoff to achieve the maximum attainable 
takeoff power without exceeding engine operating limits;
    (3) Prevent deactivation of the APR by manual adjustment of the 
power levers following an engine failure;
    (4) Provide a means for the flight crew to deactivate the automatic 
function. This means must be designed to prevent inadvertent 
deactivation; and
    (5) Allow normal manual decrease or increase in power up to the 
maximum takeoff power approved for the airplane under the existing 
conditions through the use of power levers, as stated in 
Sec. 23.1141(c), except as provided under paragraph (c) of H23.5 of this 
appendix.
    (c) For airplanes equipped with limiters that automatically prevent 
engine operating limits from being exceeded, other means may be used to 
increase the maximum level of power controlled by the power levers in 
the event of an APR failure. The means must be located on or forward of 
the power levers, must be easily identified and operated under all 
operating conditions by a single action of any pilot with the hand that 
is normally used to actuate the power levers, and must meet the 
requirements of Sec. 23.777 (a), (b), and (c).
    H23.6, Powerplant instruments.
    In addition to the requirements of Sec. 23.1305:
    (a) A means must be provided to indicate when the APR is in the 
armed or ready condition.
    (b) If the inherent flight characteristics of the airplane do not 
provide warning that an engine has failed, a warning system independent 
of the APR must be provided to give the pilot a clear warning of any 
engine failure during takeoff.
    (c) Following an engine failure at V<INF>1</INF> or above, there 
must be means for the crew to readily and quickly verify that the APR 
has operated satisfactorily.

this regulation, an applicant for approval of modifications to a DC-3 or 
L-18 airplane which result in changes in design or in changes to 
approved limitations shall show that the modifications were accomplished 
in accordance with the rules of either Part 4a or Part 4b in effect on 
September 1, 1953, which are applicable to the modification being made: 
Provided, That an applicant may elect to accomplish a modification in 
accordance with the rules of Part 4b in effect on the date of 
application for the modification in lieu of Part 4a or Part 4b as in 
effect on September 1, 1953: And provided further, That each specific 
modification must be accomplished in accordance with all of the 
provisions contained in the elected rules relating to the particular 
modification.
    3. Specific conditions for approval. An applicant for any approval 
of the following specific changes shall comply with section 2 of this 
regulation as modified by the applicable provisions of this section.
    (a) Increase in take-off power limitation--1,200 to 1,350 
horsepower. The engine take-off power limitation for the airplane may be 
increased to more than 1,200 horsepower but not to more than 1,350 
horsepower per engine if the increase in power does not adversely affect 
the flight characteristics of the airplane.
    (b) Increase in take-off power limitation to more than 1,350

[[Page 336]]

    (2) In the selected configuration for takeoff.
    (b) No takeoff made to determine the data required by this section

Sec. 25.107  Takeoff speeds.

    (a) V<INF>1</INF> must be established in relation to V<INF>EF</INF> 
as follows:
    (1) V<INF>EF</INF> is the calibrated airspeed at which the critical 
engine is assumed to fail. V<INF>EF</INF> must be selected by the 
applicant, but may not be less than VmcG determined under 
Sec. 25.149(e).
    (2) V<INF>1</INF>, in terms of calibrated airspeed, is the takeoff 
decision speed selected by the applicant; however, V<INF>1</INF> may not 
be less than V<INF>EF</INF> plus the speed gained with the critical 
engine inoperative during the time interval between the instant at which 
the critical engine is failed, and the instant at which the pilot 
recognizes and reacts to the engine failure, as indicated by the pilot's 
application of the first retarding means during accelerate-stop tests.
    (b) V<INF>2MIN</INF>, in terms of calibrated airspeed, may not be 
less than--
    (1) 1.2 V<INF>S</INF> for--
    (i) Two-engine and three-engine turbopropeller and reciprocating 
engine powered airplanes; and
    (ii) Turbojet powered airplanes without provisions for obtaining a 
significant reduction in the one-engine-inoperative power-on stalling 
speed;
    (2) 1.15 V<INF>S!</INF>for--
    (i) Turbopropeller and reciprocating engine powered airplanes with 
more than three engines; and
    (ii) Turbojet powered airplanes with provisions for obtaining a 
significant reduction in the one-engine-inoperative power-on stalling 
speed; and
    (3) 1.10 times V<INF>MC!</INF>established under Sec. 25.149.
    (c) V<INF>2</INF>, in terms of calibrated airspeed, must be selected 
by the applicant to provide at least the gradient of climb required by 
Sec. 25.121(b) but may not be less than--
    (1) V<INF>2MIN</INF>, and
    (2) V<INF>R</INF> plus the speed increment attained (in accordance 
with Sec. 25.111(c)(2)) before reaching a height of 35 feet above the 
takeoff surface.
    (d) V<INF>MU</INF> is the calibrated airspeed at and above which the 
airplane can safely lift off the ground, and con- tinue the takeoff. 
V<INF>MU</INF> speeds must be selected by the applicant throughout the 
range of thrust-to-weight ratios to be certificated. These speeds may be 
established from free air data if these data are verified by ground 
takeoff tests.
    (e) VR, in terms of calibrated airspeed, must be selected in 
accordance with the conditions of paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this 
section:
    (1) V<INF>R</INF> may not be less than--
    (i) V<INF>1</INF>;
    (ii) 105 percent of V<INF>MC</INF>;
    (iii) The speed (determined in accordance with Sec. 25.111(c)(2)) 
that allows reaching V<INF>2</INF> before reaching a height of 35 feet 
above the takeoff surface; or
    (iv) A speed that, if the airplane is rotated at its maximum 
practicable rate, will result in a V<INF>LOF</INF> of not less than 110 
percent of V<INF>MU</INF> in the all-engines-operating condition and not 
less than 105 percent of V<INF>MU</INF> determined at the thrust-to-
weight ratio corresponding to the one-engine-inoperative condition.
    (2) For any given set of conditions (such as weight, configuration, 
and temperature), a single value of V<INF>R</INF>, obtained in 
accordance with this paragraph, must be used to show compliance with 
both the one-engine-inoperative and the all-engines-operating takeoff 
provisions.
    (3) It must be shown that the one-engine-inoperative takeoff 
distance,

[[Page 337]]

using a rotation speed of 5 knots less than V<INF>R</INF> established in 
accordance with paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, does not 
exceed the corresponding one-engine-inoperative takeoff distance using 
the established V<INF>R</INF>. The takeoff distances must be determined 
in accordance with Sec. 25.113(a)(1).
    (4) Reasonably expected variations in service from the established 
takeoff procedures for the operation of the airplane (such as over-
rotation of the airplane and out-of-trim conditions) may not result in 
unsafe flight characteristics or in marked increases in the scheduled 
takeoff distances established in accordance with Sec. 25.113(a).
    (f) V<INF>LOF</INF> is the calibrated airspeed at which the airplane 
first becomes airborne.

Sec. 25.109  Accelerate-stop distance.

    (a) The accelerate-stop distance is the greater of the following 
distances:
    (1) The sum of the distances necessary to--
    (i) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start to V<INF>EF</INF> 
with all engines operating;
    (ii) Accelerate the airplane from V<INF>EF</INF> to V<INF>1</INF> 
and continue the acceleration for 2.0 seconds after V<INF>1</INF> is 
reached, assuming the critical engine fails at V<INF>EF</INF>; and
    (iii) Come to a full stop from the point reached at the end of the 
acceleration period prescribed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, 
assuming that the pilot does not apply any means of retarding the 
airplane until that point is reached and that the critical engine is 
still inoperative.
    (2) The sum of the distances necessary to--
    (i) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start to V<INF>1</INF> 
and continue the acceleration for 2.0 seconds after V<INF>1</INF> is 
reached with all engines operating; and
    (ii) Come to a full stop from the point reached at the end of the 
acceleration period prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, 
assuming that the pilot does not apply any means of retarding the 
airplane until that point is reached and that all engines are still 
operating. 
    (b) Means other than wheel brakes may be used to determine the 
accelerate-stop distance if that means--
    (1) Is safe and reliable;
    (2) Is used so that consistent results can be expected under normal 
operating conditions; and
    (3) Is such that exceptional skill is not required to control the 
airplane.
    (c) The landing gear must remain extended throughout the accelerate-
stop distance.
    (d) If the accelerate-stop distance includes a stopway with surface 
characteristics substantially different from those of a smooth hard-
surfaced runway, the takeoff data must include operational correction 
factors for the accelerate-stop distance. The correction factors must 
account for the particular surface characteristics of the stopway and 
the variations in these characteristics with seasonal weather conditions 
(such as temperature, rain, snow, and ice) within the established 
operational limits.

Sec. 25.111  Takeoff path.

    (a) The takeoff path extends from a standing start to a point in the 
takeoff at which the airplane is 1,500 feet above the takeoff surface, 
or at which the transition from the takeoff to the en route 
configuration is completed and a speed is reached at which compliance 
with Sec. 25.121(f) is shown, whichever point is higher. In addition--
    (1) The takeoff path must be based on the procedures prescribed in 
Sec. 25.101(f);
    (2) The airplane must be accelerated on the ground to 
V<INF>EF</INF>, at which point the critical engine must be made 
inoperative and remain inoperative for the rest of the takeoff; and
    (3) After reaching V<INF>EF</INF>, the airplane must be accelerated 
to V<INF>2</INF>. 
    (b) During the acceleration to speed V<INF>2</INF>, the nose gear 
may be raised off the ground at a speed not less than V<INF>R</INF>. 
However, landing gear retraction may not be begun until the airplane is 
airborne.
    (c) During the takeoff path determination in accordance with 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section--

[[Page 338]]

    (1) The slope of the airborne part of the takeoff path must be 
positive at each point;
    (2) The airplane must reach V<INF>2</INF> before it is 35 feet above 
the takeoff surface and must continue at a speed as close as practical 
to, but not less than V<INF>2</INF>, until it is 400 feet above the 
takeoff surface;
    (3) At each point along the takeoff path, starting at the point at 
which the airplane reaches 400 feet above the takeoff surface, the 
available gradient of climb may not be less than--
    (i) 1.2 percent for two-engine airplanes;
    (ii) 1.5 percent for three-engine airplanes; and
    (iii) 1.7 percent for four-engine airplanes; and
    (4) Except for gear retraction and propeller feathering, the 
airplane configuration may not be changed, and no change in power or 
thrust that requires action by the pilot may be made, until the airplane 
is 400 feet above the takeoff surface.
    (d) The takeoff path must be determined by a continuous demonstrated 
takeoff or by synthesis from segments. If the takeoff path is determined 
by the segmental method--
    (1) The segments must be clearly defined and must be related to the 
distinct changes in the configuration, power or thrust, and speed;
    (2) The weight of the airplane, the configuration, and the power or 
thrust must be constant throughout each segment and must correspond to 
the most critical condition prevailing in the segment;
    (3) The flight path must be based on the airplane's performance 
without ground effect; and
    (4) The takeoff path data must be checked by continuous demonstrated 
takeoffs up to the point at which the airplane is out of ground effect 
and its speed is stabilized, to ensure that the path is conservative 
relative to the continous path.

The airplane is considered to be out of the ground effect when it 
reaches a height equal to its wing span.
    (e) For airplanes equipped with standby power rocket engines, the 
takeoff path may be determined in accordance with section II of Appendix 
E.

    (a) For the en route configuration, the flight paths prescribed in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be determined at each 
weight, altitude, and ambient temperature, within the operating limits

must be determined at any selected speed, with--
    (1) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
    (2) The critical engines inoperative;
    (3) The remaining engines at the available maximum continuous power 
or thrust; and

    (3) Changes in configuration, power or thrust, and speed, must be 
made in accordance with the established procedures for service 
operation.
    (4) The landing must be made without excessive vertical 
acceleration, tendency to bounce, nose over, ground loop, porpoise, or 
water loop.
    (5) The landings may not require exceptional piloting skill or 
alertness.
    (b) For landplanes and amphibians, the landing distance on land must 
be determined on a level, smooth, dry, hard-surfaced runway. In 
addition--
    (1) The pressures on the wheel braking systems may not exceed those 
specified by the brake manufacturer;
    (2) The brakes may not be used so as to cause excessive wear of 
brakes or tires; and
    (3) Means other than wheel brakes may be used if that means--
    (i) Is safe and reliable;
    (ii) Is used so that consistent results can be expected in service; 
and
    (iii) Is such that exceptional skill is not required to control the 
airplane.
    (c) For seaplanes and amphibians, the landing distance on water must 
be determined on smooth water.
    (d) For skiplanes, the landing distance on snow must be determined 
on smooth, dry, snow.
    (e) The landing distance data must include correction factors for 
not more than 50 percent of the nominal wind components along the 
landing path opposite to the direction of landing, and not less than 150 
percent of the nominal wind components along the landing path in the 
direction of landing.
    (f) If any device is used that depends on the operation of any 
engine, and if the landing distance would be noticeably increased when a 
landing is made

[[Page 341]]

with that engine inoperative, the landing distance must be determined 
with that engine inoperative unless the use of compensating means will 
result in a landing distance not more than that with each engine 
operating.

                   Controllability and Maneuverability


<R05>
Sec. 25.143  General.

    (a) The airplane must be safely controllable and maneuverable 
during--
    (1) Takeoff;
    (2) Climb;
    (3) Level flight;
    (4) Descent; and
    (5) Landing.
    (b) It must be possible to make a smooth transition from one flight 
condition to any other flight condition without exceptional piloting 
skill, alertness, or strength, and without danger of exceeding the 
airplane limit-load factor under any probable operating conditions, 
including--
    (1) The sudden failure of the critical engine;
    (2) For airplanes with three or more engines, the sudden failure of 
the second critical engine when the airplane is in the en route, 
approach, or landing configuration and is trimmed with the critical 
engine inoperative; and
    (3) Configuration changes, including deployment or retraction of 
deceleration devices.
    (c) The following table prescribes, for conventional wheel type 
controls, the maximum control forces permitted during the testing 
required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Force, in pounds, applied to the control                             
            wheel or rudder pedals              Pitch     Roll     Yaw  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For short term application for pitch and roll                           
 control--two hands available for control....       75       50  .......
For short term application for pitch and roll                           
 control--one hand available for control.....       50       25  .......
For short term application for yaw control...  .......  .......      150
For long term application....................       10        5       20
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Approved operating procedures or conventional operating 
practices must be followed when demonstrating compliance with the 
control force limitations for short term application that are prescribed 
in paragraph (c) of this section. The airplane must be in trim, or as 
near to being in trim as practical, in the immediately preceding steady 
flight condition. For the takeoff condition, the airplane must be 
trimmed according to the approved operating procedures.
    (e) When demonstrating compliance with the control force limitations 
for long term application that are prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section, the airplane must be in trim, or as near to being in trim as 
practical.
    (f) When maneuvering at a constant airspeed or Mach number (up to 
V<INF>FC</INF>/M<INF>FC</INF>), the stick forces and the gradient of the 
stick force versus maneuvering load factor must lie within satisfactory 
limits. The stick forces must not be so great as to make excessive 
demands on the pilot's strength when maneuvering the airplane, and must 
not be so low that the airplane can easily be overstressed 
inadvertently. Changes of gradient that occur with changes of load 
factor must not cause undue difficulty in maintaining control of the 
airplane, and local gradients must not be so low as to result in a 
danger of overcontrolling.

Sec. 25.145  Longitudinal control.

    (a) It must be possible at any speed between the trim speed 
prescribed in Sec. 25.103(b)(1) and V<INF>s</INF>, to pitch the nose 
downward so that the acceleration to this selected trim speed is prompt 
with--
    (1) The airplane trimmed at the trim speed prescribed in 
Sec. 25.103(b)(1).
    (2) The landing gear extended;
    (3) The wing flaps (i) retracted and (ii) extended; and
    (4) Power (i) off and (ii) at maximum continuous power on the 
engines.
    (b) With the landing gear extended, no change in trim control, or 
exertion of more than 50 pounds control force (representative of the 
maximum short term force that can be applied readily by one hand) may be 
required for the following maneuvers:

[[Page 342]]

    (1) With power off, flaps retracted, and the airplane trimmed at 1.4 
V<INF>S1</INF>, extend the flaps as rapidly as possible while 
maintaining the airspeed at approximately 40 percent above the stalling 
speed existing at each instant throughout the maneuver.
    (2) Repeat paragraph (b)(1) except initially extend the flaps and 
then retract them as rapidly as possible.
    (3) Repeat paragraph (b)(2), except at the go-around power or thrust 
setting.
    (4) With power off, flaps retracted, and the airplane trimmed at 1.4 
V<INF>SI</INF>, rapidly set go-around power or thrust while maintaining 
the same airspeed.
    (5) Repeat paragraph (b)(4) except with flaps extended.
    (6) With power off, flaps extended, and the airplane trimmed at 1.4 
V<INF>S1</INF>, obtain and maintain airspeeds between 1.1 
V<INF>S1</INF>, and either 1.7 V<INF>S1</INF>, or V<INF>FE</INF>, 
whichever is lower.
    (c) Is must be possible, without exceptional piloting skill, to 
prevent loss of altitude when complete retraction of the high lift 
devices from any position is begun during steady, straight, level flight 
at 1.1 V<INF>S1</INF> for propeller powered airplanes, or 1.2 V<INF>S1</INF> 
for turbojet powered airplanes, with--
    (1) Simultaneous movement of the power or thrust controls to the go-
around power or thrust setting;
    (2) The landing gear extended; and
    (3) The critical combinations of landing weights and altitudes.

If gated high-lift device control positions are provided, retraction 
must be shown from any position from the maximum landing position to the 
first gated position, between gated positions, and from the last gated 
position to the full retraction position. In addition, the first gated 
control position from the landing position must correspond with the 
high-lift devices configuration used to establish the go-around 
procedure from the landing configuration. Each gated control position 
must require a separate and distinct motion of the control to pass 
through the gated position and must have features to prevent inadvertent 
movement of the control through the gated position.

Sec. 25.147  Directional and lateral control.

    (a) Directional control; general. It must be possible, with the 
wings level, to yaw into the operative engine and to safely make a 
reasonably sudden change in heading of up to 15 degrees in the direction 
of the critical inoperative engine. This must be shown at 1.4V<INF>s1</INF> 
for heading changes up to 15 degrees (except that the heading change at 
which the rudder pedal force is 150 pounds need not be exceeded), and 
with--
    (1) The critical engine inoperative and its propeller in the minimum 
drag position;
    (2) The power required for level flight at 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>, but 
not more than maximum continuous power;
    (3) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
    (4) Landing gear retracted;
    (5) Flaps in the approach position; and
    (6) Maximum landing weight.
    (b) Directional control; airplanes with four or more engines. 
Airplanes with four or more engines must meet the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section except that--
    (1) The two critical engines must be inoperative with their 
propellers (if applicable) in the minimum drag position;
    (2)  [Reserved]
    (3) The flaps must be in the most favorable climb position.
    (c) Lateral control; general. It must be possible to make 20 deg. 
banked turns, with and against the inoperative engine, from steady 
flight at a speed equal to 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>, with--
    (1) The critical engine inoperative and its propeller (if 
applicable) in the minimum drag position;
    (2) The remaining engines at maximum continuous power;
    (3) The most unfavorable center of gravity;

[[Page 343]]

    (4) Landing gear (i) retracted and (ii) extended;
    (5) Flaps in the most favorable climb position; and
    (6) Maximum takeoff weight.
    (d) Lateral control; airplanes with four or more engines. Airplanes 
with four or more engines must be able to make 20 deg. banked turns, 
with and against the inoperative engines, from steady flight at a speed 
equal to 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF>, with maximum continuous power, and with the 
airplane in the configuration prescribed by paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (e) Lateral control; all engines operating.  With the engines 
operating, roll response must allow normal maneuvers (such as recovery 
from upsets produced by gusts and the initiation of evasive maneuvers). 
There must be enough excess lateral control in sideslips (up to sideslip 
angles that might be required in normal operation), to allow a limited 
amount of maneuvering and to correct for gusts. Lateral control must be 
enough at any speed up to V<INF>FC</INF>/M<INF>FC!</INF>to provide a 
peak roll rate necessary for safety, without excessive control forces or 
travel.

<R05>
Sec. 25.149  Minimum control speed.

    (a) In establishing the minimum control speeds required by this 
section, the method used to simulate critical engine failure must 
represent the most critical mode of powerplant failure with respect to 
controllability expected in service.
    (b) V<INF>MC</INF> is the calibrated airspeed at which, when the 
critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain 
control of the airplane with that engine still inoperative and maintain 
straight flight with an angle of bank of not more than 5 degrees.

propeller control; or
    (iii) Feathered, if the airplane has an automatic feathering device 
acceptable for showing compliance with the climb requirements of 
Sec. 25.121.
    (d) The rudder forces required to maintain control at V<INF>MC
!</INF>may not exceed 150 pounds nor may it be necessary to reduce power 
or thrust of the operative engines. During recovery, the airplane may 
not assume any dangerous attitude or require exceptional piloting skill, 
alertness, or strength to prevent a heading change of more than 20 
degrees.
    (e) V<INF>MCG</INF>, the minimum control speed on the ground, is the 
calibrated airspeed during the takeoff run at which, when the critical 
engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control 
of the airplane using the rudder control alone (without the use of 
nosewheel steering), as limited by 150 pounds of force, and the lateral 
control to the extent of keeping the wings level to enable the takeoff 
to be safely continued using normal piloting skill. In the determination 
of V<INF>MCG</INF>, assuming that the path of the airplane accelerating 
with all engines operating is along the centerline of the runway, its 
path from the point at which the critical engine is made inoperative to 
the point at which recovery to a direction parallel to the centerline is 
completed may not deviate more than 30 feet laterally from the 
centerline at any point. V<INF>MCG</INF> must be established with--
    (1) The airplane in each takeoff configuration or, at the option of 
the applicant, in the most critical takeoff configuration;
    (2) Maximum available takeoff power or thrust on the operating 
engines;
    (3) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
    (4) The airplane trimmed for takeoff; and

[[Page 344]]

    (f) V<INF>MCL</INF>, the minimum control speed during approach and 
landing with all engines operating, is the calibrated airspeed at which, 
when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to 
maintain control of the airplane with that engine still inoperative, and 
maintain straight flight with an angle of bank of not more than 5 
degrees. V<INF>MCL</INF> must be established with--
    (1) The airplane in the most critical configuration (or, at the 
option of the applicant, each configuration) for approach and landing 
with all engines operating;
    (2) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
    (3) The airplane trimmed for approach with all engines operating;
    (4) The most favorable weight, or, at the option of the applicant, 
as a function of weight;
    (5) For propeller airplanes, the propeller of the inoperative engine 
in the position it achieves without pilot action, assuming the engine 
fails while at the power or thrust necessary to maintain a three degree 
approach path angle; and
    (6) Go-around power or thrust setting on the operating engine(s).
    (g) For airplanes with three or more engines, V<INF>MCL-2</INF>, the 
minimum control speed during approach and landing with one critical 
engine inoperative, is the calibrated airspeed at which, when a second 
critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain 
control of the airplane with both engines still inoperative, and 
maintain straight flight with an angle of bank of not more than 5 
degrees. V<INF>MCL-2</INF> must be established with--
    (1) The airplane in the most critical configuration (or, at the 
option of the applicant, each configuration) for approach and landing 
with one critical engine inoperative;
    (2) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
    (3) The airplane trimmed for approach with one critical engine 
inoperative;
    (4) The most unfavorable weight, or, at the option of the applicant, 
as a function of weight;
    (5) For propeller airplanes, the propeller of the more critical 
inoperative engine in the position it achieves without pilot action, 
assuming the engine fails while at the power or thrust necessary to 
maintain a three degree approach path angle, and the propeller of the 
other inoperative engine feathered;
    (6) The power or thrust on the operating engine(s) necessary to 
maintain an approach path angle of three degrees when one critical 
engine is inoperative; and
    (7) The power or thrust on the operating engine(s) rapidly changed, 
immediately after the second critical engine is made inoperative, from 
the power or thrust prescribed in paragraph (g)(6) of this section to--

    (i) Minimum power or thrust; and

    (ii) Go-around power or thrust setting.

    (h) In demonstrations of V<INF>MCL</INF> and V<INF>MCL-2</INF>--

    (1) The rudder force may not exceed 150 pounds;

    (2) The airplane may not exhibit hazardous flight characteristics or 
require exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength;

    (3) Lateral control must be sufficient to roll the airplane, from an 
initial condition of steady flight, through an angle of 20 degrees in 
the direction necessary to initiate a turn away from the inoperative 
engine(s), in not more than 5 seconds; and

    (4) For propeller airplanes, hazardous flight characteristics must 
not be exhibited due to any propeller position achieved when the engine 
fails or during any likely subsequent movements of the engine or 
propeller controls.

engines or, for turbine engines, the maximum cruising power selected by 
the applicant as an operating limitation, except that the power need not 
exceed that required for level flight at V<INF>LE</INF>; and
    (iii) The aircraft trimmed for level flight with the power required 
in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (c) Approach. The stick force curve must have a stable slope at

    (4) The airplane trimmed at 1.4 V<INF>S1</INF> with enough power to 
maintain level flight at this speed.
    (d) Landing. The stick force curve must have a stable slope, and the 
stick force may not exceed 80 pounds, at speeds between 1.1 V<INF>S0</INF> 
and 1.3 V<INF>S0</INF> with--
    (1) Wing flaps in the landing position;
    (2) Landing gear extended;
    (3) Maximum landing weight;
    (4) Power or thrust off on the engines; and

Sec. 25.177  Static lateral-directional stability.

    (a)  [Reserved]
    (b)  [Reserved]
    (c) In straight, steady sideslips, the aileron and rudder control 
movements and forces must be substantially proportional to the angle of 
sideslip in a stable sense; and the factor of proportionality must lie 
between limits found necessary for safe operation throughout the range 
of sideslip angles appropriate to the operation of the airplane. At 
greater angles, up to the angle at which full rudder is used or a rudder 
force of 180 pounds is obtained, the rudder pedal forces may not 
reverse; and increased rudder deflection must be needed for increased 
angles of sideslip. Compliance with this paragraph must be demonstrated 
for all landing gear and flap positions and symmetrical power conditions 
at speeds from 1.2 V<INF>S1</INF> to V<INF>FE</INF>, V<INF>LE</INF>, or 
V<INF>FC</INF>/M<INF>FC</INF>, as appropriate.
    (d) The rudder gradients must meet the requirements of paragraph (c) 
at speeds between V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF> and V<INF>FC</INF>/
M<INF>FC</INF> except that the dihedral effect (aileron deflection 
opposite the corresponding rudder input) may be negative provided the 
divergence is gradual, easily recognized, and easily controlled by the 
pilot.

Sec. 25.181  Dynamic stability.

    (a) Any short period oscillation, not including combined lateral-
directional oscillations, occurring between 1.2 V<INF>S</INF> and 
maximum allowable speed appropriate to the configuration of the airplane 
must be heavily damped with the primary controls--
    (1) Free; and
    (2) In a fixed position.
    (b) Any combined lateral-directional oscillations (``Dutch roll'') 
occurring between 1.2 V<INF>S</INF> and maximum allowable speed 
appropriate to the configuration of the airplane must be positively 
damped with controls free, and must be controllable with normal use of 
the primary controls without requiring exceptional pilot skill.

                                 Stalls


<R05>
Sec. 25.201  Stall demonstration.

    (a) Stalls must be shown in straight flight and in 30 degree banked 
turns with--
    (1) Power off; and
    (2) The power necessary to maintain level flight at 1.6 V<INF>S1</INF> 
(where V<INF>S1</INF> corresponds to the stalling speed with flaps in 
the approach position, the landing gear retracted, and maximum landing 
weight).
    (b) In each condition required by paragraph (a) of this section, it 
must be possible to meet the applicable requirements of Sec. 25.203 
with--
    (1) Flaps, landing gear, and deceleration devices in any likely 
combination of positions approved for operation;
    (2) Representative weights within the range for which certification 
is requested;
    (3) The most adverse center of gravity for recovery; and
    (4) The airplane trimmed for straight flight at the speed prescribed 
in Sec. 25.103(b)(1).
    (c) The following procedures must be used to show compliance with 
Sec. 25.203;
    (1) Starting at a speed sufficiently above the stalling speed to 
ensure that a steady rate of speed reduction can be established, apply 
the longitudinal control so that the speed reduction does not exceed one 
knot per second until the airplane is stalled.
    (2) In addition, for turning flight stalls, apply the longitudinal 
control

[[Page 348]]

to achieve airspeed deceleration rates up to 3 knots per second.
    (3) As soon as the airplane is stalled, recover by normal recovery 
techniques.
    (d) The airplane is considered stalled when the behavior of the 
airplane gives the pilot a clear and distinctive indication of an 
acceptable nature that the airplane is stalled. Acceptable indications 
of a stall, occurring either individually or in combination, are--
    (1) A nose-down pitch that cannot be readily arrested;
    (2) Buffeting, of a magnitude and severity that is a strong and 
effective deterrent to further speed reduction; or
    (3) The pitch control reaches the aft stop and no further increase 
in pitch attitude occurs when the control is held full aft for a short 
time before recovery is initiated.

<R05>
Sec. 25.203  Stall characteristics.

    (a) It must be possible to produce and to correct roll and yaw by 
unreversed use of the aileron and rudder controls, up to the time the 
airplane is stalled. No abnormal nose-up pitching may occur. The 
longitudinal control force must be positive up to and throughout the 
stall. In addition, it must be possible to promptly prevent stalling and 
to recover from a stall by normal use of the controls.
    (b) For level wing stalls, the roll occurring between the stall and 
the completion of the recovery may not exceed approximately 20 degrees.
    (c) For turning flight stalls, the action of the airplane after the 
stall may not be so violent or extreme as to make it difficult, with 
normal piloting skill, to effect a prompt recovery and to regain control 
of the airplane. The maximum bank angle that occurs during the recovery 
may not exceed--
    (1) Approximately 60 degrees in the original direction of the turn, 
or 30 degrees in the opposite direction, for deceleration rates up to 1 
knot per second; and
    (2) Approximately 90 degrees in the original direction of the turn, 
or 60 degrees in the opposite direction, for deceleration rates in 
excess of 1 knot per second.

<R05>
Sec. 25.207  Stall warning.

    (a) Stall warning with sufficient margin to prevent inadvertent 
stalling with the flaps and landing gear in any normal position must be 
clear and distinctive to the pilot in straight and turning flight.
    (b) The warning may be furnished either through the inherent 
aerodynamic qualities of the airplane or by a device that will give 
clearly distinguishable indications under expected conditions of flight. 
However, a visual stall warning device that requires the attention of 
the crew within the cockpit is not acceptable by itself. If a warning 
device is used, it must provide a warning in each of the airplane 
configuations prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section at the speed 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) The stall warning must begin at a speed exceeding the stalling 
speed (i.e., the speed at which the airplane stalls or the minimum speed 
demonstrated, whichever is applicable under the provisions of 
Sec. 25.201(d)) by seven percent or at any lesser margin if the stall 
warning has enough clarity, duration, distinctiveness, or similar 
properties.

                Ground and Water Handling Characteristics


<R05>
Sec. 25.231  Longitudinal stability and control.

    (a) Landplanes may have no uncontrollable tendency to nose over in 
any reasonably expected operating condition or when rebound occurs 
during landing or takeoff. In addition--
    (1) Wheel brakes must operate smoothly and may not cause any undue 
tendency to nose over; and
    (2) If a tail-wheel landing gear is used, it must be possible, 
during the takeoff ground run on concrete, to maintain any altitude up 
to thrust line level, at 80 percent of V<INF>S1</INF>.

[[Page 349]]

    (b) For seaplanes and amphibians, the most adverse water conditions 
safe for takeoff, taxiing, and landing, must be established.


<R05>
Sec. 25.233  Directional stability and control.

    (a) There may be no uncontrollable ground-looping tendency in 
90 deg. cross winds, up to a wind velocity of 20 knots or 0.2 
V<INF>S0</INF>, whichever is greater, except that the wind velocity need 
not exceed 25 knots. At any speed at which the airplane may be expected 
to be operated on the ground. This may be shown while establishing the 
90 deg. cross component of wind velocity required by Sec. 25.237.
    (b) Landplanes must be satisfactorily controllable, without 
exceptional piloting skill or alertness, in power-off landings at normal 
landing speed, without using brakes or engine power to maintain a 
straight path. This may be shown during power-off landings made in 
conjunction with other tests.
    (c) The airplane must have adequate directional control during 
taxiing. This may be shown during taxiing prior to takeoffs made in 
conjunction with other tests.

    The shock absorbing mechanism may not damage the structure of the 
airplane when the airplane is taxied on the roughest ground that may 
reasonably be expected in normal operation.

Sec. 25.237  Wind velocities.

    (a) For landplanes and amphibians, a 90-degree cross component of 
wind velocity, demonstrated to be safe for takeoff and landing, must be 
established for dry runways and must be at least 20 knots or 0.2 
V<INF>S0</INF>, whichever is greater, except that it need not exceed 25 
knots.
    (b) For seaplanes and amphibians, the following applies:
    (1) A 90-degree cross component of wind velocity, up to which 
takeoff and landing is safe under all water conditions that may 
reasonably be expected in normal operation, must be established and must 
be at least 20 knots or 0.2 V<INF>s0</INF>, whichever is greater, except 
that it need not exceed 25 knots.
    (2) A wind velocity, for which taxiing is safe in any direction 
under all water conditions that may reasonably be expected in normal 
operation, must be established and must be at least 20 knots or 0.2 
V<INF>S0</INF>, whichever is greater, except that it need not exceed 25 
knots.

<R05>
Sec. 25.239  Spray characteristics, control, and stability on water.

    (a) For seaplanes and amphibians, during takeoff, taxiing, and 
landing, and in the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section, there may be no--
    (1) Spray characteristics that would impair the pilot's view, cause 
damage, or result in the taking in of an undue quantity of water;
    (2) Dangerously uncontrollable porpoising, bounding, or swinging 
tendency; or
    (3) Immersion of auxiliary floats or sponsons, wing tips, propeller 
blades, or other parts not designed to withstand the resulting water 
loads.
    (b) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section must be shown--
    (1) In water conditions, from smooth to the most adverse condition 
established in accordance with Sec. 25.231;
    (2) In wind and cross-wind velocities, water currents, and 
associated waves and swells that may reasonably be expected in operation 
on water;
    (3) At speeds that may reasonably be expected in operation on water;
    (4) With sudden failure of the critical engine at any time while on 
water; and
    (5) At each weight and center of gravity position, relevant to each 
operating condition, within the range of loading conditions for which 
certification is requested.
    (c) In the water conditions of paragraph (b) of this section, and in 
the corresponding wind conditions, the seaplane or amphibian must be 
able to drift for five minutes with engines inoperative, aided, if 
necessary, by a sea anchor.

                    Miscellaneous Flight Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 25.251  Vibration and buffeting.

    (a) The airplane must be demonstrated in flight to be free from any 
vibration and buffeting that would prevent continued safe flight in any 
likely operating condition.
    (b) Each part of the airplane must be demonstrated in flight to be 
free from excessive vibration under any appropriate speed and power 
conditions up to V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF>. The maximum speeds shown 
must be used in establishing the operating limitations of the airplane 
in accordance with Sec. 25.1505.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, there may 
be no buffeting condition, in normal flight, including configuration 
changes during cruise, severe enough to interfere with the control of 
the airplane, to cause excessive fatigue to the crew, or to cause 
structural damage. Stall warning buffeting within these limits is 
allowable.
    (d) There may be no perceptible buffeting condition in the cruise 
configuration in straight flight at any speed up to V<INF>MO</INF>/
M<INF>MO</INF>, except that stall warning buffeting is allowable.
    (e) For an airplane with M<INF>D</INF> greater than .6 or with a 
maximum operating altitude greater than 25,000 feet, the positive 
maneuvering load factors at which the onset of perceptible buffeting 
occurs must be determined with the airplane in the cruise configuration 
for the ranges of airspeed or Mach number, weight, and altitude for 
which the airplane is to be certificated. The envelopes of load factor, 
speed, altitude, and weight must provide a sufficient range of speeds 
and load factors for normal operations. Probable inadvertent excursions 
beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset envelopes may not result in 
unsafe conditions.

25-77, 57 FR 28949, June 29, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 25.253  High-speed characteristics.

    (a) Speed increase and recovery characteristics.  The following 
speed increase and recovery characteristics must be met:
    (1) Operating conditions and characteristics likely to cause 
inadvertent speed increases (including upsets in pitch and roll) must be 
simulated with the airplane trimmed at any likely cruise speed up to 
V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF>. These conditions and characteristics 
include gust upsets, inadvertent control movements, low stick force 
gradient in relation to control friction, passenger movement, leveling 
off from climb, and descent from Mach to airspeed limit altitudes.
    (2) Allowing for pilot reaction time after effective inherent or 
artificial speed warning occurs, it must be shown that the airplane can 
be recovered to a normal attitude and its speed reduced to 
V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF>, without-
    (i) Exceptional piloting strength or skill;
    (ii) Exceeding V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF>, V<INF>DF</INF>/
M<INF>DF</INF>, or the structural limitations; and
    (iii) Buffeting that would impair the pilot's ability to read the 
instruments or control the airplane for recovery.
    (3) With the airplane trimmed at any speed up to V<INF>MO</INF> /
M<INF>MO</INF>, there must be no reversal of the response to control 
input about any axis at any speed up to V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF>. 
Any tendency to pitch, roll, or yaw must be mild and readily 
controllable, using normal piloting techniques. When the airplane is 
trimmed at V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF>, the slope of the elevator 
control force versus speed curve need not be stable at speeds greater 
than V<INF>FC</INF>/M<INF>FC</INF>, but there must be a push force at 
all speeds up to V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF> and there must be no 
sudden or excessive reduction of elevator control force as 
V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF> is reached.
    (b) Maximum speed for stability characteristics, V<INF>FC</INF>/
M<INF>FC</INF>. V<INF>FC</INF>/M<INF>FC</INF> is the maximum speed at 
which the requirements of Secs. 25.143(f), 25.147(e), 25.175(b)(1), 
25.177, and 25.181 must be met with flaps and landing gear retracted. It 
may not be less than a speed midway between V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF> 
and V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF>, except that for altitudes where Mach 
number is the limiting factor, M<INF>FC</INF> need not exceed the Mach 
number at which effective speed warning occurs.

<R05>
Sec. 25.255  Out-of-trim characteristics.

    (a) From an initial condition with the airplane trimmed at cruise 
speeds up to V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO,</INF> the airplane must have 
satisfactory maneuvering stability and controllability with the degree 
of out-of-trim in both the airplane nose-up and nose-down directions, 
which results from the greater of--
    (1) A three-second movement of the longitudinal trim system at its 
normal rate for the particular flight condition with no aerodynamic load 
(or an equivalent degree of trim for airplanes that do not have a power-
operated trim system), except as limited by stops in the trim system, 
including those required by Sec. 25.655(b) for adjustable stabilizers; 
or
    (2) The maximum mistrim that can be sustained by the autopilot while 
maintaining level flight in the high speed cruising condition.
    (b) In the out-of-trim condition specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section, when the normal acceleration is varied from +1 g to the 
positive and negative values specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section--
    (1) The stick force vs. g curve must have a positive slope at any 
speed up to and including V<INF>FC</INF>/M<INF>FC</INF>; and
    (2) At speeds between V<INF>FC</INF>/M<INF>FC</INF> and 
V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF> the direction of the primary longitudinal 
control force may not reverse.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, 
compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section must be 
demonstrated in flight over the acceleration range--
    (1) -1 g to +2.5 g; or
    (2) 0 g to 2.0 g, and extrapolating by an acceptable method to -1 g 
and +2.5 g.
    (d) If the procedure set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
is used to demonstrate compliance and marginal conditions exist during 
flight test with regard to reversal of primary longitudinal control 
force, flight tests must be accomplished from the normal acceleration at 
which a marginal condition is found to exist to the applicable limit 
specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (e) During flight tests required by paragraph (a) of this section, 
the limit maneuvering load factors prescribed in Secs. 25.333(b) and 
25.337, and the maneuvering load factors associated with probable 
inadvertent excursions beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset 
envelopes determined under Sec. 25.251(e), need not be exceeded. In 
addition, the entry speeds for flight test demonstrations at normal 
acceleration values less than 1 g must be limited to the extent 
necessary to accomplish a recovery without exceeding V<INF>DF</INF>/
M<INF>DF</INF>.
    (f) In the out-of-trim condition specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section, it must be possible from an overspeed condition at 
V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF> to produce at least 1.5 g for recovery by 
applying not more than 125 pounds of longitudinal control force using 
either the primary longitudinal control alone or the primary 
longitudinal control and the longitudinal trim system. If the 
longitudinal trim is used to assist in producing the required load 
factor, it must be shown at V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF> that the 
longitudinal trim can be actuated in the airplane nose-up direction with 
the primary surface loaded to correspond to the least of the following 
airplane nose-up control forces:
    (1) The maximum control forces expected in service as specified in 
Secs. 25.301 and 25.397.
    (2) The control force required to produce 1.5 g.
    (3) The control force corresponding to buffeting or other phenomena 
of such intensity that it is a strong deterrent to further application 
of primary longitudinal control force.

<R05>
Sec. 25.301  Loads.

    (a) Strength requirements are specified in terms of limit loads (the 
maximum loads to be expected in service) and ultimate loads (limit loads 
multiplied by prescribed factors of safety). Unless otherwise provided, 
prescribed loads are limit loads.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided, the specified air, ground, and water 
loads must be placed in equilibrium with inertia forces, considering 
each item of mass in the airplane. These loads must

[[Page 352]]

be distributed to conservatively approximate or closely represent actual 
conditions. Methods used to determine load intensities and distribution 
must be validated by flight load measurement unless the methods used for 
determining those loading conditions are shown to be reliable.
    (c) If deflections under load would significantly change the 
distribution of external or internal loads, this redistribution must be 
taken into account.

35 FR 5672, Apr. 8, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 25.303  Factor of safety.

    Unless otherwise specified, a factor of safety of 1.5 must be 
applied to the prescribed limit load which are considered external loads 
on the structure. When a loading condition is prescribed in terms of 
ultimate loads, a factor of safety need not be applied unless otherwise 
specified.

<R05>
Sec. 25.305  Strength and deformation.

    (a) The structure must be able to support limit loads without 
detrimental permanent deformation. At any load up to limit loads, the 
deformation may not interfere with safe operation.
    (b) The structure must be able to support ultimate loads without 
failure for at least 3 seconds. However, when proof of strength is shown 
by dynamic tests simulating actual load conditions, the 3-second limit 
does not apply. Static tests conducted to ultimate load must include the 
ultimate deflections and ultimate deformation induced by the loading. 
When analytical methods are used to show compliance with the ultimate 
load strength requirements, it must be shown that--
    (1) The effects of deformation are not significant;
    (2) The deformations involved are fully accounted for in the 
analysis; or
    (3) The methods and assumptions used are sufficient to cover the 
effects of these deformations.
    (c) Where structural flexibility is such that any rate of load 
application likely to occur in the operating conditions might produce 
transient stresses appreciably higher than those corresponding to static 
loads, the effects of this rate of application must be considered.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) The airplane must be designed to withstand any vibration and 
buffeting that might occur in any likely operating condition up to 
V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF>, including stall and probable inadvertent 
excursions beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset envelope. This must 
be shown by analysis, flight tests, or other tests found necessary by 
the Administrator.
    (f) Unless shown to be extremely improbable, the airplane must be 
designed to withstand any forced structural vibration resulting from any 
failure, malfunction or adverse condition in the flight control system. 
These must be considered limit loads and must be investigated at 
airspeeds up to V<INF>C</INF>/M<INF>C</INF>.

Sec. 25.307  Proof of structure.

    (a) Compliance with the strength and deformation requirements of 
this subpart must be shown for each critical loading condition. 
Structural analysis may be used only if the structure conforms to that 
for which experience has shown this method to be reliable. The

tests may be inadequate.

    (d) When static or dynamic tests are used to show compliance with 
the requirements of Sec. 25.305(b) for flight structures, appropriate 
material correction factors must be applied to the test results, unless 
the structure, or part thereof, being tested has features such that a 
number of elements contribute to the total strength of the structure and 
the failure of one element results in the redistribution of the load 
through alternate load paths.

                              Flight Loads


<R05>
Sec. 25.321  General.

    (a) Flight load factors represent the ratio of the aerodynamic force 
component (acting normal to the assumed longitudinal axis of the 
airplane) to the weight of the airplane. A positive load factor is one 
in which the aerodynamic force acts upward with respect to the airplane.
    (b) Considering compressibility effects at each speed, compliance 
with the flight load requirements of this subpart must be shown--
    (1) At each critical altitude within the range of altitudes selected 
by the applicant;
    (2) At each weight from the design minimum weight to the design 
maximum weight appropriate to each particular flight load condition; and
    (3) For each required altitude and weight, for any practicable 
distribution of disposable load within the operating limitations 
recorded in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (c) Enough points on and within the boundaries of the design 
envelope must be investigated to ensure that the maximum load for each 
part of the airplane structure is obtained.
    (d) The significant forces acting on the airplane must be placed in 
equilibrium in a rational or conservative manner. The linear inertia 
forces must be considered in equilibrium with the thrust and all 
aerodynamic loads, while the angular (pitching) inertia forces must be 
considered in equilibrium with thrust and all aerodynamic moments, 
including moments due to loads on components such as tail surfaces and 
nacelles. Critical thrust values in the range from zero to maximum 
continuous thrust must be considered.

                  Flight Maneuver and Gust Conditions 


<R05>
Sec. 25.331  Symmetric maneuvering conditions.

    (a) Procedure. For the analysis of the maneuvering flight conditions 
specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the following 
provisions apply:
    (1) Where sudden displacement of a control is specified, the assumed 
rate of control surface displacement may not be less than the rate that 
could be applied by the pilot through the control system.
    (2) In determining elevator angles and chordwise load distribution 
in the maneuvering conditions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
the effect of corresponding pitching velocities must be taken into 
account. The in-trim and out-of-trim flight conditions specified in 
Sec. 25.255 must be considered.
    (b) Maneuvering balanced conditions.  Assuming the airplane to be in 
equilibrium with zero pitching acceleration, the maneuvering conditions 
A through I on the maneuvering envelope in Sec. 25.333(b) must be 
investigated.
    (c) Maneuvering pitching conditions.  The following conditions 
involving pitching acceleration must be investigated:
    (1) Maximum elevator displacement at V<INF>A</INF>. The airplane is 
assumed to be flying in steady level flight (point A<INF>1</INF>, 
Sec. 25.333(b)) and, except as limited by pilot effort in accordance 
with Sec. 25.397(b), the pitching control is suddenly moved to obtain 
extreme positive pitching acceleration (nose up). The dynamic response 
or, at the option of the applicant, the transient rigid body response of 
the airplane, must be taken into account in determining the tail load. 
Airplane loads which occur subsequent to the normal acceleration at the 
center of gravity exceeding the maximum positive limit maneuvering load 
factor, n, need not be considered.
    (2) Specified control displacement. A checked maneuver, based on a 
rational pitching control motion vs. time profile, must be established 
in which the design limit load factor specified in Sec. 25.337 will not 
be exceeded. Unless lesser values cannot be exceeded, the airplane 
response must result in pitching accelerations not less than the 
following:
    (i) A positive pitching acceleration (nose up) is assumed to be 
reached concurrently with the airplane load factor of 1.0 (Points 
A<INF>1</INF> to D<INF>1</INF>, Sec. 25.333(b)). The positive 
acceleration must be equal to at least

[[Page 354]]

where--

n is the positive load factor at the speed under consideration, and V is 
          the airplane equivalent speed in knots.

    (ii) A negative pitching acceleration (nose down) is assumed to be 
reached concurrently with the positive maneuvering load factor (points 
A<INF>2</INF> to D<INF>2</INF>, Sec. 25.333(b)). This negative pitching 
acceleration must be equal to at least

where--

n is the positive load factor at the speed under consideration; and V is 
          the airplane equivalent speed in knots.

    (a) General. The strength requirements must be met at each 
combination of airspeed and load factor on and within the boundaries of 
the representative maneuvering envelope (V-n diagram) of paragraph (b) 
of this section. This envelope must also be used in determining the 
airplane structural operating limitations as specified in Sec. 25.1501.

Sec. 25.335  Design airspeeds.

    The selected design airspeeds are equivalent airspeeds (EAS). 
Estimated values of V<INF>S0</INF> and V<INF>S1</INF> must be 
conservative.

[[Page 355]]

    (a) Design cruising speed, V<INF>C</INF>. For V<INF>C</INF>, the 
following apply:
    (1) The minimum value of V<INF>C!</INF>must be sufficiently greater 
than V<INF>B!</INF>to provide for inadvertent speed increases likely to 
occur as a result of severe atmospheric turbulence.
    (2) In the absence of a rational investigation substantiating the 
use of other values, V<INF>C!</INF>may not be less than V<INF>B</INF>+43 
knots. However, it need not exceed the maximum speed in level flight at 
maximum continuous power for the corresponding altitude.
    (3) At altitudes where V<INF>D!</INF>is limited by Mach number, 
V<INF>C!</INF>may be limited to a selected Mach number.
    (b) Design dive speed, V<INF>D</INF>. V<INF>D!</INF>must be selected 
so that V<INF>C</INF>/M<INF>C!</INF>is not greater than 0.8 
V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF>, or so that the minimum speed margin between 
V<INF>C</INF>/M<INF>C!</INF>and V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D!</INF>is the 
greater of the following values:
    (1) From an initial condition of stabilized flight at V<INF>C</INF>/
M<INF>C</INF>, the airplane is upset, flown for 20 seconds along a 
flight path 7.5 deg. below the initial path, and then pulled up at a 
load factor of 1.5 g (0.5 g  acceleration increment). The speed increase 
occurring in this maneuver may be calculated if reliable or conservative 
aerodynamic data is used. Power as specified in Sec. 25.175(b)(1)(iv) is 
assumed until the pullup is initiated, at which time power reduction and 
the use of pilot controlled drag devices may be assumed;
    (2) The minimum speed margin must be enough to provide for 
atmospheric variations (such as horizontal gusts, and penetration of jet 
streams and cold fronts) and for instrument errors and airframe 
production variations. These factors may be considered on a probability 
basis. However, the margin at altitude where M<INF>C!</INF>is limited by 
compressibility effects may not be less than 0.05 M.
    (c) Design maneuvering speed V<INF>A</INF>. For V<INF>A</INF>, the 
following apply:
    (1) V<INF>A</INF> may not be less than V<INF>S1</INF> <radical>n 
where--
    (i) n is the limit positive maneuvering load factor at 
V<INF>C</INF>; and
    (ii) V<INF>S1</INF> is the stalling speed with flaps retracted.
    (2) V<INF>A!</INF>and V<INF>S!</INF>must be evaluated at the design 
weight and altitude under consideration.
    (3) V<INF>A!</INF>need not be more than V<INF>C!</INF>or the speed 
at which the positive C<INF>N!max!</INF>curve intersects the positive 
maneuver load factor line, whichever is less.
    (d) Design speed for maximum gust intensity, V<INF>B</INF>.
    (1) V<INF>B</INF> may not be less than
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09FE96.016
    
where--
V<INF>S1</INF>=the 1-g stalling speed based on C<INF>NAmax</INF> with 
the flaps retracted at the particular weight under consideration;
V<INF>c</INF>=design cruise speed (knots equivalent airspeed);
U<INF>ref</INF>=the reference gust velocity (feet per second equivalent 
airspeed) from Sec. 25.341(a)(5)(i);
w=average wing loading (pounds per square foot) at the particular weight 
under consideration.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09FE96.017

<greek-r>=density of air (slugs/ft<SUP>3</SUP>);
c=mean geometric chord of the wing (feet);
g=acceleration due to gravity (ft/sec<SUP>2</SUP>);
a=slope of the airplane normal force coefficient curve, C<INF>NA</INF> 
per radian;

    (2) At altitudes where V<INF>C</INF> is limited by Mach number--
    (i) V<INF>B</INF> may be chosen to provide an optimum margin between 
low and high speed buffet boundaries; and,
    (ii) V<INF>B</INF> need not be greater than V<INF>C</INF>.
    (e) Design flap speeds, V<INF>F</INF>. For V<INF>F</INF>, the 
following apply:
    (1) The design flap speed for each flap position (established in 
accordance with Sec. 25.697(a)) must be sufficiently greater than the 
operating speed recommended for the corresponding stage of flight 
(including balked landings) to allow for probable variations in control 
of airspeed and for transition from one flap position to another.
    (2) If an automatic flap positioning or load limiting device is 
used, the speeds

[[Page 356]]

and corresponding flap positions programmed or allowed by the device may 
be used.
    (3) V<INF>F!</INF>may not be less than--
    (i) 1.6 V<INF>S1</INF> with the flaps in takeoff position at maximum 
takeoff weight;
    (ii) 1.8 V<INF>S1</INF> with the flaps in approach position at 
maximum landing weight, and
    (iii) 1.8 V<INF>S0</INF> with the flaps in landing position at 
maximum landing weight.
    (f) Design drag device speeds, V<INF>DD</INF>. The selected design 
speed for each drag device must be sufficiently greater than the speed 
recommended for the operation of the device to allow for probable 
variations in speed control. For drag devices intended for use in high 
speed descents, V<INF>DD!</INF>may not be less than V<INF>D</INF>. When 
an automatic drag device positioning or load limiting means is used, the 
speeds and corresponding drag device positions programmed or allowed by 
the automatic means must be used for design.

Sec. 25.337  Limit maneuvering load factors.

    (a) Except where limited by maximum (static) lift coefficients, the 
airplane is assumed to be subjected to symmetrical maneuvers resulting 
in the limit maneuvering load factors prescribed in this section. 
Pitching velocities appropriate to the corresponding pull-up and steady 
turn maneuvers must be taken into account.
    (b) The positive limit maneuvering load factor ``n'' for any speed 
up to Vn may not be less than 2.1+24,000/ (W +10,000) except that ``n'' 
may not be less than 2.5 and need not be greater than 3.8--where ``W'' 
is the design maximum takeoff weight.
    (c) The negative limit maneuvering load factor--
    (1) May not be less than -1.0 at speeds up to V<INF>C</INF>; and
    (2) Must vary linearly with speed from the value at V<INF>C!</INF>to 
zero at V<INF>D</INF>.
    (d) Maneuvering load factors lower than those specified in this 
section may be used if the airplane has design features that make it 
impossible to exceed these values in flight.

Sec. 25.341  Gust and turbulence loads.

    (a) Discrete Gust Design Criteria. The airplane is assumed to be 
subjected to symmetrical vertical and lateral gusts in level flight. 
Limit gust loads must be determined in accordance with the provisions:
    (1) Loads on each part of the structure must be determined by 
dynamic analysis. The analysis must take into account unsteady 
aerodynamic characteristics and all significant structural degrees of 
freedom including rigid body motions.
    (2) The shape of the gust must be:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09FE96.018
    
for 0 <ls-thn-eq> s <ls-thn-eq> 2H
where--
s=distance penetrated into the gust (feet);
U<INF>ds</INF>=the design gust velocity in equivalent airspeed specified 
in paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and
H=the gust gradient which is the distance (feet) parallel to the 
airplane's flight path for the gust to reach its peak velocity.

    (3) A sufficient number of gust gradient distances in the range 30 
feet to 350 feet must be investigated to find the critical response for 
each load quantity.
    (4) The design gust velocity must be:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09FE96.019
    
where--
U<INF>ref</INF>=the reference gust velocity in equivalent airspeed 
defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
F<INF>g</INF>=the flight profile alleviation factor defined in paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section.

    (5) The following reference gust velocities apply:
    (i) At the airplane design speed V<INF>C</INF>: Positive and 
negative gusts with reference gust velocities of 56.0 ft/sec EAS must be 
considered at sea level. The

[[Page 357]]

reference gust velocity may be reduced linearly from 56.0 ft/sec EAS at 
sea level to 44.0 ft/sec EAS at 15000 feet. The reference gust velocity 
may be further reduced linearly from 44.0 ft/sec EAS at 15000 feet to 
26.0 ft/sec EAS at 50000 feet.
    (ii) At the airplane design speed V<INF>D</INF>: The reference gust 
velocity must be 0.5 times the value obtained under 
Sec. 25.341(a)(5)(i).
    (6) The flight profile alleviation factor, F<INF>g</INF>, must be 
increased linearly from the sea level value to a value of 1.0 at the 
maximum operating altitude defined in Sec. 25.1527. At sea level, the 
flight profile alleviation factor is determined by the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN08MR96.004

Z<INF>mo</INF>=Maximum operating altitude defined in Sec. 25.1527.

    (7) When a stability augmentation system is included in the 
analysis, the effect of any significant system nonlinearities should be 
accounted for when deriving limit loads from limit gust conditions.
    (b) Continuous Gust Design Criteria. The dynamic response of the 
airplane to vertical and lateral continuous turbulence must be taken 
into account. The continuous gust design criteria of Appendix G of this 
part must be used to establish the dynamic response unless more rational 
criteria are shown.

Sec. 25.343  Design fuel and oil loads.

    (a) The disposable load combinations must include each fuel and oil 
load in the range from zero fuel and oil to the selected maximum fuel 
and oil load. A structural reserve fuel condition, not exceeding 45 
minutes of fuel under the operating conditions in Sec. 25.1001(e) and 
(f), as applicable, may be selected.
    (b) If a structural reserve fuel condition is selected, it must be 
used as the minimum fuel weight condition for showing compliance with 
the flight load requirements as prescribed in this subpart. In 
addition--
    (1) The structure must be designed for a condition of zero fuel and 
oil in the wing at limit loads corresponding to--
    (i) A maneuvering load factor of +2.25; and
    (ii) The gust conditions of Sec. 25.341(a) but assuming 85% of the 
design velocities prescribed in Sec. 25.341(a)(4).
    (2) Fatigue evaluation of the structure must account for any 
increase in operating stresses resulting from the design condition of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (3) The flutter, deformation, and vibration requirements must also 
be met with zero fuel.

    (a) If wing flaps are to be used during takeoff, approach, or 
landing, at the design flap speeds established for these stages of 
flight under Sec. 25.335(e) and with the wing flaps in the corresponding 
positions, the airplane is assumed to be subjected to symmetrical 
maneuvers and gusts. The resulting limit loads must correspond to the 
conditions determined as follows:
    (1) Maneuvering to a positive limit load factor of 2.0; and
    (2) Positive and negative gusts of 25 ft/sec EAS acting normal to 
the flight path in level flight. Gust loads resulting on each part of 
the structure must be determined by rational analysis. The analysis must 
take into account

[[Page 358]]

the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics and rigid body motions of the 
aircraft. The shape of the gust must be as described in 
Sec. 25.341(a)(2) except that--

U<INF>ds</INF>=25 ft/sec EAS;
H=12.5 c; and
c=mean geometric chord of the wing (feet).

    (b) The airplane must be designed for the conditions prescribed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, except that the airplane load factor need 
not exceed 1.0, taking into account, as separate conditions, the effects 
of--
    (1) Propeller slipstream corresponding to maximum continuous power 
at the design flap speeds V<INF>F</INF>, and with takeoff power at not 
less than 1.4 times the stalling speed for the particular flap position 
and associated maximum weight; and
    (2) A head-on gust of 25 feet per second velocity (EAS).
    (c) If flaps or other high lift devices are to be used in en route 
conditions, and with flaps in the appropriate position at speeds up to 
the flap design speed chosen for these conditions, the airplane is 
assumed to be subjected to symmetrical maneuvers and gusts within the 
range determined by--
    (1) Maneuvering to a positive limit load factor as prescribed in 
Sec. 25.337(b); and
    (2) The discrete vertical gust criteria in Sec. 25.341(a).
    (d) The airplane must be designed for landing at the maximum takeoff 
weight with a maneuvering load factor of 1.5g and the flaps and similar 
high lift devices in the landing configuration.

Sec. 25.349  Rolling conditions.

    The airplane must be designed for loads resulting from the rolling 
conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 
Unbalanced aerodynamic moments about the center of gravity must be 
reacted in a rational or conservative manner, considering the principal 
masses furnishing the reaching inertia fores.
    (a) Maneuvering. The following conditions, speeds, and aileron 
deflections (except as the deflections may be limited by pilot effort) 
must be considered in combination with an airplane load factor of zero 
and of two-thirds of the positive maneuvering factor used in design. In 
determining the required aileron deflections, the torsional flexibility 
of the wing must be considered in accordance with Sec. 25.301(b):
    (1) Conditions corresponding to steady rolling velocities must be 
investigated. In addition, conditions corresponding to maximum angular 
acceleration must be investigated for airplanes with engines or other 
weight concentrations outboard of the fuselage. For the angular 
acceleration conditions, zero rolling velocity may be assumed in the 
absence of a rational time history investigation of the maneuver.
    (2) At V<INF>A,!</INF>a sudden deflection of the aileron to the stop 
is assumed.
    (3) At V<INF>C,!</INF>the aileron deflection must be that required 
to produce a rate of roll not less than that obtained in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (4) At V<INF>D,!</INF>the aileron deflection must be that required 
to produce a rate of roll not less than one-third of that in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Unsymmetrical gusts. The airplane is assumed to be subjected to 
unsymmetrical vertical gusts in level flight. The resulting limit loads 
must be determined from either the wing maximum airload derived directly 
from Sec. 25.341(a), or the wing maximum airload derived indirectly from 
the vertical load factor calculated from Sec. 25.341(a). It must be 
assumed that 100 percent of the wing air load acts on one side of the 
airplane and 80 percent of the wing air load acts on the other side.

furnishing the reacting inertia forces:

[[Page 359]]

    (a) Maneuvering. At speeds from V<INF>MC</INF> to V<INF>D</INF>, the 
following maneuvers must be considered. In computing the tail loads, the 
yawing velocity may be assumed to be zero:
    (1) With the airplane in unaccelerated flight at zero yaw, it is 
assumed that the rudder control is suddenly displaced to the maximum 
deflection, as limited by the control surface stops, or by a 300-pound 
rudder pedal force, whichever is less.
    (2) With the rudder deflected as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, it is assumed that the airplane yaws to the resulting 
sideslip angle.
    (3) With the airplane yawed to the static sideslip angle 
corresponding to the rudder deflection specified in paragraph (a)(1) of

torque corresponding to takeoff power and propeller speed, multiplied by

quick feathering, acting simultaneously with 1g level flight loads. In 
the absence of a rational analysis, a factor of 1.6 must be used.

supporting structure must be designed to withstand each of the 
following:
    (1) A limit engine torque load imposed by sudden engine stoppage due 
to malfunction or structural failure (such as compressor jamming).
    (2) A limit engine torque load imposed by the maximum acceleration 
of the engine.
    (c) The limit engine torque to be considered under paragraph (a) of 
this section must be obtained by multiplying mean torque for the 
specified power and speed by a factor of--

    (a) Each engine mount and its supporting structure must be designed 
for a limit load factor in a lateral direction, for the side load on the 
engine mount, at least equal to the maximum load factor obtained in the 
yawing conditions but not less than--

Sec. 25.365  Pressurized compartment loads.

    For airplanes with one or more pressurized compartments the 
following apply:
    (a) The airplane structure must be strong enough to withstand the 
flight loads combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to 
the maximum relief valve setting.

[[Page 360]]

    (b) The external pressure distribution in flight, and stress 
concentrations and fatigue effects must be accounted for.
    (c) If landings may be made with the compartment pressurized, 
landing loads must be combined with pressure differential loads from 
zero up to the maximum allowed during landing.
    (d) The airplane structure must be designed to be able to withstand 
the pressure differential loads corresponding to the maximum relief 
valve setting multiplied by a factor of 1.33 for airplanes to be 
approved for operation to 45,000 feet or by a factor of 1.67 for 
airplanes to be approved for operation above 45,000 feet, omitting other 
loads.
    (e) Any structure, component or part, inside or outside a 
pressurized compartment, the failure of which could interfere with 
continued safe flight and landing, must be designed to withstand the 
effects of a sudden release of pressure through an opening in any 
compartment at any operating altitude resulting from each of the 
following conditions:
    (1) The penetration of the compartment by a portion of an engine 
following an engine disintegration;
    (2) Any opening in any pressurized compartment up to the size 
H<INF>o</INF> in square feet; however, small compartments may be 
combined with an adjacent pressurized compartment and both considered as 
a single compartment for openings that cannot reasonably be expected to 
be confined to the small compartment. The size H<INF>o</INF> must be 
computed by the following formula:

    H<INF>o</INF>=PA<INF>s</INF>
    where,
    H<INF>o</INF>=Maximum opening in square feet, need not exceed 20 
square feet.

    A<INF>s</INF>=Maximum cross-sectional area of the pressurized shell 
normal to the longitudinal axis, in square feet; and

    (3) The maximum opening caused by airplane or equipment failures not 
shown to be extremely improbable.
    (f) In complying with paragraph (e) of this section, the fail-safe 
features of the design may be considered in determining the probability 
of failure or penetration and probable size of openings, provided that 
possible improper operation of closure devices and inadvertent door 
openings are also considered. Furthermore, the resulting differential 
pressure loads must be combined in a rational and conservative manner 
with 1-g level flight loads and any loads arising from emergency 
depressurization conditions. These loads may be considered as ultimate 
conditions; however, any deformations associated with these conditions 
must not interfere with continued safe flight and landing. The pressure 
relief provided by intercompartment venting may also be considered.
    (g) Bulkheads, floors, and partitions in pressurized compartments 
for occupants must be designed to withstand the conditions specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section. In addition, reasonable design 
precautions must be taken to minimize the probability of parts becoming 
detached and injuring occupants while in their seats.

Sec. 25.367  Unsymmetrical loads due to engine failure.

    (a) The airplane must be designed for the unsymmetrical loads 
resulting from the failure of the critical engine. Turbopropeller 
airplanes must be designed for the following conditions in combination 
with a single malfunction of the propeller drag limiting system, 
considering the probable pilot corrective action on the flight controls:
    (1) At speeds between V<INF>MC!</INF>and V<INF>D</INF>, the loads 
resulting from power failure because of fuel flow interruption are 
considered to be limit loads.
    (2) At speeds between V<INF>MC!</INF>and V<INF>C</INF>, the loads 
resulting from the disconnection of the engine compressor from the 
turbine or from loss of the turbine blades are considered to be ultimate 
loads.
    (3) The time history of the thrust decay and drag build-up occurring 
as a result of the prescribed engine failures must be substantiated by 
test or other data applicable to the particular engine-propeller 
combination.

[[Page 361]]

    (4) The timing and magnitude of the probable pilot corrective action 
must be conservatively estimated, considering the characteristics of the 
particular engine-propeller-airplane combination.
    (b) Pilot corrective action may be assumed to be initiated at the 
time maximum yawing velocity is reached, but not earlier than two 
seconds after the engine failure. The magnitude of the corrective action 
may be based on the control forces specified in Sec. 25.397(b) except 
that lower forces may be assumed where it is shown by anaylsis or test 
that these forces can control the yaw and roll resulting from the 
prescribed engine failure conditions.

Sec. 25.371  Gyroscopic loads.

    The structure supporting the engines and the auxiliary power units 
must be designed for the gyroscopic loads associated with the conditions

installed for use in en route conditions--
    (a) The airplane must be designed for the symmetrical maneuvers 
prescribed in Sec. 25.333 and Sec. 25.337, the yawing maneuvers 
prescribed in Sec. 25.351, and the vertical and later gust conditions 
prescribed in Sec. 25.341(a), at each setting and the maximum speed 
associated with that setting; and
    (b) If the device has automatic operating or load limiting features, 
the airplane must be designed for the maneuver and gust conditions 
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, at the speeds and 
corresponding device positions that the mechanism allows.

    The control surfaces must be designed for the limit loads resulting 
from the flight conditions in Secs. 25.331, 25.341(a), 25.349 and 25.351 
and the ground gust conditions in Sec. 25.415, considering the

Sec. 25.393  Loads parallel to hinge line.

    (a) Control surfaces and supporting hinge brackets must be designed 
for inertia loads acting parallel to the hinge line.
    (b) In the absence of more rational data, the inertia loads may be 
assumed to be equal to KW, where--

  (1) K=24 for vertical surfaces;
  (2) K=12 for horizontal surfaces; and
  (3) W=weight of the movable surfaces.

Sec. 25.395  Control system.

    (a) Longitudinal, lateral, directional, and drag control system and 
their supporting structures must be designed for loads corresponding to 
125 percent of the computed hinge moments of the movable control surface 
in the conditions prescribed in Sec. 25.391.
    (b) The system limit loads, except the loads resulting from ground 
gusts, need not exceed the loads that can be produced by the pilot (or 
pilots) and by automatic or power devices operating the controls.
    (c) The loads must not be less than those resulting from application 
of the minimum forces prescribed in Sec. 25.397(c).

<R05>
Sec. 25.397  Control system loads.

    (a) General. The maximum and minimum pilot forces, specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section, are assumed to act at the appropriate 
control grips or pads (in a manner simulating flight conditions) and to 
be reacted at the attachment of the control system to the control 
surface horn.

[[Page 362]]

    (b) Pilot effort effects. In the control surface flight loading 
condition, the air loads on movable surfaces and the corresponding 
deflections need not exceed those that would result in flight from the 
application of any pilot force within the ranges specified in paragraph 
(c) of this section. Two-thirds of the maximum values specified for the 
aileron and elevator may be used if control surface hinge moments are 
based on reliable data. In applying this criterion, the effects of servo 
mechanisms, tabs, and automatic pilot systems, must be considered.
    (c) Limit pilot forces and torques. The limit pilot forces and 
torques are as follows:

<R05>
Sec. 25.407  Trim tab effects.

    The effects of trim tabs on the control surface design conditions 
must be accounted for only where the surface loads are limited by 
maximum pilot effort. In these cases, the tabs are considered to be 
deflected in the direction that would assist the pilot, and the 
deflections are--
    (a) For elevator trim tabs, those required to trim the airplane at 
any point within the positive portion of the pertinent flight envelope 
in Sec. 25.333(b), except as limited by the stops; and
    (b) For aileron and rudder trim tabs, those required to trim the 
airplane in the critical unsymmetrical power and loading conditions, 
with appropriate allowance for rigging tolerances.


<R05>
Sec. 25.409  Tabs.

    (a) Trim tabs. Trim tabs must be designed to withstand loads arising 
from all likely combinations of tab setting, primary control position, 
and airplane speed (obtainable without exceeding the flight load 
conditions prescribed for the airplane as a whole), when the effect of 
the tab is opposed by pilot effort forces up to those specified in 
Sec. 25.397(b).
    (b) Balancing tabs. Balancing tabs must be designed for deflections 
consistent with the primary control surface loading conditions.
    (c) Servo tabs. Servo tabs must be designed for deflections 
consistent with the primary control surface loading conditions 
obtainable within the pilot maneuvering effort, considering possible 
opposition from the trim tabs.

<R05>
Sec. 25.415  Ground gust conditions.

    (a) The control system must be designed as follows for control 
surface loads due to ground gusts and taxiing downwind:
    (1) The control system between the stops nearest the surfaces and 
the cockpit controls must be designed for loads corresponding to the 
limit hinge moments H of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. These loads 
need not exceed--
    (i) The loads corresponding to the maximum pilot loads in 
Sec. 25.397(c) for each pilot alone; or
    (ii) 0.75 times these maximum loads for each pilot when the pilot 
forces are applied in the same direction.
    (2) The control system stops nearest the surfaces, the control 
system locks, and the parts of the systems (if any) between these stops 
and locks and the control surface horns, must be designed for limit 
hinge moments H obtained from the formula, H=KcS<INF>s</INF>q, where--

H=limit hinge moment (ft. lbs.);
c=mean chord of the control surface aft of the hinge line (ft.);
S<INF>s</INF>=area of the control surface aft of the hinge line (sq. 
          ft.);

          14.6(W/S)<SUP>12</SUP>+14.6 (f.p.s.), except that the design 
          speed need not exceed 88 f.p.s. (W/S is wing loading based on

Sec. 25.427  Unsymmetrical loads.

    (a) In designing the airplane for lateral gust, yaw maneuver and 
roll maneuver conditions, account must be taken of unsymmetrical loads 
on the empennage arising from effects such as slipstream and aerodynamic 
interference with the wing, vertical fin and other aerodynamic surfaces.
    (b) The horizontal tail must be assumed to be subjected to 
unsymmetrical loading conditions determined as follows:
    (1) 100 percent of the maximum loading from the symmetrical maneuver 
conditions of Sec. 25.331 and the vertical gust conditions of 
Sec. 25.341(a) acting separately on the surface on one side of the plane 
of symmetry; and
    (2) 80 percent of these loadings acting on the other side.
    (c) For empennage arrangements where the horizontal tail surfaces 
have dihedral angles greater than plus or minus 10 degrees, or are 
supported by the vertical tail surfaces, the surfaces and the supporting 
structure must be designed for gust velocities specified in 
Sec. 25.341(a) acting in any orientation at right angles to the flight 
path.
    (d) Unsymmetrical loading on the empennage arising from buffet 
conditions of Sec. 25.305(e) must be taken into account.

Sec. 25.445  Auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces.

    (a) When significant, the aerodynamic influence between auxiliary 
aerodynamic surfaces, such as outboard fins and winglets, and their 
supporting aerodynamic surfaces, must be taken into account for all 
loading conditions including pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers, and gusts 
as specified in Sec. 25.341(a) acting at any orientation at right angles 
to the flight path.
    (b) To provide for unsymmetrical loading when outboard fins extend 
above and below the horizontal surface, the critical vertical surface

<R05>
Sec. 25.471  General.

    (a) Loads and equilibrium. For limit ground loads--
    (1) Limit ground loads obtained under this subpart are considered to 
be external forces applied to the airplane structure; and
    (2) In each specified ground load condition, the external loads must 
be placed in equilibrium with the linear and angular inertia loads in a 
rational or conservative manner.
    (b) Critical centers of gravity. The critical centers of gravity 
within the range for which certification is requested must be selected 
so that the maximum design loads are obtained in each landing gear 
element. Fore and aft, vertical, and lateral airplane centers of gravity 
must be considered. Lateral displacements of the c.g. from the airplane 
centerline which would result in main gear loads not greater than 103 
percent of the critical design load for symmetrical loading conditions 
may be selected without considering the effects of these lateral c.g. 
displacements on the loading of the main gear elements, or on the 
airplane structure provided--
    (1) The lateral displacement of the c.g. results from random 
passenger or cargo disposition within the fuselage or from random 
unsymmetrical fuel loading or fuel usage; and
    (2) Appropriate loading instructions for random disposable loads are 
included under the provisions of Sec. 25.1583(c)(1) to ensure that the 
lateral displacement of the center of gravity is maintained within these 
limits.
    (c) Landing gear dimension data. Figure 1 of Appendix A contains the 
basic landing gear dimension data.

Sec. 25.473  Ground load conditions and assumptions.

    (a) For the landing conditions specified in Secs. 25.479 through 
25.485, the following apply:
    (1) The selected limit vertical inertia load factors at the center 
of gravity of the airplane may not be less than the values that would be 
obtained--
    (i) In the attitude and subject to the drag loads associated with 
the particular landing condition;
    (ii) With a limit descent velocity of 10 f.p.s. at the design 
landing weight (the maximum weight for landing conditions at the maximum 
descent velocity); and
    (iii) With a limit descent velocity of 6 f.p.s. at the design 
takeoff weight (the maximum weight for landing conditions at a reduced 
descent velocity).
    (2) Airplane lift, not exceeding the airplane weight, may be assumed 
to exist throughout the landing impact and to act through the center of 
gravity of the airplane.
    (b) The prescribed descent velocities may be modified if it is shown 
that the airplane has design features that make it impossible to develop 
these velocities.
    (c) The minimum limit inertia load factors corresponding to the 
required limit descent velocities must be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 25.723(a).

arrangements of main and nose gears, or main and tail gears, when normal 
operating techniques are used.


<R05>
Sec. 25.479  Level landing conditions.

    (a) In the level attitude, the airplane is assumed to contact the 
ground at forward velocity components, ranging from V<INF>L1</INF> to 
1.25 V<INF>L2</INF> parallel to the

[[Page 365]]

ground, and to be subjected to the load factors prescribed in 
Sec. 25.473(a)(1) with--
    (1) V<INF>L1</INF> equal to V<INF>S0</INF> (TAS) at the appropriate 
landing weight and in standard sea level conditions; and
    (2) V<INF>L2</INF> equal to V<INF>S0</INF> (TAS) at the appropriate 
landing weight and altitudes in a hot day temperature of 41 degrees F. 
above standard.
    (b) The effects of increased contact speeds must be investigated if 
approval of downwind landings exceeding 10 knots is desired.
    (c) Assuming that the following combinations of vertical and drag 
components act at the axle centerline, the following apply:
    (1) For the condition of maximum wheel spin-up load, drag components 
simulating the forces required to accelerate the wheel rolling assembly 
up to the specified ground speed must be combined with the vertical 
ground reactions existing at the instant of peak drag loads. The 
coefficient of friction between the tires and the ground may be 
established by considering the effects of skidding velocity and tire 
pressure. However, this coefficient of friction need not be more than 
0.8. This condition must be applied to the landing gear, directly 
affected attaching structure, and large mass items such as external fuel 
tanks and nacelles.
    (2) For the condition of maximum wheel vertical load, an aft acting 
drag component of not less than 25 percent of the maximum vertical 
ground reaction must be combined with the maximum ground reaction of 
Sec. 25.473.
    (3) For the condition of maximum springback load, forward-acting 
horizontal loads resulting from a rapid reduction of the spin-up drag 
loads must be combined with the vertical ground reactions at the instant 
of the peak forward load. This condition must be applied to the landing 
gear, directly affected attaching structure, and large mass items such 
as external fuel tanks and nacelles.
    (d) For the level landing attitude for airplanes with tail wheels, 
the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section 
must be investigated with the airplane horizontal reference line 
horizontal in accordance with figure 2 of Appendix A.
    (e) For the level landing attitude for airplanes with nose wheels, 
shown in figure 2 of Appendix A, the conditions specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (c) of this section must be investigated, assuming the 
following attitudes:
    (1) An attitude in which the main wheels are assumed to contact the 
ground with the nose wheel just clear of the ground.
    (2) If reasonably attainable at the specified descent and forward 
velocities, an attitude in which the nose and main wheels are assumed to 
contact the ground simultaneously. For this attitude--
    (i) The nose and main gear may be separately investigated under the 
conditions in paragraph (c)(1) and (3) of this section; and
    (ii) The pitching moment is assumed, under the condition in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to be resisted by the nose gear.

    (a) In the tail-down attitude, the airplane is assumed to contact 
the ground at forward velocity components, ranging from V<INF>L1</INF> 
to V<INF>L2</INF>, parallel to the ground, and is subjected to the load 
factors prescribed in Sec. 25.473(a)(1) with--
    (1) V<INF>L1</INF> equal to V<INF>S0</INF> (TAS) at the appropriate 
landing weight and in standard sea level conditions; and
    (2) V<INF>L2</INF> equal to V<INF>S0</INF> (TAS) at the appropriate 
landing weight and altitudes in a hot day temperature of 41 degrees F. 
above standard.

The combination of vertical and drag components specified in 
Sec. 25.479(c)(1) and (3) is considered to be acting at the main wheel 
axle centerline.
    (b) For the tail-down landing condition for airplanes with tail 
wheels, the main and tail wheels are assumed to contact the ground 
simultaneously, in accordance with figure 3 of Appendix A. Ground 
reaction conditions on the tail wheel are assumed to act--
    (1) Vertically; and
    (2) Up and aft through the axle at 45 degrees to the ground line.
    (c) For the tail-down landing condition for airplanes with nose 
wheels, the

[[Page 366]]

airplane is assumed to be at an attitude corresponding to either the 
stalling angle or the maximum angle allowing clearance with the ground 
by each part of the airplane other than the main wheels, in accordance 
with figure 3 of Appendix A, whichever is less.


<R05>
Sec. 25.483  One-wheel landing conditions.

    For the one-wheel landing condition, the airplane is assumed to be 
in the level attitude and to contact the ground on one side of the main 
landing gear, in accordance with Figure 4 of Appendix A. In this 
attitude--
    (a) The ground reactions must be the same as those obtained on that 
side under Sec. 25.479(c)(2); and
    (b) Each unbalanced external load must be reacted by airplane 
inertia in a rational or conservative manner.

    (a) For the side load condition, the airplane is assumed to be in 
the level attitude with only the main wheels contacting the ground, in 
accordance with figure 5 of Appendix A.
    (b) Side loads of 0.8 of the vertical reaction (on one side) acting 
inward and 0.6 of the vertical reaction (on the other side) acting 
outward must be combined with one-half of the maximum vertical ground 
reactions obtained in the level landing conditions. These loads are 
assumed to be applied at the ground contact point and to be resisted by 
the inertia of the airplane. The drag loads may be assumed to be zero.


<R05>
Sec. 25.487  Rebound landing condition.

    (a) The landing gear and its supporting structure must be 
investigated for the loads occurring during rebound of the airplane from 
the landing surface.
    (b) With the landing gear fully extended and not in contact with the 
ground, a load factor of 20.0 must act on the unsprung weights of the 
landing gear. This load factor must act in the direction of motion of 
the unsprung weights as they reach their limiting positions in extending 
with relation to the sprung parts of the landing gear.


<R05>
Sec. 25.489  Ground handling conditions.

    Unless otherwise prescribed, the landing gear and airplane structure 
must be investigated for the conditions in Secs. 25.491 through 25.509 
with the airplane at the design ramp weight (the maximum weight for 
ground handling conditions). No wing lift may be considered. The shock 
absorbers and tires may be assumed to be in their static position.

described in Sec. 25.235.


<R05>
Sec. 25.493  Braked roll conditions.

    (a) An airplane with a tail wheel is assumed to be in the level 
attitude with the load on the main wheels, in accordance with figure 6 
of Appendix A. The limit vertical load factor is 1.2 at the design 
landing weight and 1.0 at the design ramp weight. A drag reaction equal 
to the vertical reaction multiplied by a coefficient of friction of 0.8, 
must be combined with the vertical ground reaction and applied at the 
ground contact point.
    (b) For an airplane with a nose wheel the limit vertical load factor 
is 1.2 at the design landing weight, and 1.0 at the design ramp weight. 
A drag reaction equal to the vertical reaction, multiplied by a 
coefficient of friction of 0.8, must be combined with the vertical 
reaction and applied at the ground contact point of each wheel with 
brakes. The following two attitudes, in accordance with figure 6 of 
Appendix A, must be considered:
    (1) The level attitude with the wheels contacting the ground and the 
loads distributed between the main and nose gear. Zero pitching 
acceleration is assumed.
    (2) The level attitude with only the main gear contacting the ground 
and with the pitching moment resisted by angular acceleration.
    (c) A drag reaction lower than that prescribed in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section may be used if it is substantiated that an effective 
drag force

[[Page 367]]

of 0.8 times the vertical reaction cannot be attained under any likely 
loading condition.

vertical reaction.


<R05>
Sec. 25.497  Tail-wheel yawing.

    (a) A vertical ground reaction equal to the static load on the tail 
wheel, in combination with a side component of equal magnitude, is 
assumed.
    (b) If there is a swivel, the tail wheel is assumed to be swiveled 
90 deg. to the airplane longitudinal axis with the resultant load 
passing through the axle.
    (c) If there is a lock, steering device, or shimmy damper the tail 
wheel is also assumed to be in the trailing position with the side load 
acting at the ground contact point.


<R05>
Sec. 25.499  Nose-wheel yaw.

    (a) A vertical load factor of 1.0 at the airplane center of gravity, 
and a side component at the nose wheel ground contact equal to 0.8 of 
the vertical ground reaction at that point are assumed.
    (b) With the airplane assumed to be in static equilibrium with the 
loads resulting from the use of brakes on one side of the main landing 
gear, the nose gear, its attaching structure, and the fuselage structure 
forward of the center of gravity must be designed for the following 
loads:
    (1) A vertical load factor at the center of gravity of 1.0.
    (2) A forward acting load at the airplane center of gravity of 0.8 
times the vertical load on one main gear.
    (3) Side and vertical loads at the ground contact point on the nose 
gear that are required for static equilibrium.
    (4) A side load factor at the airplane center of gravity of zero.
    (c) If the loads prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section result 
in a nose gear side load higher than 0.8 times the vertical nose gear 
load, the design nose gear side load may be limited to 0.8 times the 
vertical load, with unbalanced yawing moments assumed to be resisted by 
airplane inertia forces.
    (d) For other than the nose gear, its attaching structure, and the 
forward fuselage structure, the loading conditions are those prescribed 
in paragraph (b) of this section, except that--
    (1) A lower drag reaction may be used if an effective drag force of 
0.8 times the vertical reaction cannot be reached under any likely 
loading condition; and
    (2) The forward acting load at the center of gravity need not exceed 
the maximum drag reaction on one main gear, determined in accordance 
with Sec. 25.493(b).
    (e) With the airplane at design ramp weight, and the nose gear in 
any steerable position, the combined application of full normal steering 
torque and a vertical force equal to the maximum static reaction on the 
nose gear must be considered in designing the nose gear, its attaching 
structure, and the forward fuselage structure.

Sec. 25.503  Pivoting.

    (a) The airplane is assumed to pivot about one side of the main gear 
with the brakes on that side locked. The limit vertical load factor must 
be 1.0 and the coefficient of friction 0.8.
    (b) The airplane is assumed to be in static equilibrium, with the 
loads being applied at the ground contact points, in accordance with 
figure 8 of Appendix A.


<R05>

Horizontal reactions parallel to the ground and directed forward must be 
applied at the ground contact point of each wheel with brakes. The limit 
loads must be equal to 0.55 times the vertical

load at each wheel or to the load developed by 1.2 times the nominal 
maximum static brake torque, whichever is less.
    (b) For airplanes with nose wheels, the pitching moment must be 
balanced by rotational inertia.
    (c) For airplanes with tail wheels, the resultant of the ground

Sec. 25.509  Towing loads.

    (a) The towing loads specified in paragraph (d) of this section must 
be considered separately. These loads must be applied at the towing 
fittings and must act parallel to the ground. In addition--
    (1) A vertical load factor equal to 1.0 must be considered acting at 
the center of gravity;
    (2) The shock struts and tires must be in their static positions; 
and
    (3) With W<INF>T!</INF>as the design ramp weight, the towing load, 
F<INF>TOW</INF>, is--
    (i) 0.3 W<INF>T!</INF>for W<INF>T!</INF>less than 30,000 pounds;
    (ii) (6W<INF>T</INF>+450,000)/7 for W<INF>T!</INF>between 30,000 and 
100,000 pounds; and
    (iii) 0.15 W<INF>T!</INF>for W<INF>T!</INF>over 100,000 pounds.
    (b) For towing points not on the landing gear but near the plane of 
symmetry of the airplane, the drag and side tow load components 
specified for the auxiliary gear apply. For towing points located 
outboard of the main gear, the drag and side tow load components 
specified for the main gear apply. Where the specified angle of swivel 
cannot be reached, the maximum obtainable angle must be used.
    (c) The towing loads specified in paragraph (d) of this section must 
be reacted as follows:
    (1) The side component of the towing load at the main gear must be 
reacted by a side force at the static ground line of the wheel to which 
the load is applied.
    (2) The towing loads at the auxiliary gear and the drag components 
of the towing loads at the main gear must be reacted as follows:
    (i) A reaction with a maximum value equal to the vertical reaction 
must be applied at the axle of the wheel to which the load is applied. 
Enough airplane inertia to achieve equilibrium must be applied.
    (ii) The loads must be reacted by airplane inertia.

    (a) General. Multiple-wheel landing gear units are assumed to be 
subjected to the limit ground loads prescribed in this subpart under 
paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. In addition--
    (1) A tandem strut gear arrangement is a multiple-wheel unit; and
    (2) In determining the total load on a gear unit with respect to the 
provisions of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, the transverse 
shift in the load centroid, due to unsymmetrical load distribution on 
the wheels, may be neglected.

[[Page 369]]

    (b) Distribution of limit loads to wheels; tires inflated. The 
distribution of the limit loads among the wheels of the landing gear 
must be established for each landing, taxiing, and ground handling 
condition, taking into account the effects of the following factors:
    (1) The number of wheels and their physical arrangements. For truck 
type landing gear units, the effects of any seesaw motion of the truck 
during the landing impact must be considered in determining the maximum 
design loads for the fore and aft wheel pairs.
    (2) Any differentials in tire diameters resulting from a combination 
of manufacturing tolerances, tire growth, and tire wear. A maximum tire-
diameter differential equal to \2/3\ of the most unfavorable combination 
of diameter variations that is obtained when taking into account 
manufacturing tolerances, tire growth, and tire wear, may be assumed.
    (3) Any unequal tire inflation pressure, assuming the maximum 
variation to be <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 percent of the nominal tire 
inflation pressure.
    (4) A runway crown of zero and a runway crown having a convex upward 
shape that may be approximated by a slope of 1\1/2\ percent with the 
horizontal. Runway crown effects must be considered with the nose gear 
unit on either slope of the crown.
    (5) The airplane attitude.
    (6) Any structural deflections.
    (c) Deflated tires. The effect of deflated tires on the structure 
must be considered with respect to the loading conditions specified in 
paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section, taking into account the 
physical arrangement of the gear components. In addition--
    (1) The deflation of any one tire for each multiple wheel landing 
gear unit, and the deflation of any two critical tires for each landing 
gear unit using four or more wheels per unit, must be considered; and
    (2) The ground reactions must be applied to the wheels with inflated 
tires except that, for multiple-wheel gear units with more than one 
shock strut, a rational distribution of the ground reactions between the 
deflated and inflated tires, accounting for the differences in shock 
strut extensions resulting from a deflated tire, may be used.
    (d) Landing conditions. For one and for two deflated tires, the 
applied load to each gear unit is assumed to be 60 percent and 50 
percent, respectively, of the limit load applied to each gear for each 
of the prescribed landing conditions. However, for the drift landing 
condition of Sec. 25.485, 100 percent of the vertical load must be 
applied.
    (e) Taxiing and ground handling conditions.  For one and for two 
deflated tires--
    (1) The applied side or drag load factor, or both factors, at the 
center of gravity must be the most critical value up to 50 percent and 
40 percent, respectively, of the limit side or drag load factors, or 
both factors, corresponding to the most severe condition resulting from 
consideration of the prescribed taxiing and ground handling conditions;
    (2) For the braked roll conditions of Sec. 25.493(a) and (b)(2), the 
drag loads on each inflated tire may not be less than those at each tire 
for the symmetrical load distribution with no deflated tires;
    (3) The vertical load factor at the center of gravity must be 60 
percent and 50 percent, respectively, of the factor with no deflated 
tires, except that it may not be less than 1g; and
    (4) Pivoting need not be considered.
    (f) Towing conditions. For one and for two deflated tires, the 
towing load, F<INF>TOW</INF>, must be 60 percent and 50 percent, 
respectively, of the load prescribed.

Sec. 25.519  Jacking and tie-down provisions.

    (a) General. The airplane must be designed to withstand the limit 
load conditions resulting from the static ground load conditions of 
paragraph (b) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (c) of this 
section at the most critical combinations of airplane weight and center 
of gravity. The maximum allowable load at each jack pad must be 
specified.
    (b) Jacking. The airplane must have provisions for jacking and must 
withstand the following limit loads when the airplane is supported on 
jacks--

[[Page 370]]

    (1) For jacking by the landing gear at the maximum ramp weight of 
the airplane, the airplane structure must be designed for a vertical 
load of 1.33 times the vertical static reaction at each jacking point 
acting singly and in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times 
the vertical static reaction applied in any direction.
    (2) For jacking by other airplane structure at maximum approved 
jacking weight:
    (i) The airplane structure must be designed for a vertical load of 
1.33 times the vertical reaction at each jacking point acting singly and 
in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical static 
reaction applied in any direction.
    (ii) The jacking pads and local structure must be designed for a 
vertical load of 2.0 times the vertical static reaction at each jacking 
point, acting singly and in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 
times the vertical static reaction applied in any direction.
    (c) Tie-down. If tie-down points are provided, the main tie-down 
points and local structure must withstand the limit loads resulting from 
a 65-knot horizontal wind from any direction.

<R05>
Sec. 25.521  General.

    (a) Seaplanes must be designed for the water loads developed during 
takeoff and landing, with the seaplane in any attitude likely to occur 
in normal operation, and at the appropriate forward and sinking 
velocities under the most severe sea conditions likely to be 
encountered.
    (b) Unless a more rational analysis of the water loads is made, or 
the standards in ANC-3 are used, Secs. 25.523 through 25.537 apply.
    (c) The requirements of this section and Secs. 25.523 through 25.537 
apply also to amphibians.


<R05>
Sec. 25.523  Design weights and center of gravity positions.

    (a) Design weights. The water load requirements must be met at each 
operating weight up to the design landing weight except that, for the 
takeoff condition prescribed in Sec. 25.531, the design water takeoff 
weight (the maximum weight for water taxi and takeoff run) must be used.
    (b) Center of gravity positions. The critical centers of gravity 
within the limits for which certification is requested must be 
considered to reach maximum design loads for each part of the seaplane 
structure.

<R05>
Sec. 25.525  Application of loads.

    (a) Unless otherwise prescribed, the seaplane as a whole is assumed 
to be subjected to the loads corresponding to the load factors specified 
in Sec. 25.527.
    (b) In applying the loads resulting from the load factors prescribed 
in Sec. 25.527, the loads may be distributed over the hull or main float 
bottom (in order to avoid excessive local shear loads and bending 
moments at the location of water load application) using pressures not 
less than those prescribed in Sec. 25.533(b).
    (c) For twin float seaplanes, each float must be treated as an 
equivalent hull on a fictitious seaplane with a weight equal to one-half 
the weight of the twin float seaplane.
    (d) Except in the takeoff condition of Sec. 25.531, the aerodynamic 
lift on the seaplane during the impact is assumed to be \2/3\ of the 
weight of the seaplane.


<R05>
Sec. 25.527  Hull and main float load factors.

    (a) Water reaction load factors n<INF>W</INF> must be computed in 
the following manner:
    (1) For the step landing case
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.036
    
    (2) For the bow and stern landing cases
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.037
    
    (b) The following values are used:

[[Page 371]]

    (1) n<INF>W</INF>=water reaction load factor (that is, the water 
reaction divided by seaplane weight).
    (2) C<INF>1</INF>=empirical seaplane operations factor equal to 
0.012 (except that this factor may not be less than that necessary to 
obtain the minimum value of step load factor of 2.33).
    (3) V<INF>S0</INF>=seaplane stalling speed in knots with flaps 
extended in the appropriate landing position and with no slipstream 
effect.
    (4) <greek-b>=angle of dead rise at the longitudinal station at 
which the load factor is being determined in accordance with figure 1 of 
Appendix B.
    (5) W=seaplane design landing weight in pounds.
    (6) K<INF>1</INF>=empirical hull station weighing factor, in 
accordance with figure 2 of Appendix B.
    (7) r<INF>x</INF>=ratio of distance, measured parallel to hull 
reference axis, from the center of gravity of the seaplane to the hull 
longitudinal station at which the load factor is being computed to the 
radius of gyration in pitch of the seaplane, the hull reference axis 
being a straight line, in the plane of symmetry, tangential to the keel 
at the main step.
    (c) For a twin float seaplane, because of the effect of flexibility 
of the attachment of the floats to the seaplane, the factor K<INF>1</INF> 
may be reduced at the bow and stern to 0.8 of the value shown in figure 
2 of Appendix B. This reduction applies only to the design of the 
carrythrough and seaplane structure.

<R05>
Sec. 25.529  Hull and main float landing conditions.

    (a) Symmetrical step, bow, and stern landing. For symmetrical step, 
bow, and stern landings, the limit water reaction load factors are those 
computed under Sec. 25.527. In addition--
    (1) For symmetrical step landings, the resultant water load must be 
applied at the keel, through the center of gravity, and must be directed 
perpendicularly to the keel line;
    (2) For symmetrical bow landings, the resultant water load must be 
applied at the keel, one-fifth of the longitudinal distance from the bow 
to the step, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line; and
    (3) For symmetrical stern landings, the resultant water load must be 
applied at the keel, at a point 85 percent of the longitudinal distance 
from the step to the stern post, and must be directed perpendicularly to 
the keel line.
    (b) Unsymmetrical landing for hull and single float seaplanes. 
Unsymmetrical step, bow, and stern landing conditions must be 
investigated. In addition--
    (1) The loading for each condition consists of an upward component 
and a side component equal, respectively, to 0.75 and 0.25 tan <greek-b> 
times the resultant load in the corresponding symmetrical landing 
condition; and
    (2) The point of application and direction of the upward component 
of the load is the same as that in the symmetrical condition, and the 
point of application of the side component is at the same longitudinal 
station as the upward component but is directed inward perpendicularly 
to the plane of symmetry at a point midway between the keel and chine 
lines.
    (c) Unsymmetrical landing; twin float seaplanes. The unsymmetrical 
loading consists of an upward load at the step of each float of 0.75 and 
a side load of 0.25 tan <greek-b> at one float times the step landing 
load reached under Sec. 25.527. The side load is directed inboard, 
perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry midway between the keel and 
chine lines of the float, at the same longitudinal station as the upward 
load.

Sec. 25.531  Hull and main float takeoff condition.

    For the wing and its attachment to the hull or main float--
    (a) The aerodynamic wing lift is assumed to be zero; and
    (b) A downward inertia load, corresponding to a load factor computed 
from the following formula, must be applied:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.038

where--

n=inertia load factor;
C<INF>TO</INF>=empirical seaplane operations factor equal to 0.004;

[[Page 372]]

V<INF>S1</INF>=seaplane stalling speed (knots) at the design takeoff 
          weight with the flaps extended in the appropriate takeoff 
          position;
<greek-b>=angle of dead rise at the main step (degrees); and
W=design water takeoff weight in pounds.

Sec. 25.533  Hull and main float bottom pressures.

    (a) General. The hull and main float structure, including frames and 
bulkheads, stringers, and bottom plating, must be designed under this 
section.
    (b) Local pressures. For the design of the bottom plating and 
stringers and their attachments to the supporting structure, the 
following pressure distributions must be applied:
    (1) For an unflared bottom, the pressure at the chine is 0.75 times 
the pressure at the keel, and the pressures between the keel and chine 
vary linearly, in accordance with figure 3 of Appendix B. The pressure 
at the keel (psi) is computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.039

where--

P<INF>k</INF>=pressure (p.s.i.) at the keel;
C<INF>2</INF>=0.00213;
K<INF>2</INF>=hull station weighing factor, in accordance with figure 2 
          of Appendix B;
V<INF>S1</INF>=seaplane stalling speed (Knots) at the design water 
          takeoff weight with flaps extended in the appropriate takeoff 
          position; and
<greek-b><INF>k</INF>=angle of dead rise at keel, in accordance with 
          figure 1 of Appendix B.

    (2) For a flared bottom, the pressure at the beginning of the flare 
is the same as that for an unflared bottom, and the pressure between the 
chine and the beginning of the flare varies linearly, in accordance with 
figure 3 of Appendix B. The pressure distribution is the same as that 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for an unflared bottom 
except that the pressure at the chine is computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.040

where--

P<INF>ch</INF>=pressure (p.s.i.) at the chine;
C<INF>3</INF>=0.0016;
K<INF>2</INF>=hull station weighing factor, in accordance with figure 2 
          of Appendix B;
V<INF>S1</INF>=seaplane stalling speed at the design water takeoff 
          weight with flaps extended in the appropriate takeoff 
          position; and
<greek-b>=angle of dead rise at appropriate station.

The area over which these pressures are applied must simulate pressures 
occurring during high localized impacts on the hull or float, but need 
not extend over an area that would induce critical stresses in the 
frames or in the overall structure.
    (c) Distributed pressures. For the design of the frames, keel, and 
chine structure, the following pressure distributions apply:
    (1) Symmetrical pressures are computed as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.041
    
where--

P=pressure (p.s.i.);
C<INF>4</INF>=0.078 C<INF>1</INF> (with C<INF>1</INF> computed under 
          Sec. 25.527);
K<INF>2</INF>=hull station weighing factor, determined in accordance 
          with figure 2 of Appendix B;
V<INF>S0</INF>=seaplane stalling speed (Knots) with landing flaps 
          extended in the appropriate position and with no slipstream 
          effect; and
V<INF>S0</INF>=seaplane stalling speed with landing flaps extended in 
          the appropriate position and with no slipstream effect; and 
          <greek-b>=angle of dead rise at appropriate station.

    (2) The unsymmetrical pressure distribution consists of the 
pressures prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on one side of 
the hull or main float centerline and one-half of that pressure on the 
other side of the hull or main float centerline, in accordance with 
figure 3 of Appendix B.

These pressures are uniform and must be applied simultaneously over the 
entire hull or main float bottom. The loads obtained must be carried 
into the sidewall structure of the hull proper,

[[Page 373]]

but need not be transmitted in a fore and aft direction as shear and 
bending loads.

<R05>
Sec. 25.535  Auxiliary float loads.

    (a) General. Auxiliary floats and their attachments and supporting 
structures must be designed for the conditions prescribed in this 
section. In the cases specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this 
section, the prescribed water loads may be distributed over the float 
bottom to avoid excessive local loads, using bottom pressures not less 
than those prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (b) Step loading. The resultant water load must be applied in the 
plane of symmetry of the float at a point three-fourths of the distance 
from the bow to the step and must be perpendicular to the keel. The 
resultant limit load is computed as follows, except that the value of L 
need not exceed three times the weight of the displaced water when the 
float is completely submerged:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.042

where--

L=limit load (lbs.);
C<INF>5</INF>=0.0053;
V<INF>S0</INF>=seaplane stalling speed (knots) with landing flaps 
          extended in the appropriate position and with no slipstream 
          effect;
W=seaplane design landing weight in pounds;
<greek-b><INF>S</INF>=angle of dead rise at a station \3/4\ of the 
          distance from the bow to the step, but need not be less than 
          15 degrees; and
r<INF>y</INF>=ratio of the lateral distance between the center of 
          gravity and the plane of symmetry of the float to the radius 
          of gyration in roll.

    (c) Bow loading. The resultant limit load must be applied in the 
plane of symmetry of the float at a point one-fourth of the distance 
from the bow to the step and must be perpendicular to the tangent to the 
keel line at that point. The magnitude of the resultant load is that 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Unsymmetrical step loading. The resultant water load consists of 
a component equal to 0.75 times the load specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section and a side component equal to 3.25 tan <greek-b> times the 
load specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The side load must be 
applied perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry of the float at a point 
midway between the keel and the chine.
    (e) Unsymmetrical bow loading. The resultant water load consists of 
a component equal to 0.75 times the load specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section and a side component equal to 0.25 tan <greek-b> times the 
load specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The side load must be 
applied perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry at a point midway 
between the keel and the chine.
    (f) Immersed float condition. The resultant load must be applied at 
the centroid of the cross section of the float at a point one-third of 
the distance from the bow to the step. The limit load components are as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.043

where--

<greek-r>=mass density of water (slugs/ft.<SUP>2</SUP>);
V=volume of float (ft.<SUP>2</SUP>);
C<INF>x</INF>=coefficient of drag force, equal to 0.133;
C<INF>y</INF>=coefficient of side force, equal to 0.106;
K=0.8, except that lower values may be used if it is shown that the 
          floats are incapable of submerging at a speed of 0.8 V<INF>S0</INF> 
          in normal operations;
V<INF>S0</INF>=seaplane stalling speed (knots) with landing flaps 
          extended in the appropriate position and with no slipstream 
          effect; and
g=acceleration due to gravity (ft./sec.<SUP>2</SUP>).

    (g) Float bottom pressures. The float bottom pressures must be 
established under Sec. 25.533, except that the value of K<INF>2</INF> in 
the formulae may be taken as 1.0. The angle of dead rise to be used in 
determining the float bottom pressures is set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section.

Sec. 25.562  Emergency landing dynamic conditions.

    (a) The seat and restraint system in the airplane must be designed 
as prescribed in this section to protect each occupant during an 
emergency landing condition when--
    (1) Proper use is made of seats, safety belts, and shoulder 
harnesses provided for in the design; and
    (2) The occupant is exposed to loads resulting from the conditions 
prescribed in this section.
    (b) Each seat type design approved for crew or passenger occupancy 
during takeoff and landing must successfully complete dynamic tests or 
be demonstrated by rational analysis based on dynamic tests of a similar 
type seat, in accordance with each of the following emergency landing 
conditions. The tests must be conducted with an occupant simulated by a 
170-pound anthropomorphic test dummy, as defined by 49 CFR Part 572, 
Subpart B, or its equivalent, sitting in the normal upright position.
    (1) A change in downward vertical velocity (<greek-D>v) of not less 
than 35 feet per second, with the airplane's longitudinal axis canted 
downward 30 degrees with respect to the horizontal plane and with the 
wings level. Peak floor deceleration must occur in not more than 0.08 
seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 14g.
    (2) A change in forward longitudinal velocity (<greek-D>v) of not 
less than 44 feet per second, with the airplane's longitudinal axis 
horizontal and yawed 10 degrees either right or left, whichever would 
cause the greatest likelihood of the upper torso restraint system (where 
installed) moving off the occupant's shoulder, and with the wings level. 
Peak floor deceleration must occur in not more than 0.09 seconds after 
impact and must reach a minimum of 16g. Where floor rails or floor 
fittings are used to attach the seating devices to the test fixture, the 
rails or fittings must be misaligned with respect to the adjacent set of 
rails or fittings by at least 10 degrees vertically (i.e., out of 
Parallel) with one rolled 10 degrees.
    (c) The following performance measures must not be exceeded during 
the dynamic tests conducted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section:
    (1) Where upper torso straps are used for crewmembers, tension loads 
in individual straps must not exceed 1,750 pounds. If dual straps are 
used for restraining the upper torso, the total strap tension loads must 
not exceed 2,000 pounds.
    (2) The maximum compressive load measured between the pelvis and the

[[Page 375]]

lumbar column of the anthropomorphic dummy must not exceed 1,500 pounds.
    (3) The upper torso restraint straps (where installed) must remain 
on the occupant's shoulder during the impact.
    (4) The lap safety belt must remain on the occupant's pelvis during 
the impact.
    (5) Each occupant must be protected from serious head injury under 
the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Where head 
contact with seats or other structure can occur, protection must be 
provided so that the head impact does not exceed a Head Injury Criterion 
(HIC) of 1,000 units. The level of HIC is defined by the equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.044

Where:
t<INF>1</INF> is the initial integration time,
t<INF>2</INF> is the final integration time, and
a(t) is the total acceleration vs. time curve for the head strike, and 
          where
(t) is in seconds, and (a) is in units of gravity (g).

    (6) Where leg injuries may result from contact with seats or other 
structure, protection must be provided to prevent axially compressive 
loads exceeding 2,250 pounds in each femur.
    (7) The seat must remain attached at all points of attachment, 
although the structure may have yielded.
    (8) Seats must not yield under the tests specified in paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section to the extent they would impede rapid 
evacuation of the airplane occupants.

                           Fatigue Evaluation


<R05>
Sec. 25.571  Damage--tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure.

    (a) General. An evaluation of the strength, detail design, and 
fabrication must show that catastrophic failure due to fatigue, 
corrosion, or accidental damage, will be avoided throughout the 
operational life of the airplane. This evaluation must be conducted in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (e) of this 
section, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, for each 
part of the structure which could contribute to a catastrophic failure 
(such as wing, empennage, control surfaces and their systems, the 
fuselage, engine mounting, landing gear, and their related primary 
attachments). Advisory Circular AC No. 25.571-1 contains guidance 
information relating to the requirements of this section (copies of the 
advisory circular may be obtained from the U.S. Department of 
Transportation, Publications Section M443.1, Washington, D.C. 20590). 
For turbojet powered airplanes, those parts which could contribute to a 
catastrophic failure must also be evaluated under paragraph (d) of this 
section. In addition, the following apply:
    (1) Each evaluation required by this section must include--
    (i) The typical loading spectra, temperatures, and humidities 
expected in service;
    (ii) The identification of principal structural elements and detail 
design points, the failure of which could cause catastrophic failure of 
the airplane; and
    (iii) An analysis, supported by test evidence, of the principal 
structural elements and detail design points identified in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) The service history of airplanes of similar structural design, 
taking due account of differences in operating conditions and 
procedures, may be used in the evaluations required by this section.

[[Page 376]]

    (3) Based on the evaluations required by this section, inspections 
or other procedures must be established as necessary to prevent 
catastrophic failure, and must be included in the Airworthiness 
Limitations section of the Instruction for Continued Airworthiness 
required by Sec. 25.1529.
    (b) Damage-tolerance evaluation. The evaluation must include a 
determination of the probable locations and modes of damage due to 
fatigue, corrosion, or accidental damage. The determination must be by 
analysis supported by test evidence and (if available) service 
experience. Damage at multiple sites due to prior fatigue exposure must 
be included where the design is such that this type of damage can be 
expected to occur. The evaluation must incorporate repeated load and 
static analyses supported by test evidence. The extent of damage for 
residual strength evaluation at any time within the operational life 
must be consistent with the initial detectability and subsequent growth 
under repeated loads. The residual strength evaluation must show that 
the remaining structure is able to withstand loads (considered as static 
ultimate loads) corresponding to the following conditions:
    (1) The limit symmetrical maneuvering conditions specified in 
Sec. 25.337 at V<INF>C</INF> and in Sec. 25.345.
    (2) The limit gust conditions specified in Sec. 25.341 at the 
specified speeds up to V<INF>C</INF> and in Sec. 25.345.
    (3) The limit rolling conditions specified in Sec. 25.349 and the 
limit unsymmetrical conditions specified in Secs. 25.367 and 25.427 (a) 
through (c), at speeds up to V<INF>C</INF>.
    (4) The limit yaw maneuvering conditions specified in Sec. 25.351(a) 
at the specified speeds up to V<INF>C</INF>.
    (5) For pressurized cabins, the following conditions:
    (i) The normal operating differential pressure combined with the 
expected external aerodynamic pressures applied simultaneously with the 
flight loading conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of 
this section, if they have a significant effect.
    (ii) The expected external aerodynamic pressures in 1 g flight 
combined with a cabin differential pressure equal to 1.1 times the 
normal operating differential pressure without any other load.
    (6) For landing gear and directly-affected airframe structure, the 
limit ground loading conditions specified in Secs. 25.473, 25.491, and 
25.493.

If significant changes in structural stiffness or geometry, or both, 
follow from a structural failure, or partial failure, the effect on 
damage tolerance must be further investigated.
    (c) Fatigue (safe-life) evaluation. Compliance with the damage-
tolerance requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is not required 
if the applicant establishes that their application for particular 
structure is impractical. This structure must be shown by analysis, 
supported by test evidence, to be able to withstand the repeated loads 
of variable magnitude expected during its service life without 
detectable cracks. Appropriate safe-life scatter factors must be 
applied.
    (d) Sonic fatigue strength. It must be shown by analysis, supported 
by test evidence, or by the service history of airplanes of similar 
structural design and sonic excitation environment, that--
    (1) Sonic fatigue cracks are not probable in any part of the flight 
structure subject to sonic excitation; or
    (2) Catastrophic failure caused by sonic cracks is not probable 
assuming that the loads prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section are 
applied to all areas affected by those cracks.
    (e) Damage-tolerance (discrete source) evaluation. The airplane must 
be capable of successfully completing a flight during which likely 
structural damage occurs as a result of--
    (1) Impact with a 4-pound bird at V<INF>c</INF> at sea level to 
8,000 feet;
    (2) Uncontained fan blade impact;
    (3) Uncontained engine failure; or
    (4) Uncontained high energy rotating machinery failure.

The damaged structure must be able to withstand the static loads 
(considered as ultimate loads) which are reasonably expected to occur on 
the flight. Dynamic effects on these static loads need not be 
considered. Corrective action to be taken by the pilot following

[[Page 377]]

the incident, such as limiting maneuvers, avoiding turbulence, and 
reducing speed, must be considered. If significant changes in structural 
stiffness or geometry, or both, follow from a structural failure or 
partial failure, the effect on damage tolerance must be further 
investigated.

Sec. 25.607  Fasteners.

    (a) Each removable bolt, screw, nut, pin, or other removable 
fastener must incorporate two separate locking devices if--
    (1) Its loss could preclude continued flight and landing within the 
design limitations of the airplane using normal pilot skill and 
strength; or
    (2) Its loss could result in reduction in pitch, yaw, or roll 
control capability or response below that required by Subpart B of this 
chapter.
    (b) The fasteners specified in paragraph (a) of this section and 
their locking devices may not be adversely affected by the environmental

Sec. 25.609  Protection of structure.

    Each part of the structure must--
    (a) Be suitably protected against deterioration or loss of strength 
in service due to any cause, including--

[[Page 378]]

    (1) Weathering;
    (2) Corrosion; and
    (3) Abrasion; and
    (b) Have provisions for ventilation and drainage where necessary for 
protection.


<R05>
Sec. 25.611  Accessibility provisions.

    Means must be provided to allow inspection (including inspection of 
principal structural elements and control systems), replacement of parts 
normally requiring replacement, adjustment, and lubrication as necessary 
for continued airworthiness. The inspection means for each item must be 
practicable for the inspection interval for the item. Nondestructive 
inspection aids may be used to inspect structural elements where it is 
impracticable to provide means for direct visual inspection if it is 
shown that the inspection is effective and the inspection procedures are 
specified in the maintenance manual required by Sec. 25.1529.

<R05>
Sec. 25.613  Material strength properties and design values.

    (a) Material strength properties must be based on enough tests of 
material meeting approved specifications to establish design values on a 
statistical basis.
    (b) Design values must be chosen to minimize the probability of 
structural failures due to material variability. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section, compliance with this paragraph must be 
shown by selecting design values which assure material strength with the 
following probability:
    (1) Where applied loads are eventually distributed through a single 
member within an assembly, the failure of which would result in loss of 
structural integrity of the component, 99 percent probability with 95 
percent confidence.
    (2) For redundant structure, in which the failure of individual 
elements would result in applied loads being safely distributed to other 
load carrying members, 90 percent probability with 95 percent 
confidence.
    (c) The effects of temperature on allowable stresses used for design 
in an essential component or structure must be considered where thermal 
effects are significant under normal operating conditions.
    (d) The strength, detail design, and fabrication of the structure 
must minimize the probability of disastrous fatigue failure, 
particularly at points of stress concentration.
    (e) Greater design values may be used if a ``premium selection'' of 
the material is made in which a specimen of each individual item is 
tested before use to determine that the actual strength properties of 
that particular item will equal or exceed those used in design.

strength is--
    (a) Uncertain;
    (b) Likely to deteriorate in service before normal replacement; or
    (c) Subject to appreciable variability because of uncertainties in 
manufacturing processes or inspection methods.

<R05>
Sec. 25.621  Casting factors.

    (a) General. The factors, tests, and inspections specified in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section must be applied in addition 
to those necessary to establish foundry quality control. The inspections 
must meet approved specifications. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section apply to any structural castings except castings that are 
pressure tested as parts of hydraulic or other fluid systems and do not 
support structural loads.
    (b) Bearing stresses and surfaces. The casting factors specified in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section--
    (1) Need not exceed 1.25 with respect to bearing stresses regardless 
of the method of inspection used; and
    (2) Need not be used with respect to the bearing surfaces of a part 
whose bearing factor is larger than the applicable casting factor.

[[Page 379]]

    (c) Critical castings. For each casting whose failure would preclude 
continued safe flight and landing of the airplane or result in serious 
injury to occupants, the following apply:
    (1) Each critical casting must--
    (i) Have a casting factor of not less than 1.25; and
    (ii) Receive 100 percent inspection by visual, radiographic, and 
magnetic particle or penetrant inspection methods or approved equivalent 
nondestructive inspection methods.
    (2) For each critical casting with a casting factor less than 1.50, 
three sample castings must be static tested and shown to meet--
    (i) The strength requirements of Sec. 25.305 at an ultimate load 
corresponding to a casting factor of 1.25; and
    (ii) The deformation requirements of Sec. 25.305 at a load of 1.15 
times the limit load.
    (3) Examples of these castings are structural attachment fittings, 
parts of flight control systems, control surface hinges and balance 
weight attachments, seat, berth, safety belt, and fuel and oil tank 
supports and attachments, and cabin pressure valves.
    (d) Noncritical castings. For each casting other than those 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the following apply:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, 
the casting factors and corresponding inspections must meet the 
following table:

1.25 through 1.50........................  100 percent visual, magnetic 
                                            particle or penetrant, and  
                                            radiographic, or approved   
                                            equivalent nondestructive

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The percentage of castings inspected by nonvisual methods may be 
reduced below that specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section when an 
approved quality control procedure is established.
    (3) For castings procured to a specification that guarantees the 
mechanical properties of the material in the casting and provides for 
demonstration of these properties by test of coupons cut from the 
castings on a sampling basis--
    (i) A casting factor of 1.0 may be used; and
    (ii) The castings must be inspected as provided in paragraph (d)(1)

Sec. 25.623  Bearing factors.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each part 
that has clearance (free fit), and that is subject to pounding or 
vibration, must have a bearing factor large enough to provide for the 
effects of normal relative motion.
    (b) No bearing factor need be used for a part for which any larger 
special factor is prescribed.


<R05>
Sec. 25.625  Fitting factors.

    For each fitting (a part or terminal used to join one structural 
member to another), the following apply:
    (a) For each fitting whose strength is not proven by limit and 
ultimate load tests in which actual stress conditions are simulated in 
the fitting and surrounding structures, a fitting factor of at least 
1.15 must be applied to each part of--
    (1) The fitting;
    (2) The means of attachment; and
    (3) The bearing on the joined members.
    (b) No fitting factor need be used--
    (1) For joints made under approved practices and based on 
comprehensive test data (such as continuous joints in metal plating, 
welded joints, and scarf joints in wood); or
    (2) With respect to any bearing surface for which a larger special 
factor is used.
    (c) For each integral fitting, the part must be treated as a fitting 
up to the point at which the section properties become typical of the 
member.

<R05>
Sec. 25.629  Aeroelastic stability requirements.

    (a) General. The aeroelastic stability evaluations required under 
this section include flutter, divergence, control reversal and any undue 
loss of stability and control as a result of structural deformation. The 
aeroelastic evaluation must include whirl modes associated with any 
propeller or rotating device that contributes significant dynamic 
forces. Compliance with this section must be shown by analyses, wind 
tunnel tests, ground vibration tests, flight tests, or other means found 
necessary by the Administrator.
    (b) Aeroelastic stability envelopes. The airplane must be designed 
to be free from aeroelastic instability for all configurations and 
design conditions within the aeroelastic stability envelopes as follows:
    (1) For normal conditions without failures, malfunctions, or adverse 
conditions, all combinations of altitudes and speeds encompassed by the 
V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF> versus altitude envelope enlarged at all 
points by an increase of 15 percent in equivalent airspeed at both 
constant Mach number and constant altitude. In addition, a proper margin 
of stability must exist at all speeds up to V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF> 
and, there must be no large and rapid reduction in stability as 
V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF> is approached. The enlarged envelope may be 
limited to Mach 1.0 when M<INF>D</INF> is less than 1.0 at all design 
altitudes, and
    (2) For the conditions described in Sec. 25.629(d) below, for all 
approved altitudes, any airspeed up to the greater airspeed defined by;
    (i) The V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF> envelope determined by 
Sec. 25.335(b); or,
    (ii) An altitude-airspeed envelope defined by a 15 percent increase 
in equivalent airspeed above V<INF>C</INF> at constant altitude, from 
sea level to the altitude of the intersection of 1.15 V<INF>C</INF> with 
the extension of the constant cruise Mach number line, M<INF>C</INF>, 
then a linear variation in equivalent airspeed to M<INF>C</INF>+.05 at 
the altitude of the lowest V<INF>C</INF>/M<INF>C</INF> intersection; 
then, at higher altitudes, up to the maximum flight altitude, the 
boundary defined by a .05 Mach increase in M<INF>C</INF> at constant 
altitude.
    (c) Balance weights. If concentrated balance weights are used, their 
effectiveness and strength, including supporting structure, must be 
substantiated.
    (d) Failures, malfunctions, and adverse conditions. The failures, 
malfunctions, and adverse conditions which must be considered in showing 
compliance with this section are:
    (1) Any critical fuel loading conditions, not shown to be extremely 
improbable, which may result from mismanagement of fuel.
    (2) Any single failure in any flutter damper system.
    (3) For airplanes not approved for operation in icing conditions, 
the maximum likely ice accumulation expected as a result of an 
inadvertent encounter.
    (4) Failure of any single element of the structure supporting any 
engine, independently mounted propeller shaft, large auxiliary power 
unit, or large externally mounted aerodynamic body (such as an external 
fuel tank).
    (5) For airplanes with engines that have propellers or large 
rotating devices capable of significant dynamic forces, any single 
failure of the engine structure that would reduce the rigidity of the 
rotational axis.
    (6) The absence of aerodynamic or gyroscopic forces resulting from 
the most adverse combination of feathered propellers or other rotating 
devices capable of significant dynamic forces. In addition, the effect 
of a single feathered propeller or rotating device must be coupled with 
the failures of paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section.
    (7) Any single propeller or rotating device capable of significant 
dynamic forces rotating at the highest likely overspeed.
    (8) Any damage or failure condition, required or selected for 
investigation by Sec. 25.571. The single structural failures described 
in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section need not be considered 
in showing compliance with this section if;
    (i) The structural element could not fail due to discrete source 
damage resulting from the conditions described in Sec. 25.571(e), and
    (ii) A damage tolerance investigation in accordance with 
Sec. 25.571(b) shows that the maximum extent of damage assumed for the 
purpose of residual strength evaluation does not involve

[[Page 381]]

complete failure of the structural element.
    (9) Any damage, failure, or malfunction considered under 
Secs. 25.631, 25.671, 25.672, and 25.1309.
    (10) Any other combination of failures, malfunctions, or adverse 
conditions not shown to be extremely improbable.
    (e) Flight flutter testing. Full scale flight flutter tests at 
speeds up to V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF> must be conducted for new 
type designs and for modifications to a type design unless the 
modifications have been shown to have an insignificant effect on the 
aeroelastic stability. These tests must demonstrate that the airplane 
has a proper margin of damping at all speeds up to V<INF>DF</INF>/
M<INF>DF</INF>, and that there is no large and rapid reduction in 
damping as V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF>, is approached. If a failure, 
malfunction, or adverse condition is simulated during flight test in 
showing compliance with paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum speed 
investigated need not exceed V<INF>FC</INF>/M<INF>FC</INF> if it is 
shown, by correlation of the flight test data with other test data or 
analyses, that the airplane is free from any aeroelastic instability at 
all speeds within the altitude-airspeed envelope described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.

Sec. 25.631  Bird strike damage.

    The empennage structure must be designed to assure capability of 
continued safe flight and landing of the airplane after impact with an 
8-pound bird when the velocity of the airplane (relative to the bird 
along the airplane's flight path) is equal to V<INF>C</INF> at sea 
level, selected under Sec. 25.335(a). Compliance with this section by 
provision of redundant structure and protected location of control 
system elements or protective devices such as splitter plates or energy 
absorbing material is acceptable. Where compliance is shown by analysis, 
tests, or both, use of data on airplanes having similar structural 
design is acceptable.

must include the horn or fitting to which the control system is 
attached.
    (b) Compliance with the special factors requirements of Secs. 25.619 
through 25.625 and 25.657 for control surface hinges must be shown by 
analysis or individual load tests.


<R05>
Sec. 25.655  Installation.

    (a) Movable tail surfaces must be installed so that there is no 
interference between any surfaces when one is held in its extreme 
position and the others are operated through their full angular 
movement.
    (b) If an adjustable stabilizer is used, it must have stops that 
will limit its range of travel to the maximum for which the airplane is 
shown to meet the trim requirements of Sec. 25.161.

exceeded. For nonstandard bearing hinge configurations, the rating must 
be established on the basis of experience or tests and, in the absence 
of a rational investigation, a factor of safety of not less than 6.67 
must be used with respect to the ultimate bearing strength of the 
softest material used as a bearing.
    (b) Hinges must have enough strength and rigidity for loads parallel 
to the hinge line.

                            Control Systems 


<R05>
Sec. 25.671  General.

    (a) Each control and control system must operate with the ease, 
smoothness, and positiveness appropriate to its function.
    (b) Each element of each flight control system must be designed, or 
distinctively and permanently marked, to minimize the probability of 
incorrect assembly that could result in the malfunctioning of the 
system.

[[Page 382]]

    (c) The airplane must be shown by analysis, tests, or both, to be 
capable of continued safe flight and landing after any of the following 
failures or jamming in the flight control system and surfaces (including 
trim, lift, drag, and feel systems), within the normal flight envelope, 
without requiring exceptional piloting skill or strength. Probable 
malfunctions must have only minor effects on control system operation 
and must be capable of being readily counteracted by the pilot.
    (1) Any single failure, excluding jamming (for example, 
disconnection or failure of mechanical elements, or structural failure 
of hydraulic components, such as actuators, control spool housing, and 
valves).
    (2) Any combination of failures not shown to be extremely 
improbable, excluding jamming (for example, dual electrical or hydraulic 
system failures, or any single failure in combination with any probable 
hydraulic or electrical failure).
    (3) Any jam in a control position normally encountered during 
takeoff, climb, cruise, normal turns, descent, and landing unless the 
jam is shown to be extremely improbable, or can be alleviated. A runaway 
of a flight control to an adverse position and jam must be accounted for 
if such runaway and subsequent jamming is not extremely improbable.
    (d) The airplane must be designed so that it is controllable if all 
engines fail. Compliance with this requirement may be shown by analysis 
where that method has been shown to be reliable.

    (a) A warning which is clearly distinguishable to the pilot under 
expected flight conditions without requiring his attention must be 
provided for any failure in the stability augmentation system or in any 
other automatic or power-operated system which could result in an unsafe 
condition if the pilot were not aware of the failure. Warning systems 
must not activate the control systems.
    (b) The design of the stability augmentation system or of any other 
automatic or power-operated system must permit initial counteraction of 
failures of the type specified in Sec. 25.671(c) without requiring 
exceptional pilot skill or strength, by either the deactivation of the 
system, or a failed portion thereof, or by overriding the failure by 
movement of the flight controls in the normal sense.
    (c) It must be shown that after any single failure of the stability 
augmentation system or any other automatic or power-operated system--
    (1) The airplane is safely controllable when the failure or 
malfunction occurs at any speed or altitude within the approved 
operating limitations that is critical for the type of failure being 
considered;
    (2) The controllability and maneuverability requirements of this 
part are met within a practical operational flight envelope (for 
example, speed, altitude, normal acceleration, and airplane 
configurations) which is described in the Airplane Flight Manual; and
    (3) The trim, stability, and stall characteristics are not impaired 
below a level needed to permit continued safe flight and landing.

Sec. 25.679  Control system gust locks.

    (a) There must be a device to prevent damage to the control surfaces 
(including tabs), and to the control system, from gusts striking the 
airplane while it is on the ground or water. If the device, when 
engaged, prevents normal operation of the control surfaces by the pilot, 
it must--
    (1) Automatically disengage when the pilot operates the primary 
flight controls in a normal manner; or
    (2) Limit the operation of the airplane so that the pilot receives 
unmistakable warning at the start of takeoff.
    (b) The device must have means to preclude the possibility of it 
becoming inadvertently engaged in flight.

control system subject to pilot effort loads are loaded to 80 percent of 
the limit load specified for the system and the powered portions of the 
control system are loaded to the maximum load expected in normal 
operation, the system is free from--
    (a) Jamming;
    (b) Excessive friction; and
    (c) Excessive deflection.

Sec. 25.689  Cable systems.

    (a) Each cable, cable fitting, turnbuckle, splice, and pulley must 
be approved. In addition--
    (1) No cable smaller than \1/8\ inch in diameter may be used in the 
aileron, elevator, or rudder systems; and
    (2) Each cable system must be designed so that there will be no 
hazardous change in cable tension throughout

[[Page 384]]

the range of travel under operating conditions and temperature 
variations.
    (b) Each kind and size of pulley must correspond to the cable with 
which it is used. Pulleys and sprockets must have closely fitted guards 
to prevent the cables and chains from being displaced or fouled. Each 
pulley must lie in the plane passing through the cable so that the cable 
does not rub against the pulley flange.
    (c) Fairleads must be installed so that they do not cause a change 
in cable direction of more than three degrees.
    (d) Clevis pins subject to load or motion and retained only by 
cotter pins may not be used in the control system.
    (e) Turnbuckles must be attached to parts having angular motion in a 
manner that will positively prevent binding throughout the range of 
travel.
    (f) There must be provisions for visual inspection of fairleads, 
pulleys, terminals, and turnbuckles.


<R05>
Sec. 25.693  Joints.

    Control system joints (in push-pull systems) that are subject to 
angular motion, except those in ball and roller bearing systems, must 
have a special factor of safety of not less than 3.33 with respect to 
the ultimate bearing strength of the softest material used as a bearing. 
This factor may be reduced to 2.0 for joints in cable control systems. 
For ball or roller bearings, the approved ratings may not be exceeded.

Sec. 25.697  Lift and drag devices, controls.

    (a) Each lift device control must be designed so that the pilots can 
place the device in any takeoff, en route, approach, or landing position 
established under Sec. 25.101(d). Lift and drag devices must maintain 
the selected positions, except for movement produced by an automatic 
positioning or load limiting device, without further attention by the 
pilots.
    (b) Each lift and drag device control must be designed and located 
to make inadvertent operation improbable. Lift and drag devices intended 
for ground operation only must have means to prevent the inadvertant 
operation of their controls in flight if that operation could be 
hazardous.
    (c) The rate of motion of the surfaces in response to the operation 
of the control and the characteristics of the automatic positioning or 
load limiting device must give satisfactory flight and performance 
characteristics under steady or changing conditions of airspeed, engine 
power, and airplane attitude.
    (d) The lift device control must be designed to retract the surfaces 
from the fully extended position, during steady flight at maximum 
continuous engine power at any speed below V<INF>F</INF> +9.0 (knots).

Sec. 25.699  Lift and drag device indicator.

    (a) There must be means to indicate to the pilots the position of 
each lift or drag device having a separate control in the cockpit to 
adjust its position. In addition, an indication of unsymmetrical 
operation or other malfunction in the lift or drag device systems must 
be provided when such indication is necessary to enable the pilots to 
prevent or counteract an unsafe flight or ground condition, considering 
the effects on flight characteristics and performance.
    (b) There must be means to indicate to the pilots the takeoff, en 
route, approach, and landing lift device positions.
    (c) If any extension of the lift and drag devices beyond the landing 
position is possible, the controls must be clearly marked to identify 
this range of extension.

Sec. 25.701  Flap and slat interconnection.

    (a) Unless the airplane has safe flight characteristics with the 
flaps or slats retracted on one side and extended on the other, the 
motion of flaps or slats on opposite sides of the plane of symmetry must 
be synchronized by a mechanical interconnection or approved equivalent 
means.
    (b) If a wing flap or slat interconnection or equivalent means is 
used, it

[[Page 385]]

must be designed to account for the applicable unsymmetrical loads, 
including those resulting from flight with the engines on one side of 
the plane of symmetry inoperative and the remaining engines at takeoff 
power.
    (c) For airplanes with flaps or slats that are not subjected to 
slipstream conditions, the structure must be designed for the loads 
imposed when the wing flaps or slats on one side are carrying the most 
severe load occurring in the prescribed symmetrical conditions and those 
on the other side are carrying not more than 80 percent of that load.
    (d) The interconnection must be designed for the loads resulting 
when interconnected flap or slat surfaces on one side of the plane of 
symmetry are jammed and immovable while the surfaces on the other side 
are free to move and the full power of the surface actuating system is 
applied.

    A takeoff warning system must be installed and must meet the 
following requirements:
    (a) The system must provide to the pilots an aural warning that is 
automatically activated during the initial portion of the takeoff roll 
if the airplane is in a configuration, including any of the following, 
that would not allow a safe takeoff:
    (1) The wing flaps or leading edge devices are not within the 
approved range of takeoff positions.
    (2) Wing spoilers (except lateral control spoilers meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 25.671), speed brakes, or longitudinal trim devices 
are in a position that would not allow a safe takeoff.
    (b) The warning required by paragraph (a) of this section must 
continue until--
    (1) The configuration is changed to allow a safe takeoff;
    (2) Action is taken by the pilot to terminate the takeoff roll;
    (3) The airplane is rotated for takeoff; or
    (4) The warning is manually deactivated by the pilot.
    (c) The means used to activate the system must function properly

Sec. 25.721  General.

    (a) The main landing gear system must be designed so that if it 
fails due to overloads during takeoff and landing (assuming the 
overloads to act in the upward and aft directions), the failure mode is 
not likely to cause--
    (1) For airplanes that have passenger seating configuration, 
excluding pilots seats, of nine seats or less, the spillage of enough 
fuel from any fuel system in the fuselage to constitute a fire hazard; 
and
    (2) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration, 
excluding pilots seats, of 10 seats or more, the spillage of enough fuel 
from any part of the fuel system to constitute a fire hazard.
    (b) Each airplane that has a passenger seating configuration 
excluding pilots seats, of 10 seats or more must be designed so that 
with the airplane under control it can be landed on a paved runway with 
any one or more landing gear legs not extended without sustaining a 
structural component failure that is likely to cause the spillage of 
enough fuel to constitute a fire hazard.
    (c) Compliance with the provisions of this section may be shown by 
analysis or tests, or both.

Sec. 25.725  Limit drop tests.

    (a) If compliance with Sec. 25.723(a) is shown by free drop tests, 
these tests must be made on the complete airplane, or on units 
consisting of a wheel, tire, and shock absorber, in their proper 
positions, from free drop heights not less than--
    (1) 18.7 inches for the design landing weight conditions; and
    (2) 6.7 inches for the design takeoff weight conditions.
    (b) If airplane lift is simulated by air cylinders or by other 
mechanical means, the weight used for the drop must be equal to W. If 
the effect of airplane lift is represented in free drop tests by an 
equivalent reduced mass, the landing gear must be dropped with an 
effective mass equal to

where--

W<INF>e</INF>= the effective weight to be used in the drop test (lbs.);
h =specified free drop height (inches);

W=W<INF>T!</INF>for tail gear units (lbs.), equal to the static weight 
          on the tail unit with the airplane in the tail-down attitude;
W=W<INF>N!</INF>for nose wheel units (lbs.), equal to the vertical 
          component of the static reaction that would exist at the nose 
          wheel, assuming that the mass of the airplane acts at the 
          center of gravity and exerts a force of 1.0 g downward and 
          0.25 g forward; and
L = ratio of the assumed airplane lift to the airplane weight, but not 
          more than 1.0.

    (c) The drop test attitude of the landing gear unit and the 
application of appropriate drag loads during the test must simulate the 
airplane landing conditions in a manner consistent with the development 
of a rational or conservative limit load factor value.
    (d) The value of d used in the computation of W<INF>e!</INF>in 
paragraph (b) of this section may not exceed the value actually obtained 
in the drop test.

          and
W<INF>e,!</INF>W, and L are the same as in the drop test computation.

Sec. 25.729  Retracting mechanism.

    (a) General. For airplanes with retractable landing gear, the 
following apply:

[[Page 387]]

    (1) The landing gear retracting mechanism, wheel well doors, and 
supporting structure, must be designed for--
    (i) The loads occurring in the flight conditions when the gear is in 
the retracted position,
    (ii) The combination of friction loads, inertia loads, brake torque 
loads, air loads, and gyroscopic loads resulting from the wheels 
rotating at a peripheral speed equal to 1.3 V<INF>s!</INF>(with the 
flaps in takeoff position at design takeoff weight), occurring during 
retraction and extension at any airspeed up to 1.6 V<INF>s1</INF> (with 
the flaps in the approach position at design landing weight), and
    (iii) Any load factor up to those specified in Sec. 25.345(a) for 
the flaps extended condition.
    (2) Unless there are other means to decelerate the airplane in 
flight at this speed, the landing gear, the retracting mechanism, and 
the airplane structure (including wheel well doors) must be designed to 
withstand the flight loads occurring with the landing gear in the 
extended position at any speed up to 0.67 V<INF>C</INF>.
    (3) Landing gear doors, their operating mechanism, and their 
supporting structures must be designed for the yawing maneuvers 
prescribed for the airplane in addition to the conditions of airspeed 
and load factor prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (b) Landing gear lock. There must be positive means to keep the 
landing gear extended, in flight and on the ground.
    (c) Emergency operation. There must be an emergency means for 
extending the landing gear in the event of--
    (1) Any reasonably probable failure in the normal retraction system; 
or
    (2) The failure of any single source of hydraulic, electric, or 
equivalent energy supply.
    (d) Operation test. The proper functioning of the retracting 
mechanism must be shown by operation tests.
    (e) Position indicator and warning device. If a retractable landing 
gear is used, there must be a landing gear position indicator (as well 
as necessary switches to actuate the indicator) or other means to inform 
the pilot that the gear is secured in the extended (or retracted) 
position. This means must be designed as follows:
    (1) If switches are used, they must be located and coupled to the 
landing gear mechanical systems in a manner that prevents an erroneous 
indication of ``down and locked'' if the landing gear is not in a fully 
extended position, or of ``up and locked'' if the landing gear is not in 
the fully retracted position. The switches may be located where they are 
operated by the actual landing gear locking latch or device.
    (2) The flightcrew must be given an aural warning that functions 
continuously, or is periodically repeated, if a landing is attempted 
when the landing gear is not locked down.
    (3) The warning must be given in sufficient time to allow the 
landing gear to be locked down or a go-around to be made.
    (4) There must not be a manual shut-off means readily available to 
the flightcrew for the warning required by paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section such that it could be operated instinctively, inadvertently, or 
by habitual reflexive action.
    (5) The system used to generate the aural warning must be designed 
to eliminate false or inappropriate alerts.
    (6) Failures of systems used to inhibit the landing gear aural 
warning, that would prevent the warning system from operating, must be 
improbable.
    (f) Protection of equipment in wheel wells. Equipment that is 
essential to safe operation of the airplane and that is located in wheel 
wells must be protected from the damaging effects of--
    (1) A bursting tire, unless it is shown that a tire cannot burst 
from overheat; and
    (2) A loose tire tread, unless it is shown that a loose tire tread 
cannot cause damage.

    (a) When a landing gear axle is fitted with a single wheel and tire 
assembly, the wheel must be fitted with a suitable tire of proper fit 
with a speed rating approved by the Administrator that is not exceeded 
under critical conditions and with a load rating approved by the 
Administrator that is not exceeded under--
    (1) The loads on the main wheel tire, corresponding to the most 
critical combination of airplane weight (up to maximum weight) and 
center of gravity position, and
    (2) The loads corresponding to the ground reactions in paragraph (b) 
of this section, on the nose wheel tire, except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
    (b) The applicable ground reactions for nose wheel tires are as 
follows:
    (1) The static ground reaction for the tire corresponding to the 
most critical combination of airplane weight (up to maximum ramp weight) 
and center of gravity position with a force of 1.0g acting downward at 
the center of gravity. This load may not exceed the load rating of the 
tire.
    (2) The ground reaction of the tire corresponding to the most 
critical combination of airplane weight (up to maximum landing weight) 
and center of gravity position combined with forces of 1.0g downward and 
0.31g forward acting at the center of gravity. The reactions in this 
case must be distributed to the nose and main wheels by the principles 
of statics with a drag reaction equal to 0.31 times the vertical load at 
each wheel with brakes capable of producing this ground reaction. This 
nose tire load may not exceed 1.5 times the load rating of the tire.
    (3) The ground reaction of the tire corresponding to the most 
critical combination of airplane weight (up to maximum ramp weight) and 
center of gravity position combined with forces of 1.0g downward and 
0.20g forward acting at the center of gravity. The reactions in this 
case must be distributed to the nose and main wheels by the principles 
of statics with a drag reaction equal to 0.20 times the vertical load at 
each wheel with brakes capable of producing this ground reaction. This 
nose tire load may not exceed 1.5 times the load rating of the tire.
    (c) When a landing gear axle is fitted with more than one wheel and 
tire assembly, such as dual or dual-tandem, each wheel must be fitted 
with a suitable tire of proper fit with a speed rating approved by the 
Administrator that is not exceeded under critical conditions, and with a 
load rating approved by the Administrator that is not exceeded by--
    (1) The loads on each main wheel tire, corresponding to the most 
critical combination of airplane weight (up to maximum weight) and 
center of gravity position, when multiplied by a factor of 1.07; and
    (2) Loads specified in paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) 
of this section on each nose wheel tire.
    (d) Each tire installed on a retractable landing gear system must, 
at the maximum size of the tire type expected in service, have a 
clearance to surrounding structure and systems that is adequate to 
prevent unintended contact between the tire and any part of the 
structure or systems.
    (e) For an airplane with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 
more than 75,000 pounds, tires mounted on braked wheels must be inflated 
with dry nitrogen or other gases shown to be inert so that the gas 
mixture in the tire does not contain oxygen in excess of 5 percent by 
volume, unless it can be shown that the tire liner material will not 
produce a volatile gas when heated or that means are provided to prevent 
tire temperatures from reaching unsafe levels.

<R05>
Sec. 25.735  Brakes.

    (a) Each brake must be approved.
    (b) The brake system and associated systems must be designed and 
constructed so that if any electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, or 
mechanical connecting or transmitting element (excluding the operating 
pedal or handle) fails, or if any single source of hydraulic or other 
brake operating energy supply is lost, it is possible to bring the 
airplane to rest under conditions specified in Sec. 25.125, with a mean 
deceleration during the landing roll of at least 50 percent of that 
obtained in determining the landing distance as prescribed in that 
section. Subcomponents within the brake assembly, such as brake drum, 
shoes, and actuators (or their equivalents), shall be considered as 
connecting or transmitting elements, unless it is shown that leakage of 
hydraulic fluid resulting from failure of the sealing elements in these 
subcomponents within the brake assembly would not reduce the braking 
effectiveness below that specified in this paragraph.
    (c) Brake controls may not require excessive control force in their 
operation.
    (d) The airplane must have a parking control that, when set by the 
pilot, will without further attention, prevent the airplane from rolling 
on a paved, level runway with takeoff power on the critical engine.
    (e) If antiskid devices are installed, the devices and associated 
systems must be designed so that no single probable malfunction will 
result in a hazardous loss of braking ability or directional control of 
the airplane.
    (f) The brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel-
brake assembly may not be less than the kinetic energy absorption 
requirements determined under either of the following methods:
    (1) The brake kinetic energy absorption requirements must be based 
on a rational analysis of the sequence of events expected during 
operational landings at maximum landing weight. This analysis must 
include conservative values of airplane speed at which the brakes are 
applied, braking coefficient of friction between tires and runway, 
aerodynamic drag, propeller drag or power-plant forward thrust, and (if 
more critical) the most adverse single engine or propeller malfunction.
    (2) Instead of a rational analysis, the kinetic energy absorption 
requirements for each main wheel brake assembly may be derived from the 
following formula, which assumes an equal distribution of braking 
between main wheels:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.047

where--

 KE=Kinetic energy per wheel (ft.-lb.);
W=Design landing weight (lb.);
V=Airplane speed in knots. V must be not less than V<INF>S0</INF>, the 
          poweroff stalling speed of the airplane at sea level, at the 
          design landing weight, and in the landing configuration; and
N=Number of main wheels with brakes.

The formula must be modified in cases of unequal braking distribution.
    (g) The minimum stalling speed rating of each main wheel-brake 
assembly (that is, the initial speed used in the dynamometer tests) may 
not be more than the V used in the determination of kinetic energy in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, assuming that the test 
procedures for wheel-brake assemblies involve a specified rate of 
deceleration, and, therefore, for the same amount of kinetic energy, the 
rate of energy absorption (the power absorbing ability of the brake) 
varies inversely with the initial speed.

<R05>
Sec. 25.751  Main float buoyancy.

    Each main float must have--
    (a) A buoyancy of 80 percent in excess of that required to support 
the maximum weight of the seaplane or amphibian in fresh water; and

[[Page 390]]

    (b) Not less than five watertight compartments approximately equal 
in volume.


<R05>
Sec. 25.753  Main float design.

    Each main float must be approved and must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 25.521.


<R05>
Sec. 25.755  Hulls.

    (a) Each hull must have enough watertight compartments so that, with 
any two adjacent compartments flooded, the buoyancy of the hull and 
auxiliary floats (and wheel tires, if used) provides a margin of 
positive stability great enough to minimize the probability of capsizing 
in rough, fresh water.
    (b) Bulkheads with watertight doors may be used for communication 
between compartments.

                   Personnel and Cargo Accommodations 


<R05>
Sec. 25.771  Pilot compartment.

    (a) Each pilot compartment and its equipment must allow the minimum 
flight crew (established under Sec. 25.1523) to perform their duties 
without unreasonable concentration or fatigue.
    (b) The primary controls listed in Sec. 25.779(a), excluding cables 
and control rods, must be located with respect to the propellers so that 
no member of the minimum flight crew (established under Sec. 25.1523), 
or part of the controls, lies in the region between the plane of 
rotation of any inboard propeller and the surface generated by a line 
passing through the center of the propeller hub making an angle of five 
degrees forward or aft of the plane of rotation of the propeller.
    (c) If provision is made for a second pilot, the airplane must be 
controllable with equal safety from either pilot seat.
    (d) The pilot compartment must be constructed so that, when flying 
in rain or snow, it will not leak in a manner that will distract the 
crew or harm the structure.
    (e) Vibration and noise characteristics of cockpit equipment may not 
interfere with safe operation of the airplane.

Sec. 25.772  Pilot compartment doors.

    For an airplane that has a maximum passenger seating configuration 
of more than 20 seats and that has a lockable door installed between the 
pilot compartment and the passenger compartment:
    (a) The emergency exit configuration must be designed so that 
neither crewmembers nor passengers need use that door in order to reach 
the emergency exits provided for them; and
    (b) Means must be provided to enable flight crewmembers to directly 
enter the passenger compartment from the pilot compartment if the 
cockpit door becomes jammed.

<R05>
Sec. 25.773  Pilot compartment view.

    (a) Nonprecipitation conditions. For nonprecipitation conditions, 
the following apply:
    (1) Each pilot compartment must be arranged to give the pilots a 
sufficiently extensive, clear, and undistorted view, to enable them to 
safely perform any maneuvers within the operating limitations of the 
airplane, including taxiing takeoff, approach, and landing.
    (2) Each pilot compartment must be free of glare and reflection that 
could interfere with the normal duties of the minimum flight crew 
(established under Sec. 25.1523). This must be shown in day and night 
flight tests under nonprecipitation conditions.
    (b) Precipitation conditions. For precipitation conditions, the 
following apply:
    (1) The airplane must have a means to maintain a clear portion of 
the windshield, during precipitation conditions, sufficient for both 
pilots to have a sufficiently extensive view along the flight path in 
normal flight attitudes of the airplane. This means must be designed to 
function, without continuous attention on the part of the crew, in--

[[Page 391]]

    (i) Heavy rain at speeds up to 1.6 V<INF>s1</INF> with lift and drag 
devices retracted; and
    (ii) The icing conditions specified in Sec. 25.1419 if certification 
with ice protection provisions is requested.
    (2) The first pilot must have--
    (i) A window that is openable under the conditions prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section when the cabin is not pressurized, 
provides the view specified in that paragraph, and gives sufficient 
protection from the elements against impairment of the pilot's vision; 
or
    (ii) An alternate means to maintain a clear view under the 
conditions specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, considering 
the probable damage due to a severe hail encounter.
    (c) Internal windshield and window fogging. The airplane must have a 
means to prevent fogging of the internal portions of the windshield and 
window panels over an area which would provide the visibility specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section under all internal and external ambient 
conditions, including precipitation conditions, in which the airplane is 
intended to be operated.
    (d) Fixed markers or other guides must be installed at each pilot 
station to enable the pilots to position themselves in their seats for 
an optimum combination of outside visibility and instrument scan. If 
lighted markers or guides are used they must comply with the 
requirements specified in Sec. 25.1381.

<R05>
Sec. 25.775  Windshields and windows.

    (a) Internal panes must be made of nonsplintering material.
    (b) Windshield panes directly in front of the pilots in the normal 
conduct of their duties, and the supporting structures for these panes, 
must withstand, without penetration, the impact of a four-pound bird 
when the velocity of the airplane (relative to the bird along the 
airplane's flight path) is equal to the value of V<INF>C</INF>, at sea 
level, selected under Sec. 25.335(a).
    (c) Unless it can be shown by analysis or tests that the probability 
of occurrence of a critical windshield fragmentation condition is of a 
low order, the airplane must have a means to minimize the danger to the 
pilots from flying windshield fragments due to bird impact. This must be 
shown for each transparent pane in the cockpit that--
    (1) Appears in the front view of the airplane;
    (2) Is inclined 15 degrees or more to the longitudinal axis of the 
airplane; and
    (3) Has any part of the pane located where its fragmentation will 
constitute a hazard to the pilots.
    (d) The design of windshields and windows in pressurized airplanes 
must be based on factors peculiar to high altitude operation, including 
the effects of continuous and cyclic pressurization loadings, the 
inherent characteristics of the material used, and the effects of 
temperatures and temperature differentials. The windshield and window 
panels must be capable of withstanding the maximum cabin pressure 
differential loads combined with critical aerodynamic pressure and 
temperature effects after any single failure in the installation or 
associated systems. It may be assumed that, after a single failure that 
is obvious to the flight crew (established under Sec. 25.1523), the 
cabin pressure differential is reduced from the maximum, in accordance 
with appropriate operating limitations, to allow continued safe flight 
of the airplane with a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 15,000 
feet.
    (e) The windshield panels in front of the pilots must be arranged so 
that, assuming the loss of vision through any one panel, one or more 
panels remain available for use by a pilot seated at a pilot station to 
permit continued safe flight and landing.

Sec. 25.777  Cockpit controls.

    (a) Each cockpit control must be located to provide convenient 
operation and to prevent confusion and inadvertent operation.
    (b) The direction of movement of cockpit controls must meet the 
requirements of Sec. 25.779. Wherever practicable, the sense of motion 
involved in

[[Page 392]]

the operation of other controls must correspond to the sense of the 
effect of the operation upon the airplane or upon the part operated. 
Controls of a variable nature using a rotary motion must move clockwise 
from the off position, through an increasing range, to the full on 
position.
    (c) The controls must be located and arranged, with respect to the 
pilots' seats, so that there is full and unrestricted movement of each 
control without interference from the cockpit structure or the clothing 
of the minimum flight crew (established under Sec. 25.1523) when any 
member of this flight crew, from 5'2'' to 6'3'' in height, is seated 
with the seat belt and shoulder harness (if provided) fastened.
    (d) Identical powerplant controls for each engine must be located to 
prevent confusion as to the engines they control.
    (e) Wing flap controls and other auxiliary lift device controls must 
be located on top of the pedestal, aft of the throttles, centrally or to 
the right of the pedestal centerline, and not less than 10 inches aft of 
the landing gear control.
    (f) The landing gear control must be located forward of the 
throttles and must be operable by each pilot when seated with seat belt 
and shoulder harness (if provided) fastened.
    (g) Control knobs must be shaped in accordance with Sec. 25.781. In 
addition, the knobs must be of the same color, and this color must 
contrast with the color of control knobs for other purposes and the 
surrounding cockpit.
    (h) If a flight engineer is required as part of the minimum flight 
crew (established under Sec. 25.1523), the airplane must have a flight 
engineer station located and arranged so that the flight crewmembers can 
perform their functions efficiently and without interfering with each 
other.

Sec. 25.783  Doors.

    (a) Each cabin must have at least one easily accessible external 
door.
    (b) There must be a means to lock and safeguard each external door 
against opening in flight (either inadvertently by persons or as a 
result of mechanical failure or failure of a single structural element 
either during or after closure). Each external door must be openable 
from both the inside and the outside, even though persons may be crowded 
against the door on the inside of the airplane. Inward opening doors may 
be used if there are means to prevent occupants from crowding against 
the door to an extent that would interfere with the opening of the door. 
The means of opening must be simple and obvious and must be arranged and 
marked so that it can be readily located and operated, even in darkness. 
Auxiliary locking devices may be used.
    (c) Each external door must be reasonably free from jamming as a 
result of fuselage deformation in a minor crash.
    (d) Each external door must be located where persons using them will 
not be endangered by the propellers when appropriate operating 
procedures are used.
    (e) There must be a provision for direct visual inspection of the 
locking mechanism to determine if external doors, for which the initial 
opening movement is not inward (including passenger, crew, service, and 
cargo doors), are fully closed and locked. The provision must be 
discernible under operational lighting conditions by appropriate 
crewmembers using a flashlight or equivalent lighting source. In 
addition, there must be a visual warning means to signal the appropriate 
flight crewmembers if any external door is not fully closed and locked. 
The means must be designed such that any failure or combination of 
failures that would result in an erroneous closed and locked indication 
is improbable for doors for which the initial opening movement is not 
inward.
    (f) External doors must have provisions to prevent the initiation of 
pressurization of the airplane to an unsafe level if the door is not 
fully closed and locked. In addition, it must be shown by safety 
analysis that inadvertent opening is extemely improbable.
    (g) Cargo and service doors not suitable for use as emergency exits 
need only meet paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and be safeguarded 
against opening in flight as a result of mechanical failure or failure 
of a single structural element.
    (h) Each passenger entry door in the side of the fuselage must meet 
the applicable requirements of Secs. 25.807 through 25.813 for a Type II 
or larger passenger emergency exit.
    (i) If an integral stair is installed in a passenger entry door that 
is qualified as a passenger emergency exit, the stair must be designed 
so that under the following conditions the effectiveness of passenger 
emergency egress will not be impaired:
    (1) The door, integral stair, and operating mechanism have been 
subjected to the inertia forces specified in Sec. 25.561(b)(3), acting 
separately relative to the surrounding structure.
    (2) The airplane is in the normal ground attitude and in each of the 
attitudes corresponding to collapse of one or more legs of the landing 
gear.
    (j) All lavatory doors must be designed to preclude anyone from 
becoming trapped inside the lavatory, and if a locking mechanism is 
installed, it be capable of being unlocked from the outside without the 
aid of special tools.

Sec. 25.785  Seats, berths, safety belts, and harnesses.

    (a) A seat (or berth for a nonambulant person) must be provided for 
each occupant who has reached his or her second birthday.
    (b) Each seat, berth, safety belt, harness, and adjacent part of the 
airplane at each station designated as occupiable during takeoff and 
landing must be designed so that a person making proper use of these 
facilities will not suffer serious injury in an emergency landing as a 
result of the inertia forces specified in Secs. 25.561 and 25.562.

[[Page 395]]

    (c) Each seat or berth must be approved.
    (d) Each occupant of a seat that makes more than an 18-degree angle 
with the vertical plane containing the airplane centerline must be 
protected from head injury by a safety belt and an energy absorbing rest 
that will support the arms, shoulders, head, and spine, or by a safety 
belt and shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting any 
injurious object. Each occupant of any other seat must be protected from 
head injury by a safety belt and, as appropriate to the type, location, 
and angle of facing of each seat, by one or more of the following:
    (1) A shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting 
any injurious object.
    (2) The elimination of any injurious object within striking radius 
of the head.
    (3) An energy absorbing rest that will support the arms, shoulders, 
head, and spine.
    (e) Each berth must be designed so that the forward part has a 
padded end board, canvas diaphragm, or equivalent means, that can 
withstand the static load reaction of the occupant when subjected to the 
forward inertia force specified in Sec. 25.561. Berths must be free from 
corners and protuberances likely to cause injury to a person occupying 
the berth during emergency conditions.
    (f) Each seat or berth, and its supporting structure, and each 
safety belt or harness and its anchorage must be designed for an 
occupant weight of 170 pounds, considering the maximum load factors, 
inertia forces, and reactions among the occupant, seat, safety belt, and 
harness for each relevant flight and ground load condition (including 
the emergency landing conditions prescribed in Sec. 25.561). In 
addition--
    (1) The structural analysis and testing of the seats, berths, and 
their supporting structures may be determined by assuming that the 
critical load in the forward, sideward, downward, upward, and rearward 
directions (as determined from the prescribed flight, ground, and 
emergency landing conditions) acts separately or using selected 
combinations of loads if the required strength in each specified 
direction is substantiated. The forward load factor need not be applied 
to safety belts for berths.
    (2) Each pilot seat must be designed for the reactions resulting 
from the application of the pilot forces prescribed in Sec. 25.395.
    (3) The inertia forces specified in Sec. 25.561 must be multiplied 
by a factor of 1.33 (instead of the fitting factor prescribed in 
Sec. 25.625) in determining the strength of the attachment of each seat 
to the structure and each belt or harness to the seat or structure.
    (g) Each seat at a flight deck station must have a restraint system 
consisting of a combined safety belt and shoulder harness with a single-
point release that permits the flight deck occupant, when seated with 
the restraint system fastened, to perform all of the occupant's 
necessary flight deck functions. There must be a means to secure each 
combined restraint system when not in use to prevent interference with 
the operation of the airplane and with rapid egress in an emergency.
    (h) Each seat located in the passenger compartment and designated 
for use during takeoff and landing by a flight attendant required by the 
operating rules of this chapter must be:
    (1) Near a required floor level emergency exit, except that another 
location is acceptable if the emergency egress of passengers would be 
enhanced with that location. A flight attendant seat must be located 
adjacent to each Type A or B emergency exit. Other flight attendant 
seats must be evenly distributed among the required floor- level 
emergency exits to the extent feasible.
    (2) To the extent possible, without compromising proximity to a 
required floor level emergency exit, located to provide a direct view of 
the cabin area for which the flight attendant is responsible.
    (3) Positioned so that the seat will not interfere with the use of a 
passageway or exit when the seat is not in use.
    (4) Located to minimize the probability that occupants would suffer 
injury by being struck by items dislodged from service areas, stowage 
compartments, or service equipment.
    (5) Either forward or rearward facing with an energy absorbing rest 
that is

[[Page 396]]

designed to support the arms, shoulders, head, and spine.
    (6) Equipped with a restraint system consisting of a combined safety 
belt and shoulder harness unit with a single point release. There must 
be means to secure each restraint system when not in use to prevent 
interference with rapid egress in an emergency.
    (i) Each safety belt must be equipped with a metal to metal latching 
device.
    (j) If the seat backs do not provide a firm handhold, there must be 
a handgrip or rail along each aisle to enable persons to steady 
themselves while using the aisles in moderately rough air.
    (k) Each projecting object that would injure persons seated or 
moving about the airplane in normal flight must be padded.
    (l) Each forward observer's seat required by the operating rules 
must be shown to be suitable for use in conducting the necessary enroute 
inspection.

Sec. 25.787  Stowage compartments.

    (a) Each compartment for the stowage of cargo, baggage, carry-on 
articles, and equipment (such as life rafts), and any other stowage 
compartment must be designed for its placarded maximum weight of 
contents and for the critical load distribution at the appropriate 
maximum load factors corresponding to the specified flight and ground 
load conditions, and to the emergency landing conditions of 
Sec. 25.561(b), except that the forces specified in the emergency 
landing conditions need not be applied to compartments located below, or 
forward, of all occupants in the airplane. If the airplane has a 
passenger seating configuration, excluding pilots seats, of 10 seats or 
more, each stowage compartment in the passenger cabin, except for 
underseat and overhead compartments for passenger convenience, must be 
completely enclosed.
    (b) There must be a means to prevent the contents in the 
compartments from becoming a hazard by shifting, under the loads 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section. For stowage compartments in 
the passenger and crew cabin, if the means used is a latched door, the 
design must take into consideration the wear and deterioration expected 
in service.
    (c) If cargo compartment lamps are installed, each lamp must be 
installed so as to prevent contact between lamp bulb and cargo.

Sec. 25.789  Retention of items of mass in passenger and crew compartments and galleys.

    (a) Means must be provided to prevent each item of mass (that is 
part of the airplane type design) in a passenger or crew compartment or 
galley from becoming a hazard by shifting under the appropriate maximum 
load factors corresponding to the specified flight and ground load 
conditions, and to the emergency landing conditions of Sec. 25.561(b).
    (b) Each interphone restraint system must be designed so that when 
subjected to the load factors specified in Sec. 25.561(b)(3), the 
interphone will remain in its stowed position.

Sec. 25.791  Passenger information signs and placards.

    (a) If smoking is to be prohibited, there must be at least one 
placard so stating that is legible to each person seated in the cabin. 
If smoking is to be allowed, and if the crew compartment is separated 
from the passenger compartment, there must be at least one sign 
notifying when smoking is prohibited. Signs which notify when smoking is 
prohibited must be operable by a member of the flightcrew and, when 
illuminated, must be legible under all probable conditions of cabin 
illumination to each person seated in the cabin.
    (b) Signs that notify when seat belts should be fastened and that 
are installed to comply with the operating rules of this chapter must be 
operable by a member of the flightcrew and, when illuminated, must be 
legible under all probable conditions of cabin

[[Page 397]]

illumination to each person seated in the cabin.
    (c) A placard must be located on or adjacent to the door of each 
receptacle used for the disposal of flammable waste materials to 
indicate that use of the receptacle for disposal of cigarettes, etc., is 
prohibited.
    (d) Lavatories must have ``No Smoking'' or ``No Smoking in 
Lavatory'' placards conspicuously located on or adjacent to each side of 
the entry door.
    (e) Symbols that clearly express the intent of the sign or placard 
may be used in lieu of letters.

                          Emergency Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 25.801  Ditching.

    (a) If certification with ditching provisions is requested, the 
airplane must meet the requirements of this section and Secs. 25.807(e), 
25.1411, and 25.1415(a).
    (b) Each practicable design measure, compatible with the general 
characteristics of the airplane, must be taken to minimize the 
probability that in an emergency landing on water, the behavior of the 
airplane would cause immediate injury to the occupants or would make it 
impossible for them to escape.
    (c) The probable behavior of the airplane in a water landing must be 
investigated by model tests or by comparison with airplanes of similar 
configuration for which the ditching characteristics are known. Scoops, 
flaps, projections, and any other factor likely to affect the 
hydrodynamic characteristics of the airplane, must be considered.
    (d) It must be shown that, under reasonably probable water 
conditions, the flotation time and trim of the airplane will allow the 
occupants to leave the airplane and enter the liferafts required by 
Sec. 25.1415. If compliance with this provision is shown by buoyancy and 
trim computations, appropriate allowances must be made for probable 
structural damage and leakage. If the airplane has fuel tanks (with fuel 
jettisoning provisions) that can reasonably be expected to withstand a 
ditching without leakage, the jettisonable volume of fuel may be 
considered as buoyancy volume.
    (e) Unless the effects of the collapse of external doors and windows 
are accounted for in the investigation of the probable behavior of the 
airplane in a water landing (as prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section), the external doors and windows must be designed to 
withstand the probable maximum local pressures. 
[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-72, 
55 FR 29781, July 20, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 25.803  Emergency evacuation.

    (a) Each crew and passenger area must have emergency means to allow 
rapid evacuation in crash landings, with the landing gear extended as 
well as with the landing gear retracted, considering the possibility of 
the airplane being on fire.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) For airplanes having a seating capacity of more than 44 
passengers, it must be shown that the maximum seating capacity, 
including the number of crewmembers required by the operating rules for 
which certification is requested, can be evacuated from the airplane to 
the ground under simulated emergency conditions within 90 seconds. 
Compliance with this requirement must be shown by actual demonstration 
using the test criteria outlined in appendix J of this part unless the 
Administrator finds that a combination of analysis and testing will 
provide data equivalent to that which would be obtained by actual 
demonstration.
    (d)-(e)  [Reserved]

[Doc. No. 24344, 55 FR 29781, July 20, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 25.807  Emergency exits.

    (a) Type. For the purpose of this part, the types of exits are 
defined as follows:
    (1) Type I. This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular 
opening of not less than 24 inches wide by 48 inches high, with corner 
radii not greater than eight inches.

[[Page 398]]

    (2) Type II. This type is a rectangular opening of not less than 20 
inches wide by 44 inches high, with corner radii not greater than seven 
inches. Type II exits must be floor-level exits unless located over the 
wing, in which case they must not have a step-up inside the airplane of 
more than 10 inches nor a step-down outside the airplane of more than 17 
inches.
    (3) Type III. This type is a rectangular opening of not less than 20 
inches wide by 36 inches high with corner radii not greater than seven 
inches, and with a step-up inside the airplane of not more than 20 
inches. If the exit is located over the wing, the step-down outside the 
airplane may not exceed 27 inches.
    (4) Type IV. This type is a rectangular opening of not less than 19 
inches wide by 26 inches high, with corner radii not greater than 6.3 
inches, located over the wing, with a step-up inside the airplane of not 
more than 29 inches and a step-down outside the airplane of not more 
than 36 inches.
    (5) Ventral. This type is an exit from the passenger compartment 
through the pressure shell and the bottom fuselage skin. The dimensions 
and physical configuration of this type of exit must allow at least the 
same rate of egress as a Type I exit with the airplane in the normal 
ground attitude, with landing gear extended.
    (6) Tailcone. This type is an aft exit from the passenger 
compartment through the pressure shell and through an openable cone of 
the fuselage aft of the pressure shell. The means of opening the 
tailcone must be simple and obvious and must employ a single operation.
    (7) Type A. This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular 
opening of not less than 42 inches wide by 72 inches high, with corner 
radii not greater than seven inches.
    (8) Type B. This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular 
opening of not less than 32 inches wide by 72 inches high, with corner 
radii not greater than six inches.
    (9) Type C. This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular 
opening of not less than 30 inches wide by 48 inches high, with corner 
radii not greater than 10 inches.
    (b) Step down distance. Step down distance, as used in this section, 
means the actual distance between the bottom of the required opening and 
a usable foot hold, extending out from the fuselage, that is large 
enough to be effective without searching by sight or feel.
    (c) Over-sized exits. Openings larger than those specified in this 
section, whether or not of rectangular shape, may be used if the 
specified rectangular opening can be inscribed within the opening and 
the base of the inscribed rectangular opening meets the specified step-
up and step-down heights.
    (d) Asymmetry. Exits of an exit pair need not be diametrically 
opposite each other nor of the same size; however, the number of 
passenger seats permitted under paragraph (g) of this section is based 
on the smaller of the two exits.
    (e) Uniformity. Exits must be distributed as uniformly as practical, 
taking into account passenger seat distribution.
    (f) Location. (1) Each required passenger emergency exit must be 
accessible to the passengers and located where it will afford the most 
effective means of passenger evacuation.
    (2) If only one floor-level exit per side is prescribed, and the 
airplane does not have a tailcone or ventral emergency exit, the floor-
level exits must be in the rearward part of the passenger compartment 
unless another location affords a more effective means of passenger 
evacuation.
    (3) If more than one floor-level exit per side is prescribed, and 
the airplane does not have a combination cargo and passenger 
configuration, at least one floor-level exit must be located in each 
side near each end of the cabin.
    (g) Type and number required. The maximum number of passenger seats 
permitted depends on the type and number of exits installed in each side 
of the fuselage. Except as further restricted in paragraphs (g)(1) 
through (g)(9) of this section, the maximum number of passenger seats 
permitted for each exit of a specific type installed in each side of the 
fuselage is as follows:

Type A                                                           110    

[[Page 399]]

                                                                        
Type B                                                            75    
Type C                                                            55    
Type I                                                            45    
Type II                                                           40    
Type III                                                          35    
Type IV                                                            9    
                                                                        

    (1) For a passenger seating configuration of 1 to 9 seats, there 
must be at least one Type IV or larger overwing exit in each side of the 
fuselage or, if overwing exits are not provided, at least one exit in 
each side that meets the minimum dimensions of a Type III exit.
    (2) For a passenger seating configuration of more than 9 seats, each 
exit must be a Type III or larger exit.
    (3) For a passenger seating configuration of 10 to 19 seats, there 
must be at least one Type III or larger exit in each side of the 
fuselage.
    (4) For a passenger seating configuration of 20 to 40 seats, there 
must be at least two exits, one of which must be a Type II or larger 
exit, in each side of the fuselage.
    (5) For a passenger seating configuration of 41 to 110 seats, there 
must be at least two exits, one of which must be a Type I or larger 
exit, in each side of the fuselage.
    (6) For a passenger seating configuration of more than 110 seats, 
the emergency exits in each side of the fuselage must include at least 
two Type I or larger exits.
    (7) The combined maximum number of passenger seats permitted for all 
Type III exits is 70, and the combined maximum number of passenger seats 
permitted for two Type III exits in each side of the fuselage that are 
separated by fewer than three passenger seat rows is 65.
    (8) If a Type A, Type B, or Type C exit is installed, there must be 
at least two Type C or larger exits in each side of the fuselage.
    (9) If a passenger ventral or tailcone exit is installed and that 
exit provides at least the same rate of egress as a Type III exit with 
the airplane in the most adverse exit opening condition that would 
result from the collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear, an 
increase in the passenger seating configuration is permitted as follows:
    (i) For a ventral exit, 12 additional passenger seats.
    (ii) For a tailcone exit incorporating a floor level opening of not 
less than 20 inches wide by 60 inches high, with corner radii not 
greater than seven inches, in the pressure shell and incorporating an 
approved assist means in accordance with Sec. 25.810(a), 25 additional 
passenger seats.
    (iii) For a tailcone exit incorporating an opening in the pressure 
shell which is at least equivalent to a Type III emergency exit with 
respect to dimensions, step-up and step-down distance, and with the top 
of the opening not less than 56 inches from the passenger compartment 
floor, 15 additional passenger seats.
    (h) Excess exits. Each emergency exit in the passenger compartment 
in excess of the minimum number of required emergency exits must meet 
the applicable requirements of Sec. 25.809 through Sec. 25.812, and must 
be readily accessible.
    (i) Ditching emergency exits for passengers. Whether or not ditching 
certification is requested, ditching emergency exits must be provided in 
accordance with the following requirements, unless the emergency exits 
required by paragraph (g) of this section already meet them:
    (1) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of 
nine or fewer seats, excluding pilot seats, one exit above the waterline 
in each side of the airplane, meeting at least the dimensions of a Type 
IV exit.
    (2) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of 10 
of more seats, excluding pilot seats, one exit above the waterline in a 
side of the airplane, meeting at least the dimensions of a Type III exit 
for each unit (or part of a unit) of 35 passenger seats, but no less 
than two such exits in the passenger cabin, with one on each side of the 
airplane. The passenger seat/ exit ratio may be increased through the 
use of larger exits, or other means, provided it is shown that the 
evacuation capability during ditching has been improved accordingly.
    (3) If it is impractical to locate side exits above the waterline, 
the side exits must be replaced by an equal number of readily accessible 
overhead hatches of not less than the dimensions

[[Page 400]]

of a Type III exit, except that for airplanes with a passenger 
configuration of 35 or fewer seats, excluding pilot seats, the two 
required Type III side exits need be replaced by only one overhead 
hatch.

Sec. 25.809  Emergency exit arrangement.

    (a) Each emergency exit, including a flight crew emergency exit, 
must be a movable door or hatch in the external walls of the fuselage, 
allowing unobstructed opening to the outside.
    (b) Each emergency exit must be openable from the inside and the 
outside except that sliding window emergency exits in the flight crew 
area need not be openable from the outside if other approved exits are 
convenient and readily accessible to the flight crew area. Each 
emergency exit must be capable of being opened, when there is no 
fuselage deformation--
    (1) With the airplane in the normal ground attitude and in each of 
the attitudes corresponding to collapse of one or more legs of the 
landing gear; and
    (2) Within 10 seconds measured from the time when the opening means 
is actuated to the time when the exit is fully opened.
    (c) The means of opening emergency exits must be simple and obvious 
and may not require exceptional effort. Internal exit-opening means 
involving sequence operations (such as operation of two handles or 
latches or the release of safety catches) may be used for flight crew 
emergency exits if it can be reasonably established that these means are 
simple and obvious to crewmembers trained in their use.
    (d) If a single power-boost or single power-operated system is the 
primary system for operating more than one exit in an emergency, each 
exit must be capable of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section in the event of failure of the primary system. Manual 
operation of the exit (after failure of the primary system) is 
acceptable.
    (e) Each emergency exit must be shown by tests, or by a combination 
of analysis and tests, to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section.
    (f) There must be a means to lock each emergency exit and to 
safeguard against its opening in flight, either inadvertently by persons 
or as a result of mechanical failure. In addition, there must be a means 
for direct visual inspection of the locking mechanism by crewmembers to 
determine that each emergency exit, for which the initial opening 
movement is outward, is fully locked.
    (g) There must be provisions to minimize the probability of jamming 
of the emergency exits resulting from fuselage deformation in a minor 
crash landing.
    (h) When required by the operating rules for any large passenger-
carrying turbojet-powered airplane, each ventral exit and tailcone exit 
must be--
    (1) Designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during 
flight; and
    (2) Marked with a placard readable from a distance of 30 inches and 
installed at a conspicuous location near the means of opening the exit, 
stating that the exit has been designed and constructed so that it 
cannot be opened during flight.

Sec. 25.810  Emergency egress assist means and escape routes.

    (a) Each non over-wing Type A, Type B or Type C exit, and any other 
non over-wing landplane emergency exit more than 6 feet from the ground 
with the airplane on the ground and the landing gear extended, must have 
an approved means to assist the occupants in descending to the ground.
    (1) The assisting means for each passenger emergency exit must be a 
self-supporting slide or equivalent; and, in the case of Type A or Type 
B exits, it must be capable of carrying simultaneously two parallel 
lines of evacuees. In addition, the assisting means must be designed to 
meet the following requirements--

[[Page 401]]

    (i) It must be automatically deployed and deployment must begin 
during the interval between the time the exit opening means is actuated 
from inside the airplane and the time the exit is fully opened. However, 
each passenger emergency exit which is also a passenger entrance door or 
a service door must be provided with means to prevent deployment of the 
assisting means when it is opened from either the inside or the outside 
under nonemergency conditions for normal use.
    (ii) Except for assisting means installed at Type C exits, it must 
be automatically erected within 6 seconds after deployment is begun. 
Assisting means installed at Type C exits must be automatically erected 
within 10 seconds from the time the opening means of the exit is 
actuated.
    (iii) It must be of such length after full deployment that the lower 
end is self-supporting on the ground and provides safe evacuation of 
occupants to the ground after collapse of one or more legs of the 
landing gear.
    (iv) It must have the capability, in 25-knot winds directed from the 
most critical angle, to deploy and, with the assistance of only one 
person, to remain usable after full deployment to evacuate occupants 
safely to the ground.
    (v) For each system installation (mockup or airplane installed), 
five consecutive deployment and inflation tests must be conducted (per 
exit) without failure, and at least three tests of each such five-test 
series must be conducted using a single representative sample of the 
device. The sample devices must be deployed and inflated by the system's 
primary means after being subjected to the inertia forces specified in 
Sec. 25.561(b). If any part of the system fails or does not function 
properly during the required tests, the cause of the failure or 
malfunction must be corrected by positive means and after that, the full 
series of five consecutive deployment and inflation tests must be 
conducted without failure.
    (2) The assisting means for flightcrew emergency exits may be a rope 
or any other means demonstrated to be suitable for the purpose. If the 
assisting means is a rope, or an approved device equivalent to a rope, 
it must be--
    (i) Attached to the fuselage structure at or above the top of the 
emergency exit opening, or, for a device at a pilot's emergency exit 
window, at another approved location if the stowed device, or its 
attachment, would reduce the pilot's view in flight;
    (ii) Able (with its attachment) to withstand a 400-pound static 
load.
    (b) Assist means from the cabin to the wing are required for each 
type A or Type B exit located above the wing and having a stepdown 
unless the exit without an assist-means can be shown to have a rate of 
passenger egress at least equal to that of the same type of non over-
wing exit. If an assist means is required, it must be automatically 
deployed and automatically erected concurrent with the opening of the 
exit. In the case of assist means installed at Type C exits, it must be 
self-supporting within 10 seconds from the time the opening means of the 
exits is actuated. For all other exit types, it must be self-supporting 
6 seconds after deployment is begun.
    (c) An escape route must be established from each overwing emergency 
exit, and (except for flap surfaces suitable as slides) covered with a 
slip resistant surface. Except where a means for channeling the flow of 
evacuees is provided--
    (1) The escape route from each Type A or Type B passenger emergency 
exit, or any common escape route from two Type III passenger emergency 
exits, must be at least 42 inches wide; that from any other passenger 
emergency exit must be at least 24 inches wide; and
    (2) The escape route surface must have a reflectance of at least 80 
percent, and must be defined by markings with a surface-to-marking 
contrast ratio of at least 5:1.
    (d) Means must be provided to assist evacuees to reach the ground 
for all Type C exits located over the wing and, if the place on the 
airplane structure at which the escape route required in paragraph (c) 
of this section terminates is more than 6 feet from the ground with the 
airplane on the ground and the landing gear extended, for all other exit 
types.

[[Page 402]]

    (1) If the escape route is over the flap, the height of the terminal 
edge must be measured with the flap in the takeoff or landing position, 
whichever is higher from the ground.
    (2) The assisting means must be usable and self-supporting with one 
or more landing gear legs collapsed and under a 25-knot wind directed 
from the most critical angle.
    (3) The assisting means provided for each escape route leading from 
a Type A or B emergency exit must be capable of carrying simultaneously 
two parallel lines of evacuees; and, the assisting means leading from 
any other exit type must be capable of carrying as many parallel lines 
of evacuees as there are required escape routes.
    (4) The assisting means provided for each escape route leading from 
a Type C exit must be automatically erected within 10 seconds from the 
time the opening means of the exit is actuated, and that provided for 
the escape route leading from any other exit type must be automatically 
erected within 10 seconds after actuation of the erection system.

Sec. 25.811  Emergency exit marking.

    (a) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its 
means of opening must be conspicuously marked.
    (b) The identity and location of each passenger emergency exit must 
be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin.
    (c) Means must be provided to assist the occupants in locating the 
exits in conditions of dense smoke.
    (d) The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated 
by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger 
aisle (or aisles). There must be--
    (1) A passenger emergency exit locator sign above the aisle (or 
aisles) near each passenger emergency exit, or at another overhead 
location if it is more practical because of low headroom, except that 
one sign may serve more than one exit if each exit can be seen readily 
from the sign;
    (2) A passenger emergency exit marking sign next to each passenger 
emergency exit, except that one sign may serve two such exits if they 
both can be seen readily from the sign; and
    (3) A sign on each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft 
vision along the passenger cabin to indicate emergency exits beyond and 
obscured by the bulkhead or divider, except that if this is not possible 
the sign may be placed at another appropriate location.
    (e) The location of the operating handle and instructions for 
opening exits from the inside of the airplane must be shown in the 
following manner:
    (1) Each passenger emergency exit must have, on or near the exit, a 
marking that is readable from a distance of 30 inches.
    (2) Each Type A, Type B, Type C or Type I passenger emergency exit 
operating handle must--
    (i) Be self-illuminated with an initial brightness of at least 160 
microlamberts; or
    (ii) Be conspicuously located and well illuminated by the emergency 
lighting even in conditions of occupant crowding at the exit.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) Each Type A, Type B, Type C, Type I, or Type II passenger 
emergency exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the 
handle must be marked--
    (i) With a red arrow, with a shaft at least three-fourths of an inch 
wide and a head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 
70 degrees of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of 
the handle length.
    (ii) So that the centerline of the exit handle is within 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 inch of the projected point of the arrow when the 
handle has reached full travel and has released the locking mechanism, 
and
    (iii) With the word ``open'' in red letters 1 inch high, placed 
horizontally near the head of the arrow.
    (f) Each emergency exit that is required to be openable from the 
outside, and its means of opening, must be marked on the outside of the 
airplane. In addition, the following apply:
    (1) The outside marking for each passenger emergency exit in the 
side of the fuselage must include a 2-inch colored band outlining the 
exit.

[[Page 403]]

    (2) Each outside marking including the band, must have color 
contrast to be readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage 
surface. The contrast must be such that if the reflectance of the darker 
color is 15 percent or less, the reflectance of the lighter color must 
be at least 45 percent. ``Reflectance'' is the ratio of the luminous 
flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives. When the 
reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 percent, at least a 
30-percent difference between its reflectance and the reflectance of the 
lighter color must be provided.
    (3) In the case of exists other than those in the side of the 
fuselage, such as ventral or tailcone exists, the external means of 
opening, including instructions if applicable, must be conspicuously 
marked in red, or bright chrome yellow if the background color is such 
that red is inconspicuous. When the opening means is located on only one 
side of the fuselage, a conspicuous marking to that effect must be 
provided on the other side.
    (g) Each sign required by paragraph (d) of this section may use the 
word ``exit'' in its legend in place of the term ``emergency exit''.

Sec. 25.812  Emergency lighting.

    (a) An emergency lighting system, independent of the main lighting 
system, must be installed. However, the sources of general cabin 
illumination may be common to both the emergency and the main lighting 
systems if the power supply to the emergency lighting system is 
independent of the power supply to the main lighting system. The 
emergency lighting system must include:
    (1) Illuminated emergency exit marking and locating signs, sources 
of general cabin illumination, interior lighting in emergency exit 
areas, and floor proximity escape path marking.
    (2) Exterior emergency lighting.
    (b) Emergency exit signs--
    (1) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration, 
excluding pilot seats, of 10 seats or more must meet the following 
requirements:
    (i) Each passenger emergency exit locator sign required by 
Sec. 25.811(d)(1) and each passenger emergency exit marking sign 
required by Sec. 25.811(d)(2) must have red letters at least 1\1/2\ 
inches high on an illuminated white background, and must have an area of 
at least 21 square inches excluding the letters. The lighted background-
to-letter contrast must be at least 10 : 1. The letter height to stroke-
width ratio may not be more than 7 : 1 nor less than 6 : 1. These signs 
must be internally electrically illuminated with a background brightness 
of at least 25 foot-lamberts and a high-to-low background contrast no 
greater than 3 : 1.
    (ii) Each passenger emergency exit sign required by 
Sec. 25.811(d)(3) must have red letters at least 1\1/2\ inches high on a 
white background having an area of at least 21 square inches excluding 
the letters. These signs must be internally electrically illuminated or 
self-illuminated by other than electrical means and must have an initial 
brightness of at least 400 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed in 
the case of a sign that is self-illuminated by other than electrical 
means.
    (2) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration, 
excluding pilot seats, of nine seats or less, that are required by 
Sec. 25.811(d)(1), (2), and (3) must have red letters at least 1 inch 
high on a white background at least 2 inches high. These signs may be 
internally electrically illuminated, or self-illuminated by other than 
electrical means, with an initial brightness of at least 160 
microlamberts. The colors may be reversed in the case of a sign that is 
self-illuminated by other than electrical means.
    (c) General illumination in the passenger cabin must be provided so 
that when measured along the centerline of main passenger aisle(s), and 
cross aisle(s) between main aisles, at seat arm-rest height and at 40-
inch intervals, the average illumination is not less than 0.05 foot-
candle and the illumination at each 40-inch interval is not less than 
0.01 foot-candle. A main passenger aisle(s) is considered to extend

[[Page 404]]

along the fuselage from the most forward passenger emergency exit or 
cabin occupant seat, whichever is farther forward, to the most rearward 
passenger emergency exit or cabin occupant seat, whichever is farther 
aft.
    (d) The floor of the passageway leading to each floor-level 
passenger emergency exit, between the main aisles and the exit openings, 
must be provided with illumination that is not less than 0.02 foot-
candle measured along a line that is within 6 inches of and parallel to 
the floor and is centered on the passenger evacuation path.
    (e) Floor proximity emergency escape path marking must provide 
emergency evacuation guidance for passengers when all sources of 
illumination more than 4 feet above the cabin aisle floor are totally 
obscured. In the dark of the night, the floor proximity emergency escape 
path marking must enable each passenger to--
    (1) After leaving the passenger seat, visually identify the 
emergency escape path along the cabin aisle floor to the first exits or 
pair of exits forward and aft of the seat; and
    (2) Readily identify each exit from the emergency escape path by 
reference only to markings and visual features not more than 4 feet 
above the cabin floor.
    (f) Except for subsystems provided in accordance with paragraph (h) 
of this section that serve no more than one assist means, are 
independent of the airplane's main emergency lighting system, and are 
automatically activated when the assist means is erected, the emergency 
lighting system must be designed as follows.
    (1) The lights must be operable manually from the flight crew 
station and from a point in the passenger compartment that is readily 
accessible to a normal flight attendant seat.
    (2) There must be a flight crew warning light which illuminates when 
power is on in the airplane and the emergency lighting control device is 
not armed.
    (3) The cockpit control device must have an ``on,'' ``off,'' and 
``armed'' position so that when armed in the cockpit or turned on at 
either the cockpit or flight attendant station the lights will either 
light or remain lighted upon interruption (except an interruption caused 
by a transverse vertical separation of the fuselage during crash 
landing) of the airplane's normal electric power. There must be a means 
to safeguard against inadvertent operation of the control device from 
the ``armed'' or ``on'' positions.
    (g) Exterior emergency lighting must be provided as follows:
    (1) At each overwing emergency exit the illumination must be--
    (i) Not less than 0.03 foot-candle (measured normal to the direction 
of the incident light) on a 2-square-foot area where an evacuee is 
likely to make his first step outside the cabin;
    (ii) Not less than 0.05 foot-candle (measured normal to the 
direction of incident light) along the 30 percent of the slip-resistant 
portion of the escape route required in Sec. 25.810(c) that is farthest 
from the exit for the minimum required width of the escape route; and
    (iii) Not less than 0.03 foot-candle on the ground surface with the 
landing gear extended (measured normal to the direction of the incident 
light) where an evacuee using the established escape route would 
normally make first contact with the ground.
    (2) At each non-overwing emergency exit not required by 
Sec. 25.809(f) to have descent assist means the illumination must be not 
less than 0.03 foot-candle (measured normal to the direction of the 
incident light) on the ground surface with the landing gear extended 
where an evacuee is likely to make his first contact with the ground 
outside the cabin.
    (h) The means required in Sec. 25.809 (f)(1) and (h) to assist the 
occupants in descending to the ground must be illuminated so that the 
erected assist means is visible from the airplane.
    (1) If the assist means is illuminated by exterior emergency 
lighting, it must provide illumination of not less than 0.03 foot-candle 
(measured normal to the direction of the incident light) at the ground 
end of the erected assist means where an evacuee using the established 
escape route would normally make first contact with the ground, with the 
airplane in each of the attitudes corresponding to the collapse of one 
or more legs of the landing gear.
    (2) If the emergency lighting subsystem illuminating the assist 
means

[[Page 405]]

serves no other assist means, is independent of the airplane's main 
emergency lighting system, and is automatically activated when the 
assist means is erected, the lighting provisions--
    (i) May not be adversely affected by stowage; and
    (ii) Must provide illumination of not less than 0.03 foot-candle 
(measured normal to the direction of incident light) at the ground and 
of the erected assist means where an evacuee would normally make first 
contact with the ground, with the airplane in each of the attitudes 
corresponding to the collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear.
    (i) The energy supply to each emergency lighting unit must provide 
the required level of illumination for at least 10 minutes at the 
critical ambient conditions after emergency landing.
    (j) If storage batteries are used as the energy supply for the 
emergency lighting system, they may be recharged from the airplane's 
main electric power system: Provided, That, the charging circuit is 
designed to preclude inadvertent battery discharge into charging circuit 
faults.
    (k) Components of the emergency lighting system, including 
batteries, wiring relays, lamps, and switches must be capable of normal 
operation after having been subjected to the inertia forces listed in 
Sec. 25.561(b).
    (l) The emergency lighting system must be designed so that after any 
single transverse vertical separation of the fuselage during crash 
landing--
    (1) Not more than 25 percent of all electrically illuminated 
emergency lights required by this section are rendered inoperative, in 
addition to the lights that are directly damaged by the separation;
    (2) Each electrically illuminated exit sign required under 
Sec. 25.811(d)(2) remains operative exclusive of those that are directly 
damaged by the separation; and
    (3) At least one required exterior emergency light for each side of 
the airplane remains operative exclusive of those that are directly 
damaged by the separation.

Sec. 25.813  Emergency exit access.

    Each required emergency exit must be accessible to the passengers 
and located where it will afford an effective means of evacuation. 
Emergency exit distribution must be as uniform as practical, taking 
passenger distribution into account; however, the size and location of 
exits on both sides of the cabin need not be symmetrical. If only one 
floor level exit per side is prescribed, and the airplane does not have 
a tailcone or ventral emergency exit, the floor level exit must be in 
the rearward part of the passenger compartment, unless another location 
affords a more effective means of passenger evacuation. Where more than 
one floor level exit per side is prescribed, at least one floor level 
exit per side must be located near each end of the cabin, except that 
this provision does not apply to combination cargo/passenger 
configurations. In addition--
    (a) There must be a passageway leading from the nearest main aisle 
to each Type A, Type B, Type C, Type I, or Type II emergency exit and 
between individual passenger areas. Each passageway leading to a Type A 
or Type B exit must be unobstructed and at least 36 inches wide. 
Passageways between individual passenger areas and those leading to Type 
I, Type II, or Type C emergency exits must be unobstructed and at least 
20 inches wide. Unless there are two or more main aisles, each Type A or 
B exit must be located so that there is passenger flow along the main 
aisle to that exit from both the forward and aft directions. If two or 
more main aisles are provided, there must be unobstructed cross-aisles 
at least 20 inches wide between main aisles. There must be--
    (1) A cross-aisle which leads directly to each passageway between 
the nearest main aisle and a Type A or B exit; and

[[Page 406]]

    (2) A cross-aisle which leads to the immediate vicinity of each 
passageway between the nearest main aisle and a Type 1, Type II, or Type 
III exit; except that when two Type III exits are located within three 
passenger rows of each other, a single cross-aisle may be used if it 
leads to the vicinity between the passageways from the nearest main 
aisle to each exit.
    (b) Adequate space to allow crewmember(s) to assist in the 
evacuation of passengers must be provided as follows:
    (1) The assist space must not reduce the unobstructed width of the 
passageway below that required for the exit.
    (2) For each Type A or Type B exit, assist space must be provided at 
each side of the exit regardless of whether a means is required by 
Sec. 25.810(a) to assist passengers in descending to the ground from 
that exit.
    (3) Assist space must be provided at one side of any other type exit 
required by Sec. 25.810(a) to have a means to assist passengers in 
descending to the ground from that exit.
    (c) The following must be provided for each Type III or Type IV 
exit--(1) There must be access from the nearest aisle to each exit. In 
addition, for each Type III exit in an airplane that has a passenger 
seating configuration of 60 or more--
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii), the access must be 
provided by an unobstructed passageway that is at least 10 inches in 
width for interior arrangements in which the adjacent seat rows on the 
exit side of the aisle contain no more than two seats, or 20 inches in 
width for interior arrangements in which those rows contain three seats. 
The width of the passageway must be measured with adjacent seats 
adjusted to their most adverse position. The centerline of the required 
passageway width must not be displaced more than 5 inches horizontally 
from that of the exit.
    (ii) In lieu of one 10- or 20-inch passageway, there may be two 
passageways, between seat rows only, that must be at least 6 inches in 
width and lead to an unobstructed space adjacent to each exit. (Adjacent 
exits must not share a common passageway.) The width of the passageways 
must be measured with adjacent seats adjusted to their most adverse 
position. The unobstructed space adjacent to the exit must extend 
vertically from the floor to the ceiling (or bottom of sidewall stowage 
bins), inboard from the exit for a distance not less than the width of 
the narrowest passenger seat installed on the airplane, and from the 
forward edge of the forward passageway to the aft edge of the aft 
passageway. The exit opening must be totally within the fore and aft 
bounds of the unobstructed space.
    (2) In addition to the access--
    (i) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of 20 
or more, the projected opening of the exit provided must not be 
obstructed and there must be no interference in opening the exit by 
seats, berths, or other protrusions (including any seatback in the most 
adverse position) for a distance from that exit not less than the width 
of the narrowest passenger seat installed on the airplane.
    (ii) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of 19 
or fewer, there may be minor obstructions in this region, if there are 
compensating factors to maintain the effectiveness of the exit.
    (3) For each Type III exit, regardless of the passenger capacity of 
the airplane in which it is installed, there must be placards that--
    (i) Are readable by all persons seated adjacent to and facing a 
passageway to the exit;
    (ii) Accurately state or illustrate the proper method of opening the 
exit, including the use of handholds; and
    (iii) If the exit is a removable hatch, state the weight of the 
hatch and indicate an appropriate location to place the hatch after 
removal.
    (d) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between 
passenger compartments to reach any required emergency exit from any 
seat in the passenger cabin, the passageway must be unobstructed. 
However, curtains may be used if they allow free entry through the 
passageway.
    (e) No door may be installed in any partition between passenger 
compartments.
    (f) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating the 
passenger

[[Page 407]]

cabin from other areas to reach any required emergency exit from any 
passenger seat, the door must have a means to latch it in open position. 
The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed upon it 
when the door is subjected to the ultimate inertia forces, relative to 
the surrounding structure, listed in Sec. 25.561(b).

Sec. 25.819  Lower deck service compartments (including galleys).

    For airplanes with a service compartment located below the main 
deck, which may be occupied during taxi or flight but not during takeoff 
or landing, the following apply:
    (a) There must be at least two emergency evacuation routes, one at 
each end of each lower deck service compartment or two having sufficient 
separation within each compartment, which could be used by each occupant 
of the lower deck service compartment to rapidly evacuate to the main 
deck under normal and emergency lighting conditions. The routes must 
provide for the evacuation of incapacitated persons, with assistance. 
The use of the evacuation routes may not be dependent on any powered 
device. The routes must be designed to minimize the possibility of 
blockage which might result from fire, mechanical or structural failure, 
or persons standing on top of or against the escape routes. In the event 
the airplane's main power system or compartment main lighting system 
should fail, emergency illumination for each lower deck service 
compartment must be automatically provided.
    (b) There must be a means for two-way voice communication between 
the flight deck and each lower deck service compartment.
    (c) There must be an aural emergency alarm system, audible during 
normal and emergency conditions, to enable crewmembers on the flight 
deck and at each required floor level emergency exit to alert occupants 
of each lower deck service compartment of an emergency situation.
    (d) There must be a means, readily detectable by occupants of each 
lower deck service compartment, that indicates when seat belts should be 
fastened.
    (e) If a public address system is installed in the airplane, 
speakers must be provided in each lower deck service compartment.
    (f) For each occupant permitted in a lower deck service compartment, 
there must be a forward or aft facing seat which meets the requirements

<R05>
Sec. 25.831  Ventilation.

    (a) Under normal operating conditions and in the event of any 
probable failure conditions of any system which would adversely affect 
the ventilating air, the ventilation system must be designed to provide 
a sufficient amount of uncontaminated air to enable the crewmembers to 
perform their duties without undue discomfort or fatigue and to provide 
reasonable passenger comfort. For normal operating conditions, the 
ventilation system must be designed to provide each occupant with an 
airflow containing at least 0.55 pounds of fresh air per minute.
    (b) Crew and passenger compartment air must be free from harmful or 
hazardous concentrations of gases or vapors. In meeting this 
requirement, the following apply:
    (1) Carbon monoxide concentrations in excess of 1 part in 20,000 
parts of air are considered hazardous. For test purposes, any acceptable 
carbon monoxide detection method may be used.
    (2) Carbon dioxide concentration during flight must be shown not to 
exceed 0.5 percent by volume (sea level equivalent) in compartments 
normally occupied by passengers or crewmembers.
    (c) There must be provisions made to ensure that the conditions 
prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section are met after reasonably 
probable failures or malfunctioning of the ventilating, heating, 
pressurization, or other systems and equipment.
    (d) If accumulation of hazardous quantities of smoke in the cockpit 
area is reasonably probable, smoke evacuation must be readily 
accomplished, starting with full pressurization and without 
depressurizing beyond safe limits.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, means must 
be provided to enable the occupants of the following compartments and 
areas to control the temperature and quantity of ventilating air 
supplied to their compartment or area independently of the temperature 
and quantity of air supplied to other compartments and areas:
    (1) The flight crew compartment.
    (2) Crewmember compartments and areas other than the flight crew 
compartment unless the crewmember compartment or area is ventilated by 
air interchange with other compartments or areas under all operating 
conditions.
    (f) Means to enable the flight crew to control the temperature and 
quantity of ventilating air supplied to the flight crew compartment 
independently of the temperature and quantity of ventilating air 
supplied to other compartments are not required if all of the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) The total volume of the flight crew and passenger compartments 
is 800 cubic feet or less.
    (2) The air inlets and passages for air to flow between flight crew

                             Pressurization


<R05>
Sec. 25.841  Pressurized cabins.

    (a) Pressurized cabins and compartments to be occupied must be 
equipped to provide a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 8,000 
feet at the maximum operating altitude of the airplane under normal 
operating conditions.

[[Page 410]]

    (1) If certification for operation above 25,000 feet is requested, 
the airplane must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to 
cabin pressure altitudes in excess of 15,000 feet after any probable 
failure condition in the pressurization system.
    (2) The airplane must be designed so that occupants will not be 
exposed to a cabin pressure altitude that exceeds the following after 
decompression from any failure condition not shown to be extremely 
improbable:
    (i) Twenty-five thousand (25,000) feet for more than 2 minutes; or
    (ii) Forty thousand (40,000) feet for any duration.
    (3) Fuselage structure, engine and system failures are to be 
considered in evaluating the cabin decompression.
    (b) Pressurized cabins must have at least the following valves, 
controls, and indicators for controlling cabin pressure:
    (1) Two pressure relief valves to automatically limit the positive 
pressure differential to a predetermined value at the maximum rate of 
flow delivered by the pressure source. The combined capacity of the 
relief valves must be large enough so that the failure of any one valve 
would not cause an appreciable rise in the pressure differential. The 
pressure differential is positive when the internal pressure is greater 
than the external.
    (2) Two reverse pressure differential relief valves (or their 
equivalents) to automatically prevent a negative pressure differential 
that would damage the structure. One valve is enough, however, if it is 
of a design that reasonably precludes its malfunctioning.
    (3) A means by which the pressure differential can be rapidly 
equalized.
    (4) An automatic or manual regulator for controlling the intake or 
exhaust airflow, or both, for maintaining the required internal 
pressures and airflow rates.
    (5) Instruments at the pilot or flight engineer station to show the 
pressure differential, the cabin pressure altitude, and the rate of 
change of the cabin pressure altitude.
    (6) Warning indication at the pilot or flight engineer station to 
indicate when the safe or preset pressure differential and cabin 
pressure altitude limits are exceeded. Appropriate warning markings on 
the cabin pressure differential indicator meet the warning requirement 
for pressure differential limits and an aural or visual signal (in 
addition to cabin altitude indicating means) meets the warning 
requirement for cabin pressure altitude limits if it warns the flight 
crew when the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 10,000 feet.
    (7) A warning placard at the pilot or flight engineer station if the 
structure is not designed for pressure differentials up to the maximum 
relief valve setting in combination with landing loads.
    (8) The pressure sensors necessary to meet the requirements of 
paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section and Sec. 25.1447(c), must 
be located and the sensing system designed so that, in the event of loss 
of cabin pressure in any passenger or crew compartment (including upper 
and lower lobe galleys), the warning and automatic presentation devices, 
required by those provisions, will be actuated without any delay that 
would significantly increase the hazards resulting from decompression.

<R05>
Sec. 25.843  Tests for pressurized cabins.

    (a) Strength test. The complete pressurized cabin, including doors, 
windows, and valves, must be tested as a pressure vessel for the 
pressure differential specified in Sec. 25.365(d).
    (b) Functional tests. The following functional tests must be 
performed:
    (1) Tests of the functioning and capacity of the positive and 
negative pressure differential valves, and of the emergency release 
valve, to stimulate the effects of closed regulator valves.
    (2) Tests of the pressurization system to show proper functioning 
under each possible condition of pressure, temperature, and moisture, up 
to the maximum altitude for which certification is requested.
    (3) Flight tests, to show the performance of the pressure supply, 
pressure and flow regulators, indicators, and warning signals, in steady 
and stepped climbs and descents at rates corresponding to the maximum 
attainable

[[Page 411]]

within the operating limitations of the airplane, up to the maximum 
altitude for which certification is requested.
    (4) Tests of each door and emergency exit, to show that they operate 
properly after being subjected to the flight tests prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

combustion chamber. However, no fire extinguishment is required in cabin 
ventilating air passages.
    (b) Ventilating air ducts. Each ventilating air duct passing through 
any fire zone must be fireproof. In addition--
    (1) Unless isolation is provided by fireproof valves or by equally 
effective means, the ventilating air duct downstream of each heater must 
be fireproof for a distance great enough to ensure that any fire 
originating in the heater can be contained in the duct; and
    (2) Each part of any ventilating duct passing through any region 
having a flammable fluid system must be constructed or isolated from 
that system so that the malfunctioning of any component of that system 
cannot introduce flammable fluids or vapors into the ventilating 
airstream.
    (c) Combustion air ducts. Each combustion air duct must be fireproof 
for a distance great enough to prevent damage from backfiring or reverse 
flame propagation. In addition--
    (1) No combustion air duct may have a common opening with the 
ventilating airstream unless flames from backfires or reverse burning 
cannot enter the ventilating airstream under any operating condition, 
including reverse flow or malfunctioning of the heater or its associated 
components; and
    (2) No combustion air duct may restrict the prompt relief of any 
backfire that, if so restricted, could cause heater failure.
    (d) Heater controls; general. Provision must be made to prevent the 
hazardous accumulation of water or ice on or in any heater control 
component, control system tubing, or safety control.
    (e) Heater safety controls. For each combustion heater there must be 
the following safety control means:
    (1) Means independent of the components provided for the normal 
continuous control of air temperature, airflow, and fuel flow must be 
provided, for each heater, to automatically shut off the ignition and 
fuel supply to that heater at a point remote from that heater when any 
of the following occurs:
    (i) The heat exchanger temperature exceeds safe limits.
    (ii) The ventilating air temperature exceeds safe limits.
    (iii) The combustion airflow becomes inadequate for safe operation.
    (iv) The ventilating airflow becomes inadequate for safe operation.
    (2) The means of complying with paragraph (e)(1) of this section for 
any individual heater must--
    (i) Be independent of components serving any other heater whose heat

[[Page 415]]

output is essential for safe operation; and
    (ii) Keep the heater off until restarted by the crew.
    (3) There must be means to warn the crew when any heater whose heat 
output is essential for safe operation has been shut off by the 
automatic means prescribed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Air intakes. Each combustion and ventilating air intake must be 
located so that no flammable fluids or vapors can enter the heater 
system under any operating condition--

    (a) For turbojet reversing systems--
    (1) Each system intended for ground operation only must be designed 
so that during any reversal in flight the engine will produce no more 
than flight idle thrust. In addition, it must be shown by analysis or 
test, or both, that--
    (i) Each operable reverser can be restored to the forward thrust 
position; and
    (ii) The airplane is capable of continued safe flight and landing

[[Page 419]]

of failures) of the reversing system, under any anticipated condition of 
operation of the airplane including ground operation. Failure of 
structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this 
kind of failure is extremely remote.
    (3) Each system must have means to prevent the engine from producing 
more than idle thrust when the reversing system malfunctions, except 
that it may produce any greater forward thrust that is shown to allow 
directional control to be maintained, with aerodynamic means alone, 
under the most critical reversing condition expected in operation.
    (b) For propeller reversing systems--
    (1) Each system intended for ground operation only must be designed 
so that no single failure (or reasonably likely combination of failures) 
or malfunction of the system will result in unwanted reverse thrust 
under any expected operating condition. Failure of structural elements 
need not be considered if this kind of failure is extremely remote.
    (2) Compliance with this section may be shown by failure analysis or 
testing, or both, for propeller systems that allow propeller blades to 
move from the flight low-pitch position to a position that is 
substantially less than that at the normal flight low-pitch position. 
The analysis may include or be supported by the analysis made to show 
compliance with the requirements of Sec. 35.21 of this chapter for the 
propeller and associated installation components.

consideration of probable malfunctions) upon the aerodynamic control of 
the airplane may not result in any condition that would require 
exceptional skill, alertness, or strength on the part of the pilot to 
avoid exceeding an operational or structural limitation of the airplane;

Sec. 25.961  Fuel system hot weather operation.

    (a) The fuel system must perform satisfactorily in hot weather 
operation. This must be shown by showing that the fuel system from the 
tank outlets to each engine is pressurized, under all intended 
operations, so as to prevent vapor formation, or must be shown by 
climbing from the altitude of the airport elected by the applicant to 
the maximum altitude established as an operating limitation under 
Sec. 25.1527. If a

[[Page 422]]

climb test is elected, there may be no evidence of vapor lock or other 
malfunctioning during the climb test conducted under the following 
conditions:
    (1) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, the engines must 
operate at maximum continuous power, except that takeoff power must be 
used for the altitudes from 1,000 feet below the critical altitude 
through the critical altitude. The time interval during which takeoff 
power is used may not be less than the takeoff time limitation.
    (2) For turbine engine powered airplanes, the engines must operate 
at takeoff power for the time interval selected for showing the takeoff 
flight path, and at maximum continuous power for the rest of the climb.
    (3) The weight of the airplane must be the weight with full fuel 
tanks, minimum crew, and the ballast necessary to maintain the center of 
gravity within allowable limits.
    (4) The climb airspeed may not exceed--
    (i) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, the maximum airspeed 
established for climbing from takeoff to the maximum operating altitude 
with the airplane in the following configuration:
    (A) Landing gear retracted.
    (B) Wing flaps in the most favorable position.
    (C) Cowl flaps (or other means of controlling the engine cooling 
supply) in the position that provides adequate cooling in the hot-day 
condition.
    (D) Engine operating within the maximum continuous power 
limitations.
    (E) Maximum takeoff weight; and
    (ii) For turbine engine powered airplanes, the maximum airspeed 
established for climbing from takeoff to the maximum operating altitude.
    (5) The fuel temperature must be at least 110 deg. F.
    (b) The test prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section may be 
performed in flight or on the ground under closely simulated flight 
conditions. If a flight test is performed in weather cold enough to 
interfere with the proper conduct of the test, the fuel tank surfaces, 
fuel lines, and other fuel system parts subject to cold air must be 
insulated to simulate, insofar as practicable, flight in hot weather.

    (a) A fuel jettisoning system must be installed on each airplane 
unless it is shown that the airplane meets the climb requirements of 
Secs. 25.119 and 25.121(d) at maximum takeoff weight, less the actual or

takeoff, go-around, and landing at the airport of departure with the 
airplane configuration, speed, power, and thrust the same as that used 
in meeting the applicable takeoff, approach, and landing climb 
performance requirements of this part.
    (b) If a fuel jettisoning system is required it must be capable of 
jettisoning enough fuel within 15 minutes, starting with the weight 
given in paragraph (a) of this section, to enable the airplane to meet 
the climb requirements of Secs. 25.119 and 25.121(d), assuming that the 
fuel is jettisoned under the conditions, except weight, found least 
favorable during the flight tests prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Fuel jettisoning must be demonstrated beginning at maximum 
takeoff weight with flaps and landing gear up and in--
    (1) A power-off glide at 1.4 Vs<INF>1</INF>;
    (2) A climb at the one-engine inoperative best rate-of-climb speed, 
with the critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines at 
maximum continuous power; and
    (3) Level flight at 1.4 Vs<INF>1</INF>; if the results of the tests 
in the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section 
show that this condition could be critical.
    (d) During the flight tests prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section, it must be shown that--
    (1) The fuel jettisoning system and its operation are free from fire 
hazard;
    (2) The fuel discharges clear of any part of the airplane;
    (3) Fuel or fumes do not enter any parts of the airplane; and
    (4) The jettisoning operation does not adversely affect the 
controllability of the airplane.
    (e) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, means must be 
provided to prevent jettisoning the fuel in the tanks used for takeoff 
and landing below the level allowing 45 minutes flight at 75 percent 
maximum continuous power. However, if there is an auxiliary control 
independent of the main jettisoning control, the system may be designed 
to jettison the remaining fuel by means of the auxiliary jettisoning 
control.
    (f) For turbine engine powered airplanes, means must be provided to 
prevent jettisoning the fuel in the tanks used for takeoff and landing 
below the level allowing climb from sea level to 10,000 feet and 
thereafter allowing 45 minutes cruise at a speed for maximum range. 
However, if there is an auxiliary control independent of the main 
jettisoning control, the system may be designed to jettison the 
remaining fuel by means of the auxiliary jettisoning control.
    (g) The fuel jettisoning valve must be designed to allow flight 
personnel to close the valve during any part of the jettisoning 
operation.
    (h) Unless it is shown that using any means (including flaps, slots, 
and slats) for changing the airflow across or around the wings does not 
adversely affect fuel jettisoning, there must be a placard, adjacent to 
the jettisoning control, to warn flight crewmembers against jettisoning 
fuel while the means that change the airflow are being used.
    (i) The fuel jettisoning system must be designed so that any 
reasonably probable single malfunction in the system will not result in 
a hazardous condition due to unsymmetrical jettisoning of, or inability 
to jettison, fuel.

itself, or into the tank outlet, of any object that might obstruct the 
flow of oil through the system. No oil tank outlet may be enclosed by 
any screen or guard that would reduce the flow of oil below a safe value 
at any operating temperature. There must be a shutoff valve at the 
outlet of each oil tank used with a turbine engine, unless the external 
portion of the oil system (including the oil tank supports) is 
fireproof.

Sec. 25.1043  Cooling tests.

    (a) General. Compliance with Sec. 25.1041 must be shown by tests, 
under critical ground, water, and flight operating conditions. For these 
tests, the following apply:
    (1) If the tests are conducted under conditions deviating from the 
maximum ambient atmospheric temperature, the recorded powerplant 
temperatures must be corrected under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section.
    (2) No corrected temperatures determined under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section may exceed established limits.
    (3) For reciprocating engines, the fuel used during the cooling 
tests must be the minimum grade approved for the engines, and the 
mixture settings must be those normally used in the flight stages for 
which the cooling tests are conducted. The test procedures must be as 
prescribed in Sec. 25.1045.
    (b) Maximum ambient atmospheric temperature. A maximum ambient 
atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of at 
least 100 degrees F must be established. The assumed temperature lapse 
rate is 3.6 degrees F per thousand feet of altitude above sea level 
until a temperature of -69.7 degrees F is reached, above which altitude 
the temperature is considered constant at -69.7 degrees F. However, for 
winterization installations, the applicant may select a maximum ambient 
atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of less 
than 100 degrees F.
    (c) Correction factor (except cylinder barrels). Unless a more 
rational correction applies, temperatures of engine fluids and 
powerplant components (except cylinder barrels) for which temperature 
limits are established, must be corrected by adding to them the 
difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the 
temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of 
the maximum component or fluid temperature recorded during the cooling 
test.
    (d) Correction factor for cylinder barrel temperatures. Unless a 
more rational correction applies, cylinder barrel temperatures must be 
corrected by adding to them 0.7 times the difference between the maximum 
ambient atmospheric temperature and the temperature of the ambient air 
at the time of the first occurrence of the maximum cylinder barrel 
temperature recorded during the cooling test.

Sec. 25.1045  Cooling test procedures.

    (a) Compliance with Sec. 25.1041 must be shown for the takeoff, 
climb, en route, and landing stages of flight that correspond to the 
applicable performance requirements. The cooling tests must be conducted 
with the airplane in the configuration, and operating under the 
conditions, that are critical relative to cooling during each stage of 
flight. For the cooling tests, a temperature is ``stabilized'' when its 
rate of change is less than two degrees F. per minute.
    (b) Temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which 
entry is made into each stage of flight being investigated, unless the 
entry condition normally is not one during which component and the 
engine fluid temperatures would stabilize (in which case, operation 
through the full entry condition must be conducted before entry into the 
stage of flight being investigated in order to allow temperatures to 
reach their natural levels at the time of entry). The takeoff cooling 
test must be preceded by a period during which the powerplant component

[[Page 431]]

and engine fluid temperatures are stabilized with the engines at ground 
idle.
    (c) Cooling tests for each stage of flight must be continued until--
    (1) The component and engine fluid temperatures stabilize;
    (2) The stage of flight is completed; or
    (3) An operating limitation is reached.
    (d) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, it may be assumed, 
for cooling test purposes, that the takeoff stage of flight is complete 
when the airplane reaches an altitude of 1,500 feet above the takeoff 
surface or reaches a point in the takeoff where the transition from the 
takeoff to the en route configuration is completed and a speed is 
reached at which compliance with Sec. 25.121(c) is shown, whichever 
point is at a higher altitude. The airplane must be in the following 
configuration:
    (1) Landing gear retracted.
    (2) Wing flaps in the most favorable position.
    (3) Cowl flaps (or other means of controlling the engine cooling 
supply) in the position that provides adequate cooling in the hot-day 
condition.
    (4) Critical engine inoperative and its propeller stopped.
    (5) Remaining engines at the maximum continuous power available for 
the altitude.
    (e) For hull seaplanes and amphibians, cooling must be shown during 
taxiing downwind for 10 minutes, at five knots above step speed.

prevents the entry of rain, ice, or any other foreign matter.
    (c) Air intakes may not open within the cowling, unless--
    (1) That part of the cowling is isolated from the engine accessory 
section by means of a fireproof diaphragm; or
    (2) For reciprocating engines, there are means to prevent the 
emergence of backfire flames.
    (d) For turbine engine powered airplanes and airplanes incorporating 
auxiliary power units--
    (1) There must be means to prevent hazardous quantities of fuel 
leakage or overflow from drains, vents, or other components of flammable 
fluid systems from entering the engine or auxiliary power unit intake 
system; and
    (2) The airplane must be designed to prevent water or slush on the 
runway, taxiway, or other airport operating surfaces from being directed 
into the engine or auxiliary power unit air inlet ducts in hazardous 
quantities, and the air inlet ducts must be located or protected so as 
to minimize the ingestion of foreign matter during takeoff, landing, and 
taxiing.
    (e) If the engine induction system contains parts or components that 
could be damaged by foreign objects entering the air inlet, it must be 
shown by tests or, if appropriate, by analysis that the induction system 
design can withstand the foreign object ingestion test conditions of 
Sec. 33.77 of this chapter without failure of parts or components that 
could create a hazard.

provide a heat rise of 120\ F. with the engine at 60 percent of maximum 
continuous power; or

[[Page 432]]

    (2) Carburetors tending to reduce the probability of ice formation 
has a preheater that can provide a heat rise of 100 deg. F. with the 
engine at 60 percent of maximum continuous power.

the flight power range of the engine (including idling), without the 
accumulation of ice on the engine, inlet system components, or airframe 
components that would adversely affect engine operation or cause a 
serious loss of power or thrust--
    (i) Under the icing conditions specified in appendix C, and
    (ii) In falling and blowing snow within the limitations established 
for the airplane for such operation.
    (2) Each turbine engine must idle for 30 minutes on the ground, with 
the air bleed available for engine icing protection at its critical 
condition, without adverse effect, in an atmosphere that is at a 
temperature between 15 deg. and 30 deg. F (between -9 deg. and -1 deg. 
C) and has a liquid water content not less than 0.3 grams per cubic 
meter in the form of drops having a mean effective diameter not less 
than 20 microns, followed by momentary operation at takeoff power or 
thrust. During the 30 minutes of idle operation, the engine may be run 
up periodically to a moderate power or thrust setting in a manner 
acceptable to the Administrator.
    (c) Supercharged reciprocating engines. For each engine having a 
supercharger to pressurize the air before it enters the carburetor, the 
heat rise in the air caused by that supercharging at any altitude may be 
utilized in determining compliance with paragraph (a) of this section if 
the heat rise utilized is that which will be available, automatically, 
for the applicable altitude and operating condition because of 
supercharging.

    (a) The equipment, systems, and installations whose functioning is 
required by this subchapter, must be designed to ensure that they 
perform their intended functions under any foreseeable operating 
condition.
    (b) The airplane systems and associated components, considered 
separately and in relation to other systems, must be designed so that--
    (1) The occurrence of any failure condition which would prevent the 
continued safe flight and landing of the airplane is extremely 
improbable, and

reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of the crew to cope 
with adverse operating conditions is improbable.
    (c) Warning information must be provided to alert the crew to unsafe 
system operating conditions, and to enable them to take appropriate 
corrective action. Systems, controls, and associated monitoring and 
warning means must be designed to minimize crew errors which could 
create additional hazards.
    (d) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section must be shown by analysis, and where necessary, by appropriate 
ground, flight, or simulator tests. The analysis must consider--
    (1) Possible modes of failure, including malfunctions and damage

    (3) The resulting effects on the airplane and occupants, considering 
the stage of flight and operating conditions, and
    (4) The crew warning cues, corrective action required, and the 
capability of detecting faults.
    (e) Each installation whose functioning is required by this 
subchapter, and that requires a power supply, is an ``essential load'' 
on the power supply. The power sources and the system must be able to 
supply the following power loads in probable operating combinations and 
for probable durations:
    (1) Loads connected to the system with the system functioning 
normally.
    (2) Essential loads, after failure of any one prime mover, power 
converter, or energy storage device.

    (i) Any one engine on two-engine airplanes; and
    (ii) Any two engines on three-or-more-engine airplanes.
    (4) Essential loads for which an alternate source of power is 
required by this chapter, after any failure or malfunction in any one 
power supply system, distribution system, or other utilization system.
    (f) In determining compliance with paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this 
section, the power loads may be assumed to be reduced under a monitoring 
procedure consistent with safety in the kinds of operation authorized. 
Loads not required in controlled flight need not be considered for the 
two-engine-inoperative condition on airplanes with three or more 
engines.
    (g) In showing compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section with regard to the electrical system and equipment design and 
installation, critical environmental conditions must be considered. For

Sec. 25.1323  Airspeed indicating system.

    For each airspeed indicating system, the following apply:
    (a) Each airspeed indicating instrument must be approved and must be 
calibrated to indicate true airspeed (at sea level with a standard 
atmosphere) with a minimum practicable instrument calibration error when 
the corresponding pitot and static pressures are applied.
    (b) Each system must be calibrated to determine the system error 
(that is, the relation between IAS and CAS) in flight and during the 
accelerated takeoff ground run. The ground run calibration must be 
determined--
    (1) From 0.8 of the minimum value of V<INF>1</INF> to the maximum 
value of V<INF>2</INF>, considering the approved ranges of altitude and 
weight; and
    (2) With the flaps and power settings corresponding to the values 
determined in the establishment of the takeoff path under Sec. 25.111 
assuming that the critical engine fails at the minimum value of 
V<INF>1</INF>.
    (c) The airspeed error of the installation, excluding the airspeed 
indicator instrument calibration error, may not exceed three percent or 
five knots, whichever is greater, throughout the speed range, from--
    (1) V<INF>MO</INF> to 1.3 V<INF>S1</INF>, with flaps retracted; and
    (2) 1.3 V<INF>S0</INF> to V<INF>FE</INF> with flaps in the landing 
position.
    (d) Each system must be arranged, so far as practicable, to prevent 
malfunction or serious error due to the entry of moisture, dirt, or 
other substances.
    (e) Each system must have a heated pitot tube or an equivalent means 
of preventing malfunction due to icing.
    (f) Where duplicate airspeed indicators are required, their 
respective pitot tubes must be far enough apart to avoid damage to both 
tubes in a collision with a bird.

<R05>
Sec. 25.1325  Static pressure systems.

    (a) Each instrument with static air case connections must be vented 
to the outside atmosphere through an appropriate piping system.
    (b) Each static port must be designed and located in such manner 
that the static pressure system performance is least affected by airflow 
variation, or by moisture or other foreign matter, and that the 
correlation between air pressure in the static pressure system and true 
ambient atmospheric static pressure is not changed when the airplane is 
exposed to the continuous and intermittent maximum icing conditions 
defined in Appendix C of this part.
    (c) The design and installation of the static pressure system must 
be such that--
    (1) Positive drainage of moisture is provided; chafing of the tubing 
and excessive distortion or restriction at bends in the tubing is 
avoided; and the materials used are durable, suitable for the purpose 
intended, and protected against corrosion; and
    (2) It is airtight except for the port into the atmosphere. A proof 
test must be conducted to demonstrate the integrity of the static 
pressure system in the following manner:
    (i) Unpressurized airplanes. Evacuate the static pressure system to 
a pressure differential of approximately 1 inch of mercury or to a 
reading on the altimeter, 1,000 feet above the airplane elevation at the 
time of the test. Without additional pumping for a period of 1 minute, 
the loss of indicated altitude must not exceed 100 feet on the 
altimeter.

[[Page 446]]

    (ii) Pressurized airplanes. Evacuate the static pressure system 
until a pressure differential equivalent to the maximum cabin pressure 
differential for which the airplane is type certificated is achieved. 
Without additional pumping for a period of 1 minute, the loss of 
indicated altitude must not exceed 2 percent of the equivalent altitude 
of the maximum cabin differential pressure or 100 feet, whichever is 
greater.
    (d) Each pressure altimeter must be approved and must be calibrated 
to indicate pressure altitude in a standard atmosphere, with a minimum 
practicable calibration error when the corresponding static pressures 
are applied.
    (e) Each system must be designed and installed so that the error in 
indicated pressure altitude, at sea level, with a standard atmosphere, 
excluding instrument calibration error, does not result in an error of 
more than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>30 feet per 100 knots speed for the 
appropriate configuration in the speed range between 1.3 V<INF>S0</INF> 
with flaps extended and 1.8 V<INF>S1</INF> with flaps retracted. 
However, the error need not be less than <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>30 feet.
    (f) If an altimeter system is fitted with a device that provides 
corrections to the altimeter indication, the device must be designed and 
installed in such manner that it can be bypassed when it malfunctions, 
unless an alternate altimeter system is provided. Each correction device 
must be fitted with a means for indicating the occurrence of reasonably 
probable malfunctions, including power failure, to the flight crew. The 
indicating means must be effective for any cockpit lighting condition 
likely to occur.
    (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, if the 
static pressure system incorporates both a primary and an alternate 
static pressure source, the means for selecting one or the other source 
must be designed so that--
    (1) When either source is selected, the other is blocked off; and
    (2) Both sources cannot be blocked off simultaneously.
    (h) For unpressurized airplanes, paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
does not apply if it can be demonstrated that the static pressure system 
calibration, when either static pressure source is selected, is not 
changed by the other static pressure source being open or blocked.

Sec. 25.1329  Automatic pilot system.

    (a) Each automatic pilot system must be approved and must be 
designed so that the automatic pilot can be quickly and positively 
disengaged by the pilots to prevent it from interfering with their 
control of the airplane.
    (b) Unless there is automatic synchronization, each system must have 
a means to readily indicate to the pilot the alignment of the actuating 
device in relation to the control system it operates.
    (c) Each manually operated control for the system must be readily 
accessible to the pilots.
    (d) Quick release (emergency) controls must be on both control

specified in Secs. 25.777(b) and 25.779(a) for cockpit controls. The 
direction of motion must be plainly indicated on, or adjacent to, each 
control.
    (f) The system must be designed and adjusted so that, within the 
range of adjustment available to the human pilot, it cannot produce 
hazardous loads on the airplane, or create hazardous deviations in the 
flight path, under any condition of flight appropriate to its use, 
either during normal operation or in the event of a malfunction, 
assuming that corrective action begins within a reasonable period of 
time.
    (g) If the automatic pilot integrates signals from auxiliary 
controls or furnishes signals for operation of other equipment, there 
must be positive interlocks and sequencing of engagement to prevent 
improper operation. Protection against adverse interaction of integrated 
components, resulting from a malfunction, is also required.
    (h) If the automatic pilot system can be coupled to airborne 
navigation equipment, means must be provided to indicate to the flight 
crew the current mode of operation. Selector switch position is not 
acceptable as a means of indication.

    (1) Each instrument must have a visual means integral with, the 
instrument, to indicate when power adequate to sustain proper instrument 
performance is not being supplied. The power must be measured at or near 
the point where it enters the instruments. For electric instruments, the 
power is considered to be adequate when the voltage is within approved 
limits.
    (2) Each instrument must, in the event of the failure of one power 
source, be supplied by another power source. This may be accomplished 
automatically or by manual means.
    (3) If an instrument presenting navigation data receives information 
from sources external to that instrument and loss of that information 
would render the presented data unreliable, the instrument must 
incorporate a visual means to warn the crew, when such loss of 
information occurs, that the presented data should not be relied upon.
    (b) As used in this section, ``instrument'' includes devices that 
are physically contained in one unit, and devices that are composed of 
two or more physically separate units or components connected together

    (b) Fuel quantity indicator. There must be means to indicate to the 
flight crewmembers, the quantity, in gallons or equivalent units, of 
usable fuel in each tank during flight. In addition--
    (1) Each fuel quantity indicator must be calibrated to read ``zero'' 
during level flight when the quantity of fuel remaining in the tank is 
equal to the unusable fuel supply determined under Sec. 25.959;
    (2) Tanks with interconnected outlets and airspaces may be treated 
as one tank and need not have separate indicators; and
    (3) Each exposed sight gauge, used as a fuel quantity indicator, 
must be protected against damage.
    (c) Fuel flowmeter system. If a fuel flowmeter system is installed, 
each metering component must have a means for bypassing the fuel supply 
if malfunction of that component severely restricts fuel flow.
    (d) Oil quantity indicator. There must be a stick gauge or 
equivalent means to indicate the quantity of oil in each tank. If an oil 
transfer or reserve oil supply system is installed, there must be a 
means to indicate to the flight crew, in flight, the quantity of oil in 
each tank.
    (e) Turbopropeller blade position indicator. Required turbopropeller 
blade position indicators must begin indicating before the blade moves 
more than eight degrees below the flight low pitch stop. The source of 
indication must directly sense the blade position.
    (f) Fuel pressure indicator. There must be means to measure fuel 
pressure, in each system supplying reciprocating engines, at a point 
downstream of any fuel pump except fuel injection pumps. In addition--
    (1) If necessary for the maintenance of proper fuel delivery 
pressure, there must be a connection to transmit the carburetor air 
intake static pressure to the proper pump relief valve connection; and
    (2) If a connection is required under paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section, the gauge balance lines must be independently connected to the 
carburetor inlet pressure to avoid erroneous readings.

Sec. 25.1351  General.

    (a) Electrical system capacity. The required generating capacity, 
and number and kinds of power sources must--
    (1) Be determined by an electrical load analysis; and
    (2) Meet the requirements of Sec. 25.1309.
    (b) Generating system. The generating system includes electrical 
power sources, main power busses, transmission cables, and associated 
control, regulation, and protective devices. It must be designed so 
that--
    (1) Power sources function properly when independent and when 
connected in combination;
    (2) No failure or malfunction of any power source can create a 
hazard or impair the ability of remaining sources to supply essential 
loads;
    (3) The system voltage and frequency (as applicable) at the 
terminals of all essential load equipment can be maintained within the 
limits for which the equipment is designed, during any probable 
operating condition; and

[[Page 449]]

    (4) System transients due to switching, fault clearing, or other 
causes do not make essential loads inoperative, and do not cause a smoke 
or fire hazard.
    (5) There are means accessible, in flight, to appropriate 
crewmembers for the individual and collective disconnection of the 
electrical power sources from the system.
    (6) There are means to indicate to appropriate crewmembers the 
generating system quantities essential for the safe operation of the 
system, such as the voltage and current supplied by each generator.
    (c) External power. If provisions are made for connecting external 
power to the airplane, and that external power can be electrically 
connected to equipment other than that used for engine starting, means 
must be provided to ensure that no external power supply having a 
reverse polarity, or a reverse phase sequence, can supply power to the 
airplane's electrical system.
    (d) Operation without normal electrical power. It must be shown by 
analysis, tests, or both, that the airplane can be operated safely in 
VFR conditions, for a period of not less than five minutes, with the 
normal electrical power (electrical power sources excluding the battery) 
inoperative, with critical type fuel (from the standpoint of flameout 
and restart capability), and with the airplane initially at the maximum 
certificated altitude. Parts of the electrical system may remain on if--
    (1) A single malfunction, including a wire bundle or junction box 
fire, cannot result in loss of both the part turned off and the part 
turned on; and
    (2) The parts turned on are electrically and mechanically isolated 
from the parts turned off.

be designed to de-energize and disconnect faulty power sources and power 
transmission equipment from their associated busses with sufficient 
rapidity to provide protection from hazardous over-voltage and other 
malfunctioning.
    (c) Each resettable circuit protective device must be designed so 
that, when an overload or circuit fault exists, it will open the circuit 
irrespective of the position of the operating control.
    (d) If the ability to reset a circuit breaker or replace a fuse is 
essential to safety in flight, that circuit breaker or fuse must be 
located and identified so that it can be readily reset or replaced in 
flight.

protection. However, individual protection for each circuit in an 
essential load system (such as each position light circuit in a system) 
is not required.
    (f) If fuses are used, there must be spare fuses for use in flight 
equal to at least 50 percent of the number of fuses of each rating 
required for complete circuit protection.

Sec. 25.1389  Position light distribution and intensities.

    (a) General. The intensities prescribed in this section must be 
provided by new equipment with light covers and color filters in place. 
Intensities must be determined with the light source operating at a

angles L, R, and A, and must meet the following requirements:
    (1) Intensities in the horizontal plane. Each intensity in the 
horizontal plane (the plane containing the longitudinal axis of the 
airplane and perpendicular to the plane of symmetry of the airplane) 
must equal or exceed the values in Sec. 25.1391.
    (2) Intensities in any vertical plane.  Each intensity in any 
vertical plane (the plane perpendicular to the horizontal plane) must 
equal or exceed the appropriate value in Sec. 25.1393, where I is the 
minimum intensity prescribed in Sec. 25.1391 for the corresponding

in any overlap between adjacent signals may exceed the values given in 
Sec. 25.1395, except that higher intensities in overlaps may be used 
with main beam intensities substantially greater than the minima 
specified in Secs. 25.1391 and 25.1393 if the overlap intensities in 
relation to the main beam intensities do not adversely affect signal 
clarity. When the peak intensity of the forward position lights is more 
than 100 candles, the maximum overlap intensities between them may 
exceed the values given in Sec. 25.1395 if the overlap intensity in Area 
A is not more than 10 percent of peak position light intensity and the 
overlap intensity in Area B is not greater than 2.5 percent of peak 
position light intensity.

that their light will not impair the crew's vision or detract from the 
conspicuity of the position lights; and
    (2) Meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section.
    (b) Field of coverage. The system must consist of enough lights to 
illuminate the vital areas around the airplane considering the physical 
configuration and flight characteristics of the airplane. The field of 
coverage must extend in each direction within at least 75 degrees above 
and 75 degrees below the horizontal plane of the airplane, except that a 
solid angle or angles of obstructed visibility totaling not more than 
0.03 steradians is allowable within a solid angle equal to 0.15

is, the number of light sources, beam width, speed of rotation, and 
other characteristics, must give an effective flash frequency of not 
less than 40, nor more than 100 cycles per minute. The effective flash 
frequency is the frequency at which the airplane's complete 
anticollision light system is observed from a distance, and applies to 
each sector of light including any overlaps that exist when the system 
consists of more than one light source. In overlaps, flash frequencies 
may exceed 100, but not 180 cycles per minute.

where:
Ie=effective intensity (candles).
I(t)=instantaneous intensity as a function of time.
t<INF>2</INF>--t<INF>1</INF>=flash time interval (seconds).

Normally, the maximum value of effective intensity is obtained when 
t<INF>2!</INF>and t<INF>1!</INF>are chosen so that the effective 
intensity is equal to the instantaneous intensity at t<INF>2!</INF>and 
t<INF>1</INF>.

anticollision light effective intensity must equal or exceed the 
applicable values in the following table.

Sec. 25.1435  Hydraulic systems.

    (a) Design. (1) Each element of the hydraulic system must be 
designed to withstand, without deformation that would prevent it from 
performing its intended function, the design operating pressure loads in 
combination with limit structural loads which may be imposed.
    (2) Each element of the hydraulic system must be able to withstand, 
without rupture, the design operating pressure loads multiplied by a 
factor of 1.5 in combination with ultimate structural loads that can 
reasonably occur simultaneously. Design operating pressure is maximum 
normal operating pressure, excluding transient pressure.
    (b) Tests and analysis. (1) A complete hydraulic system must be 
static tested to show that it can withstand 1.5 times the design 
operating pressure without a deformation of any part of the system that 
would prevent it from performing its intended function. Clearance 
between structural members and hydraulic system elements must be 
adequate and there must be no permanent detrimental deformation. For the 
purpose of this test, the pressure relief valve may be made inoperable 
to permit application of the required pressure.
    (2) Compliance with Sec. 25.1309 for hydraulic systems must be shown 
by functional tests, endurance tests, and analyses. The entire system, 
or appropriate subsystems, must be tested in an airplane or in a mock-up 
installation to determine proper performance and proper relation to 
other aircraft systems. The functional tests must include simulation of 
hydraulic system failure conditions. Endurance tests must simulate the 
repeated complete flights that could be expected to occur in service. 
Elements which fail during the tests must be modified in order to have 
the design deficiency corrected and, where necessary, must be 
sufficiently retested. Simulation of operating and environmental 
conditions must be completed on elements and appropriate portions of the 
hydraulic system to the extent necessary to evaluate the environmental 
effects. Compliance with Sec. 25.1309 must take into account the 
following:
    (i) Static and dynamic loads including flight, ground, pilot, 
hydrostatic, inertial and thermally induced loads, and combinations 
thereof.
    (ii) Motion, vibration, pressure transients, and fatigue.
    (iii) Abrasion, corrosion, and erosion.
    (iv) Fluid and material compatibility.

must be established so that it is not greater than the design cruising 
speed V<INF>C!</INF>and so that it is sufficiently below V<INF>D</INF>/
M<INF>D</INF> or V<INF>DF</INF>/M<INF>DF</INF>, to make it highly 
improbable that the latter speeds will be inadvertently exceeded in 
operations. The speed margin between V<INF>MO</INF>/M<INF>MO</INF> and 
V<INF>D</INF>/M<INF>D</INF> or V<INF>DF</INF>M/<INF>DF</INF> may not be 
less than that determined under Sec. 25.335(b) or found necessary during

    (a) Continuous maximum icing. The maximum continuous intensity of 
atmospheric icing conditions (continuous maximum icing) is defined by 
the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective 
diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the 
interrelationship of these three variables as shown in figure 1 of this 
appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and 
temperature is given in figure 2 of this appendix. The inter-
relationship of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and 
altitude is determined from figures 1 and 2. The cloud liquid water 
content for continuous maximum icing conditions of a horizontal extent, 
other than 17.4 nautical miles, is determined by the value of liquid 
water content of figure 1, multiplied by the appropriate factor from 
figure 3 of this appendix.
    (b) Intermittent maximum icing. The intermittent maximum intensity 
of atmospheric icing conditions (intermittent maximum icing) is defined 
by the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective 
diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the 
interrelationship of these three variables as shown in figure 4 of this 
appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and 
temperature is given in figure 5 of this appendix. The inter-
relationship of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and 
altitude is determined from figures 4 and 5. The cloud liquid water 
content for intermittent maximum icing conditions of a horizontal 
extent, other than 2.6 nautical miles, is determined by the value of 
cloud liquid water content of figure 4 multiplied by the appropriate 
factor in figure 6 of this appendix.

                          Appendix D to Part 25

    Criteria for determining minimum flight crew. The following are 
considered by the Agency in determining the minimum flight crew under 
Sec. 25.1523:
    (a) Basic workload functions. The following basic workload functions 
are considered:
    (1) Flight path control.
    (2) Collision avoidance.
    (3) Navigation.
    (4) Communications.
    (5) Operation and monitoring of aircraft engines and systems.
    (6) Command decisions.
    (b) Workload factors. The following workload factors are considered 
significant when analyzing and demonstrating workload for minimum flight 
crew determination:
    (1) The accessibility, ease, and simplicity of operation of all 
necessary flight, power, and equipment controls, including emergency 
fuel shutoff valves, electrical controls, electronic controls, 
pressurization system controls, and engine controls.
    (2) The accessibility and conspicuity of all necessary instruments 
and failure warning devices such as fire warning, electrical system 
malfunction, and other failure or caution indicators. The extent to 
which such instruments or devices direct the proper corrective action is 
also considered.
    (3) The number, urgency, and complexity of operating procedures with 
particular consideration given to the specific fuel management schedule 
imposed by center of gravity, structural or other considerations of an 
airworthiness nature, and to the ability of each engine to operate at 
all times from a single tank or source which is automatically 
replenished if fuel is also stored in other tanks.
    (4) The degree and duration of concentrated mental and physical 
effort involved in normal operation and in diagnosing and coping with 
malfunctions and emergencies.
    (5) The extent of required monitoring of the fuel, hydraulic, 
pressurization, electrical, electronic, deicing, and other systems while 
en route.
    (6) The actions requiring a crewmember to be unavailable at his 
assigned duty station, including: observation of systems, emergency 
operation of any control, and emergencies in any compartment.
    (7) The degree of automation provided in the aircraft systems to 
afford (after failures or malfunctions) automatic crossover or isolation 
of difficulties to minimize the need for flight crew action to guard 
against loss of hydraulic or electric power to flight controls or to 
other essential systems.
    (8) The communications and navigation workload.
    (9) The possibility of increased workload associated with any 
emergency that may lead to other emergencies.
    (10) Incapacitation of a flight crewmember whenever the applicable 
operating rule requires a minimum flight crew of at least two pilots.
    (c) Kind of operation authorized. The determination of the kind of 
operation authorized requires consideration of the operating rules under 
which the airplane will be operated. Unless an applicant desires 
approval for a more limited kind of operation. It is assumed that each 
airplane certificated under this Part will operate under IFR conditions.

                          Appendix E to Part 25

   I--Limited Weight Credit For Airplanes Equipped With Standby Power 

    (a) Each applicant for an increase in the maximum certificated 
takeoff and landing weights of an airplane equipped with a type-
certificated standby power rocket engine may obtain an increase as 
specified in paragraph (b) if--
    (1) The installation of the rocket engine has been approved and it 
has been established by flight test that the rocket engine and its 
controls can be operated safely and reliably at the increase in maximum 
weight; and
    (2) The Airplane Flight Manual, or the placard, markings or manuals 
required in place thereof, set forth in addition to any other operating 
limitations the Administrator may require, the increased weight approved 
under this regulation and a prohibition against the operation of the 
airplane at the approved increased weight when--
    (i) The installed standby power rocket engines have been stored or 
installed in excess of the time limit established by the manufacturer of 
the rocket engine (usually stenciled on the engine casing); or
    (ii) The rocket engine fuel has been expended or discharged.
    (b) The currently approved maximum takeoff and landing weights at 
which an airplane is certificated without a standby power rocket engine 
installation may be increased by an amount that does not exceed any of 
the following:
    (1) An amount equal in pounds to 0.014 IN, where I is the maximum 
usable impulse in pounds-seconds available from each standby power 
rocket engine and N is the number of rocket engines installed.
    (2) An amount equal to 5 percent of the maximum certificated weight 
approved in accordance with the applicable airworthiness regulations 
without standby power rocket engines installed.
    (3) An amount equal to the weight of the rocket engine installation.
    (4) An amount that, together with the currently approved maximum 
weight, would

[[Page 484]]

equal the maximum structural weight established for the airplane without 
standby rocket engines installed.

 II--Performance Credit for Transport Category Airplanes Equipped With 
                             Standby Power 

    The Administrator may grant performance credit for the use of 
standby power on transport category airplanes. However, the performance 
credit applies only to the maximum certificated takeoff and landing 
weights, the takeoff distance, and the takeoff paths, and may not exceed 
that found by the Administrator to result in an overall level of safety 
in the takeoff, approach, and landing regimes of flight equivalent to 
that prescribed in the regulations under which the airplane was 
originally certificated without standby power. For the purposes of this 
Appendix, ``standby power'' is power or thrust, or both, obtained from 
rocket engines for a relatively short period and actuated only in cases 
of emergency. The following provisions apply:
    (1) Takeoff; general. The takeoff data prescribed in paragraphs (2) 
and (3) of this Appendix must be determined at all weights and 
altitudes, and at ambient temperatures if applicable, at which 
performance credit is to be applied.
    (2) Takeoff path. 
    (a) The one-engine-inoperative takeoff path with standby power in 
use must be determined in accordance with the performance requirements 
of the applicable airworthiness regulations.
    (b) The one-engine-inoperative takeoff path (excluding that part 
where the airplane is on or just above the takeoff surface) determined 
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section must lie above the one-
engine-inoperative takeoff path without standby power at the maximum 
takeoff weight at which all of the applicable air-worthiness 
requirements are met. For the purpose of this comparison, the flight 
path is considered to extend to at least a height of 400 feet above the 
takeoff surface.
    (c) The takeoff path with all engines operating, but without the use 
of standby power, must reflect a conservatively greater overall level of 
performance than the one-engine-inoperative takeoff path established in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The margin must be 
established by the Administrator to insure safe day-to-day operations, 
but in no case may it be less than 15 percent. The all-engines-operating 
takeoff path must be determined by a procedure consistent with that 
established in complying with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) For reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes, the takeoff path to 
be scheduled in the Airplane Flight Manual must represent the one-
engine-operative takeoff path determined in accordance with paragraph 
(a) of this section and modified to reflect the procedure (see paragraph 
(6)) established by the applicant for flap retraction and attainment of 
the en route speed. The scheduled takeoff path must have a positive 
slope at all points of the airborne portion and at no point must it lie 
above the takeoff path specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) Takeoff distance. The takeoff distance must be the horizontal 
distance along the one-engine-inoperative take off path determined in 
accordance with paragraph (2)(a) from the start of the takeoff to the 
point where the airplane attains a height of 50 feet above the takeoff 
surface for reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes and a height of 35 
feet above the takeoff surface for turbine-powered airplanes.
    (4) Maximum certificated takeoff weights. The maximum certificated 
takeoff weights must be determined at all altitudes, and at ambient 
temperatures, if applicable, at which performance credit is to be 
applied and may not exceed the weights established in compliance with 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) The conditions of paragraphs (2)(b) through (d) must be met at 
the maximum certificated takeoff weight.
    (b) Without the use of standby power, the airplane must meet all of 
the en route requirements of the applicable airworthiness regulations 
under which the airplane was originally certificated. In addition, 
turbine-powered airplanes without the use of standby power must meet the 
final takeoff climb requirements prescribed in the applicable 
airworthiness regulations.
    (5) Maximum certificated landing weights.
    (a) The maximum certificated landing weights (one-engine-inoperative 
approach and all-engine-operating landing climb) must be determined at 
all altitudes, and at ambient temperatures if applicable, at which 
performance credit is to be applied and must not exceed that established 
in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The flight path, with the engines operating at the power or 
thrust, or both, appropriate to the airplane configuration and with 
standby power in use, must lie above the flight path without standby 
power in use at the maximum weight at which all of the applicable 
airworthiness requirements are met. In addition, the flight paths must 
comply with subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.
    (i) The flight paths must be established without changing the 
appropriate airplane configuration.
    (ii) The flight paths must be carried out for a minimum height of 
400 feet above the point where standby power is actuated.
    (6) Airplane configuration, speed, and power and thrust; general. 
Any change in the airplane's configuration, speed, and power or thrust, 
or both, must be made in accordance with the procedures established by 
the applicant for the operation of the airplane in

[[Page 485]]

service and must comply with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. 
In addition, procedures must be established for the execution of balked 
landings and missed approaches.
    (a) The Administrator must find that the procedure can be 
consistently executed in service by crews of average skill.
    (b) The procedure may not involve methods or the use of devices 
which have not been proven to be safe and reliable.
    (c) Allowances must be made for such time delays in the execution of 
the procedures as may be reasonably expected to occur during service.
    (7) Installation and operation; standby power. The standby power 
unit and its installation must comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section.
    (a) The standby power unit and its installation must not adversely 
affect the safety of the airplane.
    (b) The operation of the standby power unit and its control must 
have proven to be safe and reliable.

humidity until moisture equilibrium is reached or for 24 hours. Each 
specimen must remain in the conditioning environment until it is 
subjected to the flame.
    (2) Specimen configuration. Except for small parts and electrical 
wire and cable insulation, materials must be tested either as section 
cut from a fabricated part as installed in the airplane or as a specimen 
simulating a cut section, such as a specimen cut from a flat sheet of 
the material or a model of the fabricated part. The specimen may be cut 
from any location in a fabricated part; however, fabricated units, such 
as sandwich panels, may not be separated for test. Except as noted 
below, the specimen thickness must be no thicker than the minimum 
thickness to be qualified for use in the airplane. Test specimens of 
thick foam parts, such as seat cushions, must be \1/2\-inch in 
thickness. Test specimens of materials that must meet the requirements 
of paragraph (a)(1)(v) of part I of this appendix must be no more than 
\1/8\-inch in thickness. Electrical wire and cable specimens must be the 
same size as used in the airplane. In the case of fabrics, both the warp

critical flammability condition. Specimens must be mounted in a metal 
frame so that the two long edges and the upper edge are held securely 
during the vertical test prescribed in subparagraph (4) of this 
paragraph and the two long edges and the edge away from the flame are 
held securely during the horizontal test prescribed in subparagraph (5) 
of this paragraph. The exposed area of the specimen must be at least 2 
inches wide and 12 inches long, unless the actual size used in the 
airplane is smaller. The edge to which the burner flame is applied must 
not consist of the finished or protected edge of the specimen but must 
be representative of the actual cross-section of the material or part as 
installed in the airplane. The specimen must be mounted in a metal frame 
so that all four edges are held securely and the exposed area of the 
specimen is at least 8 inches by 8 inches during the 45 deg. test 
prescribed in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph.
    (3) Apparatus. Except as provided in subparagraph (7) of this 
paragraph, tests must be conducted in a draft-free cabinet in accordance 
with Federal Test Method Standard 191 Model 5903 (revised Method 5902) 
for the vertical test, or Method 5906 for horizontal test (available 
from the General Services Administration, Business Service Center, 
Region 3, Seventh & D Streets SW., Washington, DC 20407). Specimens 
which are too large for the cabinet must be tested in similar draft-free 
conditions.
    (4) Vertical test. A minimum of three specimens must be tested and 
results averaged. For fabrics, the direction of weave corresponding to 
the most critical flammability conditions must be parallel to the 
longest dimension. Each specimen must be supported vertically. The 
specimen must be exposed to a Bunsen or Tirrill burner with a nominal 
\3/8\-inch I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame of 1\1/2\ inches in 
height. The minimum flame temperature measured by a calibrated 
thermocouple pyrometer in the center of the flame must be 1550  deg.F. 
The lower edge of the specimen must be \3/4\-inch above the top edge of 
the burner. The flame must be applied to the center line of the lower 
edge of the specimen. For materials covered by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
part I of this appendix, the flame must be applied for 60 seconds and 
then removed. For materials covered by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of part I of 
this appendix, the flame must be applied for 12 seconds and then 
removed. Flame time, burn length, and flaming time of drippings, if any, 
may be recorded. The burn length determined in accordance with 
subparagraph (7) of this paragraph must be measured to the nearest tenth 
of an inch.
    (5) Horizontal test. A minimum of three specimens must be tested and 
the results averaged. Each specimen must be supported horizontally. The 
exposed surface, when installed in the aircraft, must be face down for 
the test. The specimen must be exposed to a Bunsen or Tirrill burner 
with a nominal \3/8\-inch I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame of 1\1/2\ 
inches in height. The minimum flame temperature measured by a calibrated 
thermocouple pyrometer in the center of the flame

[[Page 487]]

must be 1550  deg.F. The specimen must be positioned so that the edge 
being tested is centered \3/4\-inch above the top of the burner. The 
flame must be applied for 15 seconds and then removed. A minimum of 10 
inches of specimen must be used for timing purposes, approximately 1\1/
2\ inches must burn before the burning front reaches the timing zone, 
and the average burn rate must be recorded.
    (6) Forty-five degree test. A minimum of three specimens must be 
tested and the results averaged. The specimens must be supported at an 
angle of 45 deg. to a horizontal surface. The exposed surface when 
installed in the aircraft must be face down for the test. The specimens 
must be exposed to a Bunsen or Tirrill burner with a nominal \3/8\-inch 
I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame of 1\1/2\ inches in height. The 
minimum flame temperature measured by a calibrated thermocouple 
pyrometer in the center of the flame must be 1550  deg.F. Suitable 
precautions must be taken to avoid drafts. The flame must be applied for 
30 seconds with one-third contacting the material at the center of the 
specimen and then removed. Flame time, glow time, and whether the flame 
penetrates (passes through) the specimen must be recorded.
    (7) Sixty degree test. A minimum of three specimens of each wire 
specification (make and size) must be tested. The specimen of wire or 
cable (including insulation) must be placed at an angle of 60 deg. with 
the horizontal in the cabinet specified in subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph with the cabinet door open during the test, or must be placed 
within a chamber approximately 2 feet high by 1 foot by 1 foot, open at 
the top and at one vertical side (front), and which allows sufficient 
flow of air for complete combustion, but which is free from drafts. The 
specimen must be parallel to and approximately 6 inches from the front 
of the chamber. The lower end of the specimen must be held rigidly 
clamped. The upper end of the specimen must pass over a pulley or rod 
and must have an appropriate weight attached to it so that the specimen 
is held tautly throughout the flammability test. The test specimen span 
between lower clamp and upper pulley or rod must be 24 inches and must 
be marked 8 inches from the lower end to indicate the central point for 
flame application. A flame from a Bunsen or Tirrill burner must be 
applied for 30 seconds at the test mark. The burner must be mounted 
underneath the test mark on the specimen, perpendicular to the specimen 
and at an angle of 30 deg. to the vertical plane of the specimen. The 
burner must have a nominal bore of \3/8\-inch and be adjusted to provide 
a 3-inch high flame with an inner cone approximately one-third of the 
flame height. The minimum temperature of the hottest portion of the 
flame, as measured with a calibrated thermocouple pyrometer, may not be 
less than 1750  deg.F. The burner must be positioned so that the hottest 
portion of the flame is applied to the test mark on the wire. Flame 
time, burn length, and flaming time of drippings, if any, must be 
recorded. The burn length determined in accordance with paragraph (8) of 
this paragraph must be measured to the nearest tenth of an inch. 
Breaking of the wire specimens is not considered a failure.
    (8) Burn length. Burn length is the distance from the original edge 
to the farthest evidence of damage to the test specimen due to flame 
impingement, including areas of partial or complete consumption, 
charring, or embrittlement, but not including areas sooted, stained, 
warped, or discolored, nor areas where material has shrunk or melted 
away from the heat source.

                 Part II--Flammability of Seat Cushions

    (a) Criteria for Acceptance. Each seat cushion must meet the 
following criteria:
    (1) At least three sets of seat bottom and seat back cushion 
specimens must be tested.
    (2) If the cushion is constructed with a fire blocking material, the 
fire blocking material must completely enclose the cushion foam core 
material.
    (3) Each specimen tested must be fabricated using the principal 
components (i.e., foam core, flotation material, fire blocking material, 
if used, and dress covering) and assembly processes (representative 
seams and closures) intended for use in the production articles. If a 
different material combination is used for the back cushion than for the 
bottom cushion, both material combinations must be tested as complete 
specimen sets, each set consisting of a back cushion specimen and a 
bottom cushion specimen. If a cushion, including outer dress covering, 
is demonstrated to meet the requirements of this appendix using the oil 
burner test, the dress covering of that cushion may be replaced with a 
similar dress covering provided the burn length of the replacement 
covering, as determined by the test specified in Sec. 25.853(b), does 
not exceed the corresponding burn length of the dress covering used on 
the cushion subjected to the oil burner test.
    (4) For at least two-thirds of the total number of specimen sets 
tested, the burn length from the burner must not reach the side of the 
cushion opposite the burner. The burn length must not exceed 17 inches. 
Burn length is the perpendicular distance from the inside edge of the 
seat frame closest to the burner to the farthest evidence of damage to 
the test specimen due to flame impingement, including areas of partial 
or complete consumption, charring, or embrittlement, but not including 
areas sooted, stained, warped, or discolored, or areas where material 
has shrunk or melted away from the heat source.
    (5) The average percentage weight loss must not exceed 10 percent. 
Also, at least two-thirds of the total number of specimen sets tested 
must not exceed 10 percent

[[Page 488]]

weight loss. All droppings falling from the cushions and mounting stand 
are to be discarded before the after-test weight is determined. The 
percentage weight loss for a specimen set is the weight of the specimen 
set before testing less the weight of the specimen set after testing 
expressed as the percentage of the weight before testing.
    (b) Test Conditions. Vertical air velocity should average 25 
fpm<plus-minus>10 fpm at the top of the back seat cushion. Horizontal 
air velocity should be below 10 fpm just above the bottom seat cushion. 
Air velocities should be measured with the ventilation hood operating 
and the burner motor off.
    (c) Test Specimens. (1) For each test, one set of cushion specimens 
representing a seat bottom and seat back cushion must be used.
    (2) The seat bottom cushion specimen must be 18<plus-minus>\1/8\ 
inches (457<plus-minus>3 mm) wide by 20<plus-minus>\1/8\ inches 
(508<plus-minus>3 mm) deep by 4<plus-minus>\1/8\ inches 
(102<plus-minus>3 mm) thick, exclusive of fabric closures and seam 
overlap.
    (3) The seat back cushion specimen must be 18<plus-minus>\1/8\ 
inches (432<plus-minus>3 mm) wide by 25<plus-minus>\1/8\ inches 
(635<plus-minus>3 mm) high by 2<plus-minus>\1/8\ inches (51<plus-minus>3 
mm) thick, exclusive of fabric closures and seam overlap.
    (4) The specimens must be conditioned at 70<plus-minus>5  deg.F 
(21<plus-minus>2  deg.C) 55%<plus-minus>10% relative humidity for at 
least 24 hours before testing.
    (d) Test Apparatus. The arrangement of the test apparatus is shown 
in Figures 1 through 5 and must include the components described in this 
section. Minor details of the apparatus may vary, depending on the model 
burner used.
    (1) Specimen Mounting Stand. The mounting stand for the test 
specimens consists of steel angles, as shown in Figure 1. The length of 
the mounting stand legs is 12<plus-minus>\1/8\ inches (305<plus-minus>3 
mm). The mounting stand must be used for mounting the test specimen seat 
bottom and seat back, as shown in Figure 2. The mounting stand should 
also include a suitable drip pan lined with aluminum foil, dull side up.
    (2) Test Burner. The burner to be used in testing must--
    (i) Be a modified gun type;
    (ii) Have an 80-degree spray angle nozzle nominally rated for 2.25 
gallons/hour at 100 psi;
    (iii) Have a 12-inch (305 mm) burner cone installed at the end of 
the draft tube, with an opening 6 inches (152 mm) high and 11 inches 
(280 mm) wide, as shown in Figure 3; and
    (iv) Have a burner fuel pressure regulator that is adjusted to 
deliver a nominal 2.0 gallon/hour of  2 Grade kerosene or equivalent 
required for the test.

Burner models which have been used successfully in testing are the 
Lennox Model OB-32, Carlin Model 200 CRD, and Park Model DPL 3400. FAA 
published reports pertinent to this type of burner are: (1) Powerplant 
Enginering Report No. 3A, Standard Fire Test Apparatus and Procedure for 
Flexible Hose Assemblies, dated March 1978; and (2) Report No. DOT/FAA/
RD/76/213, Reevaluation of Burner Characteristics for Fire Resistance 
Tests, dated January 1977.
    (3) Calorimeter. 
    (i) The calorimeter to be used in testing must be a (0-15.0 BTU/
ft<SUP>2</SUP>-sec. 0-17.0 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP>) calorimeter, accurate 
<plus-minus>3%, mounted in a 6-inch by 12-inch (152 by 305 mm) by \3/4\-
inch (19 mm) thick calcium silicate insulating board which is attached 
to a steel angle bracket for placement in the test stand during burner 
calibration, as shown in Figure 4.
    (ii) Because crumbling of the insulating board with service can 
result in misalignment of the calorimeter, the calorimeter must be 
monitored and the mounting shimmed, as necessary, to ensure that the 
calorimeter face is flush with the exposed plane of the insulating board 
in a plane parallel to the exit of the test burner cone.
    (4) Thermocouples. The seven thermocouples to be used for testing 
must be \1/16\- to \1/8\-inch metal sheathed, ceramic packed, type K, 
grounded thermocouples with a nominal 22 to 30 American wire gage (AWG)-
size conductor. The seven thermocouples must be attached to a steel 
angle bracket to form a thermocouple rake for placement in the test 
stand during burner calibration, as shown in Figure 5.
    (5) Apparatus Arrangement. The test burner must be mounted on a 
suitable stand to position the exit of the burner cone a distance of 
4<plus-minus>\1/8\ inches (102<plus-minus>3 mm) from one side of the 
specimen mounting stand. The burner stand should have the capability of 
allowing the burner to be swung away from the specimen mounting stand 
during warmup periods.
    (6) Data Recording. A recording potentiometer or other suitable 
calibrated instrument with an appropriate range must be used to measure 
and record the outputs of the calorimeter and the thermocouples.
    (7) Weight Scale. Weighing Device--A device must be used that with 
proper procedures may determine the before and after test weights of 
each set of seat cushion specimens within 0.02 pound (9 grams). A 
continuous weighing system is preferred.
    (8) Timing Device. A stopwatch or other device (calibrated to 
<plus-minus>1 second) must be used to

[[Page 489]]

measure the time of application of the burner flame and self-
extinguishing time or test duration.
    (e) Preparation of Apparatus. Before calibration, all equipment must 
be turned on and the burner fuel must be adjusted as specified in 
paragraph (d)(2).
    (f) Calibration. To ensure the proper thermal output of the burner, 
the following test must be made:
    (1) Place the calorimeter on the test stand as shown in Figure 4 at 
a distance of 4<plus-minus>\1/8\ inches (102<plus-minus>3 mm) from the 
exit of the burner cone.
    (2) Turn on the burner, allow it to run for 2 minutes for warmup, 
and adjust the burner air intake damper to produce a reading of 
10.5<plus-minus>0.5 BTU/ft<SUP>2</SUP>-sec. (11.9<plus-minus>0.6 w/
cm<SUP>2</SUP>) on the calorimeter to ensure steady state conditions 
have been achieved. Turn off the burner.
    (3) Replace the calorimeter with the thermocouple rake (Figure 5).
    (4) Turn on the burner and ensure that the thermocouples are reading 
1900<plus-minus>100  deg.F (1038<plus-minus>38  deg.C) to ensure steady 
state conditions have been achieved.
    (5) If the calorimeter and thermocouples do not read within range, 
repeat steps in paragraphs 1 through 4 and adjust the burner air intake 
damper until the proper readings are obtained. The thermocouple rake and 
the calorimeter should be used frequently to maintain and record 
calibrated test parameters. Until the specific apparatus has 
demonstrated consistency, each test should be calibrated. After 
consistency has been confirmed, several tests may be conducted with the 
pre-test calibration before and a calibration check after the series.
    (g) Test Procedure. The flammability of each set of specimens must 
be tested as follows:
    (1) Record the weight of each set of seat bottom and seat back 
cushion specimens to be tested to the nearest 0.02 pound (9 grams).
    (2) Mount the seat bottom and seat back cushion test specimens on 
the test stand as shown in Figure 2, securing the seat back cushion 
specimen to the test stand at the top.
    (3) Swing the burner into position and ensure that the distance from 
the exit of the burner cone to the side of the seat bottom cushion 
specimen is 4<plus-minus>\1/8\ inches (102<plus-minus>3 mm).
    (4) Swing the burner away from the test position. Turn on the burner 
and allow it to run for 2 minutes to provide adequate warmup of the 
burner cone and flame stabilization.
    (5) To begin the test, swing the burner into the test position and 
simultaneously start the timing device.
    (6) Expose the seat bottom cushion specimen to the burner flame for 
2 minutes and then turn off the burner. Immediately swing the burner 
away from the test position. Terminate test 7 minutes after initiating 
cushion exposure to the flame by use of a gaseous extinguishing agent 
(i.e., Halon or CO<INF>2</INF>).
    (7) Determine the weight of the remains of the seat cushion specimen 
set left on the mounting stand to the nearest 0.02 pound (9 grams) 
excluding all droppings.
    (h) Test Report. With respect to all specimen sets tested for a 
particular seat cushion for which testing of compliance is performed, 
the following information must be recorded:
    (1) An identification and description of the specimens being tested.
    (2) The number of specimen sets tested.
    (3) The initial weight and residual weight of each set, the 
calculated percentage weight loss of each set, and the calculated 
average percentage weight loss for the total number of sets tested.
    (4) The burn length for each set tested.

Part III--Test Method to Determine Flame Penetration Resistance of Cargo 
                           Compartment Liners.

    (a) Criteria for Acceptance. (1) At least three specimens of cargo 
compartment sidewall or ceiling liner panels must be tested.
    (2) Each specimen tested must simulate the cargo compartment 
sidewall or ceiling liner panel, including any design features, such as 
joints, lamp assemblies, etc., the failure of which would affect the 
capability of the liner to safely contain a fire.
    (3) There must be no flame penetration of any specimen within 5 
minutes after application of the flame source, and the peak temperature 
measured at 4 inches above the upper surface of the horizontal test 
sample must not exceed 400  deg.F.
    (b) Summary of Method. This method provides a laboratory test 
procedure for measuring the capability of cargo compartment lining 
materials to resist flame penetration with a 2 gallon per hour (GPH) 2 
Grade kerosene or equivalent burner fire source. Ceiling and sidewall 
liner panels may be tested individually provided a baffle is used to 
simulate the missing panel. Any specimen that passes the test as a 
ceiling liner panel may be used as a sidewall liner panel.
    (c) Test Specimens. (1) The specimen to be tested must measure 
16<plus-minus>\1/8\ inches (406<plus-minus>3 mm) by 24+\1/8\ inches 
(610<plus-minus>3 mm).
    (2) The specimens must be conditioned at 70  deg.F.<plus-minus>5 
deg.F. (21 deg.C.<plus-minus>2  deg.C.) and 55%<plus-minus>5% humidity 
for at least 24 hours before testing.
    (d) Test Apparatus. The arrangement of the test apparatus, which is 
shown in Figure 3 of Part II and Figures 1 through 3 of this part of 
Appendix F, must include the components described in this section. Minor 
details of the apparatus may vary, depending on the model of the burner 
used.
    (1) Specimen Mounting Stand. The mounting stand for the test 
specimens consists of steel angles as shown in Figure 1.
    (2) Test Burner. The burner to be used in tesing must--
    (i) Be a modified gun type.
    (ii) Use a suitable nozzle and maintain fuel pressure to yield a 2 
GPH fuel flow. For example: an 80 degree nozzle nominally rated at 2.25 
GPH and operated at 85 pounds per square inch (PSI) gage to deliver 2.03 
GPH.
    (iii) Have a 12 inch (305 mm) burner extension installed at the end 
of the draft tube with an opening 6 inches (152 mm) high and 11 inches 
(280 mm) wide as shown in Figure 3 of Part II of this appendix.
    (iv) Have a burner fuel pressure regulator that is adjusted to 
deliver a nominal 2.0 GPH of 2 Grade kerosene or equivalent.

Burner models which have been used successfully in testing are the Lenox 
Model OB-32, Carlin Model 200 CRD and Park Model DPL. The basic burner 
is described in FAA Powerplant Engineering Report No. 3A, Standard Fire 
Test Apparatus and Procedure for Flexible Hose Assemblies, dated March 
1978; however, the test settings specified in this appendix differ in 
some instances from those specified in the report.
    (3) Calorimeter. (i) The calorimeter to be used in testing must be a 
total heat flux Foil Type Gardon Gage of an appropriate range 
(approximately 0 to 15.0 British thermal unit (BTU) per ft.<SUP>2</SUP> 
sec., 0-17.0 watts/cm<SUP>2</SUP>). The calorimeter must be mounted in a 
6 inch by 12 inch (152 by 305 mm) by \3/4\ inch (19 mm) thick insulating 
block which is attached to a steel angle bracket for placement in the 
test stand during burner calibration as shown in Figure 2 of this part 
of this appendix.
    (ii) The insulating block must be monitored for deterioration and 
the mounting shimmed as necessary to ensure that the calorimeter face is 
parallel to the exit plane of the test burner cone.
    (4) Thermocouples. The seven thermocouples to be used for testing 
must be \1/16\ inch ceramic sheathed, type K, grounded thermocouples 
with a nominal 30 American wire gage (AWG) size conductor. The seven 
thermocouples must be attached to a steel angle bracket to form a 
thermocouple rake for placement in the test stand during burner 
calibration as shown in Figure 3 of this part of this appendix.
    (5) Apparatus Arrangement. The test burner must be mounted on a 
suitable stand to position the exit of the burner cone a distance of 8 
inches from the ceiling liner panel and 2 inches from the sidewall liner 
panel. The burner stand should have the capability of allowing the 
burner to be swung away from the test specimen during warm-up periods.
    (6) Instrumentation. A recording potentiometer or other suitable 
instrument with an appropriate range must be used to measure and record 
the outputs of the calorimeter and the thermocouples.
    (7) Timing Device. A stopwatch or other device must be used to 
measure the time of flame application and the time of flame penetration, 
if it occurs.
    (e) Preparation of Apparatus. Before calibration, all equipment must 
be turned on and allowed to stabilize, and the burner fuel flow must be 
adjusted as specified in paragraph (d)(2).

[[Page 496]]

    (f) Calibration. To ensure the proper thermal output of the burner 
the following test must be made:
    (1) Remove the burner extension from the end of the draft tube. Turn 
on the blower portion of the burner without turning the fuel or igniters 
on. Measure the air velocity using a hot wire anemometer in the center 
of the draft tube across the face of the opening. Adjust the damper such 
that the air velocity is in the range of 1550 to 1800 ft./min. If tabs 
are being used at the exit of the draft tube, they must be removed prior 
to this measurement. Reinstall the draft tube extension cone.
    (2) Place the calorimeter on the test stand as shown in Figure 2 at 
a distance of 8 inches (203 mm) from the exit of the burner cone to 
simulate the position of the horizontal test specimen.
    (3) Turn on the burner, allow it to run for 2 minutes for warm-up, 
and adjust the damper to produce a calorimeter reading of 
8.0<plus-minus>0.5 BTU per ft.<SUP>2</SUP> sec. (9.1<plus-minus>0.6 
Watts/cm<SUP>2</SUP>).
    (4) Replace the calorimeter with the thermocouple rake (see Figure 
3).
    (5) Turn on the burner and ensure that each of the seven 
thermocouples reads 1700  deg.F. <plus-minus>100  deg.F. (927  deg.C. 
<plus-minus>38  deg.C.) to ensure steady state conditions have been 
achieved. If the temperature is out of this range, repeat steps 2 
through 5 until proper readings are obtained.
    (6) Turn off the burner and remove the thermocouple rake.
    (7) Repeat (1) to ensure that the burner is in the correct range.
    (g) Test Procedure. (1) Mount a thermocouple of the same type as 
that used for calibration at a distance of 4 inches (102 mm) above the 
horizontal (ceiling) test specimen. The thermocouple should be centered 
over the burner cone.
    (2) Mount the test specimen on the test stand shown in Figure 1 in 
either the horizontal or vertical position. Mount the insulating 
material in the other position.
    (3) Position the burner so that flames will not impinge on the 
specimen, turn the burner on, and allow it to run for 2 minutes. Rotate 
the burner to apply the flame to the specimen and simultaneously start 
the timing device.
    (4) Expose the test specimen to the flame for 5 minutes and then 
turn off the burner. The test may be terminated earlier if flame 
penetration is observed.
    (5) When testing ceiling liner panels, record the peak temperature 
measured 4 inches above the sample.
    (6) Record the time at which flame penetration occurs if applicable.
    (h) Test Report. The test report must include the following:
    (1) A complete description of the materials tested including type, 
manufacturer, thickness, and other appropriate data.
    (2) Observations of the behavior of the test specimens during flame 
exposure such as delamination, resin ignition, smoke, ect., including 
the time of such occurrence.
    (3) The time at which flame penetration occurs, if applicable, for 
each of the three specimens tested.
    (4) Panel orientation (ceiling or sidewall).

   Part IV--Test Method to Determine the Heat Release Rate From Cabin 
                   Materials Exposed to Radiant Heat.

    (a) Summary of Method. Three or more specimens representing the 
completed aircraft component are tested. Each test specimen is injected 
into an environmental chamber through which a constant flow of air 
passes. The specimen's exposure is determined by a radiant heat source 
adjusted to produce, on the specimen, the desired total heat flux of 3.5 
W/cm<SUP>2</SUP>. The specimen is tested with the exposed surface 
vertical. Combustion is initiated by piloted ignition. The combustion 
products leaving the chamber are monitored in order to calculate the 
release rate of heat.
    (b) Apparatus. The Ohio State University (OSU) rate of heat release 
apparatus, as described below, is used. This is a modified version of 
the rate of heat release apparatus standardized by the American Society 
of Testing and Materials (ASTM), ASTM E-906.
    (1) This apparatus is shown in Figures 1A and 1B of this part IV. 
All exterior surfaces of the apparatus, except the holding chamber, must 
be insulated with 1 inch (25 mm) thick, low density, high temperature, 
fiberglass board insulation. A gasketed door, through which the sample 
injection rod slides, must be used to form an airtight closure on the 
specimen hold chamber.
    (2) Thermopile. The temperature difference between the air entering 
the environmental chamber and that leaving must be monitored by a 
thermopile having five hot, and five cold, 24-guage Chromel-Alumel 
junctions. The hot junctions must be spaced across the top of the 
exhaust stack, .38 inches (10 mm) below the top of the chimney. The 
thermocouples must have a .050 <plus-minus> .010 inch (1.3 <plus-minus> 
.3mm) diameter, ball-type, welded tip. One thermocouple must be located 
in the geometric center, with the other four located 1.18 inch (30 mm) 
from the center along the diagonal toward each of the corners (Figure 5 
of this part IV). The cold junctions must be located in the pan below 
the lower air distribution plate (see paragraph (b)(4) of this part IV). 
Thermopile hot junctions must be cleared of soot deposits as needed to 
maintain the calibrated sensitivity.
    (3) Radiation Source. A radiant heat source incorporating four Type 
LL silicon carbide elements, 20 inches (508 mm) long by .63 inch (16 mm) 
O.D., must be used, as shown in Figures 2A and 2B of this part IV. The 
heat source must have a nominal resistance of 1.4 ohms and be capable of 
generating a flux up to 100 kW/m\2\. The silicone carbide elements must 
be mounted in the stainless steel panel box by inserting them through 
.63 inch (16 mm) holes in .03 inch (1 mm) thick ceramic fiber or 
calcium-silicate millboard. Locations of the holes in the pads and 
stainless steel cover plates are shown in Figure 2B of this part IV. The 
truncated diamond-shaped mask of .042 <plus-minus> .002 inch (1.07 
<plus-minus> .05mm) stainless steel must be added to provide uniform 
heat flux density over the area occupied by the vertical sample.
    (4) Air Distribution System. The air entering the environmental 
chamber must be distributed by a .25 inch (6.3 mm) thick aluminum plate 
having eight No. 4 drill-holes, located 2 inches (51 mm) from sides on 4 
inch (102 mm) centers, mounted at the base of the environmental chamber. 
A second plate of 18 guage stainless steel having 120, evenly spaced, 
No. 28 drill holes must be mounted 6 inches (152 mm) above the aluminum 
plate. A well-regulated air supply is required. The air-supply manifold 
at the base of the pyramidal section must have 48, evenly spaced, No. 26 
drill holes located .38 inch (10 mm) from the inner edge of the 
manifold, resulting in an airflow split of approximately three to one 
within the apparatus.
    (5) Exhaust Stack. An exhaust stack, 5.25  x 2.75 inches (133  x 70 
mm) in cross section, and 10 inches (254 mm) long, fabricated from 28 
guage stainless steel must be mounted on the outlet of the pyramidal 
section. A. 1.0  x 3.0 inch (25  x 76 mm) baffle plate of .018 
<plus-minus> .002 inch (.50 <plus-minus> .05 mm) stainless steel must be 
centered inside the stack, perpendicular to the air flow, 3 inches (76 
mm) above the base of the stack.
    (6) Specimen Holders. (i) The specimen must be tested in a vertical 
orientation. The specimen holder (Figure 3 of this part IV) must 
incorporate a frame that touches the specimen (which is wrapped with 
aluminum foil as required by paragraph (d)(3) of this Part) along only 
the .25 inch (6 mm) perimeter. A ``V'' shaped spring is used to hold the 
assembly together. A detachable .50  x .50  x 5.91 inch (12  x 12  x 150 
mm) drip pan and two .020 inch (.5 mm) stainless steel wires (as shown 
in Figure 3 of this part IV) must be used for testing materials prone to 
melting and dripping. The positioning of the spring and frame may be 
changed to accommodate different specimen thicknesses by inserting the 
retaining rod in different holes on the specimen holder.
    (ii) Since the radiation shield described in ASTM E-906 is not used, 
a guide pin must be added to the injection mechanism. This fits into a 
slotted metal plate on the injection mechanism outside of the holding 
chamber. It can be used to provide accurate positioning of the specimen 
face after injection. The front surface of the specimen must be 3.9 
inches (100 mm) from the closed radiation doors after injection.
    (iii) The specimen holder clips onto the mounted bracket (Figure 3 
of this part IV). The mounting bracket must be attached to the injection 
rod by three screws that pass through a wide-area washer welded onto a 
\1/2\-inch (13 mm) nut. The end of the injection rod must be threaded to 
screw into the nut, and a .020 inch (5.1 mm) thick wide area

[[Page 501]]

washer must be held between two \1/2\-inch (13 mm) nuts that are 
adjusted to tightly cover the hole in the radiation doors through which 
the injection rod or calibration calorimeter pass.
    (7) Calorimeter. A total-flux type calorimeter must be mounted in 
the center of a \1/2\-inch Kaowool ``M'' board inserted in the sample 
holder to measure the total heat flux. The calorimeter must have a view 
angle of 180 degrees and be calibrated for incident flux. The 
calorimeter calibration must be acceptable to the Administrator.
    (8) Pilot-Flame Positions. Pilot ignition of the specimen must be 
accomplished by simultaneously exposing the specimen to a lower pilot 
burner and an upper pilot burner, as described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) 
and (b)(8)(ii) or (b)(8)(iii) of this part IV, respectively. Since 
intermittent pilot flame extinguishment for more than 3 seconds would 
invalidate the test results, a spark ignitor may be installed to ensure 
that the lower pilot burner remains lighted.
    (i) Lower Pilot Burner. The pilot-flame tubing must be .25 inch (6.3 
mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8mm) wall, stainless steel tubing. A mixture of 
120 cm<SUP>3</SUP>/min. of methane and 850 cm<SUP>3</SUP>/min. of air 
must be fed to the lower pilot flame burner. The normal position of the 
end of the pilot burner tubing is .40 inch (10 mm) from and 
perpendicular to the exposed vertical surface of the specimen. The 
centerline at the outlet of the burner tubing must intersect the 
vertical centerline of the sample at a point .20 inch (5 mm) above the 
lower exposed edge of the specimen.
    (ii) Standard Three-Hole Upper Pilot Burner. The pilot burner must 
be a straight length of .25 inch (6.3 mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8 mm) wall, 
stainless steel tubing that is 14 inches (360 mm) long. One end of the 
tubing must be closed, and three No. 40 drill holes must be drilled into 
the tubing, 2.38 inch (60 mm) apart, for gas ports, all radiating in the 
same direction. The first hole must be .19 inch (5 mm) from the closed 
end of the tubing. The tube must be positioned .75 inch (19 mm) above 
and .75 inch (19 mm) behind the exposed upper edge of the specimen. The 
middle hole must be in the vertical plane perpendicular to the exposed 
surface of the specimen which passes through its vertical centerline and 
must be pointed toward the radiation source. The gas supplied to the 
burner must be methane and must be adjusted to produce flame lengths of 
1 inch (25 mm).
    (iii) Optional Fourteen-Hole Upper Pilot Burner. This burner may be 
used in lieu of the standard three-hole burner described in paragraph 
(b)(8)(ii) of this part IV. The pilot burner must be a straight length 
of .25 inch (6.3 mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8 mm) wall, stainless steel 
tubing that is 15.75 inches (400 mm) long. One end of the tubing must be 
closed, and 14 No. 59 drill holes must be drilled into the tubing, .50 
inch (13 mm) apart, for gas ports, all radiating in the same direction. 
The first hole must be .50 inch (13 mm) from the closed end of the 
tubing. The tube must be positioned above the specimen holder so that 
the holes are placed above the specimen as shown in Figure 1B of this 
part IV. The fuel supplied to the burner must be methane mixed with air 
in a ratio of approximately 50/50 by volume. The total gas flow must be 
adjusted to produce flame lengths of 1 inch (25 mm). When the gas/air 
ratio and the flow rate are properly adjusted, approximately .25 inch (6 
mm) of the flame length appears yellow in color.
    (c) Calibration of Equipment. (1) Heat Release Rate. A calibration 
burner, as shown in Figure 4, must be placed over the end of the lower 
pilot flame tubing using a gas tight connection. The flow of gas to the 
pilot flame must be at least 99 percent methane and must be accurately 
metered. Prior to usage, the wet test meter must be properly leveled and 
filled with distilled water to the tip of the internal pointer while no 
gas is flowing. Ambient temperature and pressure of the water are based 
on the internal wet test meter temperature. A baseline flow rate of 
approximately 1 liter/min. must be set and increased to higher preset 
flows of 4, 6, 8, 6 and 4 liters/min. Immediately prior to recording 
methane flow rates, a flow rate of 8 liters/min. must be used for 2 
minutes to precondition the chamber. This is not recorded as part of 
calibration. The rate must be determined by using a stopwatch to time a 
complete revolution of the wet test meter for both the baseline and 
higher flow, with the flow returned to baseline before changing to the 
next higher flow. The thermopile baseline voltage must be measured. The 
gas flow to the burner must be increased to the higher preset flow and 
allowed to burn for 2.0 minutes, and the thermopile voltage must be 
measured. The sequence must be repeated until all five values have been 
determined. The average of the five values must be used as the 
calibration factor. The procedure must be repeated if the percent 
relative standard deviation is greater than 5 percent. Calculations are 
shown in paragraph (f) of this part IV.
    (2) Flux Uniformity. Uniformity of flux over the specimen must be 
checked periodically and after each heating element change to determine 
if it is within acceptable limits of plus or minus 5 percent.
    (3) As noted in paragraph (b)(2) of this part IV, thermopile hot 
junctions must be cleared of soot deposits as needed to maintain the 
calibrated sensitivity.
    (d) Preparation of Test Specimens. (1) The test specimens must be 
representative of the aircraft component in regard to materials and 
construction methods. The standard size for the test specimens is 5.91 
<plus-minus> .03  x  5.91 <plus-minus> .03 inches (149 <plus-minus> 1 
x  149 <plus-minus> 1 mm). The thickness of the specimen must be the 
same as that of

[[Page 502]]

the aircraft component it represents up to a maximum thickness of 1.75 
inches (45 mm). Test specimens representing thicker components must be 
1.75 inches (45 mm).
    (2) Conditioning. Specimens must be conditioned as described in Part 
1 of this appendix.
    (3) Mounting. Each test specimen must be wrapped tightly on all 
sides of the specimen, except for the one surface that is exposed with a 
single layer of .001 inch (.025 mm) aluminum foil.
    (e) Procedure. (1) The power supply to the radiant panel must be set 
to produce a radiant flux of 3.5 <plus-minus> .05 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, as 
measured at the point the center of the specimen surface will occupy 
when positioned for the test. The radiant flux must be measured after 
the air flow through the equipment is adjusted to the desired rate.
    (2) After the pilot flames are lighted, their position must be 
checked as described in paragraph (b)(8) of this part IV.
    (3) Air flow through the apparatus must be controlled by a circular 
plate orifice located in a 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) I.D. pipe with two 
pressure measuring points, located 1.5 inches (38 mm) upstream and .75 
inches (19 mm) downstream of the orifice plate. The pipe must be 
connected to a manometer set at a pressure differential of 7.87 inches 
(200 mm) of Hg. (See Figure 1B of this part IV.) The total air flow to 
the equipment is approximately .04 m<SUP>3</SUP>/seconds. The stop on 
the vertical specimen holder rod must be adjusted so that the exposed 
surface of the specimen is positioned 3.9 inches (100 mm) from the 
entrance when injected into the environmental chamber.
    (4) The specimen must be placed in the hold chamber with the 
radiation doors closed. The airtight outer door must be secured, and the 
recording devices must be started. The specimen must be retained in the 
hold chamber for 60 seconds, plus or minus 10 seconds, before injection. 
The thermopile ``zero'' value must be determined during the last 20 
seconds of the hold period. The sample must not be injected before 
completion of the ``zero'' value determination.
    (5) When the specimen is to be injected, the radiation doors must be 
opened. After the specimen is injected into the environmental chamber, 
the radiation doors must be closed behind the specimen.
    (6)  [Reserved]
    (7) Injection of the specimen and closure of the inner door marks 
time zero. A record of the thermopile output with at least one data 
point per second must be made during the time the specimen is in the 
environmental chamber.
    (8) The test duration is five minutes. The lower pilot burner and 
the upper pilot burner must remain lighted for the entire duration of 
the test, except that there may be intermittent flame extinguishment for 
periods that do not exceed 3 seconds. Furthermore, if the optional 
three-hole upper burner is used, at least two flamelets must remain 
lighted for the entire duration of the test, except that there may be 
intermittent flame extinguishment of all three flamelets for periods 
that do not exceed 3 seconds.
    (9) A minimum of three specimens must be tested.
    (f) Calculations. (1) The calibration factor is calculated as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.072

F<INF>0</INF>=flow of methane at baseline (1pm)
F<INF>1</INF>=higher preset flow of methane (1pm)
V<INF>0</INF>=thermopile voltage at baseline (mv)
V<INF>1</INF>=thermopile voltage at higher flow (mv)
T<INF>a</INF>=Ambient temperature (K)
P=Ambient pressure (mm Hg)
P<INF>v</INF>=Water vapor pressure (mm Hg)

    (2) Heat release rates may be calculated from the reading of the 
thermopile output voltage at any instant of time as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02FE95.006

HRR=heat release rate (kw/m\2\)
V<INF>b</INF>=baseline voltage (mv)
V<INF>m</INF>=measured thermopile voltage (mv)
K<INF>h</INF>=calibration factor (kw/mv)
    (3) The integral of the heat release rate is the total heat release 
as a function of time and is calculated by multiplying the rate by the 
data sampling frequency in minutes and summing the time from zero to two 
minutes.
    (g) Criteria. The total positive heat release over the first two 
minutes of exposure for each of the three or more samples tested must be 
averaged, and the peak heat release rate for each of the samples must be 
averaged. The average total heat release must not exceed 65 kilowatt-
minutes per square meter, and the average peak heat release rate must 
not exceed 65 kilowatts per square meter.

[[Page 503]]

    (h) Report. The test report must include the following for each 
specimen tested:
    (1) Description of the specimen.
    (2) Radiant heat flux to the specimen, expressed in W/
cm<SUP>2</SUP>.
    (3) Data giving release rates of heat (in kW/m<SUP>2</SUP> ) as a 
function of time, either graphically or tabulated at intervals no 
greater than 10 seconds. The calibration factor (k<INF>n</INF>) must be 
recorded.
    (4) If melting, sagging, delaminating, or other behavior that 
affects the exposed surface area or the mode of burning occurs, these 
behaviors must be reported, together with the time at which such 
behaviors were observed.
    (5) The peak heat release and the 2-minute integrated heat release 
rate must be reported.

section of this volume.

         Appendix G to Part 25--Continuous Gust Design Criteria

    The continuous gust design criteria in this appendix must be used in 
establishing the dynamic response of the airplane to vertical and 
lateral continuous turbulence unless a more rational criteria is used. 
The following gust load requirements apply to mission analysis and 
design envelope analysis:
    (a) The limit gust loads utilizing the continuous turbulence concept 
must be determined in accordance with the provisions of either paragraph 
(b) or paragraphs (c) and (d) of this appendix.
    (b) Design envelope analysis. The limit loads must be determined in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) All critical altitudes, weights, and weight distributions, as 
specified in Sec. 25.321(b), and all critical speeds within the ranges 
indicated in paragraph (b)(3) of this appendix must be considered.
    (2) Values of A (ratio of root-mean-square incremental load root-
mean-square gust velocity) must be determined by dynamic analysis. The 
power spectral density of the atmospheric turbulence must be as given by 
the equation--
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.078

where:
<greek-ph>=power-spectral density (ft./sec.) <SUP>2</SUP>/rad./ft.
<greek-s>=root-mean-square gust velocity, ft./sec.
<greek-OH>=reduced frequency, radians per foot.
L=2,500 ft.

    (3) The limit loads must be obtained by multiplying the A values 
determined by the dynamic analysis by the following values of the gust 
velocity U<greek-s>:
    (i) At speed V<INF>c</INF>: U<greek-s>=85 fps true gust velocity in 
the interval 0 to 30,000 ft. altitude and is linearly decreased to 30 
fps true gust velocity at 80,000 ft. altitude. Where the Administrator 
finds that a design is comparable to a similar design with extensive 
satisfactory service experience, it will be acceptable to select 
U<greek-s> at V<INF>c</INF> less than 85 fps, but not less than 75 fps, 
with linear decrease from that value at 20,000 feet to 30 fps at 80,000 
feet. The following factors will be taken into account when assessing 
comparability to a similar design:
    (1) The transfer function of the new design should exhibit no 
unusual characteristics as compared to the similar design which will 
significantly affect response to turbulence; e.g., coalescence of modal 
response in the frequency regime which can result in a significant 
increase of loads.
    (2) The typical mission of the new airplane is substantially 
equivalent to that of the similar design.
    (3) The similar design should demonstrate the adequacy of the 
U<greek-s>!</INF>selected.
    (ii) At speed V<INF>B</INF>: U<greek-s>!</INF>is equal to 1.32 times 
the values obtained under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this appendix.
    (iii) At speed V<INF>D</INF>: U<greek-s>!</INF>is equal to \1/2\ the 
values obtained under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this appendix.
    (iv) At speeds between V<INF>B</INF> and V<INF>c!</INF>and between 
V<INF>c!</INF>and V<INF>D</INF>: U<greek-s>!</INF>is equal to a value 
obtained by linear interpolation.
    (4) When a stability augmentation system is included in the 
analysis, the effect of system nonlinearities on loads at the limit load 
level must be realistically or conservatively accounted for.
    (c) Mission analysis. Limit loads must be determined in accordance 
with the following:
    (1) The expected utilization of the airplane must be represented by 
one or more flight profiles in which the load distribution and the 
variation with time of speed, altitude, gross weight, and center of 
gravity position are defined. These profiles must be divided into 
mission segments or blocks, for analysis, and average or effective 
values of the pertinent parameters defined for each segment.
    (2) For each of the mission segments defined under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this appendix, values of A and N<INF>o!</INF>must be determined by 
analysis. A is defined as the ratio of root-mean-square incremental load 
to root-mean-square gust velocity and N<INF>o!</INF>is the radius of 
gyration of the load power spectral density function about zero 
frequency. The power spectral density of the atmospheric turbulence must 
be given by the equation set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this appendix.
    (3) For each of the load and stress quantities selected, the 
frequency of exceedance must be determined as a function of load level 
by means of the equation--

[[Page 512]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.079


where--

t=selected time interval.
y=net value of the load or stress.
Y<INF>one=g</INF>=value of the load or stress in one-g level flight.
N(y)=average number of exceedances of the indicated value of the load or 
          stress in unit time.
<greek-S>=symbol denoting summation over all mission segments.
N<INF>o</INF>, A=parameters determined by dynamic analysis as defined in 
          paragraph (c)(2) of this appendix.
P<INF>1</INF>, P<INF>2</INF>, b<INF>1</INF>, b<INF>2</INF>=parameters 
          defining the probability distributions of root-mean-square 
          gust velocity, to be read from Figures 1 and 2 of this 
          appendix.

The limit gust loads must be read from the frequency of exceedance 
curves at a frequency of exceedance of 2 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> exceedances 
per hour. Both positive and negative load directions must be considered 
in determining the limit loads.
    (4) If a stability augmentation system is utilized to reduce the 
gust loads, consideration must be given to the fraction of flight time 
that the system may be inoperative. The flight profiles of paragraph 
(c)(1) of this appendix must include flight with the system inoperative 
for this fraction of the flight time. When a stability augmentation 
system is included in the analysis, the effect of system nonlinearities 
on loads at the limit load level must be conservatively accounted for.
    (d) Supplementary design envelope analysis. In addition to the limit 
loads defined by paragraph (c) of this appendix, limit loads must also 
be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this appendix, except 
that--
    (1) In paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this appendix, the value of 
U<greek-s>=85 fps true gust velocity is replaced by U<greek-s>=60 fps 
true gust velocity on the interval 0 to 30,000 ft. altitude, and is 
linearly decreased to 25 fps true gust velocity at 80,000 ft. altitude; 
and
    (2) In paragraph (b) of this appendix, the reference to paragraphs 
(b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iii) of this appendix is to be understood as 
referring to the paragraph as modified by paragraph (d)(1).

   Appendix I to Part 25--Installation of an Automatic Takeoff Thrust 
                         Control System (ATTCS)

                             I25.1  General.

    (a) This appendix specifies additional requirements for installation 
of an engine power control system that automatically resets thrust or 
power on operating engine(s) in the event of any one engine failure 
during takeoff.
    (b) With the ATTCS and associated systems functioning normally as 
designed, all applicable requirements of Part 25, except as provided in 
this appendix, must be met without requiring any action by the crew to 
increase thrust or power.

                           I25.2  Definitions.

    (a) Automatic Takeoff Thrust Control System (ATTCS). An ATTCS is 
defined as the entire automatic system used on takeoff, including all 
devices, both mechanical and electrical, that sense engine failure, 
transmit signals, actuate fuel controls or power levers or increase 
engine power by other means on operating engines to achieve scheduled 
thrust or power increases, and furnish cockpit information on system 
operation.
    (b) Critical Time Interval. When conducting an ATTCS takeoff, the 
critical time interval is between V<INF>1</INF> minus 1 second and a 
point on the minimum performance, all-engine flight path where, assuming 
a simultaneous occurrence of an engine and ATTCS failure, the resulting 
minimum flight path thereafter intersects the Part 25 required actual 
flight path at no less than 400 feet above the takeoff surface. This 
time interval is shown in the following illustration:

         I25.3  Performance and System Reliability Requirements.

     The applicant must comply with the performance and ATTCS 
reliability requirements as follows:
    (a) An ATTCS failure or a combination of failures in the ATTCS 
during the critical time interval:
    (1) Shall not prevent the insertion of the maximum approved takeoff 
thrust or power, or must be shown to be an improbable event.
    (2) Shall not result in a significant loss or reduction in thrust or 
power, or must be shown to be an extremely improbable event.
    (b) The concurrent existence of an ATTCS failure and an engine 
failure during the critical time interval must be shown to be extremely 
improbable.
    (c) All applicable performance requirements of Part 25 must be met 
with an engine failure occurring at the most critical point during 
takeoff with the ATTCS system functioning.

                         I25.4  Thrust Setting.

     The initial takeoff thrust or power setting on each engine at the 
beginning of the takeoff roll may not be less than any of the following:
    (a) Ninety (90) percent of the thrust or power set by the ATTCS (the 
maximum takeoff thrust or power approved for the airplane under existing 
ambient conditions);
    (b) That required to permit normal operation of all safety-related 
systems and equipment dependent upon engine thrust or power lever 
position; or
    (c) That shown to be free of hazardous engine response 
characteristics when thrust or power is advanced from the initial 
takeoff thrust or power to the maximum approved takeoff thrust or power.

                       I25.5  Powerplant Controls.

    (a) In addition to the requirements of Sec. 25.1141, no single 
failure or malfunction, or probable combination thereof, of the ATTCS, 
including associated systems, may cause the failure of any powerplant 
function necessary for safety.
    (b) The ATTCS must be designed to:
    (1) Apply thrust or power on the operating engine(s), following any 
one engine failure during takeoff, to achieve the maximum approved 
takeoff thrust or power without exceeding engine operating limits;
    (2) Permit manual decrease or increase in thrust or power up to the 
maximum takeoff thrust or power approved for the airplane under existing 
conditions through the use of the power lever. For airplanes equipped 
with limiters that automatically prevent engine operating limits from 
being exceeded under existing ambient conditions, other means may be 
used to increase the thrust or power in the event of an ATTCS failure 
provided the means is located on or forward of the power levers; is 
easily identified and operated under all operating conditions by a 
single action of either pilot with the hand that is normally used to 
actuate the power levers; and meets the requirements of Sec. 25.777 (a), 
(b), and (c);
    (3) Provide a means to verify to the flightcrew before takeoff that 
the ATTCS is in a condition to operate; and
    (4) Provide a means for the flightcrew to deactivate the automatic 
function. This means must be designed to prevent inadvertent 
deactivation.

                     I25.6  Powerplant Instruments.

     In addition to the requirements of Sec. 25.1305:
    (a) A means must be provided to indicate when the ATTCS is in the 
armed or ready condition; and
    (b) If the inherent flight characteristics of the airplane do not 
provide adequate warning that an engine has failed, a warning system 
that is independent of the ATTCS must be provided to give the pilot a 
clear warning of any engine failure during takeoff.

[Amdt. 25-62, 52 FR 43156, Nov. 9, 1987]

               Appendix J to Part 25--Emergency Evacuation

    The following test criteria and procedures must be used for showing 
compliance with Sec. 25.803:
    (a) The emergency evacuation must be conducted either during the 
dark of the night or during daylight with the dark of night simulated. 
If the demonstration is conducted indoors during daylight hours, it must 
be conducted with each window covered and each door closed to minimize 
the daylight effect. Illumination on the floor or ground may be used, 
but it must be kept low and shielded against shining into the airplane's 
windows or doors.
    (b) The airplane must be in a normal attitude with landing gear 
extended.
    (c) Unless the airplane is equipped with an off-wing descent means, 
stands or ramps may be used for descent from the wing to the ground. 
Safety equipment such as mats or inverted life rafts may be placed on 
the floor or ground to protect participants. No other equipment that is 
not part of the emergency evacuation equipment of the airplane may be 
used to aid the participants in reaching the ground.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this Appendix, only the 
airplane's emergency lighting system may provide illumination.
    (e) All emergency equipment required for the planned operation of 
the airplane must be installed.
    (f) Each external door and exit, and each internal door or curtain, 
must be in the takeoff configuration.

[[Page 519]]

    (g) Each crewmember must be seated in the normally assigned seat for 
takeoff and must remain in the seat until receiving the signal for 
commencement of the demonstration. Each crewmember must be a person 
having knowledge of the operation of exits and emergency equipment and, 
if compliance with Sec. 121.291 is also being demonstrated, each flight 
attendant must be a member of a regularly scheduled line crew.
    (h) A representative passenger load of persons in normal health must 
be used as follows:
    (1) At least 40 percent of the passenger load must be female.
    (2) At least 35 percent of the passenger load must be over 50 years 
of age.
    (3) At least 15 percent of the passenger load must be female and 
over 50 years of age.
    (4) Three life-size dolls, not included as part of the total 
passenger load, must be carried by passengers to simulate live infants 2 
years old or younger.
    (5) Crewmembers, mechanics, and training personnel, who maintain or 
operate the airplane in the normal course of their duties, may not be 
used as passengers.
    (i) No passenger may be assigned a specific seat except as the 
Administrator may require. Except as required by subparagraph (g) of 
this paragraph, no employee of the applicant may be seated next to an 
emergency exit.
    (j) Seat belts and shoulder harnesses (as required) must be 
fastened.
    (k) Before the start of the demonstration, approximately one-half of 
the total average amount of carry-on baggage, blankets, pillows, and 
other similar articles must be distributed at several locations in 
aisles and emergency exit access ways to create minor obstructions.
    (l) No prior indication may be given to any crewmember or passenger 
of the particular exits to be used in the demonstration.
    (m) The applicant may not practice, rehearse, or describe the 
demonstration for the participants nor may any participant have taken 
part in this type of demonstration within the preceding 6 months.
    (n) The pretakeoff passenger briefing required by Sec. 121.571 may 
be given. The passengers may also be advised to follow directions of 
crewmembers but not be instructed on the procedures to be followed in 
the demonstration.
    (o) If safety equipment as allowed by paragraph (c) of this appendix 
is provided, either all passenger and cockpit windows must be blacked 
out or all of the emergency exits must have safety equipment in order to 
prevent disclosure of the available emergency exits.
    (p) Not more than 50 percent of the emergency exits in the sides of 
the fuselage of an airplane that meets all of the requirements 
applicable to the required emergency exits for that airplane may be used 
for the demonstration. Exits that are not to be used in the 
demonstration must have the exit handle deactivated or must be indicated 
by red lights, red tape, or other acceptable means placed outside the 
exits to indicate fire or other reason why they are unusable. The exits 
to be used must be representative of all of the emergency exits on the 
airplane and must be designated by the applicant, subject to approval by 
the Administrator. At least one floor level exit must be used.
    (q) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, all 
evacuees must leave the airplane by a means provided as part of the 
airplane's equipment.
    (r) The applicant's approved procedures must be fully utilized, 
except the flightcrew must take no active role in assisting others 
inside the cabin during the demonstration.
    (s) The evacuation time period is completed when the last occupant 
has evacuated the airplane and is on the ground. Provided that the 
acceptance rate of the stand or ramp is no greater than the acceptance 
rate of the means available on the airplane for descent from the wing 
during an actual crash situation, evacuees using stands or ramps allowed 
by paragraph (c) of this Appendix are considered to be on the ground 
when they are on the stand or ramp.

    Removable ballast may be used in showing compliance with the flight 
requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 27.33  Main rotor speed and pitch limits.

    (a) Main rotor speed limits. A range of main rotor speeds must be 
established that--

[[Page 525]]

    (1) With power on, provides adequate margin to accommodate the 
variations in rotor speed occurring in any appropriate maneuver, and is 
consistent with the kind of governor or synchronizer used; and
    (2) With power off, allows each appropriate autorotative maneuver to 
be performed throughout the ranges of airspeed and weight for which 
certification is requested.
    (b) Normal main rotor high pitch limits (power on). For rotocraft, 
except helicopters required to have a main rotor low speed warning under 
paragraph (e) of this section. It must be shown, with power on and 
without exceeding approved engine maximum limitations, that main rotor 
speeds substantially less than the minimum approved main rotor speed 
will not occur under any sustained flight condition. This must be met 
by--
    (1) Appropriate setting of the main rotor high pitch stop;
    (2) Inherent rotorcraft characteristics that make unsafe low main 
rotor speeds unlikely; or
    (3) Adequate means to warn the pilot of unsafe main rotor speeds.
    (c) Normal main rotor low pitch limits (power off). It must be 
shown, with power off, that--
    (1) The normal main rotor low pitch limit provides sufficient rotor 
speed, in any autorotative condition, under the most critical 
combinations of weight and airspeed; and
    (2) It is possible to prevent overspeeding of the rotor without 
exceptional piloting skill.
    (d) Emergency high pitch. If the main rotor high pitch stop is set 
to meet paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and if that stop cannot be 
exceeded inadvertently, additional pitch may be made available for 
emergency use.
    (e) Main rotor low speed warning for helicopters. For each single 
engine helicopter, and each multiengine helicopter that does not have an 
approved device that automatically increases power on the operating 
engines when one engine fails, there must be a main rotor low speed 
warning which meets the following requirements:
    (1) The warning must be furnished to the pilot in all flight 
conditions, including power-on and power-off flight, when the speed of a 
main rotor approaches a value that can jeopardize safe flight.
    (2) The warning may be furnished either through the inherent 
aerodynamic qualities of the helicopter or by a device.
    (3) The warning must be clear and distinct under all conditons, and 
must be clearly distinguishable from all other warnings. A visual device 
that requires the attention of the crew within the cockpit is not 
acceptable by itself.
    (4) If a warning device is used, the device must automatically 
deactivate and reset when the low-speed condition is corrected. If the 
device has an audible warning, it must also be equipped with a means for 
the pilot to manually silence the audible warning before the low-speed 
condition is corrected.

flight condition.
    (d) For reciprocating engine-powered rotorcraft, the performance, as

flight conditions acts on the surface on one side of the plane of 
symmetry, and no loading acts on the other side.
    (2) Fifty percent of the maximum loading from the symmetrical flight 
conditions acts on the surface on each side of the plane of symmetry but 
in opposite directions.
    (c) For empennage arrangements where the horizontal tail surfaces 
are supported by the vertical tail surfaces, the vertical tail surfaces 
and supporting structure must be designed for the combined vertical and 
horizontal surface loads resulting from each prescribed flight 
condition, considered separately. The flight conditions must be selected 
so the maximum design loads are obtained on each surface. In the absence 
of more rational data, the unsymmetrical horizontal tail surface loading 
distributions described in this section must be assumed.

    (1) The seating device system must remain intact although it may 
experience separation intended as part of its design.

Sec. 27.563  Structural ditching provisions.

    If certification with ditching provisions is requested, structural 
strength for ditching must meet the requirements of this section and 
Sec. 27.801(e).
    (a) Forward speed landing conditions. The rotorcraft must initially 
contact the most critical wave for reasonably probable water conditions 
at forward velocities from zero up to 30 knots in likely pitch, roll, 
and yaw attitudes. The rotorcraft limit vertical descent velocity may 
not be less than 5 feet per second relative to the mean water surface. 
Rotor lift may be used to act through the center of gravity throughout 
the landing impact. This lift may not exceed two-thirds of the design 
maximum weight. A maximum forward velocity of less than 30 knots may be 
used in design if it can be demonstrated that the forward velocity 
selected would not be exceeded in a normal one-engine-out touchdown.
    (b) Auxiliary or emergency float conditions--(1) Floats fixed or 
deployed before initial water contact. In addition to the landing loads 
in paragraph (a) of this

[[Page 541]]

section, each auxiliary or emergency float, of its support and attaching 
structure in the airframe or fuselage, must be designed for the load 
developed by a fully immersed float unless it can be shown that full 
immersion is unlikely. If full immersion is unlikely, the highest likely 
float buoyancy load must be applied. The highest likely buoyancy load 
must include consideration of a partially immersed float creating 
restoring moments to compensate the upsetting moments caused by side 
wind, unsymmetrical rotorcraft loading, water wave action, rotorcraft 
inertia, and probable structural damage and leakage considered under 
Sec. 27.801(d). Maximum roll and pitch angles determined from compliance 
with Sec. 27.801(d) may be used, if significant, to determine the extent 
of immersion of each float. If the floats are deployed in flight, 
appropriate air loads derived from the flight limitations with the 
floats deployed shall be used in substantiation of the floats and their 
attachment to the rotorcraft. For this purpose, the design airspeed for 
limit load is the float deployed airspeed operating limit multiplied by 
1.11.
    (2) Floats deployed after initial water contact. Each float must be 
designed for full or partial immersion perscribed in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section. In addition, each float must be designed for combined 
vertical and drag loads using a relative limit speed of 20 knots between 
the rotorcraft and the water. The vertical load may not be less than the 
highest likely buoyancy load determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.

detectable under inspection procedures furnished under section A27.4 of 
Appendix A.

conducted on the complete rotorcraft or on units consisting of wheel, 
tire, and shock absorber in their proper relation.


<R05>
Sec. 27.725  Limit drop test.

    The limit drop test must be conducted as follows:
    (a) The drop height must be--
    (1) 13 inches from the lowest point of the landing gear to the 
ground; or
    (2) Any lesser height, not less than eight inches, resulting in a 
drop contact velocity equal to the greatest probable sinking speed 
likely to occur at ground contact in normal power-off landings.
    (b) If considered, the rotor lift specified in Sec. 27.473(a) must 
be introduced into the drop test by appropriate energy absorbing devices 
or by the use of an effective mass.
    (c) Each landing gear unit must be tested in the attitude simulating 
the landing condition that is most critical from the standpoint of the 
energy to be absorbed by it.

of more rational computations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.085

where:

W<INF>e</INF>= the effective weight to be used in the drop test (lbs.);
W=W<INF>M!</INF>for main gear units (lbs.), equal to the static reaction 
          on the particular unit with the rotorcraft in the most 
          critical attitude. A rational method may be used in computing 
          a main gear static reaction, taking into consideration the 
          moment arm between the main wheel reaction and the rotorcraft 
          center of gravity.
W=W<INF>N!</INF>for nose gear units (lbs.), equal to the vertical 
          component of the static reaction that would exist at the nose 
          wheel, assuming that the mass of the rotorcraft acts at the 
          center of gravity and exerts a force of 1.0g downward and 
          0.25g forward.
W=W<INF>T!</INF>for tailwheel units (lbs.), equal to whichever of the 
          following is critical:

    (1) The static weight on the tailwheel with the rotorcraft resting 
on all wheels; or
    (2) The vertical component of the ground reaction that would occur 
at the tailwheel, assuming that the mass of the rotorcraft acts at the 
center of gravity and exerts a force of lg downward with the rotorcraft 
in the maximum nose-up attitude considered in the nose-up landing 
conditions.

h =specified free drop height (inches).
L =ration of assumed rotor lift to the rotorcraft weight.
d =deflection under impact of the tire (at the proper inflation 
          pressure) plus the vertical component of the axle travels 
          (inches) relative to the drop mass.
n =limit inertia load factor.
n<INF>j</INF>=the load factor developed, during impact, on the mass used 
          in the drop test (i.e., the acceleration dv/dt in g 's 
          recorded in the drop test plus 1.0).


<R05>
Sec. 27.727  Reserve energy absorption drop test.

    The reserve energy absorption drop test must be conducted as 
follows:
    (a) The drop height must be 1.5 times that specified in 
Sec. 27.725(a).
    (b) Rotor lift, where considered in a manner similar to that 
prescribed in Sec. 27.725(b), may not exceed 1.5 times the lift allowed 
under that paragraph.
    (c) The landing gear must withstand this test without collapsing. 
Collapse of the landing gear occurs when a member of the nose, tail, or 
main gear will not support the rotorcraft in the proper attitude or 
allows the rotorcraft structure, other than the landing gear and 
external accessories, to impact the landing surface.

Sec. 27.785  Seats, berths, safety belts, and harnesses.

    (a) Each seat, safety belt, harness, and adjacent part of the 
rotorcraft at each station designated for occupancy during takeoff and 
landing must be free of potentially injurious objects, sharp edges, 
protuberances, and hard surfaces and must be designed so that a person 
making proper use of these facilities will not suffer serious injury in 
an emergency landing as a result of the static inertial load factors 
specified in Sec. 27.561(b) and dynamic conditions specified in 
Sec. 27.562.
    (b) Each occupant must be protected from serious head injury by a 
safety belt plus a shoulder harness that will prevent the head from 
contacting any injurious object except as provided for in 
Sec. 27.562(c)(5). A shoulder harness (upper torso restraint), in 
combination with the safety belt, constitutes a torso restraint system 
as described in TSO-C114.
    (c) Each occupant's seat must have a combined safety belt and 
shoulder harness with a single-point release. Each pilot's combined 
safety belt and shoulder harness must allow each pilot when seated with 
safety belt and shoulder harness fastened to perform all functions 
necessary for flight operations. There must be a means to secure belts 
and harnesses, when not in use, to prevent interference with the 
operation of the rotorcraft and with rapid egress in an emergency.
    (d) If seat backs do not have a firm handhold, there must be hand 
grips or rails along each aisle to enable the occupants to steady 
themselves while using the aisle in moderately rough air.
    (e) Each projecting object that could injure persons seated or 
moving about in the rotorcraft in normal flight must be padded.
    (f) Each seat and its supporting structure must be designed for an

factors, inertial forces, and reactions between occupant, seat, and 
safety belt or harness corresponding with the applicable flight and 
ground load conditions, including the emergency landing conditions of 
Sec. 27.561(b). In addition--
    (1) Each pilot seat must be designed for the reactions resulting 
from the application of the pilot forces prescribed in Sec. 27.397; and
    (2) The inertial forces prescribed in Sec. 27.561(b) must be 
multiplied by a factor of 1.33 in determining the strength of the 
attachment of--
    (i) Each seat to the structure; and
    (ii) Each safety belt or harness to the seat or structure.
    (g) When the safety belt and shoulder harness are combined, the 
rated strength of the safety belt and shoulder harness may not be less 
than that corresponding to the inertial forces specified in 
Sec. 27.561(b), considering the occupant weight of at least 170 pounds, 
considering the dimensional characteristics of the restraint system 
installation, and using a distribution of at least a 60-percent load to 
the safety

[[Page 552]]

belt and at least a 40-percent load to the shoulder harness. If the 
safety belt is capable of being used without the shoulder harness, the 
inertial forces specified must be met by the safety belt alone.
    (h) When a headrest is used, the headrest and its supporting 
structure must be designed to resist the inertia forces specified in 
Sec. 27.561, with a 1.33 fitting factor and a head weight of at least 13 
pounds.
    (i) Each seating device system includes the device such as the seat, 
the cushions, the occupant restraint system, and attachment devices.
    (j) Each seating device system may use design features such as 
crushing or separation of certain parts of the seats to reduce occupant 
loads for the emergency landing dynamic conditions of Sec. 27.562; 
otherwise, the system must remain intact and must not interfere with 
rapid evacuation of the rotorcraft.
    (k) For the purposes of this section, a litter is defined as a 
device designed to carry a nonambulatory person, primarily in a 
recumbent position, into and on the rotorcraft. Each berth or litter 
must be designed to withstand the load reaction of an occupant weight of 
at least 170 pounds when the occupant is subjected to the forward 
inertial factors specified in Sec. 27.561(b). A berth or litter 
installed within 15 deg. or less of the longitudinal axis of the 
rotorcraft must be provided with a padded end-board, cloth diaphram, or 
equivalent means that can withstand the forward load reaction. A berth 
or litter oriented greater than 15 deg. with the longitudinal axis of 
the rotorcraft must be equipped with appropriate restraints, such as 
straps or safety belts, to withstand the forward load reaction. In 
addition--
    (1) The berth or litter must have a restraint system and must not 
have corners or other protuberances likely to cause serious injury to a 
person occupying it during emergency landing conditions; and
    (2) The berth or litter attachment and the occupant restraint system 
attachments to the structure must be designed to withstand the critical 
loads resulting from flight and ground load conditions and from the 
conditions prescribed in Sec. 27.561(b).

distributions at the appropriate maximum load factors corresponding to 
the specified flight and ground load conditions, except the emergency 
landing conditions of Sec. 27.561.
    (b) There must be means to prevent the contents of any compartment 
from becoming a hazard by shifting under the loads specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Under the emergency landing conditions of Sec. 27.561, cargo and 
baggage compartments must--
    (1) Be positioned so that if the contents break loose they are 
unlikely to cause injury to the occupants or restrict any of the escape 
facilities provided for use after an emergency landing; or
    (2) Have sufficient strength to withstand the conditions specified 
in Sec. 27.561 including the means of restraint, and their attachments, 
required by paragraph (b) of this section. Sufficient strength must be 
provided for the maximum authorized weight of cargo and baggage at the 
critical loading distribution.
    (d) If cargo compartment lamps are installed, each lamp must be 
installed so as to prevent contact between lamp bulb and cargo.

rotorcraft must meet the requirements of this section and 
Secs. 27.807(d), 27.1411 and 27.1415.
    (b) Each practicable design measure, compatible with the general 
characteristics of the rotorcraft, must be taken to minimize the 
probability that in an

[[Page 553]]

emergency landing on water, the behavior of the rotorcraft would cause 
immediate injury to the occupants or would make it impossible for them 
to escape.
    (c) The probable behavior of the rotorcraft in a water landing must 
be investigated by model tests or by comparison with rotorcraft of 
similar configuration for which the ditching characteristics are known. 
Scoops, flaps, projections, and any other factor likely to affect the 
hydrodynamic characteristics of the rotorcraft must be considered.
    (d) It must be shown that, under reasonably probable water 
conditions, the flotation time and trim of the rotorcraft will allow the 
occupants to leave the rotorcraft and enter the life rafts required by 
Sec. 27.1415. If compliance with this provision is shown by buoyancy and 
trim computations, appropriate allowances must be made for probable 
structural damage and leakage. If the rotorcraft has fuel tanks (with 
fuel jettisoning provisions) that can reasonably be expected to 
withstand a ditching without leakage, the jettisonable volume of fuel 
may be considered as buoyancy volume.
    (e) Unless the effects of the collapse of external doors and windows 
are accounted for in the investigation of the probable behavior of the 
rotorcraft in a water landing (as prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) 
of this section), the external doors and windows must be designed to 
withstand the probable maximum local pressures.

person using it, and be located so as to allow ready use, without 
crowding, in any probable attitudes that may result from a crash;
    (3) Have a simple and obvious method of opening and be arranged and 
marked so as to be readily located and operated, even in darkness; and
    (4) Be reasonably protected from jamming by fuselage deformation.
    (c) Tests. The proper functioning of each emergency exit must be 
shown by test.

ditching provisions is requested, one emergency exit on each side of the 
fuselage must be proven by test, demonstration, or analysis to--
    (1) Be above the waterline;
    (2) Have at least the dimensions specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section; and
    (3) Open without interference from flotation devices whether stowed 
or deployed.

section must be run at not less than maximum continuous torque and the 
maximum speed for use with maximum continuous torque. In this test, the 
main rotor controls must be set in the position that will give maximum 
longitudinal cyclic pitch change to simulate forward flight. The 
auxiliary rotor controls must be in the position for normal operation 
under the conditions of the test.

sequence, during which that engine simulates a power failure and the 
remaining engines are run at 2\1/2\ minute OEI torque and the maximum 
speed for use with 2\1/2\ minute OEI torque for 2\1/2\ minutes.
    (2) For multiengine turbine-powered rotorcraft for which the use of

power source must simulate a failure, in turn, and apply the maximum 
torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-second OEI power to the 
remaining affected drive system power inputs for not less than 30 
seconds, followed by application of the maximum torque and the maximum 
speed for use with 2-minute OEI power for not less than 2 minutes. At

affected by the application of higher or asymmetric torque and speed 
prescribed by the test.
    (iii) This test may be conducted on a representative bench test 
facility when engine limitations either preclude repeated use of this 
power or would result in premature engine removal during the test. The 
loads, the vibration frequency, and the methods of application to the 
affected rotor drive system components must be representative of 
rotorcraft conditions. Test components must be those used to show 
compliance with the remainder of this section.
    (f) The parts of the test prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of

this section, 500 complete cycles of lateral control, 500 complete 
cycles of longitudinal control of the main rotors, and 500 complete 
cycles of control of each auxiliary rotor must be accomplished. A 
``complete cycle'' involves movement of the controls from the neutral 
position, through both extreme positions, and back to the neutral 
position, except that control movements need not produce loads or 
flapping motions exceeding the maximum loads or motions encountered in 
flight. The cycling may be accomplished during the testing prescribed in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) At least 200 start-up clutch engagements must be accomplished--
    (1) So that the shaft on the driven side of the clutch is 
accelerated; and
    (2) Using a speed and method selected by the applicant.

power is requested, five runs must be made at 30-minute OEI torque and 
the maximum speed for use with 30-minute OEI torque, in which each 
engine, in sequence, is made inoperative and the remaining engine(s) is 
run for a 30-minute period.
    (k) For multiengine rotorcraft for which the use of continuous OEI 
power is requested, five runs must be made at continuous OEI torque and 
the maximum speed for use with continuous OEI torque, in which each

applications, for 10 seconds each, or torque that is at least equal to 
the lesser of--
    (i) The maximum torque used in meeting Sec. 27.923 plus 10 percent; 
or

the remaining transmission torque inputs the maximum torque attainable 
under probable operating conditions, assuming that torque limiting 
devices, if any, function properly. Each transmission input must be 
tested at this maximum torque for at least 15 minutes.
    (3) The tests prescribed in this paragraph must be conducted on the 
rotorcraft at the maximum rotational speed intended for the power 
condition of the test and the torque must be absorbed by the rotors to 
be installed, except that other ground or flight test facilities with 
other appropriate methods of torque absorption may be used if the 
conditions of support and vibration closely simulate the conditions that 
would exist during a test on the rotorcraft.

flow of fuel at a rate and pressure established for proper engine 
functioning under any likely operating condition, including the 
maneuvers for which certification is requested.
    (b) Each fuel system must be arranged so that--
    (1) No fuel pump can draw fuel from more than one tank at a time; or
    (2) There are means to prevent introducing air into the system.
    (c) Each fuel system for a turbine engine must be capable of 
sustained operation throughout its flow and pressure range with fuel

Sec. 27.952  Fuel system crash resistance.

    Unless other means acceptable to the Administrator are employed to 
minimize the hazard of fuel fires to occupants following an otherwise 
survivable impact (crash landing), the fuel systems must incorporate the 
design features of this section. These systems must be shown to be 
capable of sustaining the static and dynamic deceleration loads of this 
section, considered as ultimate loads acting alone, measured at the 
system component's center of gravity, without structural damage to 
system components, fuel tanks, or their attachments that would leak fuel 
to an ignition source.
    (a) Drop test requirements. Each tank, or the most critical tank, 
must be drop-tested as follows:
    (1) The drop height must be at least 50 feet.
    (2) The drop impact surface must be nondeforming.
    (3) The tank must be filled with water to 80 percent of the normal, 
full capacity.
    (4) The tank must be enclosed in a surrounding structure 
representative of the installation unless it can be established that the 
surrounding structure is free of projections or other design features 
likely to contribute to rupture of the tank.
    (5) The tank must drop freely and impact in a horizontal position 
<plus-minus>10 deg..
    (6) After the drop test, there must be no leakage.
    (b) Fuel tank load factors. Except for fuel tanks located so that 
tank rupture with fuel release to either significant ignition sources, 
such as engines, heaters, and auxiliary power units, or occupants is 
extremely remote, each fuel tank must be designed and installed to 
retain its contents under the following ultimate inertial load factors, 
acting alone.
    (1) For fuel tanks in the cabin:
    (i) Upward--4g.
    (ii) Forward--16g.
    (iii) Sideward--8g.
    (iv) Downward--20g.
    (2) For fuel tanks located above or behind the crew or passenger 
compartment that, if loosened, could injure an occupant in an emergency 
landing:
    (i) Upward--1.5g.
    (ii) Forward--8g.
    (iii) Sideward--2g.
    (iv) Downward--4g.
    (3) For fuel tanks in other areas:
    (i) Upward--1.5g.
    (ii) Forward--4g.
    (iii) Sideward--2g.
    (iv) Downward--4g.
    (c) Fuel line self-sealing breakaway couplings. Self-sealing 
breakaway couplings must be installed unless hazardous relative motion 
of fuel system components to each other or to local rotorcraft structure 
is demonstrated to be extremely improbable or unless other means are 
provided. The couplings or equivalent devices must be installed at all 
fuel tank-to-fuel line connections, tank-to-tank interconnects, and at 
other points in the fuel system where local structural deformation could 
lead to the release of fuel.
    (1) The design and construction of self-sealing breakaway couplings 
must incorporate the following design features:
    (i) The load necessary to separate a breakaway coupling must be 
between 25 to 50 percent of the minimum ultimate failure load (ultimate 
strength) of the weakest component in the fluid-carrying line. The 
separation load must in no case be less than 300 pounds, regardless of 
the size of the fluid line.
    (ii) A breakaway coupling must separate whenever its ultimate load 
(as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section) is applied in the 
failure modes most likely to occur.
    (iii) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to 
visually ascertain that the coupling is locked together (leak-free) and 
is open during normal installation and service.
    (iv) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to 
prevent uncoupling or unintended closing due to operational shocks, 
vibrations, or accelerations.
    (v) No breakaway coupling design may allow the release of fuel once 
the coupling has performed its intended function.
    (2) All individual breakaway couplings, coupling fuel feed systems, 
or equivalent means must be designed, tested, installed, and maintained 
so that inadvertent fuel shutoff in flight is improbable in accordance 
with

[[Page 562]]

Sec. 27.955(a) and must comply with the fatigue evaluation requirements 
of Sec. 27.571 without leaking.
    (3) Alternate, equivalent means to the use of breakaway couplings 
must not create a survivable impact-induced load on the fuel line to 
which it is installed greater than 25 to 50 percent of the ultimate load 
(strength) of the weakest component in the line and must comply with the 
fatigue requirements of Sec. 27.571 without leaking.
    (d) Frangible or deformable structural attachments. Unless hazardous 
relative motion of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local 
rotorcraft structure is demonstrated to be extremely improbable in an 
otherwise survivable impact, frangible or locally deformable attachments 
of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure 
must be used. The attachment of fuel tanks and fuel system components to 
local rotorcraft structure, whether frangible or locally deformable, 
must be designed such that its separation or relative local deformation 
will occur without rupture or local tear-out of the fuel tank or fuel 
system components that will cause fuel leakage. The ultimate strength of 
frangible or deformable attachments must be as follows:
    (1) The load required to separate a frangible attachment from its 
support structure, or deform a locally deformable attachment relative to 
its support structure, must be between 25 and 50 percent of the minimum 
ultimate load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the 
attached system. In no case may the load be less than 300 pounds.
    (2) A frangible or locally deformable attachment must separate or 
locally deform as intended whenever its ultimate load (as defined in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is applied in the modes most likely to 
occur.
    (3) All frangible or locally deformable attachments must comply with 
the fatigue requirements of Sec. 27.571.
    (e) Separation of fuel and ignition sources. To provide maximum 
crash resistance, fuel must be located as far as practicable from all 
occupiable areas and from all potential ignition sources.
    (f) Other basic mechanical design criteria. Fuel tanks, fuel lines, 
electrical wires, and electrical devices must be designed, constructed, 
and installed, as far as practicable, to be crash resistant.
    (g) Rigid or semirigid fuel tanks. Rigid or semirigid fuel tank or 
bladder walls must be impact and tear resistant.

<R05>
Sec. 27.953  Fuel system independence.

    (a) Each fuel system for multiengine rotorcraft must allow fuel to 
be supplied to each engine through a system independent of those parts 
of each system supplying fuel to other engines. However, separate fuel 
tanks need not be provided for each engine.
    (b) If a single fuel tank is used on a multiengine rotorcraft, the 
following must be provided:
    (1) Independent tank outlets for each engine, each incorporating a 
shutoff valve at the tank. This shutoff valve may also serve as the 
firewall shutoff valve required by Sec. 27.995 if the line between the 
valve and the engine compartment does not contain a hazardous amount of 
fuel that can drain into the engine compartment.
    (2) At least two vents arranged to minimize the probability of both 
vents becoming obstructed simultaneously.
    (3) Filler caps designed to minimize the probability of incorrect 
installation or inflight loss.
    (4) A fuel system in which those parts of the system from each tank 
outlet to any engine are independent of each part of each system 
supplying fuel to other engines.


<R05>
Sec. 27.954  Fuel system lightning protection.

    The fuel system must be designed and arranged to prevent the 
ignition of fuel vapor within the system by--
    (a) Direct lightning strikes to areas having a high probability of 
stroke attachment;
    (b) Swept lightning strokes to areas where swept strokes are highly 
probable; or
    (c) Corona and streamering at fuel vent outlets.

[[Page 563]]


<R05>
Sec. 27.955  Fuel flow.

    (a) General. The fuel system for each engine must be shown to 
provide the engine with at least 100 percent of the fuel required under 
each operating and maneuvering condition to be approved for the 
rotorcraft including, as applicable, the fuel required to operate the 
engine(s) under the test conditions required by Sec. 27.927. Unless 
equivalent methods are used, compliance must be shown by test during 
which the following provisions are met except that combinations of 
conditions which are shown to be improbable need not be considered.
    (1) The fuel pressure, corrected for critical accelerations, must be 
within the limits specified by the engine type certificate data sheet.
    (2) The fuel level in the tank may not exceed that established as 
the unusable fuel supply for that tank under Sec. 27.959, plus the 
minimum additional fuel necessary to conduct the test.
    (3) The fuel head between the tank outlet and the engine inlet must 
be critical with respect to rotorcraft flight attitudes.
    (4) The critical fuel pump (for pump-fed systems) is installed to 
produce (by actual or simulated failure) the critical restriction to 
fuel flow to be expected from pump failure.
    (5) Critical values of engine rotation speed, electrical power, or 
other sources of fuel pump motive power must be applied.
    (6) Critical values of fuel properties which adversely affect fuel 
flow must be applied.
    (7) The fuel filter required by Sec. 27.997 must be blocked to the 
degree necessary to simulate the accumulation of fuel contamination 
required to activate the indicator required by Sec. 27.1305(q).
    (b) Fuel transfer systems. If normal operation of the fuel system 
requires fuel to be transferred to an engine feed tank, the transfer 
must occur automatically via a system which has been shown to maintain 
the fuel level in the engine feed tank within acceptable limits during 
flight or surface operation of the rotorcraft.
    (c) Multiple fuel tanks. If an engine can be supplied with fuel from 
more than one tank, the fuel systems must, in addition to having 
appropriate manual switching capability, be designed to prevent 
interruption of fuel flow to that engine, without attention by the 
flightcrew, when any tank supplying fuel to that engine is depleted of 
usable fuel during normal operation, and any other tank that normally 
supplies fuel to the engine alone contains usable fuel.

[Amdt. 27-23, 53 FR 34212, Sept. 2, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 27.959  Unusable fuel supply.

    The unusable fuel supply for each tank must be established as not 
less than the quantity at which the first evidence of malfunction occurs 
under the most adverse fuel feed condition occurring under any intended 
operations and flight maneuvers involving that tank.


<R05>
Sec. 27.961  Fuel system hot weather operation.

    Each suction lift fuel system and other fuel systems with features 
conducive to vapor formation must be shown by test to operate 
satisfactorily (within certification limits) when using fuel at a 
temperature of 110  deg.F under critical operating conditions including, 
if applicable, the engine operating conditions defined by Sec. 27.927 
(b)(1) and (b)(2).

[Amdt. 27-23, 53 FR 34212, Sept. 2, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 27.963  Fuel tanks: general.

    (a) Each fuel tank must be able to withstand, without failure, the 
vibration, inertia, fluid, and structural loads to which it may be 
subjected in operation.
    (b) Each fuel tank of 10 gallons or greater capacity must have 
internal baffles, or must have external support to resist surging.
    (c) Each fuel tank must be separated from the engine compartment by 
a firewall. At least one-half inch of clear airspace must be provided 
between the tank and the firewall.
    (d) Spaces adjacent to the surfaces of fuel tanks must be ventilated 
so that fumes cannot accumulate in the tank compartment in case of 
leakage. If two or more tanks have interconnected outlets, they must be 
considered as one tank, and the airspaces in those tanks must be 
interconnected to prevent the

[[Page 564]]

flow of fuel from one tank to another as a result of a difference in 
pressure between those airspaces.
    (e) The maximum exposed surface temperature of any component in the 
fuel tank must be less, by a safe margin as determined by the 
Administrator, than the lowest expected autoignition temperature of the 
fuel or fuel vapor in the tank. Compliance with this requirement must be 
shown under all operating conditions and under all failure or 
malfunction conditions of all components inside the tank.
    (f) Each fuel tank installed in personnel compartments must be 
isolated by fume-proof and fuel-proof enclosures that are drained and 
vented to the exterior of the rotorcraft. The design and construction of 
the enclosures must provide necessary protection for the tank, must be 
crash resistant during a survivable impact in accordance with 
Sec. 27.952, and must be adequate to withstand loads and abrasions to be 
expected in personnel compartments.
    (g) Each flexible fuel tank bladder or liner must be approved or 
shown to be suitable for the particular application and must be puncture 
resistant. Puncture resistance must be shown by meeting the TSO-C80, 
paragraph 16.0, requirements using a minimum puncture force of 370 
pounds.
    (h) Each integral fuel tank must have provisions for inspection and 
repair of its interior.

<R05>
Sec. 27.965  Fuel tank tests.

    (a) Each fuel tank must be able to withstand the applicable pressure 
tests in this section without failure or leakage. If practicable, test 
pressures may be applied in a manner simulating the pressure 
distribution in service.
    (b) Each conventional metal tank, nonmetallic tank with walls that 
are not supported by the rotorcraft structure, and integral tank must be 
subjected to a pressure of 3.5 p.s.i. unless the pressure developed 
during maximum limit acceleration or emergency deceleration with a full 
tank exceeds this value, in which case a hydrostatic head, or equivalent 
test, must be applied to duplicate the acceleration loads as far as 
possible. However, the pressure need not exceed 3.5 p.s.i. on surfaces 
not exposed to the acceleration loading.
    (c) Each nonmetallic tank with walls supported by the rotorcraft 
structure must be subjected to the following tests:
    (1) A pressure test of at least 2.0 p.s.i. This test may be 
conducted on the tank alone in conjunction with the test specified in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) A pressure test, with the tank mounted in the rotorcraft 
structure, equal to the load developed by the reaction of the contents, 
with the tank full, during maximum limit acceleration or emergency 
deceleration. However, the pressure need not exceed 2.0 p.s.i. on 
surfaces not exposed to the acceleration loading.
    (d) Each tank with large unsupported or unstiffened flat areas, or 
with other features whose failure or deformation could cause leakage, 
must be subjected to the following test or its equivalent:
    (1) Each complete tank assembly and its support must be vibration 
tested while mounted to simulate the actual installation.
    (2) The tank assembly must be vibrated for 25 hours while two-thirds 
full of any suitable fluid. The amplitude of vibration may not be less 
than one thirty-second of an inch, unless otherwise substantiated.
    (3) The test frequency of vibration must be as follows:
    (i) If no frequency of vibration resulting from any r.p.m. within 
the normal operating range of engine or rotor system speeds is critical, 
the test frequency of vibration, in number of cycles per minute must, 
unless a frequency based on a more rational calculation is used, be the 
number obtained by averaging the maximum and minimum power-on engine 
speeds (r.p.m.) for reciprocating engine powered rotorcraft or 2,000 
c.p.m. for turbine engine powered rotorcraft.
    (ii) If only one frequency of vibration resulting from any r.p.m. 
within the normal operating range of engine or rotor system speeds is 
critical, that frequency of vibration must be the test frequency.

[[Page 565]]

    (iii) If more than one frequency of vibration resulting from any 
r.p.m. within the normal operating range of engine or rotor system 
speeds is critical, the most critical of these frequencies must be the 
test frequency.
    (4) Under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the time 
of test must be adjusted to accomplish the same number of vibration 
cycles as would be accomplished in 25 hours at the frequency specified 
in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.
    (5) During the test, the tank assembly must be rocked at the rate of 
16 to 20 complete cycles per minute through an angle of 15 degrees on 
both sides of the horizontal (30 degrees total), about the most critical 
axis, for 25 hours. If motion about more than one axis is likely to be 
critical, the tank must be rocked about each critical axis for 12\1/2\ 
hours.

    (a) Each fuel tank must be supported so that tank loads are not 
concentrated on unsupported tank surfaces. In addition--
    (1) There must be pads, if necessary, to prevent chafing between 
each tank and its supports;
    (2) The padding must be nonabsorbent or treated to prevent the 
absorption of fuel;
    (3) If flexible tank liners are used, they must be supported so that 
it is not necessary for them to withstand fluid loads; and

free of projections that could cause wear of the liner unless--
    (i) There are means for protection of the liner at those points; or
    (ii) The construction of the liner itself provides such protection.
    (b) Any spaces adjacent to tank surfaces must be adequately 
ventilated to avoid accumulation of fuel or fumes in those spaces due to 
minor leakage. If the tank is in a sealed compartment, ventilation may 
be limited to drain holes that prevent clogging and excessive pressure 
resulting from altitude changes. If flexible tank liners are installed, 
the venting arrangement for the spaces between the liner and its 
container must maintain the proper relationship to tank vent pressures 
for any expected flight condition.
    (c) The location of each tank must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 27.1185 (a) and (c).
    (d) No rotorcraft skin immediately adjacent to a major air outlet 
from the engine compartment may act as the wall of the integral tank.

accessible for preflight drainage and has a minimum capacity of 1 ounce 
for every 20 gallons of fuel tank capacity; and
    (2) Each fuel tank drain is located so that in any ground attitude 
to be expected in service, water will drain from all parts of the tank 
to the sediment bowl or chamber.
    (b) Each sump, sediment bowl, and sediment chamber drain required by 
this section must comply with the drain provisions of Sec. 27.999(b).

<R05>
Sec. 27.1011  Engines: General.

    (a) Each engine must have an independent oil system that can supply 
it with an appropriate quantity of oil at a temperature not above that 
safe for continuous operation.
    (b) The usable oil capacity of each system may not be less than the 
product of the endurance of the rotorcraft under critical operating 
conditions and the maximum oil consumption of the engine under the same

cooling. Instead of a rational analysis of endurance and consumption, a 
usable oil capacity of one gallon for each 40 gallons of usable fuel may 
be used.
    (c) The oil cooling provisions for each engine must be able to 
maintain the oil inlet temperature to that engine at or below the 
maximum established value. This must be shown by flight tests.

<R05>
Sec. 27.1041  General.

    (a) Each powerplant cooling system must be able to maintain the 
temperatures of powerplant components within the limits established for 
these components under critical surface (ground or water) and flight 
operating conditions for which certification is required and after

<R05>
Sec. 27.1043  Cooling tests.

    (a) General. For the tests prescribed in Sec. 27.1041(b), the 
following apply:
    (1) If the tests are conducted under conditions deviating from the 
maximum ambient atmospheric temperature specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section, the recorded powerplant temperatures must be corrected 
under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section unless a more rational 
correction method is applicable.
    (2) No corrected temperature determined under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section may exceed established limits.
    (3) For reciprocating engines, the fuel used during the cooling 
tests must be of the minimum grade approved for the engines, and the 
mixture settings must be those normally used in the flight stages for 
which the cooling tests are conducted.
    (4) The test procedures must be as prescribed in Sec. 27.1045.
    (b) Maximum ambient atmospheric temperature. A maximum ambient 
atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of at 
least 100 degrees F. must be established. The assumed temperature lapse 
rate is 3.6 degrees F. per thousand feet of altitude above sea level 
until a temperature of -69.7 degrees F. is reached, above which altitude 
the temperature is considered constant at -69.7 degrees F. However, for 
winterization installations, the applicant may select a maximum ambient 
atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of less 
than 100 degrees F.
    (c) Correction factor (except cylinder barrels). Unless a more 
rational correction applies, temperatures of engine fluids and power-
plant components (except cylinder barrels) for which temperature limits 
are established, must be corrected by adding to them the difference 
between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the temperature 
of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of the maximum 
component or fluid temperature recorded during the cooling test.
    (d) Correction factor for cylinder barrel temperatures. Cylinder 
barrel temperatures must be corrected by adding to them 0.7 times the 
difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the 
temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of 
the maximum cylinder barrel temperature recorded during the cooling 
test.

Sec. 27.1045  Cooling test procedures.

    (a) General. For each stage of flight, the cooling tests must be 
conducted with the rotorcraft--
    (1) In the configuration most critical for cooling; and
    (2) Under the conditions most critical for cooling.
    (b) Temperature stabilization. For the purpose of the cooling tests, 
a temperature is ``stabilized'' when its rate of change is less than two 
degrees F. per minute. The following component and engine fluid 
temperature stabilization rules apply:
    (1) For each rotorcraft, and for each stage of flight--
    (i) The temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from 
which entry is made into the stage of flight being investigated; or
    (ii) If the entry condition normally does not allow temperatures to 
stabilize, operation through the full entry condition must be conducted 
before entry into the stage of flight being investigated in order to 
allow the temperatures to attain their natural levels at the time of 
entry.
    (2) For each helicopter during the takeoff stage of flight, the 
climb at takeoff power must be preceded by a period of hover during 
which the temperatures are stabilized.
    (c) Duration of test. For each stage of flight the tests must be 
continued until--
    (1) The temperatures stabilize or 5 minutes after the occurrence of 
the highest temperature recorded, as appropriate to the test condition;
    (2) That stage of flight is completed; or
    (3) An operating limitation is reached.

must have drains that discharge fuel--
    (1) Clear of the rotorcraft; and
    (2) Out of the path of exhaust flames.
    (d) For turbine engine powered rotorcraft--
    (1) There must be means to prevent hazardous quantities of fuel 
leakage or overflow from drains, vents, or other components of flammable 
fluid systems from entering the engine intake system; and

percent of maximum continuous power--
    (1) Each rotorcraft with sea level engines using conventional 
venturi carburetors has a preheater that can provide a heat rise of 90 
degrees F.;
    (2) Each rotorcraft with sea level engines using carburetors tending 
to prevent icing has a sheltered alternate source of air, and that the 
preheat supplied to the alternate air intake is not less than that 
provided by the engine cooling air downstream of the cylinders;

that would adversely affect engine operation or cause a serious loss of 
power under the icing conditions specified in Appendix C of Part 29 of 
this chapter; and
    (ii) In snow, both falling and blowing, without adverse effect on 
engine operation, within the limitations established for the rotorcraft.
    (2) Each turbine engine must idle for 30 minutes on the ground, with 
the air bleed available for engine icing protection at its critical 
condition, without adverse effect, in an atmosphere that is at a 
temperature between 15 deg. and 30 deg. F (between -9 deg. and -1 deg. 
C) and has a liquid water content not less than 0.3 gram per cubic meter 
in the form of drops having a mean effective diameter not less than 20 
microns, followed by momentary operation at takeoff power or thrust. 
During the 30 minutes of idle operation, the engine may be run up 
periodically to a moderate power or thrust setting in a manner 
acceptable to the Administrator.
    (c) Supercharged reciprocating engines.  For each engine having 
superchargers to pressurize the air before it enters the carburetor, the 
heat rise in the air caused by that supercharging at any altitude may be 
utilized in determining compliance with paragraph (a) of this section if 
the heat rise utilized is that which will be available, automatically, 
for the applicable altitude and operating condition because of 
supercharging.

Sec. 27.1401  Anticollision light system.

    (a) General. If certification for night operation is requested, the 
rotorcraft must have an anticollision light system that--
    (1) Consists of one or more approved anticollision lights located so 
that their emitted light will not impair the crew's vision or detract 
from the conspicuity of the position lights; and
    (2) Meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section.
    (b) Field of coverage. The system must consist of enough lights to 
illuminate the vital areas around the rotorcraft, considering the 
physical configuration and flight characteristics of the rotorcraft. The 
field of coverage must extend in each direction within at least 30 
degrees below the horizontal plane of the rotorcraft, except that there 
may be solid angles of obstructed visibility totaling not more than 0.5 
steradians.
    (c) Flashing characteristics. The arrangement of the system, that 
is, the number of light sources, beam width, speed of rotation, and 
other characteristics, must give an effective flash frequency of not 
less than 40, nor more than 100, cycles per minute. The effective flash 
frequency is the frequency at which the rotorcraft's complete 
anticollision light system is observed from a distance, and applies to 
each sector of light including any overlaps that exist when the system 
consists of more than one light source. In overlaps, flash frequencies 
may exceed 100, but not 180, cycles per minute.
    (d) Color. Each anticollision light must be aviation red and must 
meet the applicable requirements of Sec. 27.1397.

plane, measured with the red filter (if used) and expressed in terms of 
``effective'' intensities, must meet the requirements of paragraph (f) 
of this section. The following relation must be assumed:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.086

where:

I<INF>e</INF>=effective intensity (candles).
I(t)=instantaneous intensity as a function of time.
t<INF>2</INF>-t<INF>1</INF>=flash time interval (seconds).

Normally, the maximum value of effective intensity is obtained when 
t<INF>2</INF> and t<INF>1</INF>  are chosen so that the effective 
intensity is equal to the instantaneous intensity at t<INF>2</INF> and 
t<INF>1</INF>. 
    (f) Minimum effective intensities for anticollision light. Each 
anticollision light effective intensity must equal or exceed the 
applicable values in the following table:

Appendix B to Part 27--Airworthiness Criteria for Helicopter Instrument 
                                 Flight

    I. General. A normal category helicopter may not be type 
certificated for operation under the instrument flight rules (IFR) of 
this chapter unless it meets the design and installation requirements 
contained in this appendix.
    II. Definitions. (a) V<INF>YI</INF> means instrument climb speed, 
utilized instead of V<INF>Y</INF> for compliance with the climb 
requirements for instrument flight.
    (b) V<INF>NEI</INF> means instrument flight never exceed speed, 
utilized instead of V<INF>NE</INF> for compliance with maximum limit 
speed requirements for instrument flight.
    (c) V<INF>MINI</INF> means instrument flight minimum speed, utilized 
in complying with minimum limit speed requirements for instrument 
flight.
    III. Trim. It must be possible to trim the cyclic, collective, and 
directional control forces to zero at all approved IFR airspeeds, power 
settings, and configurations appropriate to the type.
    IV. Static longitudinal stability. (a) General. The helicopter must 
possess positive static longitudinal control force stability at critical 
combinations of weight and center of gravity at the conditions specified 
in paragraph IV (b) or (c) of this appendix, as appropriate. The stick 
force must vary with speed so that any substantial speed change results 
in a stick force clearly perceptible to the pilot. For single-pilot 
approval, the airspeed must return to within 10 percent of the trim 
speed when the control force is slowly released for each trim condition 
specified in paragraph IV(b) of the this appendix.
    (b) For single-pilot approval:
    (1) Climb. Stability must be shown in climb throughout the speed 
range 20 knots either side of trim with--
    (i) The helicopter trimmed at V<INF>YI</INF>;
    (ii) Landing gear retracted (if retractable); and
    (iii) Power required for limit climb rate (at least 1,000 fpm) at 
V<INF>YI</INF> or maximum continuous power, whichever is less.
    (2) Cruise. Stability must be shown throughout the speed range from 
0.7 to 1.1 V<INF>H</INF> or V<INF>NEI</INF>, whichever is lower, not to 
exceed <plus-minus>20 knots from trim with--
    (i) The helicopter trimmed and power adjusted for level flight at 
0.9 V<INF>H</INF> or 0.9 V<INF>NEI,</INF> whichever is lower; and
    (ii) Landing gear retracted (if retractable).
    (3) Slow cruise. Stability must be shown throughout the speed range 
from 0.9 V<INF>MINI</INF> to 1.3 V<INF>MINI</INF> or 20 knots above trim 
speed, whichever is greater, with--
    (i) the helicopter trimmed and power adjusted for level flight at 
1.1 V<INF>MINI</INF>; and
    (ii) Landing gear retracted (if retractable).
    (4) Descent. Stability must be shown throughout the speed range 20 
knots either side of trim with--
    (i) The helicopter trimmed at 0.8 V<INF>H</INF> or 0.8 
V<INF>NEI</INF> (or 0.8 V<INF>LE</INF> for the landing gear extended 
case), whichever is lower;
    (ii) Power required for 1,000 fpm descent at trim speed; and
    (iii) Landing gear extended and retracted, if applicable.
    (5) Approach. Stability must be shown throughout the speed range 
from 0.7 times the minimum recommended approach speed to 20 knots above 
the maximum recommended approach speed with--
    (i) The helicopter trimmed at the recommended approach speed or 
speeds;
    (ii) Landing gear extended and retracted, if applicable; and
    (iii) Power required to maintain a 3 deg. glide path and power 
required to maintain the

[[Page 596]]

steepest approach gradient for which approval is requested.
    (c) Helicopters approved for a minimum crew of two pilots must 
comply with the provisions of paragraphs IV(b)(2) and IV(b)(5) of this 
appendix.
    V. Static lateral-directional stability. (a) Static directional 
stability must be positive throughout the approved ranges of airspeed, 
power, and vertical speed. In straight, steady sideslips up to 
<plus-minus>10 deg. from trim, directional control position must 
increase in approximately constant proportion to angle of sideslip. At 
greater angles up to the maximum sideslip angle appropriate to the type, 
increased directional control position must produce increased angle of 
sideslip.
    (b) During sideslips up to <plus-minus>10 deg. from trim throughout 
the approved ranges of airspeed, power, and vertical speed, there must 
be no negative dihedral stability perceptible to the pilot through 
lateral control motion or force. Longitudinal cyclic movement with 
sideslip must not be excessive.
    VI. Dynamic stability. (a) For single-pilot approval--
    (1) Any oscillation having a period of less than 5 seconds must damp 
to \1/2\ amplitude in not more than one cycle.
    (2) Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less 
than 10 seconds must damp to \1/2\ amplitude in not more than two 
cycles.
    (3) Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more but less 
than 20 seconds must be damped.
    (4) Any oscillation having a period of 20 seconds or more may not 
achieve double amplitude in less than 20 seconds.
    (5) Any aperiodic response may not achieve double amplitude in less 
than 6 seconds.
    (b) For helicopters approved with a minimum crew of two pilots--
    (1) Any oscillation having a period of less than 5 seconds must damp 
to \1/2\ amplitude in not more than two cycles.
    (2) Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less 
than 10 seconds must be damped.
    (3) Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more may not 
achieve double amplitude in less than 10 seconds.
    VII. Stability augmentation system (SAS). (a) If a SAS is used, the 
reliability of the SAS must be related to the effects of its failure. 
The occurrence of any failure condition which would prevent continued 
safe flight and landing must be extremely improbable. For any failure 
condition of the SAS which is not shown to be extremely improbable--
    (1) The helicopter must be safely controllable and capable of 
prolonged instrument flight without undue pilot effort. Additional 
unrelated probable failures affecting the control system must be 
considered; and
    (2) The flight characteristics requirements in Subpart B of Part 27 
must be met throughout a practical flight envelope.
    (b) The SAS must be designed so that it cannot create a hazardous 
deviation in flight path or produce hazardous loads on the helicopter 
during normal operation or in the event of malfunction or failure, 
assuming corrective action begins within an appropriate period of time. 
Where multiple systems are installed, subsequent malfunction conditions 
must be considered in sequence unless their occurrence is shown to be 
improbable.
    VIII. Equipment, systems, and installation. The basic equipment and 
installation must comply with Secs. 29.1303, 29.1431, and 29.1433 
through Amendment 29-14, with the following exceptions and additions:
    (a) Flight and Navigation Instruments. (1) A magnetic gyro-stablized 
direction indicator instead of a gyroscopic direction indicator required 
by Sec. 29.1303(h); and
    (2) A standby attitude indicator which meets the requirements of 
Secs. 29.1303(g)(1) through (7) instead of a rate-of-turn indicator 
required by Sec. 29.1303(g). For two-pilot configurations, one pilot's 
primary indicator may be designated for this purpose. If standby 
batteries are provided, they may be charged from the aircraft electrical 
system if adequate isolation is incorporated.
    (b) Miscellaneous requirements. (1) Instrument systems and other 
systems essential for IFR flight that could be adversely affected by 
icing must be adequately protected when exposed to the continuous and 
intermittent maximum icing conditions defined in Appendix C of Part 29 
of this chapter, whether or not the rotorcraft is certificated for 
operation in icing conditions.
    (2) There must be means in the generating system to automatically 
de-energize and disconnect from the main bus any power source developing 
hazardous overvoltage.
    (3) Each required flight instrument using a power supply (electric, 
vacuum, etc.) must have a visual means integral with the instrument to 
indicate the adequacy of the power being supplied.
    (4) When multiple systems performing like functions are required, 
each system must be grouped, routed, and spaced so that physical 
separation between systems is provided to ensure that a single 
malfunction will not adversely affect more than one system.
    (5) For systems that operate the required flight instruments at each 
pilot's station--
    (i) Only the required flight instruments for the first pilot may be 
connected to that operating system;
    (ii) Additional instruments, systems, or equipment may not be 
connected to an operating system for a second pilot unless provisions 
are made to ensure the continued normal functioning of the required

    (b) Each occupant must be protected from serious head injury by a 
safety belt plus a shoulder harness that will prevent the head from 
contacting any injurious object.
    (c) The safety belt and shoulder harness must meet the static and 
dynamic strength requirements, if applicable, specified by the 
rotorcraft type certification basis.
    (d) For purposes of this section, the date of manufacture is 
either--
    (1) The date the inspection acceptance records, or equivalent, 
reflect that the rotorcraft is complete and meets the FAA-Approved Type

<R05>
Sec. 29.25  Weight limits.

    (a) Maximum weight. The maximum weight (the highest weight at which 
compliance with each applicable requirement of this part is shown) or, 
at the option of the applicant, the highest weight for each altitude and 
for each practicably separable operating condition, such as takeoff, 
enroute operation, and landing, must be established so that it is not 
more than--

    (2) The design minimum weight (the lowest weight at which compliance 
with each structural loading condition of this part is shown); or
    (3) The lowest weight at which compliance with each applicable 
flight requirement of this part is shown.
    (c) Total weight with jettisonable external load. A total weight for 
the rotorcraft with jettisonable external load attached that is greater 
than the maximum weight established under paragraph (a) of this section 
may be established if structural component approval for external load 
operations

[[Page 603]]

under Part 133 of this chapter is requested and the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The portion of the total weight that is greater than the maximum

of the weight of all or part of the jettisonable external load.
    (2) Structural components of the rotorcraft are shown to comply with 
the applicable structural requirements of this part under the increased 
loads and stresses caused by the weight increase over that established 
under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) Operation of the rotorcraft at a total weight greater than the 
maximum certificated weight established under paragraph (a) of this 
section is limited by appropriate operating limitations to rotorcraft 
external load operations under Part 133 of this chapter.

with--
    (1) Fixed ballast;
    (2) Unusable fuel; and
    (3) Full operating fluids, including--
    (i) Oil;

    Removable ballast may be used in showing compliance with the flight 
requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 29.33  Main rotor speed and pitch limits.

    (a) Main rotor speed limits. A range of main rotor speeds must be 
established that--
    (1) With power on, provides adequate margin to accommodate the 
variations in rotor speed occurring in any appropriate maneuver, and is 
consistent with the kind of governor or synchronizer used; and
    (2) With power off, allows each appropriate autorotative maneuver to 
be performed throughout the ranges of airspeed and weight for which 
certification is requested.
    (b) Normal main rotor high pitch limit (power on). For rotorcraft, 
except helicopters required to have a main rotor low speed warning under 
paragraph (e) of this section, it must be shown, with power on and 
without exceeding approved engine maximum limitations, that main rotor 
speeds substantially less than the minimum approved main rotor speed 
will not occur under any sustained flight condition. This must be met 
by--
    (1) Appropriate setting of the main rotor high pitch stop;
    (2) Inherent rotorcraft characteristics that make unsafe low main 
rotor speeds unlikely; or
    (3) Adequate means to warn the pilot of unsafe main rotor speeds.
    (c) Normal main rotor low pitch limit (power off). It must be shown, 
with power off, that--

[[Page 604]]

    (1) The normal main rotor low pitch limit provides sufficient rotor 
speed, in any autorotative condition, under the most critical 
combinations of weight and airspeed; and
    (2) It is possible to prevent overspeeding of the rotor without 
exceptional piloting skill.
    (d) Emergency high pitch. If the main rotor high pitch stop is set 
to meet paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and if that stop cannot be 
exceeded inadvertently, additional pitch may be made available for 
emergency use.
    (e) Main rotor low speed warning for helicopters. For each single 
engine helicopter, and each multiengine helicopter that does not have an 
approved device that automatically increases power on the operating 
engines when one engine fails, there must be a main rotor low speed 
warning which meets the following requirements:
    (1) The warning must be furnished to the pilot in all flight 
conditions, including power-on and power-off flight, when the speed of a 
main rotor approaches a value that can jeopardize safe flight.
    (2) The warning may be furnished either through the inherent 
aerodynamic qualities of the helicopter or by a device.
    (3) The warning must be clear and distinct under all conditions, and 
must be clearly distinguishable from all other warnings. A visual device 
that requires the attention of the crew within the cockpit is not 
acceptable by itself.
    (4) If a warning device is used, the device must automatically 
deactivate and reset when the low-speed condition is corrected. If the 
device has an audible warning, it must also be equipped with a means for 
the pilot to manually silence the audible warning before the low-speed 
condition is corrected.

must be shown--
    (1) For still air at sea level with a standard atmosphere and;

    (c) The available power must correspond to engine power, not 
exceeding the approved power, less--
    (1) Installation losses; and
    (2) The power absorbed by the accessories and services at the values 
for which certification is requested and approved.
    (d) For reciprocating engine-powered rotorcraft, the performance, as 
affected by engine power, must be based on a relative humidity of 80 
percent in a standard atmosphere.
    (e) For turbine engine-powered rotorcraft, the performance, as 
affected by engine power, must be based on a relative humidity of--
    (1) 80 percent, at and below standard temperature; and
    (2) 34 percent, at and above standard temperature plus 50 deg. F.

Between these two temperatures, the relative humidity must vary 
linearly.
    (f) For turbine-engine-power rotorcraft, a means must be provided to 
permit the pilot to detemine prior to takeoff that each engine is 
capable of developing the power necessary to achieve the applicable 
rotorcraft performance prescribed in this subpart.

multiplied by prescribed factors of safety). Unless otherwise provided, 
prescribed loads are limit loads.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided, the specified air, ground, and water 
loads must be placed in equilibrium with inertia forces, considering 
each item of mass in the rotorcraft. These loads must be distributed to 
closely approximate or conservatively represent actual conditions.

this subpart must be shown for each critical loading condition 
accounting for the environment to which the structure will be exposed in 
operation. Structural analysis (static or fatigue) may be used only if 
the structure conforms

[[Page 613]]

to those structures for which experience has shown this method to be 
reliable. In other cases, substantiating load tests must be made.
    (b) Proof of compliance with the strength requirements of this 
subpart must include--
    (1) Dynamic and endurance tests of rotors, rotor drives, and rotor 
controls;
    (2) Limit load tests of the control system, including control 
surfaces;
    (3) Operation tests of the control system;
    (4) Flight stress measurement tests;
    (5) Landing gear drop tests; and

on and power-off flight with the maximum design rotor tip speed ratio. 
The rotor tip speed ratio is the ratio of the rotorcraft flight velocity 
component in the plane of the rotor disc to the rotational tip speed of 
the rotor blades, and is expressed as follows:

[[Page 615]]

    (1) The system must withstand loads resulting from the limit pilot 
forces prescribed in Sec. 29.397;
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3) of this section, when power-

must also withstand the loads resulting from the limit pilot forces 
prescribed in Sec. 29.397 in conjunction with the forces output of each

opposite directions.
    (c) For empennage arrangements where the horizontal tail surfaces

and supporting structure must be designed for the combined vertical and 
horizontal surface loads resulting from each prescribed flight 
condition, considered separately. The flight conditions must be selected

<R05>
Sec. 29.519  Hull type rotorcraft: Water-based and amphibian.

    (a) General. For hull type rotorcraft, the structure must be 
designed to withstand the water loading set forth in paragraphs (b), 
(c), and (d) of this section considering the most severe wave heights 
and profiles for which approval is desired. The loads for the landing 
conditions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be developed 
and distributed along and among the hull and auxiliary floats, if used, 
in a rational and conservative manner, assuming a rotor lift not 
exceeding two-thirds of the rotorcraft weight to act throughout the 
landing impact.
    (b) Vertical landing conditions. The rotorcraft must initially 
contact the most critical wave surface at zero forward speed in likely 
pitch and roll attitudes which result in critical design loadings. The 
vertical descent velocity may not be less than 6.5 feet per second 
relative to the mean water surface.
    (c) Forward speed landing conditions. The rotorcraft must contact 
the most critical wave at forward velocities from zero up to 30 knots in 
likely pitch, roll, and yaw attitudes and with a vertical descent 
velocity of not less than 6.5 feet per second relative to the mean water 
surface. A maximum forward velocity of less than 30 knots may be used in 
design if it can be demonstrated that the forward velocity selected 
would not be exceeded in a normal one-engine-out landing.
    (d) Auxiliary float immersion condition.  In addition to the loads 
from the landing conditions, the auxiliary float, and its support and 
attaching structure in the hull, must be designed for the load developed 
by a fully immersed float unless it can be shown that full immersion of 
the float is unlikely, in which case the highest likely float buoyancy 
load must be applied that considers loading of the float immersed to 
create restoring moments compensating for upsetting moments caused by 
side wind, asymmetrical rotorcraft loading, water wave action, and 
rotorcraft inertia.

    If certification for float operation (including float amphibian 
operation) is requested, the rotorcraft, with floats, must be designed 
to withstand the following loading conditions (where the limit load 
factor is determined under Sec. 29.473(b) or assumed to be equal to that 
determined for wheel landing gear):
    (a) Up-load conditions in which--
    (1) A load is applied so that, with the rotorcraft in the static 
level attitude, the resultant water reaction passes vertically through 
the center of gravity; and
    (2) The vertical load prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
is applied simultaneously with an aft component of 0.25 times the 
vertical component
    (b) A side load condition in which--
    (1) A vertical load of 0.75 times the total vertical load specified 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is divided equally among the floats; 
and
    (2) For each float, the load share determined under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, combined with a total side load of 0.25 times the total 
vertical load specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is applied 
to that float only.

Sec. 29.562  Emergency landing dynamic conditions.

    (a) The rotorcraft, although it may be damaged in a crash landing,

    (1) The occupant properly uses the seats, safety belts, and shoulder 
harnesses provided in the design; and
    (2) The occupant is exposed to loads equivalent to those resulting

second when the seat or other seating device is oriented in its nominal 
position with respect to the rotorcraft's reference system, the 
rotorcraft's longitudinal axis is canted upward 60 deg. with respect to 
the impact velocity vector, and the rotorcraft's lateral axis is 
perpendicular to a vertical plane containing the impact velocity vector 
and the rotorcraft's longitudinal axis. Peak floor deceleration must

when the seat or other seating device is oriented in its nominal 
position with respect to the rotorcraft's reference system, the 
rotorcraft's longitudinal axis is yawed 10 deg. either right or left of

the shoulder harness), the rotorcraft's lateral axis is contained in a 
horizontal plane containing the impact velocity vector, and the 
rotorcraft's vertical axis is perpendicular to a horizontal plane 
containing the impact velocity vector. Peak floor deceleration must 
occur in not more than 0.071 seconds after impact and must reach a 
minimum of 18.4g's.
    (3) Where floor rails or floor or sidewall floor attachment devices

conditions of this section, the rails or devices must

[[Page 623]]

be misaligned with respect to each other by at least 10 deg. vertically 
(i.e., pitch out of parallel) and by at least a 10 deg. lateral roll, 
with the directions optional, to account for possible floor warp.
    (c) Compliance with the following must be shown:
    (1) The seating device system must remain intact although it may 
experience separation intended as part of its design.
    (2) The attachment between the seating device and the airframe 
structure must remain intact although the structure may have exceeded 
its limit load.
    (3) The ATD's shoulder harness strap or straps must remain on or in 
the immediate vicinity of the ATD's shoulder during the impact.
    (4) The safety belt must remain on the ATD's pelvis during the 
impact.
    (5) The ATD's head either does not contact any portion of the crew 
or passenger compartment or, if contact is made, the head impact does 
not exceed a head injury criteria (HIC) of 1,000 as determined by this 
equation.

1,750 pounds. If dual straps are used for retaining the upper torso, the 
total harness strap loads must not exceed 2,000 pounds.
    (7) The maximum compressive load measured between the pelvis and the 
lumbar column of the ATD must not exceed 1,500 pounds.

Sec. 29.563  Structural ditching provisions.

    If certification with ditching provisions is requested, structural 
strength for ditching must meet the requirements of this section and 
Sec. 29.801(e).
    (a) Forward speed landing conditions. The rotorcraft must initially 
contact the most critical wave for reasonably probable water conditions 
at forward velocities from zero up to 30 knots in likely pitch, roll, 
and yaw attitudes. The rotorcraft limit vertical descent velocity may 
not be less than 5 feet per second relative to the mean water surface. 
Rotor lift may be used to act through the center of gravity throughout 
the landing impact. This lift may not exceed two-thirds of the design 
maximum weight. A maximum forward velocity of less than 30 knots may be 
used in design if it can be demonstrated that the forward velocity 
selected would not be exceeded in a normal one-engine-out touchdown.
    (b) Auxiliary or emergency float conditions--(1) Floats fixed or 
deployed before initial water contact. In addition to the landing loads 
in paragraph (a) of this section, each auxiliary or emergency float, or 
its support and attaching structure in the airframe or fuselage, must be 
designed for the load developed by a fully immersed float unless it can 
be shown that full immersion is unlikely. If full immersion is unlikely, 
the highest likely float buoyancy load must be applied. The highest 
likely buoyancy load must include consideration of a partially immersed 
float creating restoring moments to compensate the upsetting moments 
caused by side wind, unsymmetrical rotorcraft loading, water wave 
action, rotorcraft inertia, and probable structural damage and leakage 
considered under Sec. 29.801(d). Maximum roll and pitch angles 
determined from compliance with Sec. 29.801(d) may be used, if 
significant, to determine the extent of immersion of each float. If the 
floats are deployed in flight, appropriate air loads derived from the 
flight limitations with the floats deployed shall be used in 
substantiation of the floats and their attachment to the rotorcraft. For 
this purpose, the design airspeed for limit load is the float deployed 
airspeed operating limit multiplied by 1.11.

[[Page 624]]

    (2) Floats deployed after initial water contact. Each float must be 
designed for full or partial immersion prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section. In addition, each float must be designed for combined 
vertical and drag loads using a relative limit speed of 20 knots between 
the rotorcraft and the water. The vertical load may not be less than the 
highest likely buoyancy load determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.

                           Fatigue Evaluation


<R05>
Sec. 29.571  Fatigue evaluation of structure.

    (a) General. An evaluation of the strength of principal elements, 
detail design points, and fabrication techniques must show that 
catastrophic failure due to fatigue, considering the effects of 
environment, intrinsic/discrete flaws, or accidental damage will be 
avoided. Parts to be evaluated include, but are not limited to, rotors, 
rotor drive systems between the engines and rotor hubs, controls, 
fuselage, fixed and movable control surfaces, engine and transmission 
mountings, landing gear, and their related primary attachments. In 
addition, the following apply:
    (1) Each evaluation required by this section must include--
    (i) The identification of principal structural elements, the failure 
of which could result in catastrophic failure of the rotorcraft;
    (ii) In-flight measurement in determining the loads or stresses for 
items in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section in all critical conditions 
throughout the range of limitations in Sec. 29.309 (including altitude 
effects), except that maneuvering load factors need not exceed the 
maximum values expected in operations; and
    (iii) Loading spectra as severe as those expected in operation based 
on loads or stresses determined under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section, including external load operations, if applicable, and other 
high frequency power cycle operations.
    (2) Based on the evaluations required by this section, inspections, 
replacement times, combinations thereof, or other procedures must be 
established as necessary to avoid catastrophic failure. These 
inspections, replacement times, combinations thereof, or other 
procedures must be included in the airworthiness limitations section of 
the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by Sec. 29.1529 
and section A29.4 of Appendix A of this part.
    (b) Fatigue tolerance evaluation (including tolerance to flaws). The 
structure must be shown by analysis supported by test evidence and, if 
available, service experience to be of fatigue tolerant design. The 
fatigue tolerance evaluation must include the requirements of either 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, or a combination thereof, 
and also must include a determination of the probable locations and 
modes of damage caused by fatigue, considering environmental effects, 
intrinsic/discrete flaws, or accidental damage. Compliance with the flaw 
tolerance requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section is 
required unless the applicant establishes that these fatigue flaw 
tolerant methods for a particular structure cannot be achieved within 
the limitations of geometry, inspectability, or good design practice. 
Under these circumstances, the safe-life evaluation of paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section is required.
    (1) Flaw tolerant safe-life evaluation. It must be shown that the 
structure, with flaws present, is able to withstand repeated loads of 
variable magnitude without detectable flaw growth for the following time 
intervals--
    (i) Life of the rotorcraft; or
    (ii) Within a replacement time furnished under section A29.4 of 
appendix A to this part.
    (2) Fail-safe (residual strength after flaw growth) evaluation. It 
must be shown that the structure remaining after a partial failure is 
able to withstand design limit loads without failure within an 
inspection period furnished under section A29.4 of appendix A to this 
part. Limit loads are defined in Sec. 29.301(a).
    (i) The residual strength evaluation must show that the remaining 
structure after flaw growth is able to withstand design limit loads 
without failure within its operational life.

[[Page 625]]

    (ii) Inspection intervals and methods must be established as 
necessary to ensure that failures are detected prior to residual 
strength conditions being reached.
    (iii) If significant changes in structural stiffness or geometry, or 
both, follow from a structural failure or partial failure, the effect on 
flaw tolerance must be further investigated.
    (3) Safe-life evaluation. It must be shown that the structure is 
able to withstand repeated loads of variable magnitude without 
detectable cracks for the following time intervals--
    (i) Life of the rotorcraft; or
    (ii) Within a replacement time furnished under section A29.4 of 
appendix A to this part.

must minimize the probability of disastrous fatigue failure, 
particularly at points of stress concentration.

floats, if used, must have enough watertight compartments so that, with 
any single compartment of the hull or auxiliary floats flooded, the 
buoyancy of the hull and auxiliary floats, and wheel tires if used, 
provides a margin of positive water stability great enough to minimize 
the probability of capsizing the rotorcraft for the worst combination of 
wave heights and surface winds for which approval is desired.

Sec. 29.783  Doors.

    (a) Each closed cabin must have at least one adequate and easily 
accessible external door.
    (b) Each external door must be located, and appropriate operating 
procedures must be established, to ensure that persons using the door 
will not be endangered by the rotors, propellers, engine intakes, and 
exhausts when the operating procedures are used.
    (c) There must be means for locking crew and external passenger 
doors and for preventing their opening in flight inadvertently or as a 
result of mechanical failure. It must be possible to open external doors 
from inside and outside the cabin with the rotorcraft on the ground even 
though persons may be crowded against the door on the inside of the 
rotorcraft. The means of opening must be simple and obvious and so 
arranged and marked that it can be readily located and operated.
    (d) There must be reasonable provisions to prevent the jamming of 
any external doors in a minor crash as a result of fuselage deformation 
under the following ultimate inertial forces except for cargo or service 
doors not suitable for use as an exit in an emergency:

(1) Upward--1.5g.
(2) Forward--4.0g.
(3) Sideward--2.0g.
(4) Downward--4.0g.
    (e) There must be means for direct visual inspection of the locking 
mechanism by crewmembers to determine whether the external doors 
(including passenger, crew, service, and cargo doors) are fully locked. 
There must be visual means to signal to appropriate crewmembers when 
normally used external doors are closed and fully locked.
    (f) For outward opening external doors usable for entrance or 
egress, there must be an auxiliary safety latching device to prevent the 
door from opening when the primary latching mechanism fails. If the door 
does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section with 
this device in place, suitable operating procedures must be established 
to prevent the use of the device during takeoff and landing.
    (g) If an integral stair is installed in a passenger entry door that 
is qualified as a passenger emergency exit, the stair must be designed 
so that under the following conditions the effectiveness of passenger 
emergency egress will not be impaired:
    (1) The door, integral stair, and operating mechanism have been 
subjected to the inertial forces specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section, acting separately relative to the surrounding structure.
    (2) The rotorcraft is in the normal ground attitude and in each of 
the attitudes corresponding to collapse of one or more legs, or primary 
members, as applicable, of the landing gear.
    (h) Nonjettisonable doors used as ditching emergency exits must have 
means to enable them to be secured in the open position and remain 
secure for emergency egress in sea state conditions prescribed for 
ditching.

<R05>
Sec. 29.785  Seats, safety belts, and harnesses.

    (a) Each seat, safety belt, harness, and adjacent part of the 
rotorcraft at each station designated for occupancy during takeoff and 
landing must be free of potentially injurious objects, sharp edges, 
protuberances, and hard surfaces and must be designed so that a person 
making proper use of these facilities will not suffer serious injury in 
an emergency landing as a result of the inertial factors specified in 
Sec. 29.561(b) and dynamic conditions specified in Sec. 29.562.
    (b) Each occupant must be protected from serious head injury by a 
safety belt plus a shoulder harness that will prevent the head from 
contacting any injurious object, except as provided for in 
Sec. 29.562(c)(5). A shoulder harness (upper torso restraint), in 
combination with the safety belt, constitutes a torso restraint system 
as described in TSO-C114.

[[Page 636]]

    (c) Each occupant's seat must have a combined safety belt and 
shoulder harness with a single-point release. Each pilot's combined 
safety belt and shoulder harness must allow each pilot when seated with 
safety belt and shoulder harness fastened to perform all functions 
necessary for flight operations. There must be a means to secure belt 
and harness when not in use to prevent interference with the operation 
of the rotorcraft and with rapid egress in an emergency.
    (d) If seat backs do not have a firm handhold, there must be hand 
grips or rails along each aisle to let the occupants steady themselves 
while using the aisle in moderately rough air.
    (e) Each projecting object that would injure persons seated or 
moving about in the rotorcraft in normal flight must be padded.
    (f) Each seat and its supporting structure must be designed for an 
occupant weight of at least 170 pounds, considering the maximum load 
factors, inertial forces, and reactions between the occupant, seat, and 
safety belt or harness corresponding with the applicable flight and 
ground-load conditions, including the emergency landing conditions of 
Sec. 29.561(b). In addition--
    (1) Each pilot seat must be designed for the reactions resulting 
from the application of the pilot forces prescribed in Sec. 29.397; and
    (2) The inertial forces prescribed in Sec. 29.561(b) must be 
multiplied by a factor of 1.33 in determining the strength of the 
attachment of--
    (i) Each seat to the structure; and
    (ii) Each safety belt or harness to the seat or structure.
    (g) When the safety belt and shoulder harness are combined, the 
rated strength of the safety belt and shoulder harness may not be less 
than that corresponding to the inertial forces specified in 
Sec. 29.561(b), considering the occupant weight of at least 170 pounds, 
considering the dimensional characteristics of the restraint system 
installation, and using a distribution of at least a 60-percent load to 
the safety belt and at least a 40-percent load to the shoulder harness. 
If the safety belt is capable of being used without the shoulder 
harness, the inertial forces specified must be met by the safety belt 
alone.
    (h) When a headrest is used, the headrest and its supporting 
structure must be designed to resist the inertia forces specified in 
Sec. 29.561, with a 1.33 fitting factor and a head weight of at least 13 
pounds.
    (i) Each seating device system includes the device such as the seat, 
the cushions, the occupant restraint system and attachment devices.
    (j) Each seating device system may use design features such as 
crushing or separation of certain parts of the seat in the design to 
reduce occupant loads for the emergency landing dynamic conditions of 
Sec. 29.562; otherwise, the system must remain intact and must not 
interfere with rapid evacuation of the rotorcraft.
    (k) For purposes of this section, a litter is defined as a device 
designed to carry a nonambulatory person, primarily in a recumbent 
position, into and on the rotorcraft. Each berth or litter must be 
designed to withstand the load reaction of an occupant weight of at 
least 170 pounds when the occupant is subjected to the forward inertial 
factors specified in Sec. 29.561(b). A berth or litter installed within 
15 deg. or less of the longitudinal axis of the rotorcraft must be 
provided with a padded end-board, cloth diaphragm, or equivalent means 
that can withstand the forward load reaction. A berth or litter oriented 
greater than 15 deg. with the longitudinal axis of the rotorcraft must 
be equipped with appropriate restraints, such as straps or safety belts, 
to withstand the forward reaction. In addition--
    (1) The berth or litter must have a restraint system and must not 
have corners or other protuberances likely to cause serious injury to a 
person occupying it during emergency landing conditions; and
    (2) The berth or litter attachment and the occupant restraint system 
attachments to the structure must be designed to withstand the critical 
loads resulting from flight and ground load conditions and from the 
conditions prescribed in Sec. 29.561(b).

<R05>
Sec. 29.787  Cargo and baggage compartments.

    (a) Each cargo and baggage compartment must be designed for its 
placarded maximum weight of contents and for the critical load 
distributions at the appropriate maximum load factors corresponding to 
the specified flight and ground load conditions, except the emergency 
landing conditions of Sec. 29.561.
    (b) There must be means to prevent the contents of any compartment 
from becoming a hazard by shifting under the loads specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Under the emergency landing conditions of Sec. 29.561, cargo and 
baggage compartments must--
    (1) Be positioned so that if the contents break loose they are 
unlikely to cause injury to the occupants or restrict any of the escape 
facilities provided for use after an emergency landing; or
    (2) Have sufficient strength to withstand the conditions specified 
in Sec. 29.561, including the means of restraint and their attachments 
required by paragraph (b) of this section. Sufficient strength must be 
provided for the maximum authorized weight of cargo and baggage at the 
critical loading distribution.
    (d) If cargo compartment lamps are installed, each lamp must be 
installed so as to prevent contact between lamp bulb and cargo.

Sec. 29.801  Ditching.

    (a) If certification with ditching provisions is requested, the 
rotorcraft must meet the requirements of this section and 
Secs. 29.807(d), 29.1411 and 29.1415.
    (b) Each practicable design measure, compatible with the general 
characteristics of the rotorcraft, must be taken to minimize the 
probability that in an emergency landing on water, the behavior of the 
rotorcraft would cause immediate injury to the occupants or would make 
it impossible for them to escape.
    (c) The probable behavior of the rotorcraft in a water landing must 
be investigated by model tests or by comparison with rotorcraft of 
similar configuration for which the ditching characteristics are known. 
Scoops, flaps, projections, and any other factors likely to affect the 
hydrodynamic characteristics of the rotorcraft must be considered.
    (d) It must be shown that, under reasonably probable water 
conditions, the flotation time and trim of the rotorcraft will allow the 
occupants to leave the rotorcraft and enter the liferafts required by 
Sec. 29.1415. If compliance with this provision is shown by bouyancy and 
trim computations, appropriate allowances must be made for probable 
structural damage and leakage. If the rotorcraft has fuel tanks (with 
fuel jettisoning provisions) that can reasonably be expected to 
withstand a ditching without leakage, the jettisonable volume of fuel 
may be considered as bouyancy volume.
    (e) Unless the effects of the collapse of external doors and windows 
are accounted for in the investigation of the probable behavior of the 
rotorcraft in a water landing (as prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) 
of this section), the external doors and windows must be designed to 
withstand the probable maximum local pressures.

evacuation in a crash landing, with the landing gear (1) extended and 
(2) retracted, considering the possibility of fire.
    (b) Passenger entrance, crew, and service doors may be considered as 
emergency exits if they meet the requirements of this section and of 
Secs. 29.805 through 29.815.
    (c)  [Reserved]
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
following categories of rotorcraft must be tested in accordance with the

seating capacity, including the crewmembers required by the operating 
rules, can be evacuated from the rotorcraft to the ground within 90 
seconds:
    (1) Rotorcraft with a seating capacity of more than 44 passengers.

[[Page 638]]

Sec. 29.807(b).
    (ii) No main aisle, as described in Sec. 29.815, for each row of 
passenger seats.
    (iii) Access to each passenger exit for each passenger by virtue of 
design features of seats, such as folding or break-over seat backs or 
folding seats.
    (e) A combination of analysis and tests may be used to show that the 
rotorcraft is capable of being evacuated within 90 seconds under the 
conditions specified in Sec. 29.803(d) if the Administrator finds that 
the combination of analysis and tests will provide data, with respect to 
the emergency evacuation capability of the rotorcraft, equivalent to 
that which would be obtained by actual demonstration.

crew area.
    (b) Each flight crew emergency exit must be of sufficient size and 
must be located so as to allow rapid evacuation of the flight crew. This 
must be shown by test.
    (c) Each exit must not be obstructed by water or flotation devices 
after a ditching. This must be shown by test, demonstration, or 
analysis.

Sec. 29.807  Passenger emergency exits.

    (a) Type. For the purpose of this part, the types of passenger 
emergency exit are as follows:
    (1) Type I. This type must have a rectangular opening of not less 
than 24 inches wide by 48 inches high, with corner radii not greater 
than one-third the width of the exit, in the passenger area in the side 
of the fuselage at floor level and as far away as practicable from areas 
that might become potential fire hazards in a crash.
    (2) Type II. This type is the same as Type I, except that the 
opening must be at least 20 inches wide by 44 inches high.
    (3) Type III. This type is the same as Type I, except that--
    (i) The opening must be at least 20 inches wide by 36 inches high; 
and
    (ii) The exits need not be at floor level.
    (4) Type IV. This type must have a rectangular opening of not less 
than 19 inches wide by 26 inches high, with corner radii not greater 
than one-third the width of the exit, in the side of the fuselage with a 
step-up inside the rotorcraft of not more than 29 inches.

Openings with dimensions larger than those specified in this section may 
be used, regardless of shape, if the base of the opening has a flat 
surface of not less than the specified width.
    (b) Passenger emergency exits; side-of-fuselage.  Emergency exits 
must be accessible to the passengers and, except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section, must be provided in accordance with the 
following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       Emergency exits for each side of

60 through 79.......................        1  .......     1 or        2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Passenger emergency exits; other than side-of-fuselage. In 
addition to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section--
    (1) There must be enough openings in the top, bottom, or ends of the 
fuselage to allow evacuation with the rotorcraft on its side; or
    (2) The probability of the rotorcraft coming to rest on its side in 
a crash landing must be extremely remote.
    (d) Ditching emergency exits for passengers. If certification with 
ditching provisions is requested, ditching emergency exits must be 
provided in accordance with the following requirements and must be 
proven by test, demonstration, or analysis unless the emergency exits 
required by paragraph (b) of this

[[Page 639]]

section already meet these requirements.
    (1) For rotorcraft that have a passenger seating configuration, 
excluding pilots seats, of nine seats or less, one exit above the 
waterline in each side of the rotorcraft, meeting at least the 
dimensions of a Type IV exit.
    (2) For rotorcraft that have a passenger seating configuration, 
excluding pilots seats, of 10 seats or more, one exit above the 
waterline in a side of the rotorcraft meeting at least the dimensions of 
a Type III exit, for each unit (or part of a unit) of 35 passenger 
seats, but no less than two such exits in the passenger cabin, with one 
on each side of the rotorcraft. However, where it has been shown through 
analysis, ditching demonstrations, or any other tests found necessary by 
the Administrator, that the evacuation capability of the rotorcraft 
during ditching is improved by the use of larger exits, or by other 
means, the passenger seat to exit ratio may be increased.
    (3) Flotation devices, whether stowed or deployed, may not interfere 
with or obstruct the exits.
    (e) Ramp exits. One Type I exit only, or one Type II exit only, that 
is required in the side of the fuselage under paragraph (b) of this 
section, may be installed instead in the ramp of floor ramp rotorcraft 
if--
    (1) Its installation in the side of the fuselage is impractical; and
    (2) Its installation in the ramp meets Sec. 29.813.
    (f) Tests. The proper functioning of each emergency exit must be 
shown by test.

    (c) The means of opening each emergency exit must be simple and 
obvious and may not require exceptional effort.
    (d) There must be means for locking each emergency exit and for 
preventing opening in flight inadvertently or as a result of mechanical 
failure.
    (e) There must be means to minimize the probability of the jamming 
of any emergency exit in a minor crash landing as a result of fuselage 
deformation under the ultimate inertial forces in Sec. 29.783(d).
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, each land-
based rotorcraft emergency exit must have an approved slide as stated in 
paragraph (g) of this section, or its equivalent, to assist occupants in 
descending to the ground from each floor level exit and an approved 
rope, or its equivalent, for all other exits, if the exit threshold is 
more that 6 feet above the ground--
    (1) With the rotorcraft on the ground and with the landing gear 
extended;
    (2) With one or more legs or part of the landing gear collapsed, 
broken, or not extended; and
    (3) With the rotorcraft resting on its side, if required by 
Sec. 29.803(d).
    (g) The slide for each passenger emergency exit must be a self-
supporting slide or equivalent, and must be designed to meet the 
following requirements:
    (1) It must be automatically deployed, and deployment must begin 
during the interval between the time the exit opening means is actuated 
from inside the rotorcraft and the time the exit is fully opened. 
However, each passenger emergency exit which is also a passenger 
entrance door or a service door must be provided with means to prevent 
deployment of the slide when the exit is opened from either the inside 
or the outside under nonemergency conditions for normal use.
    (2) It must be automatically erected within 10 seconds after 
deployment is begun.
    (3) It must be of such length after full deployment that the lower 
end is self-supporting on the ground and provides safe evacuation of 
occupants to the ground after collapse of one or more legs or part of 
the landing gear.
    (4) It must have the capability, in 25-knot winds directed from the 
most critical angle, to deploy and, with the assistance of only one 
person, to remain usable after full deployment to

[[Page 640]]

evacuate occupants safely to the ground.
    (5) Each slide installation must be qualified by five consecutive 
deployment and inflation tests conducted (per exit) without failure, and 
at least three tests of each such five-test series must be conducted 
using a single representative sample of the device. The sample devices 
must be deployed and inflated by the system's primary means after being 
subjected to the inertia forces specified in Sec. 29.561(b). If any part 
of the system fails or does not function properly during the required 
tests, the cause of the failure or malfunction must be corrected by 
positive means and after that, the full series of five consecutive 
deployment and inflation tests must be conducted without failure.
    (h) For rotorcraft having 30 or fewer passenger seats and having an 
exit threshold more than 6 feet above the ground, a rope or other assist 
means may be used in place of the slide specified in paragraph (f) of 
this section, provided an evacuation demonstration is accomplished as 
prescribed in Sec. 29.803(d) or (e).
    (i) If a rope, with its attachment, is used for compliance with 
paragraph (f), (g), or (h) of this section, it must--
    (1) Withstand a 400-pound static load; and
    (2) Attach to the fuselage structure at or above the top of the 
emergency exit opening, or at another approved location if the stowed 
rope would reduce the pilot's view in flight.

Sec. 29.811  Emergency exit marking.

    (a) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its 
means of opening must be conspicuously marked for the guidance of 
occupants using the exits in daylight or in the dark. Such markings must 
be designed to remain visible for rotorcraft equipped for overwater 
flights if the rotorcraft is capsized and the cabin is submerged.
    (b) The identity and location of each passenger emergency exit must 
be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin.
    (c) The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated 
by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger 
aisle. There must be a locating sign--
    (1) Next to or above the aisle near each floor emergency exit, 
except that one sign may serve two exits if both exists can be seen 
readily from that sign; and
    (2) On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision 
along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and 
obscured by it, except that if this is not possible the sign may be 
placed at another appropriate location.
    (d) Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign 
must have white letters 1 inch high on a red background 2 inches high, 
be self or electrically illuminated, and have a minimum luminescence 
(brightness) of at least 160 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed 
if this will increase the emergency illumination of the passenger 
compartment.
    (e) The location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle 
and instructions for opening must be shown--
    (1) For each emergency exit, by a marking on or near the exit that 
is readable from a distance of 30 inches; and
    (2) For each Type I or Type II emergency exit with a locking 
mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle, by--
    (i) A red arrow, with a shaft at least three-fourths inch wide and a 
head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70 degrees 
of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle 
length; and
    (ii) The word ``open'' in red letters 1 inch high, placed 
horizontally near the head of the arrow.
    (f) Each emergency exit, and its means of opening, must be marked on 
the outside of the rotorcraft. In addition, the following apply:
    (1) There must be a 2-inch colored band outlining each passenger 
emergency exit, except small rotorcraft with a maximum weight of 12,500 
pounds or less may have a 2-inch colored band outlining each exit 
release

[[Page 641]]

lever or device of passenger emergency exits which are normally used 
doors.
    (2) Each outside marking, including the band, must have color 
contrast to be readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage 
surface. The contrast must be such that, if the reflectance of the 
darker color is 15 percent or less, the reflectance of the lighter color 
must be at least 45 percent. ``Reflectance'' is the ratio of the 
luminous flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives. When 
the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 percent, at least 
a 30 percent difference between its reflectance and the reflectance of 
the lighter color must be provided.
    (g) Exits marked as such, though in excess of the required number of 
exits, must meet the requirements for emergency exits of the particular 
type. Emergency exits need only be marked with the word ``Exit.''

lighting system must be installed to--
    (1) Illuminate each passenger emergency exit marking and locating 
sign; and
    (2) Provide enough general lighting in the passenger cabin so that 
the average illumination, when measured at 40-inch intervals at seat 
armrest height on the center line of the main passenger aisle, is at 
least 0.05 foot-candle.
    (b) Exterior emergency lighting must be provided at each emergency 
exit. The illumination may not be less than 0.05 foot-candle (measured 
normal to the direction of incident light) for minimum width on the 
ground surface, with landing gear extended, equal to the width of the 
emergency exit where an evacuee is likely to make first contact with the 
ground outside the cabin. The exterior emergency lighting may be 
provided by either interior or exterior sources with light intensity 
measurements made with the emergency exits open.
    (c) Each light required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section must 
be operable manually from the cockpit station and from a point in the 
passenger compartment that is readily accessible. The cockpit control 
device must have an ``on,'' ``off,'' and ``armed'' position so that when 
turned on at the cockpit or passenger compartment station or when armed 
at the cockpit station, the emergency lights will either illuminate or 
remain illuminated upon interruption of the rotorcraft's normal electric 
power.
    (d) Any means required to assist the occupants in descending to the 
ground must be illuminated so that the erected assist means is visible 
from the rotorcraft.
    (1) The assist means must be provided with an illumination of not 
less than 0.03 foot-candle (measured normal to the direction of the 
incident light) at the ground end of the erected assist means where an 
evacuee using the established escape route would normally make first 
contact with the ground, with the rotorcraft in each of the attitudes 
corresponding to the collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear.
    (2) If the emergency lighting subsystem illuminating the assist 
means is independent of the rotorcraft's main emergency lighting system, 
it--
    (i) Must automatically be activated when the assist means is 
erected;
    (ii) Must provide the illumination required by paragraph (d)(1); and
    (iii) May not be adversely affected by stowage.
    (e) The energy supply to each emergency lighting unit must provide 
the required level of illumination for at least 10 minutes at the 
critical ambient conditions after an emergency landing.
    (f) If storage batteries are used as the energy supply for the 
emergency lighting system, they may be recharged from the rotorcraft's 
main electrical power system provided the charging circuit is designed 
to preclude inadvertent battery discharge into charging circuit faults.

    (2) At least 20 inches wide.
    (b) For each emergency exit covered by Sec. 29.809(f), there must be 
enough space adjacent to that exit to allow a crewmember to assist in 
the evacuation of passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of 
the passageway below that required for that exit.
    (c) There must be access from each aisle to each Type III and Type 
IV exit, and
    (1) For rotorcraft that have a passenger seating configuration, 
excluding pilot seats, of 20 or more, the projected opening of the exit 
provided must not be obstructed by seats, berths, or other protrusions 
(including seatbacks in any position) for a distance from that exit of 
not less than the width of the narrowest passenger seat installed on the 
rotorcraft;
    (2) For rotorcraft that have a passenger seating configuration, 
excluding pilot seats, of 19 or less, there may be minor obstructions in 
the region described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if there are 
compensating factors to maintain the effectiveness of the exit.

flammable fluid system components (including the heater fuel system), 
that could--
    (i) Be damaged by heater malfunctioning; or
    (ii) Allow flammable fluids or vapors to reach the heater in case of 
leakage.
    (2) Each part of any ventilating air passage that--
    (i) Surrounds the combustion chamber; and
    (ii) Would not contain (without damage to other rotorcraft 
components)

[[Page 645]]

any fire that may occur within the passage.
    (b) Ventilating air ducts. Each ventilating air duct passing through 
any fire zone must be fireproof. In addition--
    (1) Unless isolation is provided by fireproof valves or by equally 
effective means, the ventilating air duct downstream of each heater must 
be fireproof for a distance great enough to ensure that any fire 
originating in the heater can be contained in the duct; and
    (2) Each part of any ventilating duct passing through any region 
having a flammable fluid system must be so constructed or isolated from 
that system that the malfunctioning of any component of that system 
cannot introduce flammable fluids or vapors into the ventilating 
airstream.
    (c) Combustion air ducts. Each combustion air duct must be fireproof 
for a distance great enough to prevent damage from backfiring or reverse 
flame propagation. In addition--
    (1) No combustion air duct may communicate with the ventilating 
airstream unless flames from backfires or reverse burning cannot enter 
the ventilating airstream under any operating condition, including 
reverse flow or malfunction of the heater or its associated components; 
and
    (2) No combustion air duct may restrict the prompt relief of any 
backfire that, if so restricted, could cause heater failure.
    (d) Heater controls; general. There must be means to prevent the 
hazardous accumulation of water or ice on or in any heater control 
component, control system tubing, or safety control.
    (e) Heater safety controls. For each combustion heater, safety 
control means must be provided as follows:
    (1) Means independent of the components provided for the normal 
continuous control of air temperature, airflow, and fuel flow must be 
provided, for each heater, to automatically shut off the ignition and 
fuel supply of that heater at a point remote from that heater when any 
of the following occurs:
    (i) The heat exchanger temperature exceeds safe limits.
    (ii) The ventilating air temperature exceeds safe limits.
    (iii) The combustion airflow becomes inadequate for safe operation.
    (iv) The ventilating airflow becomes inadequate for safe operation.
    (2) The means of complying with paragraph (e)(1) of this section for 
any individual heater must--
    (i) Be independent of components serving any other heater whose heat 
output is essential for safe operation; and
    (ii) Keep the heater off until restarted by the crew.
    (3) There must be means to warn the crew when any heater whose heat 
output is essential for safe operation has been shut off by the 
automatic means prescribed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Air intakes. Each combustion and ventilating air intake must be 
where no flammable fluids or vapors can enter the heater system under 
any operating condition--
    (1) During normal operation; or
    (2) As a result of the malfunction of any other component.
    (g) Heater exhaust. Each heater exhaust system must meet the 
requirements of Secs. 29.1121 and 29.1123. In addition--
    (1) Each exhaust shroud must be sealed so that no flammable fluids 
or hazardous quantities of vapors can reach the exhaust systems through

    (2) No exhaust system may restrict the prompt relief of any backfire 
that, if so restricted, could cause heater failure.
    (h) Heater fuel systems. Each heater fuel system must meet the 
powerplant fuel system requirements affecting safe heater operation. 
Each heater fuel system component in the ventilating airstream must be 
protected by shrouds so that no leakage from those components can enter 
the ventilating airstream.
    (i) Drains. There must be means for safe drainage of any fuel that 
might accumulate in the combustion chamber or the heat exchanger. In 
addition--
    (1) Each part of any drain that operates at high temperatures must 
be protected in the same manner as heater exhausts; and

rotorcraft-load combinations must include a device to enable the pilot 
to release the external load quickly during flight. This quick-release 
device, and the means by which it is controlled, must comply with the 
following:
    (1) A control for the quick-release device must be installed on one 
of the pilot's primary controls and must be designed and located so that 
it may be operated by the pilot without hazardously limiting his ability 
to control the rotorcraft during an emergency situation.
    (2) In addition a manual mechanical control for the quick-release 
device, readily accessible either to the pilot or

[[Page 647]]

to another crew member, must be provided.
    (3) The quick-release device must function properly with all 
external loads up to and including the maximum external load for which 
authorization is requested.

qualified in accordance with Sec. 33.49(d) of this chapter or be 
otherwise approved for the intended usage.
    (b) Category A; engine isolation. For each category A rotorcraft, 
the powerplants must be arranged and isolated from each other to allow 
operation, in at least one configuration, so that the

[[Page 648]]

failure or malfunction of any engine, or the failure of any system that 
can affect any engine, will not--
    (1) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; 
or
    (2) Require immediate action, other than normal pilot action with 
primary flight controls, by any crewmember to maintain safe operation.
    (c) Category A; control of engine rotation. For each Category A

    (a) Each engine must be installed to prevent the harmful vibration 
of any part of the engine or rotorcraft.
    (b) The addition of the rotor and the rotor drive system to the 
engine may not subject the principal rotating parts of the engine to 
excessive vibration stresses. This must be shown by a vibration 
investigation.

Sec. 29.908  Cooling fans.

    For cooling fans that are a part of a powerplant installation the 
following apply:
    (a) Category A. For cooling fans installed in Category A rotorcraft, 
it must be shown that a fan blade failure will not prevent continued 
safe flight either because of damage caused by the failed blade or loss 
of cooling air.
    (b) Category B. For cooling fans installed in category B rotorcraft, 
there must be means to protect the rotorcraft and allow a safe landing 
if a fan blade fails. It must be shown that--
    (1) The fan blade would be contained in the case of a failure;
    (2) Each fan is located so that a fan blade failure will not 
jeopardize safety; or
    (3) Each fan blade can withstand an ultimate load of 1.5 times the 
centrifugal force expected in service, limited by either--
    (i) The highest rotational speeds achievable under uncontrolled 
conditions; or
    (ii) An overspeed limiting device.
    (c) Fatigue evaluation. Unless a fatigue evaluation under 
Sec. 29.571 is conducted, it must be shown that cooling fan blades are 
not operating at resonant conditions within the operating limits of the 
rotorcraft.

                           Rotor Drive System


<R05>
Sec. 29.917  Design.

    (a) General. The rotor drive system includes any part necessary to 
transmit power from the engines to the rotor hubs. This includes gear 
boxes,

[[Page 649]]

shafting, universal joints, couplings, rotor brake assemblies, clutches, 
supporting bearings for shafting, any attendant accessory pads or 
drives, and any cooling fans that are a part of, attached to, or mounted 
on the rotor drive system.
    (b) Design assessment. A design assessment must be performed to 
ensure that the rotor drive system functions safely over the full range 
of conditions for which certification is sought. The design assessment 
must include a detailed failure analysis to identify all failures that 
will prevent continued safe flight or safe landing and must identify the 
means to minimize the likelihood of their occurrence.
    (c) Arrangement. Rotor drive systems must be arranged as follows:
    (1) Each rotor drive system of multiengine rotorcraft must be 
arranged so that each rotor necessary for operation and control will 
continue to be driven by the remaining engines if any engine fails.
    (2) For single-engine rotorcraft, each rotor drive system must be so 
arranged that each rotor necessary for control in autorotation will 
continue to be driven by the main rotors after disengagement of the 
engine from the main and auxiliary rotors.
    (3) Each rotor drive system must incorporate a unit for each engine 
to automatically disengage that engine from the main and auxiliary 
rotors if that engine fails.
    (4) If a torque limiting device is used in the rotor drive system, 
it must be located so as to allow continued control of the rotorcraft 
when the device is operating.
    (5) If the rotors must be phased for intermeshing, each system must 
provide constant and positive phase relationship under any operating 
condition.
    (6) If a rotor dephasing device is incorporated, there must be means 
to keep the rotors locked in proper phase before operation.

Sec. 29.921  Rotor brake.

    If there is a means to control the rotation of the rotor drive 
system independently of the engine, any limitations on the use of that 
means must be specified, and the control for that means must be guarded 
to prevent inadvertent operation.


<R05>
Sec. 29.923  Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests.

    (a) Endurance tests, general. Each rotor drive system and rotor 
control mechanism must be tested, as prescribed in paragraphs (b) 
through (n) of this section, for at least 200 hours plus the time 
required to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (k) 
of this section. These tests must be conducted as follows:
    (1) Ten-hour test cycles must be used, except that the test cycle 
must be extended to include the OEI test of paragraphs (b)(2) and (k), 
of this section if OEI ratings are requested.
    (2) The tests must be conducted on the rotorcraft.
    (3) The test torque and rotational speed must be--
    (i) Determined by the powerplant limitations; and
    (ii) Absorbed by the rotors to be approved for the rotorcraft.
    (b) Endurance tests; takeoff run. The takeoff run must be conducted 
as follows:
    (1) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this 
section, the takeoff torque run must consist of 1 hour of alternate runs 
of 5 minutes at takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with 
takeoff torque, and 5 minutes at as low an engine idle speed as 
practicable. The engine must be declutched from the rotor drive system, 
and the rotor brake, if furnished and so intended, must be applied 
during the first minute of the idle run. During the remaining 4 minutes 
of the idle run, the clutch must be engaged so that the engine drives 
the rotors at the minimum practical r.p.m. The engine and the rotor 
drive system must be accelerated at the maximum rate. When declutching 
the engine, it must be decelerated rapidly enough to allow the operation 
of the overrunning clutch.
    (2) For helicopters for which the use of a 2\1/2\-minute OEI rating 
is requested, the takeoff run must be conducted as prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except for the third and sixth

[[Page 650]]

runs for which the takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with 
takeoff torque are prescribed in that paragraph. For these runs, the 
following apply:
    (i) Each run must consist of at least one period of 2\1/2\ minutes 
with takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque on 
all engines.
    (ii) Each run must consist of at least one period, for each engine 
in sequence, during which that engine simulates a power failure and the 
remaining engines are run at the 2\1/2\-minute OEI torque and the 
maximum speed for use with 2\1/2\-minute OEI torque for 2\1/2\ minutes.
    (3) For multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft for which the use of 
30-second/2-minute OEI power is requested, the takeoff run must be 
conducted as prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section except for 
the following:
    (i) Immediately following any one 5-minute power-on run required by 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, simulate a failure for each power 
source in turn, and apply the maximum torque and the maximum speed for 
use with 30-second OEI power to the remaining affected drive system 
power inputs for not less than 30 seconds. Each application of 30-second 
OEI power must be followed by two applications of the maximum torque and 
the maximum speed for use with the 2 minute OEI power for not less than 
2 minutes each; the second application must follow a period at 
stabilized continuous or 30 minute OEI power (whichever is requested by 
the applicant). At least one run sequence must be conducted from a 
simulated ``flight idle'' condition. When conducted on a bench test, the 
test sequence must be conducted following stabilization at take-off 
power.
    (ii) For the purpose of this paragraph, an affected power input 
includes all parts of the rotor drive system which can be adversely 
affected by the application of higher or asymmetric torque and speed 
prescribed by the test.
    (iii) This test may be conducted on a representative bench test 
facility when engine limitations either preclude repeated use of this 
power or would result in premature engine removals during the test. The 
loads, the vibration frequency, and the methods of application to the 
affected rotor drive system components must be representative of 
rotorcraft conditions. Test components must be those used to show 
compliance with the remainder of this section.
    (c) Endurance tests; maximum continuous run. Three hours of 
continuous operation at maximum continuous torque and the maximum speed 
for use with maximum continuous torque must be conducted as follows:
    (1) The main rotor controls must be operated at a minimum of 15 
times each hour through the main rotor pitch positions of maximum 
vertical thrust, maximum forward thrust component, maximum aft thrust 
component, maximum left thrust component, and maximum right thrust 
component, except that the control movements need not produce loads or 
blade flapping motion exceeding the maximum loads of motions encountered 
in flight.
    (2) The directional controls must be operated at a minimum of 15 
times each hour through the control extremes of maximum right turning 
torque, neutral torque as required by the power applied to the main 
rotor, and maximum left turning torque.
    (3) Each maximum control position must be held for at least 10 
seconds, and the rate of change of control position must be at least as 
rapid as that for normal operation.
    (d) Endurance tests; 90 percent of maximum continuous run. One hour 
of continuous operation at 90 percent of maximum continuous torque and 
the maximum speed for use with 90 percent of maximum continuous torque 
must be conducted.
    (e) Endurance tests; 80 percent of maximum continuous run. One hour 
of continuous operation at 80 percent of maximum continuous torque and 
the minimum speed for use with 80 percent of maximum continuous torque 
must be conducted.
    (f) Endurance tests; 60 percent of maximum continuous run. Two hours 
or, for helicopters for which the use of either 30-minute OEI power or 
continuous OEI power is requested, 1 hour of continuous operation at 60 
percent of maximum continuous torque and the minimum speed for use with 
60 percent of

[[Page 651]]

maximum continuous torque must be conducted.
    (g) Endurance tests; engine malfunctioning run. It must be 
determined whether malfunctioning of components, such as the engine fuel 
or ignition systems, or whether unequal engine power can cause dynamic 
conditions detrimental to the drive system. If so, a suitable number of 
hours of operation must be accomplished under those conditions, 1 hour 
of which must be included in each cycle, and the remaining hours of 
which must be accomplished at the end of the 20 cycles. If no 
detrimental condition results, an additional hour of operation in 
compliance with paragraph (b) of this section must be conducted in 
accordance with the run schedule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
without consideration of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (h) Endurance tests; overspeed run. One hour of continuous operation 
must be conducted at maximum continuous torque and the maximum power-on 
overspeed expected in service, assuming that speed and torque limiting 
devices, if any, function properly.
    (i) Endurance tests; rotor control positions. When the rotor 
controls are not being cycled during the tie-down tests, the rotor must 
be operated, using the procedures prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section, to produce each of the maximum thrust positions for the 
following percentages of test time (except that the control positions 
need not produce loads or blade flapping motion exceeding the maximum 
loads or motions encountered in flight):
    (1) For full vertical thrust, 20 percent.
    (2) For the forward thrust component, 50 percent.
    (3) For the right thrust component, 10 percent.
    (4) For the left thrust component, 10 percent.
    (5) For the aft thrust component, 10 percent.
    (j) Endurance tests, clutch and brake engagements. A total of at 
least 400 clutch and brake engagements, including the engagements of 
paragraph (b) of this section, must be made during the takeoff torque 
runs and, if necessary, at each change of torque and speed throughout 
the test. In each clutch engagement, the shaft on the driven side of the 
clutch must be accelerated from rest. The clutch engagements must be 
accomplished at the speed and by the method prescribed by the applicant. 
During deceleration after each clutch engagement, the engines must be 
stopped rapidly enough to allow the engines to be automatically 
disengaged from the rotors and rotor drives. If a rotor brake is 
installed for stopping the rotor, the clutch, during brake engagements, 
must be disengaged above 40 percent of maximum continuous rotor speed 
and the rotors allowed to decelerate to 40 percent of maximum continuous 
rotor speed, at which time the rotor brake must be applied. If the 
clutch design does not allow stopping the rotors with the engine 
running, or if no clutch is provided, the engine must be stopped before 
each application of the rotor brake, and then immediately be started 
after the rotors stop.
    (k) Endurance tests; OEI power run. (1) 30-minute OEI power run. For 
rotorcraft for which the use of 30-minute OEI power is requested, a run 
at 30-minute OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-minute OEI 
torque must be conducted as follows: For each engine, in sequence, that 
engine must be inoperative and the remaining engines must be run for a 
30-minute period.
    (2) Continuous OEI power run. For rotorcraft for which the use of 
continuous OEI power is requested, a run at continuous OEI torque and 
the maximum speed for use with continuous OEI torque must be conducted 
as follows: For each engine, in sequence, that engine must be 
inoperative and the remaining engines must be run for 1 hour.
    (3) The number of periods prescribed in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) 
of this section may not be less than the number of engines, nor may it 
be less than two.
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) Any components that are affected by maneuvering and gust loads 
must be investigated for the same flight conditions as are the main 
rotors, and their service lives must be determined by fatigue tests or 
by other acceptable methods. In addition, a level of safety equal to 
that of the main rotors must be provided for--

[[Page 652]]

    (1) Each component in the rotor drive system whose failure would 
cause an uncontrolled landing;
    (2) Each component essential to the phasing of rotors on multirotor 
rotorcraft, or that furnishes a driving link for the essential control 
of rotors in autorotation; and
    (3) Each component common to two or more engines on multiengine 
rotorcraft.
    (n) Special tests. Each rotor drive system designed to operate at 
two or more gear ratios must be subjected to special testing for 
durations necessary to substantiate the safety of the rotor drive 
system.
    (o) Each part tested as prescribed in this section must be in a 
serviceable condition at the end of the tests. No intervening 
disassembly which might affect test results may be conducted.
    (p) Endurance tests; operating lubricants. To be approved for use in 
rotor drive and control systems, lubricants must meet the specifications 
of lubricants used during the tests prescribed by this section. 
Additional or alternate lubricants may be qualified by equivalent 
testing or by comparative analysis of lubricant specifications and rotor 
drive and control system characteristics. In addition--
    (1) At least three 10-hour cycles required by this section must be 
conducted with transmission and gearbox lubricant temperatures, at the 
location prescribed for measurement, not lower than the maximum 
operating temperature for which approval is requested;
    (2) For pressure lubricated systems, at least three 10-hour cycles 
required by this section must be conducted with the lubricant pressure, 
at the location prescribed for measurement, not higher than the minimum 
operating pressure for which approval is requested; and

Sec. 29.927  Additional tests.

    (a) Any additional dynamic, endurance, and operational tests, and 
vibratory investigations necessary to determine that the rotor drive 
mechanism is safe, must be performed.
    (b) If turbine engine torque output to the transmission can exceed 
the highest engine or transmission torque limit, and that output is not 
directly controlled by the pilot under normal operating conditions (such 
as where the primary engine power control is accomplished through the 
flight control), the following test must be made:
    (1) Under conditions associated with all engines operating, make 200 
applications, for 10 seconds each, of torque that is at least equal to 
the lesser of--
    (i) The maximum torque used in meeting Sec. 29.923 plus 10 percent; 
or
    (ii) The maximum torque attainable under probable operating 
conditions, assuming that torque limiting devices, if any, function 
properly.
    (2) For multiengine rotorcraft under conditions associated with each 
engine, in turn, becoming inoperative, apply to the remaining 
transmission torque inputs the maximum torque attainable under probable 
operating conditions, assuming that torque limiting devices, if any, 
function properly. Each transmission input must be tested at this 
maximum torque for at least fifteen minutes.
    (c) Lubrication system failure. For lubrication systems required for 
proper operation of rotor drive systems, the following apply:

[[Page 653]]

    (1) Category A. Unless such failures are extremely remote, it must 
be shown by test that any failure which results in loss of lubricant in 
any normal use lubrication system will not prevent continued safe 
operation, although not necessarily without damage, at a torque and 
rotational speed prescribed by the applicant for continued flight, for 
at least 30 minutes after perception by the flightcrew of the 
lubrication system failure or loss of lubricant.
    (2) Category B. The requirements of Category A apply except that the 
rotor drive system need only be capable of operating under autorotative 
conditions for at least 15 minutes.
    (d) Overspeed test. The rotor drive system must be subjected to 50 
overspeed runs, each 30<plus-minus>3 seconds in duration, at not less 
than either the higher of the rotational speed to be expected from an 
engine control device failure or 105 percent of the maximum rotational 
speed, including transients, to be expected in service. If speed and 
torque limiting devices are installed, are independent of the normal 
engine control, and are shown to be reliable, their rotational speed 
limits need not be exceeded. These runs must be conducted as follows:
    (1) Overspeed runs must be alternated with stabilizing runs of from 
1 to 5 minutes duration each at 60 to 80 percent of maximum continuous 
speed.
    (2) Acceleration and deceleration must be accomplished in a period 
not longer than 10 seconds (except where maximum engine acceleration 
rate will require more than 10 seconds), and the time for changing 
speeds may not be deducted from the specified time for the overspeed 
runs.
    (3) Overspeed runs must be made with the rotors in the flattest 
pitch for smooth operation.
    (e) The tests prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section 
must be conducted on the rotorcraft and the torque must be absorbed by 
the rotors to be installed, except that other ground or flight test 
facilities with other appropriate methods of torque absorption may be 
used if the conditions of support and vibration closely simulate the 
conditions that would exist during a test on the rotorcraft.
    (f) Each test prescribed by this section must be conducted without 
intervening disassembly and, except for the lubrication system failure 
test required by paragraph (c) of this section, each part tested must be 
in a serviceable condition at the conclusion of the test.

Sec. 29.931  Shafting critical speed.

    (a) The critical speeds of any shafting must be determined by 
demonstration except that analytical methods may be used if reliable 
methods of analysis are available for the particular design.
    (b) If any critical speed lies within, or close to, the operating 
ranges for idling, power-on, and autorotative conditions, the stresses 
occurring at that speed must be within safe limits. This must be shown 
by tests.
    (c) If analytical methods are used and show that no critical speed 
lies within the permissible operating ranges, the margins between the 
calculated critical speeds and the limits of the allowable operating 
ranges must be adequate to allow for possible variations between the 
computed and actual values.

surge,  of flameout) are present, to a hazardous degree, during normal 
and emergency operation within the range of operating limitations of the 
rotorcraft and of the engine.
    (b) The turbine engine air inlet system may not, as a result of 
airflow distortion during normal operation, cause vibration harmful to 
the engine.

including the maneuvers for which certification is requested and during 
which the engine or auxiliary power unit is permitted to be in

    (b) Each fuel system must be arranged so that--
    (1) No engine or fuel pump can draw fuel from more than one tank at 
a time; or
    (2) There are means to prevent introducing air into the system.
    (c) Each fuel system for a turbine engine must be capable of 
sustained operation throughout its flow and pressure range with fuel 
initially saturated with water at 80 degrees F. and having 0.75cc of 
free water per gallon added and cooled to the most critical condition 
for icing likely to be encountered in operation.

Sec. 29.952  Fuel system crash resistance.

    Unless other means acceptable to the Administrator are employed to 
minimize the hazard of fuel fires to occupants following an otherwise 
survivable impact (crash landing), the fuel systems must incorporate the 
design features of this section. These systems must be shown to be 
capable of sustaining the static and dynamic deceleration loads of this 
section, considered as ultimate loads acting alone, measured at the 
system component's center of gravity without structural damage to the 
system components, fuel tanks, or their attachments that would leak fuel 
to an ignition source.
    (a) Drop test requirements. Each tank, or the most critical tank, 
must be drop-tested as follows:
    (1) The drop height must be at least 50 feet.
    (2) The drop impact surface must be nondeforming.
    (3) The tanks must be filled with water to 80 percent of the normal, 
full capacity.
    (4) The tank must be enclosed in a surrounding structure 
representative of the installation unless it can be established that the 
surrounding structure is free of projections or other design features 
likely to contribute to upture of the tank.
    (5) The tank must drop freely and impact in a horizontal position 
<plus-minus>10 deg..
    (6) After the drop test, there must be no leakage.
    (b) Fuel tank load factors. Except for fuel tanks located so that 
tank rupture with fuel release to either significant ignition sources, 
such as engines, heaters, and auxiliary power units, or occupants is 
extremely remote, each fuel tank must be designed and installed to 
retain its contents under the following ultimate inertial load factors, 
acting alone.
    (1) For fuel tanks in the cabin:
    (i) Upward--4g.
    (ii) Forward--16g.
    (iii) Sideward--8g.
    (iv) Downward--20g.
    (2) For fuel tanks located above or behind the crew or passenger 
compartment that, if loosened, could injure an occupant in an emergency 
landing:
    (i) Upward--1.5g.
    (ii) Forward--8g.
    (iii) Sideward--2g.
    (iv) Downward--4g.
    (3) For fuel tanks in other areas:
    (i) Upward--1.5g.
    (ii) Forward--4g.
    (iii) Sideward--2g.
    (iv) Downward--4g.
    (c) Fuel line self-sealing breakaway couplings. Self-sealing 
breakaway couplings must be installed unless hazardous relative motion 
of fuel system components to each other or to local rotorcraft structure 
is demonstrated to be extremely improbable or unless

[[Page 655]]

other means are provided. The couplings or equivalent devices must be 
installed at all fuel tank-to-fuel line connections, tank-to-tank 
interconnects, and at other points in the fuel system where local 
structural deformation could lead to the release of fuel.
    (1) The design and construction of self-sealing breakaway couplings 
must incorporate the following design features:
    (i) The load necessary to separate a breakaway coupling must be 
between 25 to 50 percent of the minimum ultimate failure load (ultimate 
strength) of the weakest component in the fluid-carrying line. The 
separation load must in no case be less than 300 pounds, regardless of 
the size of the fluid line.
    (ii) A breakaway coupling must separate whenever its ultimate load 
(as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section) is applied in the 
failure modes most likely to occur.
    (iii) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to 
visually ascertain that the coupling is locked together (leak-free) and 
is open during normal installation and service.
    (iv) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to 
prevent uncoupling or unintended closing due to operational shocks, 
vibrations, or accelerations.
    (v) No breakaway coupling design may allow the release of fuel once 
the coupling has performed its intended function.
    (2) All individual breakaway couplings, coupling fuel feed systems, 
or equivalent means must be designed, tested, installed, and maintained 
so inadvertent fuel shutoff in flight is improbable in accordance with 
Sec. 29.955(a) and must comply with the fatigue evaluation requirements 
of Sec. 29.571 without leaking.
    (3) Alternate, equivalent means to the use of breakaway couplings 
must not create a survivable impact-induced load on the fuel line to 
which it is installed greater than 25 to 50 percent of the ultimate load 
(strength) of the weakest component in the line and must comply with the 
fatigue requirements of Sec. 29.571 without leaking.
    (d) Frangible or deformable structural attachments. Unless hazardous 
relative motion of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local 
rotorcraft structure is demonstrated to be extremely improbable in an 
otherwise survivable impact, frangible or locally deformable attachments 
of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure 
must be used. The attachment of fuel tanks and fuel system components to 
local rotorcraft structure, whether frangible or locally deformable, 
must be designed such that its separation or relative local deformation 
will occur without rupture or local tear-out of the fuel tank or fuel 
system component that will cause fuel leakage. The ultimate strength of 
frangible or deformable attachments must be as follows:
    (1) The load required to separate a frangible attachment from its 
support structure, or deform a locally deformable attachment relative to 
its support structure, must be between 25 and 50 percent of the minimum 
ultimate load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the 
attached system. In no case may the load be less than 300 pounds.
    (2) A frangible or locally deformable attachment must separate or 
locally deform as intended whenever its ultimate load (as defined in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is applied in the modes most likely to 
occur.
    (3) All frangible or locally deformable attachments must comply with 
the fatigue requirements of Sec. 29.571.
    (e) Separation of fuel and ignition sources. To provide maximum 
crash resistance, fuel must be located as far as practicable from all 
occupiable areas and from all potential ignition sources.
    (f) Other basic mechanical design criteria. Fuel tanks, fuel lines, 
electrical wires, and electrical devices must be designed, constructed, 
and installed, as far as practicable, to be crash resistant.
    (g) Rigid or semirigid fuel tanks. Rigid or semirigid fuel tank or 
bladder walls must be impact and tear resistant.

Sec. 29.953  Fuel system independence.

    (a) For category A rotorcraft--
    (1) The fuel system must meet the requirements of Sec. 29.903(b); 
and
    (2) Unless other provisions are made to meet paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section,

[[Page 656]]

the fuel system must allow fuel to be supplied to each engine through a 
system independent of those parts of each system supplying fuel to other 
engines.

meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. However, 
separate fuel tanks need not be provided for each engine.


<R05>
Sec. 29.954  Fuel system lightning protection.

    The fuel system must be designed and arranged to prevent the 
ignition of fuel vapor within the system by--
    (a) Direct lightning strikes to areas having a high probability of 
stroke attachment;
    (b) Swept lightning strokes to areas where swept strokes are highly 
probable; and
    (c) Corona and streamering at fuel vent outlets.

Sec. 29.955  Fuel flow.

    (a) General. The fuel system for each engine must provide the engine 
with at least 100 percent of the fuel required under all operating and 
maneuvering conditions to be approved for the rotorcraft, including, as 
applicable, the fuel required to operate the engines under the test 
conditions required by Sec. 29.927. Unless equivalent methods are used, 
compliance must be shown by test during which the following provisions 
are met, except that combinations of conditions which are shown to be 
improbable need not be considered.
    (1) The fuel pressure, corrected for accelerations (load factors), 
must be within the limits specified by the engine type certificate data 
sheet.
    (2) The fuel level in the tank may not exceed that established as 
the unusable fuel supply for that tank under Sec. 29.959, plus that 
necessary to conduct the test.
    (3) The fuel head between the tank and the engine must be critical 
with respect to rotorcraft flight attitudes.
    (4) The fuel flow transmitter, if installed, and the critical fuel 
pump (for pump-fed systems) must be installed to produce (by actual or 
simulated failure) the critical restriction to fuel flow to be expected 
from component failure.
    (5) Critical values of engine rotational speed, electrical power, or 
other sources of fuel pump motive power must be applied.
    (6) Critical values of fuel properties which adversely affect fuel 
flow are applied during demonstrations of fuel flow capability.
    (7) The fuel filter required by Sec. 29.997 is blocked to the degree 
necessary to simulate the accumulation of fuel contamination required to 
activate the indicator required by Sec. 29.1305(a)(17).
    (b) Fuel transfer system. If normal operation of the fuel system 
requires fuel to be transferred to another tank, the transfer must occur 
automatically via a system which has been shown to maintain the fuel 
level in the receiving tank within acceptable limits during flight or 
surface operation of the rotorcraft.
    (c) Multiple fuel tanks. If an engine can be supplied with fuel from 
more than one tank, the fuel system, in addition to having appropriate 
manual switching capability, must be designed to prevent interruption of 
fuel flow to that engine, without attention by the flightcrew, when any 
tank supplying fuel to that engine is depleted of usable fuel during 
normal operation and any other tank that normally supplies fuel to that 
engine alone contains usable fuel.

<R05>
Sec. 29.957  Flow between interconnected tanks.

    (a) Where tank outlets are interconnected and allow fuel to flow 
between them due to gravity or flight accelerations, it must be 
impossible for fuel to flow between tanks in quantities great enough to 
cause overflow from the tank vent in any sustained flight condition.
    (b) If fuel can be pumped from one tank to another in flight--
    (1) The design of the vents and the fuel transfer system must 
prevent structural damage to tanks from overfilling; and
    (2) There must be means to warn the crew before overflow through the 
vents occurs.

<R05>
Sec. 29.959  Unusable fuel supply.

    The unusable fuel supply for each tank must be established as not 
less than the quantity at which the first evidence of malfunction occurs 
under the most adverse fuel feed condition occurring under any intended 
operations and flight maneuvers involving that tank.


<R05>
Sec. 29.961   Fuel system hot weather operation.

    Each suction lift fuel system and other fuel systems conducive to 
vapor formation must be shown to operate satisfactorily (within 
certification limits) when using fuel at the most critical temperature 
for vapor formation under critical operating conditions including, if 
applicable, the engine operating conditions defined by Sec. 29.927(b)(1) 
and (b)(2).

Sec. 29.963  Fuel tanks: general.

    (a) Each fuel tank must be able to withstand, without failure, the 
vibration, inertia, fluid, and structural loads to which it may be 
subjected in operation.
    (b) Each flexible fuel tank bladder or liner must be approved or 
shown to be suitable for the particular application and must be puncture 
resistant. Puncture resistance must be shown by meeting the TSO-C80, 
paragraph 16.0, requirements using a minimum puncture force of 370 
pounds.
    (c) Each integral fuel tank must have facilities for inspection and 
repair of its interior.
    (d) The maximum exposed surface temperature of all components in the 
fuel tank must be less by a safe margin than the lowest expected 
autoignition temperature of the fuel or fuel vapor in the tank. 
Compliance with this requirement must be shown under all operating 
conditions and under all normal or malfunction conditions of all 
components inside the tank.
    (e) Each fuel tank installed in personnel compartments must be 
isolated by fume-proof and fuel-proof enclosures that are drained and 
vented to the exterior of the rotorcraft. The design and construction of 
the enclosures must provide necessary protection for the tank, must be 
crash resistant during a survivable impact in accordance with 
Sec. 29.952, and must be adequate to withstand loads and abrasions to be 
expected in personnel compartments.

Sec. 29.965  Fuel tank tests.

    (a) Each fuel tank must be able to withstand the applicable pressure 
tests in this section without failure or leakage. If practicable, test 
pressures may be applied in a manner simulating the pressure 
distribution in service.
    (b) Each conventional metal tank, each nonmetallic tank with walls 
that are not supported by the rotorcraft structure, and each integral 
tank must be subjected to a pressure of 3.5 p.s.i. unless the pressure 
developed during maximum limit acceleration or emergency deceleration 
with a full tank exceeds this value, in which case a hydrostatic head, 
or equivalent test, must be applied to duplicate the acceleration loads 
as far as possible. However, the pressure need not exceed 3.5 p.s.i. on 
surfaces not exposed to the acceleration loading.
    (c) Each nonmetallic tank with walls supported by the rotorcraft 
structure must be subjected to the following tests:
    (1) A pressure test of at least 2.0 p.s.i. This test may be 
conducted on the tank alone in conjunction with the test specified in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) A pressure test, with the tank mounted in the rotorcraft 
structure, equal to the load developed by the reaction of the contents, 
with the tank full, during maximum limit acceleration or emergency 
deceleration. However, the pressure need not exceed 2.0 p.s.i. on 
surfaces faces not exposed to the acceleration loading.
    (d) Each tank with large unsupported or unstiffened flat areas, or 
with other features whose failure or deformation could cause leakage, 
must be subjected to the following test or its equivalent:
    (1) Each complete tank assembly and its supports must be vibration 
tested while mounted to simulate the actual installation.

[[Page 658]]

    (2) The tank assembly must be vibrated for 25 hours while two-thirds 
full of any suitable fluid. The amplitude of vibration may not be less 
than one thirty-second of an inch, unless otherwise substantiated.
    (3) The test frequency of vibration must be as follows:
    (i) If no frequency of vibration resulting from any r.p.m. within 
the normal operating range of engine or rotor system speeds is critical, 
the test frequency of vibration, in number of cycles per minute, must, 
unless a frequency based on a more rational analysis is used, be the 
number obtained by averaging the maximum and minimum power-on engine 
speeds (r.p.m.) for reciprocating engine powered rotorcraft or 2,000 
c.p.m. for turbine engine powered rotorcraft.
    (ii) If only one frequency of vibration resulting from any r.p.m. 
within the normal operating range of engine or rotor system speeds is 
critical, that frequency of vibration must be the test frequency.
    (iii) If more than one frequency of vibration resulting from any 
r.p.m. within the normal operating range of engine or rotor system 
speeds is critical, the most critical of these frequencies must be the 
test frequency.
    (4) Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) and (iii), the time of test must be 
adjusted to accomplish the same number of vibration cycles as would be 
accomplished in 25 hours at the frequency specified in paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section.
    (5) During the test, the tank assembly must be rocked at the rate of 
16 to 20 complete cycles per minute through an angle of 15 degrees on 
both sides of the horizontal (30 degrees total), about the most critical 
axis, for 25 hours. If motion about more than one axis is likely to be 
critical, the tank must be rocked about each critical axis for 12\1/2\ 
hours.

Sec. 29.967  Fuel tank installation.

    (a) Each fuel tank must be supported so that tank loads are not 
concentrated on unsupported tank surfaces. In addition--
    (1) There must be pads, if necessary, to prevent chafing between 
each tank and its supports;
    (2) The padding must be nonabsorbent or treated to prevent the 
absorption of fuel;
    (3) If flexible tank liners are used, they must be supported so that 
they are not required to withstand fluid loads; and
    (4) Each interior surface of tank compartments must be smooth and 
free of projections that could cause wear of the liner, unless--
    (i) There are means for protection of the liner at those points; or
    (ii) The construction of the liner itself provides such protection.
    (b) Any spaces adjacent to tank surfaces must be adequately 
ventilated to avoid accumulation of fuel or fumes in those spaces due to 
minor leakage. If the tank is in a sealed compartment, ventilation may 
be limited to drain holes that prevent clogging and that prevent 
excessive pressure resulting from altitude changes. If flexible tank 
liners are installed, the venting arrangement for the spaces between the 
liner and its container must maintain the proper relationship to tank 
vent pressures for any expected flight condition.
    (c) The location of each tank must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 29.1185(b) and (c).
    (d) No rotorcraft skin immediately adjacent to a major air outlet 
from the engine compartment may act as the wall of an integral tank.

    (a) General. For the tests prescribed in Sec. 29.1041(c), the 
following apply:
    (1) If the tests are conducted under conditions deviating from the 
maximum ambient atmospheric temperature specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section, the recorded powerplant temperatures must be corrected 
under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, unless a more rational 
correction method is applicable.
    (2) No corrected temperature determined under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section may exceed established limits.
    (3) The fuel used during the cooling tests must be of the minimum 
grade approved for the engines, and the mixture settings must be those 
used in normal operation.
    (4) The test procedures must be as prescribed in Secs. 29.1045 
through 29.1049.
    (5) For the purposes of the cooling tests, a temperature is 
``stabilized'' when its rate of change is less than 2  deg.F per minute.
    (b) Maximum ambient atmospheric temperature. A maximum ambient 
atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of at 
least 100 degrees F. must be established. The assumed temperature lapse 
rate is 3.6 degrees F. per thousand feet of altitude above sea level 
until a temperature of -69.7 degrees F. is reached, above

[[Page 665]]

which altitude the temperature is considered constant at -69.7 degrees 
F. However, for winterization installations, the applicant may select a 
maximum ambient atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level 
conditions of less than 100 degrees F.
    (c) Correction factor (except cylinder barrels). Unless a more 
rational correction applies, temperatures of engine fluids and 
powerplant components (except cylinder barrels) for which temperature 
limits are established, must be corrected by adding to them the 
difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the 
temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of 
the maximum component or fluid temperature recorded during the cooling 
test.
    (d) Correction factor for cylinder barrel temperatures. Cylinder 
barrel temperatures must be corrected by adding to them 0.7 times the 
difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the 
temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of 
the maximum cylinder barrel temperature recorded during the cooling 
test.

Sec. 29.1309  Equipment, systems, and installations.

    (a) The equipment, systems, and installations whose functioning is 
required by this subchapter must be designed and installed to ensure 
that they perform their intended functions under any foreseeable 
operating condition.

[[Page 678]]

    (b) The rotorcraft systems and associated components, considered 
separately and in relation to other systems, must be designed so that--
    (1) For Category B rotorcraft, the equipment, systems, and 
installations must be designed to prevent hazards to the rotorcraft if 
they malfunction or fail; or
    (2) For Category A rotorcraft--
    (i) The occurrence of any failure condition which would prevent the 
continued safe flight and landing of the rotorcraft is extremely 
improbable; and
    (ii) The occurrence of any other failure conditions which would 
reduce the capability of the rotorcraft or the ability of the crew to 
cope with adverse operating conditions is improbable.
    (c) Warning information must be provided to alert the crew to unsafe 
system operating conditions and to enable them to take appropriate 
corrective action. Systems, controls, and associated monitoring and 
warning means must be designed to minimize crew errors which could 
create additional hazards.
    (d) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section must be shown by analysis and, where necessary, by appropriate 
ground, flight, or simulator tests. The analysis must consider--
    (1) Possible modes of failure, including malfunctions and damage 
from external sources;
    (2) The probability of multiple failures and undetected failures;
    (3) The resulting effects on the rotorcraft and occupants, 
considering the stage of flight and operating conditions; and
    (4) The crew warning cues, corrective action required, and the 
capability of detecting faults.
    (e) For Category A rotorcraft, each installation whose functioning 
is required by this subchapter and which requires a power supply is an 
``essential load'' on the power supply. The power sources and the system 
must be able to supply the following power loads in probable operating 
combinations and for probable durations:
    (1) Loads connected to the system with the system functioning 
normally.
    (2) Essential loads, after failure of any one prime mover, power 
converter, or energy storage device.
    (3) Essential loads, after failure of--
    (i) Any one engine, on rotorcraft with two engines; and
    (ii) Any two engines, on rotorcraft with three or more engines.
    (f) In determining compliance with paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this 
section, the power loads may be assumed to be reduced under a monitoring 
procedure consistent with safety in the kinds of operations authorized. 
Loads not required for controlled flight need not be considered for the 
two-engine-inoperative condition on rotorcraft with three or more 
engines.
    (g) In showing compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section with regard to the electrical system and to equipment design and 
installation, critical environmental conditions must be considered. For 
electrical generation, distribution, and utilization equipment required 
by or used in complying with this subchapter, except equipment covered 
by Technical Standard Orders containing environmental test procedures, 
the ability to provide continuous, safe service under foreseeable 
environmental conditions may be shown by environmental tests, design 
analysis, or reference to previous comparable service experience on 
other aircraft.
    (h) In showing compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, the effects of lightning strikes on the rotorcraft must be 
considered.

Sec. 29.1323  Airspeed indicating system.

    For each airspeed indicating system, the following apply:
    (a) Each airspeed indicating instrument must be calibrated to 
indicate true airspeed (at sea level with a standard atmosphere) with a 
minimum practicable instrument calibration error when the corresponding 
pitot and static pressures are applied.
    (b) Each system must be calibrated to determine system error 
excluding airspeed instrument error. This calibration must be 
determined--
    (1) In level flight at speeds of 20 knots and greater, and over an 
appropriate range of speeds for flight conditions of climb and 
autorotation; and
    (2) During takeoff, with repeatable and readable indications that 
ensure--
    (i) Consistent realization of the field lengths specified in the 
Rotorcraft Flight Manual; and
    (ii) Avoidance of the critical areas of the height-velocity envelope 
as established under Sec. 29.87.
    (c) For Category A rotorcraft--
    (1) The indication must allow consistent definition of the critical 
decision point; and
    (2) The system error, excluding the airspeed instrument calibration 
error, may not exceed--
    (i) Three percent or 5 knots, whichever is greater, in level flight 
at speeds above 80 percent of takeoff safety speed; and

Sec. 29.1325  Static pressure and pressure altimeter systems.

    (a) Each instrument with static air case connections must be vented 
to the outside atmosphere through an appropriate piping system.
    (b) Each vent must be located where its orifices are least affected 
by airflow variation, moisture, or foreign matter.
    (c) Each static pressure port must be designed and located in such 
manner that the correlation between air pressure in the static pressure 
system and true ambient atmospheric static pressure is not altered when 
the rotorcraft encounters icing conditions. An anti-icing means or an 
alternate source of static pressure may be used in showing compliance 
with this requirement. If the reading of the altimeter, when on the 
alternate static pressure system, differs from the reading of altimeter 
when on the primary static system by more than 50 feet, a correction 
card must be provided for the alternate static system.
    (d) Except for the vent into the atmosphere, each system must be 
airtight.
    (e) Each pressure altimeter must be approved and calibrated to 
indicate pressure altitude in a standard atmosphere with a minimum 
practicable calibration error when the corresponding static pressures 
are applied.
    (f) Each system must be designed and installed so that an error in 
indicated pressure altitude, at sea level, with a standard atmosphere, 
excluding instrument calibration error, does not result in an error of 
more than <plus-minus>30 feet per 100 knots speed. However, the error 
need not be less than <plus-minus>30 feet.
    (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, if the 
static pressure system incorporates both a primary and an alternate 
static pressure source, the means for selecting one or the other source 
must be designed so that--
    (1) When either source is selected, the other is blocked off; and
    (2) Both sources cannot be blocked off simultaneously.
    (h) For unpressurized rotorcraft, paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
does not apply if it can be demonstrated that the static pressure system 
calibration, when either static pressure source is selected, is not 
changed by the other static pressure source being open or blocked.

rotorcraft; and
    (2) Be readily and positively disengaged by each pilot to prevent it 
from interfering with the control of the rotorcraft.
    (b) Unless there is automatic synchronization, each system must have 
a means to readily indicate to the pilot the alignment of the actuating 
device in relation to the control system it operates.

[[Page 681]]

    (c) Each manually operated control for the system's operation must 
be readily accessible to the pilots.
    (d) The system must be designed and adjusted so that, within the 
range of adjustment available to the pilot, it cannot produce hazardous 
loads on the rotorcraft, or create hazardous deviations in the flight 
path, under any flight condition appropriate to its use, either during 
normal operation or in the event of a malfunction, assuming that 
corrective action begins within a reasonable period of time.
    (e) If the automatic pilot integrates signals from auxiliary 
controls or furnishes signals for operation of other equipment, there 
must be positive interlocks and sequencing of engagement to prevent 
improper operation.

    (1) Two independent sources of power;
    (2) A means of selecting either power source; and
    (3) A visual means integral with each instrument to indicate when 
the power adequate to sustain proper instrument performance is not being 
supplied. The power must be measured at or near the point where it 
enters the instrument. For electrical instruments, the power is 
considered to be adequate when the voltage is within the approved 
limits; and
    (b) The installation and power supply system must be such that 
failure of any flight instrument connected to one source, or of the 
energy supply from one source, or a fault in any part of the power 
distribution system does not interfere with the proper supply of energy 
from any other source.

    (1) Consists of one or more approved anticollision lights located so 
that their emitted light will not impair the crew's vision or detract 
from the conspicuity of the position lights; and
    (2) Meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section.
    (b) Field of coverage. The system must consist of enough lights to 
illuminate the vital areas around the rotorcraft, considering the 
physical configuration and flight characteristics of the rotorcraft. The 
field of coverage must extend in each direction within at least 30 
degrees above and 30 degrees below the horizontal plane of the 
rotorcraft, except that there may be solid angles of obstructed 
visibility totaling not more than 0.5 steradians.
    (c) Flashing characteristics. The arrangement of the system, that 
is, the number of light sources, beam width, speed of rotation, and 
other characteristics, must give an effective flash frequency of not 
less than 40, nor more than 100, cycles per minute. The effective flash 
frequency is the frequency at which the rotorcraft's complete 
anticollision light system is observed from a distance, and applies to 
each sector of light including any overlaps that exist when the system 
consists of more than one light source. In overlaps, flash frequencies 
may exceed 100, but not 180, cycles per minute.
    (d) Color. Each anticollision light must be aviation red and must 
meet the applicable requirements of Sec. 29.1397.
    (e) Light intensity. The minimum light intensities in any vertical 
plane, measured with the red filter (if used) and expressed in terms of 
``effective'' intensities must meet the requirements of paragraph (f) of 
this section. The following relation must be assumed:

where:

I<INF>e</INF>=effective intensity (candles).
I(t)=instantaneous intensity as a function of time.
t<INF>2</INF>-t<INF>l</INF>=flash time interval (seconds).

Normally, the maximum value of effective intensity is obtained when 
t<INF>2</INF> and t<INF>1</INF> are chosen so that the effective 
intensity is equal to the instantaneous intensity at t<INF>2</INF> and 
t<INF>1</INF>.
    (f) Minimum effective intensities for anticollision light. Each 
anticollision light effective intensity must equal or exceed the 
applicable values in the following table:

certificated for operation under the instrument flight rules (IFR) of 
this chapter unless it meets the design and installation requirements 
contained in this appendix.
    II. Definitions. (a) V<INF>YI</INF> means instrument climb speed, 
utilized instead of V<INF>Y</INF> for compliance with the climb 
requirements for instrument flight.
    (b) V<INF>NEI</INF> means instrument flight never exceed speed, 
utilized instead of V<INF>NE</INF> for compliance with maximum limit 
speed requirements for instrument flight.
    (c) V<INF>MINI</INF> means instrument flight minimum speed, utilized 
in complying with minimum limit speed requirements for instrument 
flight.
    III. Trim. It must be possible to trim the cyclic, collective, and 
directional control forces to zero at all approved IFR airspeeds, power 
settings, and configurations appropriate to the type.
    IV. Static longitudinal stability. (a) General. The helicopter must 
possess positive static longitudinal control force stability at critical 
combinations of weight and center of gravity at the conditions specified 
in paragraphs IV (b) through (f) of this appendix. The stick force must 
vary with speed so that any substantial speed change results in a stick 
force clearly perceptible to the pilot. The airspeed must return to 
within 10 percent of the trim speed when the control force is slowly 
released for each trim condition specified in paragraphs IV (b) through 
(f) of this appendix.
    (b) Climb. Stability must be shown in climb thoughout the speed 
range 20 knots either side of trim with--
    (1) The helicopter trimmed at V<INF>YI</INF>;
    (2) Landing gear retracted (if retractable); and
    (3) Power required for limit climb rate (at least 1,000 fpm) at 
V<INF>YI</INF> or maximum continuous power, whichever is less.
    (c) Cruise. Stability must be shown throughout the speed range from 
0.7 to 1.1 V<INF>H</INF> or V<INF>NEI</INF>, whichever is lower, not to 
exceed <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>20 knots from trim with--
    (1) The helicopter trimmed and power adjusted for level flight at 
0.9 V<INF>H</INF> or 0.9 V<INF>NEI</INF>, whichever is lower; and
    (2) Landing gear retracted (if retractable).
    (d) Slow cruise. Stability must be shown throughout the speed range 
from 0.9 V<INF>MINI</INF> to 1.3 V<INF>MINI</INF> or 20 knots above trim 
speed, whichever is greater, with--
    (1) The helicopter trimmed and power adjusted for level flight at 
1.1 V<INF>MINI</INF>; and
    (2) Landing gear retracted (if retractable).
    (e) Descent. Stability must be shown throughout the speed range 20 
knots either side of trim with--
    (1) The helicopter trimmed at 0.8 V<INF>H</INF> or 0.8 V<INF>NEI</INF> 
(or 0.8 V<INF>LE</INF> for the landing gear extended case), whichever is 
lower;
    (2) Power required for 1,000 fpm descent at trim speed; and
    (3) Landing gear extended and retracted, if applicable.
    (f) Approach. Stability must be shown throughout the speed range 
from 0.7 times the minimum recommended approach speed to 20 knots above 
the maximum recommended approach speed with--
    (1) The helicopter trimmed at the recommended approach speed or 
speeds;
    (2) Landing gear extended and retracted, if applicable; and
    (3) Power required to maintain a 3 deg. glide path and power 
required to maintain the steepest approach gradient for which approval 
is requested.
    V. Static lateral-directional stability. (a) Static directional 
stability must be positive throughout the approved ranges of airspeed, 
power, and vertical speed. In straight, steady sideslips up to 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 deg. from trim, directional control position 
must increase in approximately constant proportion to angle of sideslip. 
At greater angles up to the maximum sideslip angle appropriate to the 
type, increased directional control position must produce increased 
angle of sideslip.

[[Page 702]]

    (b) During sideslips up to <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 deg. from trim 
throughout the approved ranges of airspeed, power, and vertical speed 
there must be no negative dihedral stability perceptible to the pilot 
through lateral control motion or force. Longitudinal cycle movement 
with sideslip must not be excessive.
    VI. Dynamic stability. (a) Any oscillation having a period of less 
than 5 seconds must damp to 1/2 amplitude in not more than one cycle.
    (b) Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less 
than 10 seconds must damp to 1/2 amplitude in not more than two cycles.
    (c) Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more but less 
than 20 seconds must be damped.
    (d) Any oscillation having a period of 20 seconds or more may not 
achieve double amplitude in less than 20 seconds.
    (e) Any aperiodic response may not achieve double amplitude in less 
than 9 seconds.
    VII. Stability augmentation system (SAS). (a) If a SAS is used, the 
reliability of the SAS must be related to the effects of its failure. 
The occurrence of any failure condition which would prevent continued 
safe flight and landing must be extremely improbable. For any failure 
condition of the SAS which is not shown to be extremely improbable--
    (1) The helicopter must be safely controllable and capable of 
prolonged instrument flight without undue pilot effort. Additional 
unrelated probable failures affecting the control system must be 
considered; and
    (2) The flight characteristics requirements in Subpart B of Part 29 
must be met throughout a practical flight envelope.
    (b) The SAS must be designed so that it cannot create a hazardous 
deviation in flight path or produce hazardous loads on the helicopter 
during normal operation or in the event of malfunction or failure, 
assuming corrective action begins within an appropriate period of time. 
Where multiple systems are installed, subsequent malfunction conditions 
must be considered in sequence unless their occurrence is shown to be 
improbable.
    VIII. Equipment, systems, and installation. The basic equipment and 
installation must comply with Subpart F of Part 29 through Amendment 29-
14, with the following exceptions and additions:
    (a) Flight and navigation instruments. (1) A magnetic gyro-
stabilized direction indicator instead of the gyroscopic direction 
indicator required by Sec. 29.1303(h); and
    (2) A standby attitude indicator which meets the requirements of 
Secs. 29.1303(g)(1) through (7), instead of a rate-of-turn indicator 
required by Sec. 29.1303(g). If standby batteries are provided, they may 
be charged from the aircraft electrical system if adequate isolation is 
incorporated. The system must be designed so that the standby batteries 
may not be used for engine starting.
    (b) Miscellaneous requirements. (1) Instrument systems and other 
systems essential for IFR flight that could be adversely affected by 
icing must be provided with adequate ice protection whether or not the 
rotorcraft is certificated for operation in icing conditions.
    (2) There must be means in the generating system to automatically 
de-energize and disconnect from the main bus any power source developing 
hazardous overvoltage.
    (3) Each required flight instrument using a power supply (electric, 
vacuum, etc.) must have a visual means integral with the instrument to 
indicate the adequacy of the power being supplied.
    (4) When multiple systems performing like functions are required, 
each system must be grouped, routed, and spaced so that physical 
separation between systems is provided to ensure that a single 
malfunction will not adversely affect more than one system.
    (5) For systems that operate the required flight instruments at each 
pilot's station--
    (i) Only the required flight instruments for the first pilot may be 
connected to that operating system;
    (ii) Additional instruments, systems, or equipment may not be 
connected to an operating system for a second pilot unless provisions 
are made to ensure the continued normal functioning of the required 
instruments in the event of any malfunction of the additional 
instruments, systems, or equipment which is not shown to be extremely 
improbable;
    (iii) The equipment, systems, and installations must be designed so 
that one display of the information essential to the safety of flight 
which is provided by the instruments will remain available to a pilot, 
without additional crew-member action, after any single failure or 
combination of failures that is not shown to be extremely improbable; 
and
    (iv) For single-pilot configurations, instruments which require a 
static source must be provided with a means of selecting an alternate 
source and that source must be calibrated.
    (6) In determining compliance with the requirements of 
Sec. 29.1351(d)(2), the supply of electrical power to all systems 
necessary for flight under IFR must be included in the evaluation.
    (c) Thunderstorm lights. In addition to the instrument lights 
required by Sec. 29.1381(a), thunderstorm lights which provide high 
intensity white flood lighting to the basic flight instruments must be 
provided. The thunderstorm lights must be installed to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 29.1381(b).
    IX. Rotorcraft Flight Manual. A Rotorcraft Flight Manual or 
Rotorcraft Flight Manual IFR Supplement must be provided and must 
contain--

[[Page 703]]

    (a) Limitations. The approved IFR flight envelope, the IFR 
flightcrew composition, the revised kinds of operation, and the steepest 
IFR precision approach gradient for which the helicopter is approved;
    (b) Procedures. Required information for proper operation of IFR 
systems and the recommended procedures in the event of stability 
augmentation or electrical system failures; and
    (c) Performance. If V<INF>YI</INF> differs from V<INF>Y</INF>, climb 
performance at V<INF>YI</INF> and with maximum continuous power 
throughout the ranges of weight, altitude, and temperature for which 
approval is requested.

               Appendix C to Part 29--Icing Certification

    (a) Continuous maximum icing. The maximum continuous intensity of 
atmospheric icing conditions (continuous maximum icing) is defined by 
the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective 
diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the 
interrelationship of these three variables as shown in Figure 1 of this 
appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and 
temperature is given in Figure 2 of this appendix. The interrelationship 
of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and altitude is 
determined from Figures 1 and 2. The cloud liquid water content for 
continuous maximum icing conditions of a horizontal extent, other than 
17.4 nautical miles, is determined by the value of liquid water content 
of Figure 1, multiplied by the appropriate factor from Figure 3 of this 
appendix.
    (b) Intermittent maximum icing. The intermittent maximum intensity 
of atmospheric icing conditions (intermittent maximum icing) is defined 
by the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective 
diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the 
interrelationship of these three variables as shown in Figure 4 of this 
appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and 
temperature is given in Figure 5 of this appendix. The interrelationship 
of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and altitude is 
determined from Figures 4 and 5. The cloud liquid water content for 
intermittent maximum icing conditions of a horizontal extent, other than 
2.6 nautical miles, is determined by the value of cloud liquid water 
content of Figure 4 multiplied by the appropriate factor in Figure 6 of 
this appendix.

the total average amount of carry-on baggage, blankets, pillows, and 
other similar articles must be distributed at several locations in the 
aisles and emergency exit access ways to create minor obstructions.
    (l) No prior indication may be given to any crewmember or passenger 
of the particular exits to be used in the demonstration.
    (m) The applicant may not practice, rehearse, or describe the 
demonstration for the participants nor may any participant have taken 
part in this type of demonstration within the preceding 6 months.
    (n) A pretakeoff passenger briefing may be given. The passengers may 
also be advised to follow directions of crewmembers, but not be 
instructed on the procedures to be followed in the demonstration.
    (o) If safety equipment, as allowed by paragraph (c) of this 
appendix, is provided, either all passenger and cockpit windows must be 
blacked out or all emergency exits must have safety equipment to prevent 
disclosure of the available emergency exits.
    (p) Not more than 50 percent of the emergency exits in the sides of 
the fuselage of a rotorcraft that meet all of the requirements 
applicable to the required emergency exits for that rotorcraft may be 
used for demonstration. Exits that are not to be used for the 
demonstration must have the exit handle deactivated or must be indicated 
by red lights, red tape, or other acceptable means placed outside the 
exits to indicate fire or other reasons why they are unusable. The exits 
to be used must be representative of all the emergency exits on the 
rotorcraft and must be designated by the applicant, subject to approval 
by the Administrator. If installed, at least one floor level exit (Type 
I; Sec. 29.807(a)(1)) must be used as required by Sec. 29.807(c).
    (q) All evacuees must leave the rotorcraft by a means provided as 
part of the rotorcraft's equipment.
    (r) Approved procedures must be fully utilized during the 
demonstration.

requirements for reciprocating and turbine aircraft engines.
Sec. 33.13  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 33.14  Start-stop cyclic stress (low-cycle fatigue).

    By a procedure approved by the FAA, operating limitations must be 
established which specify the maximum allowable number of start-stop 
stress cycles for each rotor structural part (such as discs, spacers, 
hubs, and shafts of the compressors and turbines), the failure of which 
could produce a hazard to the aircraft. A start-stop stress cycle 
consists of a flight cycle profile or an equivalent representation of 
engine usage. It includes starting the engine, accelerating to maximum 
rated power or thrust, decelerating, and stopping. For each cycle, the 
rotor structural parts must reach stabilized temperature during engine 
operation at a maximum rate power or thrust and after engine shutdown, 
unless it is shown that the parts undergo the same stress range without 
temperature stabilization.

the probability of the occurrence of an internal fire that could result 
in structural failure, overheating, or other hazardous conditions.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this 
section, each external line, fitting, and other component, which 
contains or conveys flammable fluid must be fire resistant. Components 
must be shielded or located to safeguard against the ignition of leaking 
flammable fluid.
    (c) Flammable fluid tanks and supports which are part of and 
attached to the engine must be fireproof or be enclosed by a fireproof 
shield unless damage by fire to any non-fireproof part will not cause 
leakage or spillage of flammable fluid. For a reciprocating engine 
having an integral oil sump of less than 25-quart capacity, the oil sump 
need not be fireproof nor be enclosed by fireproof shield.
    (d) For turbine engines type certificated for use in supersonic 
aircraft, each external component which conveys or contains flammable 
fluid must be fireproof.

Sec. 33.43  Vibration test.

    (a) Each engine must undergo a vibration survey to establish the 
torsional and bending vibration characteristics of the crankshaft and 
the propeller shaft or other output shaft, over the range of crankshaft 
speed and engine power, under steady state and transient conditions, 
from idling speed to either 110 percent of the desired maximum 
continuous speed rating or 103 percent of the maximum desired takeoff 
speed rating, whichever is higher. The survey must be conducted using,

Sec. 33.83  Vibration test.

    (a) Each engine must undergo vibration surveys to establish that the 
vibration characteristics of those components that may be subject to 
mechanically or aerodynamically induced vibratory excitations are 
acceptable throughout the declared flight envelope. The engine surveys 
shall be based upon an appropriate combination of experience, analysis, 
and component test and shall address, as a minimum, blades, vanes, rotor 
discs, spacers, and rotor shafts.
    (b) The surveys shall cover the ranges of power or thrust, and both 
the physical and corrected rotational speeds for each rotor system, 
corresponding to operations throughout the range of ambient conditions 
in the declared flight envelope, from the minimum rotational speed up to 
103 percent of the maximum physical and corrected rotational speed 
permitted for rating periods of two minutes or longer, and up to 100 
percent of all other permitted physical and corrected rotational speeds, 
including those that are overspeeds. If there is any indication of a 
stress peak arising at the highest of those required physical or 
corrected rotational speeds, the surveys shall be extended sufficiently 
to reveal the maximum stress values present, except that the extension 
need not cover more than a further 2 percentage points increase beyond 
those speeds.
    (c) Evaluations shall be made of the following:
    (1) The effects on vibration characteristics of operating with 
scheduled changes (including tolerances) to variable vane angles, 
compressor bleeds, accessory loading, the most adverse inlet air flow 
distortion pattern declared by the manufacturer, and the most adverse 
conditions in the exhaust duct(s); and
    (2) The aerodynamic and aeromechanical factors which might induce or 
influence flutter in those systems susceptible to that form of 
vibration.
    (d) Except as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, the 
vibration stresses associated with the vibration characteristics 
determined under this section, when combined with the appropriate steady 
stresses, must be less than the endurance limits of the materials 
concerned, after making due allowances for operating conditions for the 
permitted variations in properties of the materials. The suitability of 
these stress margins must be justified for each part evaluated. If it is 
determined that certain operating conditions, or ranges, need to be 
limited, operating and installation limitations shall be established.
    (e) The effects on vibration characteristics of excitation forces 
caused by fault conditions (such as, but not limited to, out-of balance, 
local blockage or enlargement of stator vane passages, fuel nozzle 
blockage, incorrectly schedule compressor variables, etc.) shall be 
evaluated by test or analysis, or by reference to previous experience 
and shall

[[Page 735]]

be shown not to create a hazardous condition.
    (f) Compliance with this section shall be substantiated for each 
specific installation configuration that can affect the vibration 
characteristics of the engine. If these vibration effects cannot be 
fully investigated during engine certification, the methods by which 
they can be evaluated and methods by which compliance can be shown shall 
be substantiated and defined in the installation instructions required 
by Sec. 33.5.

Sec. 33.85  Calibration tests.

    (a) Each engine must be subjected to those calibration tests 
necessary to establish its power characteristics and the conditions for 
the endurance test specified Sec. 33.87. The results of the power 
characteristics calibration tests form the basis for establishing the 
characteristics of the engine over its entire operating range of speeds, 
pressures, temperatures, and altitudes. Power ratings are based upon 
standard atmospheric conditions with no airbleed for aircraft services 
and with only those accessories installed which are essential for engine 
functioning.
    (b) A power check at sea level conditions must be accomplished on 
the endurance test engine after the endurance test and any change in 
power characteristics which occurs during the endurance test must be 
determined. Measurements taken during the final portion of the endurance 
test may be used in showing compliance with the requirements of this 
paragraph.
    (c) In showing compliance with this section, each condition must 
stabilize before measurements are taken, except as permitted by 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) In the case of engines having 30-second OEI, and 2-minute OEI 
ratings, measurements taken during the applicable endurance test 
prescribed in Sec. 33.87(f) (1) through (8) may be used in showing 
compliance with the requirements of this section for these OEI ratings.

Sec. 33.87   Endurance test.

    (a) General. Each engine must be subjected to an endurance test that 
includes a total of at least 150 hours of operation and, depending upon 
the type and contemplated use of the engine, consists of one of the 
series of runs specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section, 
as applicable. For engines tested under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) or 
(g) of this section, the prescribed 6-hour test sequence must be 
conducted 25 times to complete the required 150 hours of operation. 
Engines for which the 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings are desired 
must be further tested under paragraph (f) of this section. The 
following test requirements apply:
    (1) The runs must be made in the order found appropriate by the 
Administrator for the particular engine being tested.
    (2) Any automatic engine control that is part of the engine must 
control the engine during the endurance test except for operations where 
automatic control is normally overridden by manual control or where 
manual control is otherwise specified for a particular test run.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, power or 
thrust, gas temperature, rotor shaft rotational speed, and, if limited, 
temperature of external surfaces of the engine must be at least 100 
percent of the value associated with the particular engine operation 
being tested. More than one test may be run if all parameters cannot be 
held at the 100 percent level simultaneously.
    (4) The runs must be made using fuel, lubricants and hydraulic fluid 
which conform to the specifications specified in complying with 
Sec. 33.7(c).
    (5) Maximum air bleed for engine and aircraft services must be used 
during at least one-fifth of the runs. However, for these runs, the 
power or thrust or the rotor shaft rotational speed may be less than 100 
percent of the value associated with the particular operation being 
tested if the Administrator finds that the validity of the endurance 
test is not compromised.
    (6) Each accessory drive and mounting attachment must be loaded. The 
load imposed by each accessory used

[[Page 736]]

only for aircraft service must be the limit load specified by the 
applicant for the engine drive and attachment point during rated maximum 
continuous power or thrust and higher output. The endurance test of any 
accessory drive and mounting attachment under load may be accomplished 
on a separate rig if the validity of the test is confirmed by an 
approved analysis.
    (7) During the runs at any rated power or thrust the gas temperature 
and the oil inlet temperature must be maintained at the limiting 
temperature except where the test periods are not longer than 5 minutes 
and do not allow stabilization. At least one run must be made with fuel, 
oil, and hydraulic fluid at the minimum pressure limit and at least one 
run must be made with fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid at the maximum 
pressure limit with fluid temperature reduced as necessary to allow 
maximum pressure to be attained.
    (8) If the number of occurrences of either transient rotor shaft 
overspeed or transient gas overtemperature is limited, that number of 
the accelerations required by paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section 
must be made at the limiting overspeed or overtemperature. If the number 
of occurrences is not limited, half the required accelerations must be 
made at the limiting overspeed or overtemperature.
    (9) For each engine type certificated for use on supersonic aircraft 
the following additional test requirements apply:
    (i) To change the thrust setting, the power control lever must be 
moved from the initial position to the final position in not more than 
one second except for movements into the fuel burning thrust augmentor 
augmentation position if additional time to confirm ignition is 
necessary.
    (ii) During the runs at any rated augmented thrust the hydraulic 
fluid temperature must be maintained at the limiting temperature except 
where the test periods are not long enough to allow stabilization.
    (iii) During the simulated supersonic runs the fuel temperature and 
induction air temperature may not be less than the limiting temperature.
    (iv) The endurance test must be conducted with the fuel burning 
thrust augmentor installed, with the primary and secondary exhaust 
nozzles installed, and with the variable area exhaust nozzles operated 
during each run according to the methods specified in complying with 
Sec. 33.5(b).
    (v) During the runs at thrust settings for maximum continuous thrust 
and percentages thereof, the engine must be operated with the inlet air 
distortion at the limit for those thrust settings.
    (b) Engines other than certain rotorcraft engines. For each engine 
except a rotorcraft engine for which a rating is desired under paragraph 
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, the applicant must conduct the 
following runs:
    (1) Takeoff and idling. One hour of alternate five-minute periods at 
rated takeoff power and thrust and at idling power and thrust. The 
developed powers and thrusts at takeoff and idling conditions and their 
corresponding rotor speed and gas temperature conditions must be as 
established by the power control in accordance with the schedule 
established by the manufacturer. The applicant may, during any one 
period, manually control the rotor speed, power, and thrust while taking 
data to check performance. For engines with augmented takeoff power 
ratings that involve increases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor 
speed, or shaft power, this period of running at takeoff must be at the 
augmented rating. For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that 
do not materially increase operating severity, the amount of running 
conducted at the augmented rating is determined by the Administrator. In 
changing the power setting after each period, the power-control lever 
must be moved in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section.
    (2) Rated maximum continuous and takeoff power and thrust. Thirty 
minutes at--
    (i) Rated maximum continuous power and thrust during fifteen of the 
twenty-five 6-hour endurance test cycles; and
    (ii) Rated takeoff power and thrust during ten of the twenty-five 6-
hour endurance test cycles.

[[Page 737]]

    (3) Rated maximum continuous power and thrust. One hour and 30 
minutes at rated maximum continuous power and thrust.
    (4) Incremental cruise power and thrust. Two hours and 30 minutes at 
the successive power lever positions corresponding to at least 15 
approximately equal speed and time increments between maximum continuous 
engine rotational speed and ground or minimum idle rotational speed. For 
engines operating at constant speed, the thrust and power may be varied 
in place of speed. If there is significant peak vibration anywhere 
between ground idle and maximum continuous conditions, the number of 
increments chosen may be changed to increase the amount of running made 
while subject to the peak vibrations up to not more than 50 percent of 
the total time spent in incremental running.
    (5) Acceleration and deceleration runs. 30 minutes of accelerations 
and decelerations, consisting of six cycles from idling power and thrust 
to rated takeoff power and thrust and maintained at the takeoff power 
lever position for 30 seconds and at the idling power lever position for 
approximately four and one-half minutes. In complying with this 
paragraph, the power-control lever must be moved from one extreme 
poition to the other in not more than one second, except that, if 
different regimes of control operations are incorporated necessitating 
scheduling of the power-control lever motion in going from one extreme 
position to the other, a longer period of time is acceptable, but not 
more than two seconds.
    (6) Starts. One hundred starts must be made, of which 25 starts must 
be preceded by at least a two-hour engine shutdown. There must be at 
least 10 false engine starts, pausing for the applicant's specified 
minimum fuel drainage time, before attempting a normal start. There must 
be at least 10 normal restarts with not longer than 15 minutes since 
engine shutdown. The remaining starts may be made after completing the 
150 hours of endurance testing.
    (c) Rotorcraft engines for which a 30-minute OEI power rating is 
desired. For each rotorcraft engine for which a 30-minute OEI power 
rating is desired, the applicant must conduct the following series of 
tests:
    (1) Takeoff and idling. One hour of alternate 5-minute periods at 
rated takeoff power and at idling power. The developed powers at takeoff 
and idling conditions and their corresponding rotor speed and gas 
temperature conditions must be as established by the power control in 
accordance with the schedule established by the manufacturer. During any 
one period, the rotor speed and power may be controlled manually while 
taking data to check performance. For engines with augmented takeoff 
power ratings that involve increases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor 
speed, or shaft power, this period of running at rated takeoff power 
must be at the augmented power rating. In changing the power setting 
after each period, the power control lever must be moved in the manner 
prescribed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
    (2) Rated 30-minute OEI power. Thirty minutes at rated 30-minute OEI 
power.
    (3) Rated maximum continuous power. Two hours at rated maximum 
continuous power.
    (4) Incremental cruise power. Two hours at the successive power 
lever positions corresponding with not less than 12 approximately equal 
speed and time increments between maximum continuous engine rotational 
speed and ground or minimum idle rotational speed. For engines operating 
at constant speed, power may be varied in place of speed. If there are 
significant peak vibrations anywhere between ground idle and maximum 
continuous conditions, the number of increments chosen must be changed 
to increase the amount of running conducted while being subjected to the 
peak vibrations up to not more than 50 percent of the total time spent 
in incremental running.
    (5) Acceleration and deceleration runs. Thirty minutes of 
accelerations and decelerations, consisting of six cycles from idling 
power to rated takeoff power and maintained at the takeoff power lever 
position for 30 seconds and at the idling power lever position for

[[Page 738]]

approximately 4\1/2\ minutes. In complying with this paragraph, the 
power control lever must be moved from one extreme position to the other 
in not more than 1 second, except that if different regimes of control 
operations are incorporated necessitating scheduling of the power 
control lever motion in going from one extreme position to the other, a 
longer period of time is acceptable, but not more than 2 seconds.
    (6) Starts. One hundred starts, of which 25 starts must be preceded 
by at least a two-hour engine shutdown. There must be at least 10 false 
engine starts, pausing for the applicant's specified minimum fuel 
drainage time, before attempting a normal start. There must be at least 
10 normal restarts with not longer than 15 minutes since engine 
shutdown. The remaining starts may be made after completing the 150 
hours of endurance testing.
    (d) Rotorcraft engines for which a continuous OEI rating is desired. 
For each rotorcraft engine for which a continuous OEI power rating is 
desired, the applicant must conduct the following series of tests:
    (1) Takeoff and idling. One hour of alternate 5-minute periods at 
rated takeoff power and at idling power. The developed powers at takeoff 
and idling conditions and their corresponding rotor speed and gas 
temperature conditions must be as established by the power control in 
accordance with the schedule established by the manufacturer. During any 
one period the rotor speed and power may be controlled manually while 
taking data to check performance. For engines with augmented takeoff 
power ratings that involve increases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor 
speed, or shaft power, this period of running at rated takeoff power 
must be at the augmented power rating. In changing the power setting 
after each period, the power control lever must be moved in the manner 
prescribed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
    (2) Rated maximum continuous and takeoff power. Thirty minutes at--
    (i) Rated maximum continuous power during fifteen of the twenty-five 
6-hour endurance test cycles; and
    (ii) Rated takeoff power during ten of the twenty-five 6-hour 
endurance test cycles.
    (3) Rated continuous OEI power. One hour at rated continuous OEI 
power.
    (4) Rated maximum continuous power. One hour at rated maximum 
continuous power.
    (5) Incremental cruise power. Two hours at the successive power 
lever positions corresponding with not less than 12 approximately equal 
speed and time increments between maximum continuous engine rotational 
speed and ground or minimum idle rotational speed. For engines operating 
at constant speed, power may be varied in place of speed. If there are 
significant peak vibrations anywhere between ground idle and maximum 
continuous conditions, the number of increments chosen must be changed 
to increase the amount of running conducted while being subjected to the 
peak vibrations up to not more than 50 percent of the total time spent 
in incremental running.
    (6) Acceleration and deceleration runs. Thirty minutes of 
accelerations and decelerations, consisting of six cycles from idling 
power to rated takeoff power and maintained at the takeoff power lever 
position for 30 seconds and at the idling power lever position for 
approximately 4\1/2\ minutes. In complying with this paragraph, the 
power control lever must be moved from one extreme position to the other 
in not more than 1 second, except that if different regimes of control 
operations are incorporated necessitating scheduling of the power 
control lever motion in going from one extreme position to the other, a 
longer period of time is acceptable, but not more than 2 seconds.
    (7) Starts. One hundred starts, of which 25 starts must be preceded 
by at least a 2-hour engine shutdown. There must be at least 10 false 
engine starts, pausing for the applicant's specified minimum fuel 
drainage time, before attempting a normal start. There must be at least 
10 normal restarts with not longer than 15 minutes since engine 
shutdown. The remaining starts may be made after completing the 150 
hours of endurance testing.
    (e) Rotorcraft engines for which a 2\1/2\-minute OEI power rating is 
desired. For

[[Page 739]]

each rotorcraft engine for which a 2\1/2\-minute OEI power rating is 
desired, the applicant must conduct the following series of tests:
    (1) Takeoff, 2\1/2\-minute OEI, and idling. One hour of alternate 5-
minute periods at rated takeoff power and at idling power except that, 
during the third and sixth takeoff power periods, only 2\1/2\ minutes 
need be conducted at rated takeoff power, and the remaining 2\1/2\ 
minutes must be conducted at rated 2\1/2\-minute OEI power. The 
developed powers at takeoff, 2\1/2\-minute OEI, and idling conditions 
and their corresponding rotor speed and gas temperature conditions must 
be as established by the power control in accordance with the schedule 
established by the manufacturer. The applicant may, during any one 
period, control manually the rotor speed and power while taking data to 
check performance. For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that 
involve increases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor speed, or shaft 
power, this period of running at rated takeoff power must be at the 
augmented rating. In changing the power setting after or during each 
period, the power control lever must be moved in the manner prescribed 
in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.

period of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or of the l hour at 
continuous OEI power test period of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, 
must be run at 2\1/2\-minute OEI power.
    (f) Rotorcraft engines for which 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI 
ratings are desired. For each rotorcraft engine for which 30-second OEI 
and 2-minute OEI power ratings are desired, and following completion of 
the tests under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, the 
applicant may disassemble the tested engine to the extent necessary to 
show compliance with the requirements of Sec. 33.93(a). The tested 
engine must then be reassembled using the same parts used during the 
test runs of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, except 
those parts described as consumables in the Instructions for Continued 
Airworthiness. The applicant must then conduct the following test

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, it must be 
demonstrated by engine tests that the engine is capable of containing 
damage without catching fire and without failure of its mounting 
attachments when operated for at least 15 seconds, unless the resulting 
engine damage induces a self shutdown, after each of the following

    (2) Failure of the most critical turbine blade while operating at 
maximum permissible r.p.m. The blade failure must occur at the outermost 
retention groove or, for integrally-bladed rotor discs, at least 80 
percent of the blade must fail. The most critical turbine blade must be 
determined by considering turbine blade weight and the strength of the 
adjacent turbine case at case temperatures and pressures associated with 
operation at maximum permissible r.p.m.

Sec. 33.96  Engine tests in auxiliary power unit (APU) mode.

    If the engine is designed with a propeller brake which will allow 
the propeller to be brought to a stop while the gas generator portion of 
the engine remains in operation, and remain stopped during operation of 
the engine as an auxiliary power unit (``APU mode''), in addition to the 
requirements of Sec. 33.87, the applicant must conduct the following 
tests:
    (a) Ground locking: A total of 45 hours with the propeller brake 
engaged in a manner which clearly demonstrates its ability to function 
without adverse effects on the complete engine while the engine is 
operating in the APU mode under the maximum conditions of engine speed, 
torque, temperature, air bleed, and power extraction as specified by the 
applicant.
    (b) Dynamic braking: A total of 400 application-release cycles of 
brake engagements must be made in a manner which clearly demonstrates 
its ability to function without adverse effects on the complete engine 
under the maximum conditions of engine acceleration/deceleration rate, 
speed, torque, and temperature as specified by the applicant. The 
propeller must be stopped prior to brake release.
    (c) One hundred engine starts and stops with the propeller brake 
engaged.
    (d) The tests required by paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this 
section must be performed on the same engine, but this engine need not 
be the same engine used for the tests required by Sec. 33.87.
    (e) The tests required by paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this 
section must be followed by engine disassembly to the extent necessary 
to show compliance with the requirements of Sec. 33.93(a) and 
Sec. 33.93(b).

Sec. 33.97  Thrust reversers.

    (a) If the engine incorporates a reverser, the endurance 
calibration, operation, and vibration tests prescribed in this subpart 
must be run with the reverser installed. In complying with this section, 
the power control lever must be moved from one extreme position to the 
other in not more than one second except, if regimes of control 
operations are incorporated necessitating scheduling of the power-
control lever motion in going from one extreme position to the other, a 
longer period of time is acceptable but not more than three seconds. In 
addition, the test prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section must be 
made. This test may be scheduled as part of the endurance run.
    (b) 175 reversals must be made from flight-idle forward thrust to 
maximum reverse thrust and 25 reversals must be made from rated takeoff 
thrust to maximum reverse thrust. After each reversal the reverser must 
be operated at full reverse thrust for a period of one minute, except 
that, in the case of a reverser intended for use only as a braking means 
on the ground, the reverser need only be operated at full reverse thrust 
for 30 seconds.

identical design and construction in the vibration, calibration, 
endurance, and operation tests, except that, if a separate engine is 
used for the endurance test it must be subjected to a calibration check 
before starting the endurance test.
    (b) Each applicant may service and make minor repairs to the engine 
during the block tests in accordance with the service and maintenance 
instructions submitted in compliance with Sec. 33.4. If the frequency of 
the service is excessive, or the number of stops due to engine 
malfunction is excessive, or a major repair, or replacement of a part is 
found necessary during the block tests or as the result of findings from 
the teardown inspection, the engine or its parts must be subjected to 
any additional tests the Administrator finds necessary.
    (c) Each applicant must furnish all testing facilities, including 
equipment and competent personnel, to conduct the block tests.

the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 91-604.
    (h) All interpretations of 40 CFR part 87 that are rendered by the 
EPA also apply to this FAR.
    (i) If the EPA, under 40 CFR 87.3(a), approves or accepts any 
testing and sampling procedures or methods, analytical techniques, or 
related equipment not identical to those specified in that part, this 
FAR requires an applicant to show that such alternate, equivalent, or 
otherwise nonidentical procedures have been complied with, and that such 
alternate equipment was used to show compliance, unless the applicant 
elects to comply with those procedures, methods, techniques, and 
equipment specified in 40 CFR part 87.
    (j) If the EPA, under 40 CFR 87.5, prescribes special test 
procedures for any aircraft or aircraft engine that is not susceptible 
to satisfactory testing by the procedures in 40 CFR part 87, the 
applicant must show the Administrator that those special test procedures 
have been complied with.
    (k) Wherever 40 CFR part 87 requires agreement, acceptance, or 
approval by the Administrator of the EPA, this FAR requires a showing 
that such agreement or approval has been obtained.
    (l) Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7573, no state or political subdivision 
thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any standard respecting 
emissions of any air pollutant from any aircraft or engine thereof 
unless that standard is identical to a standard made applicable to the 
aircraft by the terms of this FAR.
    (m) If EPA, by regulation or exemption, relaxes a provision of 40 
CFR part 87 that is implemented in this FAR, no state or political 
subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce the terms of this 
FAR that are superseded by the relaxed requirement.
    (n) If any provision of this FAR is rendered inapplicable to a 
foreign aircraft as provided in 40 CFR 87.3(c) (international 
agreements), and Sec. 34.3(d) of this FAR, that provision may not be 
adopted or enforced against that foreign aircraft by a state or 
political subdivision thereof.
    (o) For exhaust emissions requirements of this FAR that apply 
beginning February 1, 1974, January 1, 1976, January 1, 1978, January 1, 
1984, and August 9, 1985, continued compliance with those requirements 
is shown for engines for which the type design has been shown to meet 
those requirements, if the engine is maintained in accordance with 
applicable maintenance requirements for 14 CFR chapter I. All methods of 
demonstrating compliance and all model designations previously found 
acceptable to the Administrator shall be deemed to continue to be an 
acceptable demonstration of compliance with the specific standards for 
which they were approved.
    (p) Each applicant must allow the Administrator to make, or witness, 
any test necessary to determine compliance with the applicable 
provisions of this FAR.

Administrator or the Administrator of the EPA shall consult with the 
other.


<R05>
Sec. 34.6  Aircraft safety.

    (a) The provisions of this part will be revised if at any time the 
Administrator determines that an emission standard cannot be met within 
the specified time without creating a safety hazard.

[[Page 749]]

    (b) Consistent with 40 CFR 87.6, if the FAA Administrator determines 
that any emission control regulation in this part cannot be safely 
applied to an aircraft, that provision may not be adopted or enforced 
against that aircraft by any state or political subdivision thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 34.7  Exemptions.

    Notwithstanding part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 
part 11), all petitions for rulemaking involving either the substance of 
an emission standard or test procedure prescribed by the EPA that is 
incorporated in this FAR, or the compliance date for such standard or 
procedure, must be submitted to the EPA. Information copies of such 
petitions are invited by the FAA. Petitions for rulemaking or exemption 
involving provisions of this FAR that do not affect the substance or the 
compliance date of an emission standard or test procedure that is 
prescribed by the EPA, and petitions for exemptions under the provisions 
for which the EPA has specifically granted exemption authority to the 
Secretary of Transportation are subject to part 11 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 11). Petitions for rulemaking or 
exemptions involving these FARs must be submitted to the FAA.
    (a) Exemptions based on flights for short durations at infrequent 
intervals. The emission standards of this part do not apply to engines 
which power aircraft operated in the United States for short durations 
at infrequent intervals. Such operations are limited to:
    (1) Flights of an aircraft for the purpose of export to a foreign 
country, including any flights essential to demonstrate the integrity of 
an aircraft prior to a flight to a point outside the United States.
    (2) Flights to a base where repairs, alterations or maintenance are 
to be performed, or to a point of storage, or for the purpose of 
returning an aircraft to service.
    (3) Official visits by representatives of foreign governments.
    (4) Other flights the Administrator determines, after consultation 
with the Administrator of the EPA, to be for short durations at 
infrequent intervals. A request for such a determination shall be made 
before the flight takes place.
    (b) Exemptions for very low production engine models. The emissions 
standards of this part do not apply to engines of very low production 
after the date of applicability. For the purpose of this part, ``very 
low production'' is limited to a maximum total production for United 
States civil aviation applications of no more than 200 units covered by 
the same type certificate after January 1, 1984. Engines manufactured 
under this provision must be reported to the FAA by serial number on or 
before the date of manufacture and exemptions granted under this 
provision are not transferable to any other engine.
    (c) Exemptions for new engines in other categories. The emissions 
standards of this part do not apply to engines for which the 
Administrator determines, with the concurrence of the Administrator of 
the EPA, that application of any standard under Sec. 34.21 is not 
justified, based upon consideration of--
    (1) Adverse economic impact on the manufacturer;
    (2) Adverse economic impact on the aircraft and airline industries 
at large;
    (3) Equity in administering the standards among all economically 
competing parties;
    (4) Public health and welfare effects; and
    (5) Other factors which the Administrator, after consultation with 
the Administrator of the EPA, may deem relevant to the case in question.
    (d) Time-limited exemptions for in-use engines. The emissions 
standards of this part do not apply to aircraft or aircraft engines for 
time periods which the Administrator determines, with the concurrence of 
the Administrator of the EPA, that any applicable standard under

Sec. 34.60  Introduction.

    (a) Except as provided under Sec. 34.5, the procedures described in 
this subpart shall constitute the test program used to determine the 
conformity of new aircraft gas turbine engines with the applicable 
standards set forth in this part.
    (b) The test consists of operating the engine at prescribed power

power) or thrust measuring test stand (for engines producing primarily 
thrust). The exhaust gases generated during engine operation must be 
sampled continuously for specific component analysis through the 
analytical train.
    (c) The exhaust emission test is designed to measure hydrocarbons, 
carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide concentrations, and to determine mass 
emissions through calculations during a simulated aircraft landing-
takeoff

(LTO) cycle. The LTO cycle is based on time in mode data during high 
activity periods at major airports. The test for non-TSS class 
propulsion engines consists of at least the following four modes of 
engine operations: taxi/idle, takeoff, climbout, and approach. The TSS 
class propulsion engine test requires an additional mode for descent. 
The mass emission for the modes are combined to yield the reported 
values.
    (d) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions on an engine 
dynamometer or test stand, the complete engine (with all accessories 
which might reasonably be expected to influence emissions to the 
atmosphere installed and functioning), shall be used if not otherwise 
prohibited by Sec. 34.62(a)(2). Use of service air bleed and shaft power 
extraction to power auxiliary, gearbox-mounted components required to 
drive aircraft systems is not permitted.
    (e) Other gaseous emissions measurement systems may be used if shown 
to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator or the Administrator of the EPA.

travel of the propeller blades to a position substantially below the 
normal flight low-pitch stop. Failure of structural elements need not be 
considered if the occurrence of such a failure is expected to be 
extremely remote. For the purposes of this section the term ``reversing 
system'' means that part of the complete reversing system that is in the 
propeller itself and those other parts that are supplied by the 
applicant for installation in the aircraft.


<R05>
Sec. 35.23  Pitch control and indication.

    (a) No loss of normal propeller pitch control may cause hazardous 
overspeeding of the propeller under intended operating conditions.
    (b) Each pitch control system that is within the propeller, or 
supplied with the propeller, and that uses engine oil for feathering, 
must incorporate means to override or bypass the normally operative 
hydraulic system components so as to allow feathering if those 
components fail or malfunction.
    (c) Each propeller approved for installation on a turbopropeller 
engine must incorporate a provision for an indicator to indicate when 
the propeller blade angle is below the flight low pitch position. The 
provision must directly sense the blade position and be arranged to 
cause an indicator to indicate that the blade angle is below the flight 
low pitch position before the blade moves more than 8 deg. below the 
flight low pitch stop.

   Appendix A to Part 36--Aircraft Noise Measurement Under Sec. 36.101

Sec.
A36.1  Noise certification test and measurement conditions.
A36.3  Measurement of aircraft noise received on the ground.
A36.5  Reporting and correcting measured data.
A36.7  Symbols and units.
A36.9  Atmospheric attenuation of sound.
A36.11  Detailed correction procedures.

Section A36.1  Noise certification test and measurement conditions.
    (a) General. This section prescribes the conditions under which 
aircraft noise certification tests must be conducted and the measurement 
procedures that must be used to measure aircraft noise during each test 
conducted on or after April 3, 1978.
    (b) Test site requirements. (1) Tests to show compliance with 
established aircraft noise certification levels must consist of a series 
of takeoffs and approaches (or stabilized flight path segments thereof) 
during which measurements must be taken at noise measuring stations 
located at the measuring points prescribed in section C36.3 of Appendix 
C of this part. Each recorded segment must include measurements 
throughout the entire time period in which the recorded signal is within 
10 dB of PNLTM.
    (2) During each test takeoff, simultaneous measurements should be 
made at the sideline noise measuring stations on each side of the runway 
and also at the takeoff noise measuring station. However, if test site 
conditions make it impractical to simultaneously measure takeoff and 
sideline noise, and if each of the other sideline measurement 
requirements is met, independent measurements may be made of the 
sideline noise under simulated flight path techniques. If the reference 
flight path includes a power cutback before the maximum possible 
sideline noise level is developed, the reduced sideline noise level 
which is the maximum value developed by the simulated flight path 
technique must be the certificated sideline noise value.
    (3) If the height of the ground at a noise measuring station differs 
from that of the nearest point on the runway by more than 20 feet, 
corrections must be made as prescribed in section A36.5(d) of this 
appendix.
    (4) The location of each noise measuring station must be surrounded 
by relatively flat terrain having no excessive sound absorption 
characteristics, such as might be caused by thick, matted, or tall 
grass, shrubs, or wooded areas.
    (5) An airport tower, or other facility, used to obtain required 
measurements of meteorological conditions at the test site must be 
approved in accordance with section A36.9(b)(1) of this appendix.
    (6) During the period when the flyover noise/time record indicates 
the noise measurement is within 10 dB of PNLTM, no obstruction that 
significantly influences the sound field from the aircraft may exist--
    (i) For a takeoff, approach, or sideline measuring station, within a 
conical space above the measuring position (the point on the ground 
vertically below the microphone), the cone being defined by an axis 
normal to the ground and by a half-angle 80 degrees from this axis; and
    (ii) For a sideline noise measuring station, above the line of sight 
between the microphone and the aircraft.
    (7) A minimum of two noise measuring stations, symmetrically 
positioned about the test flight track, must be used to define the 
maximum sideline noise with respect to location and level as required by 
section C36.3 of Appendix C of this part. For turbojet powered aircraft, 
when approved by the FAA, the maximum sideline noise at takeoff thrust 
may be assumed to occur at the point (or its approved equivalent) along 
the extended centerline of the runway where the aircraft reaches 1000 
feet (305 meters) altitude above ground level. A height of 1440 feet 
(439 meters) may be assumed for Stage 1 or Stage 2 four engine 
airplanes. The altitude of the aircraft as it passes the microphone 
stations must be within +500 to -0 feet (+150 to -0 meters) of the 
target altitude. For aircraft powered by other than turbojet engines, 
the altitude for maximum sideline noise must be determined 
experimentally.
    (c) Weather restrictions. The tests must be conducted under the 
following atmospheric conditions:
    (1) No rain or other precipitation.
    (2) Ambient air temperature between 36 degrees F and 95 degrees F 
(2.2 degrees C and 35 degrees C), inclusively, over that portion of the 
sound propagation path between the aircraft and a point 10 meters above 
the ground at the noise measuring station.
    (3) Relative humidity and ambient temperature over that portion of 
the sound propagation path between the aircraft and a point 10 meters 
above the ground at the noise measuring station is such that the sound 
attenuation in the one-third octave band centered a 8 kHz is not greater 
than 12 dB/100 meters and the relative humidity is between 20 and 95 
percent, inclusively. However, if the dew point and dry bulb temperature 
used for obtaining relative humidity are measured with a device which is 
accurate to within <plus-minus>0.5  deg.C, the sound attenuation rate

[[Page 770]]

shall not exceed 14 dB/100 meters in the one-third octave band centered 
at 8kHz.
    (4) Average wind velocity 10 meters above ground is not to exceed 12 
knots and the crosswind velocity for the airplane is not to exceed 7 
knots. The average wind velocity shall be determined using a thirty-
second averaging period spanning the 10 dB down time interval. Maximum 
wind velocity 10 meters above ground is not to exceed 15 knots and the 
crosswind velocity is not to exceed 10 knots during the 10 dB down time 
interval.
    (5) No anomalous wind conditions (including turbulence) which will 
significantly affect the noise level of the aircraft when the noise is 
recorded at each noise measuring station.
    (d) Aircraft testing procedures.--(1) The aircraft testing 
procedures and noise measurements must be conducted and processed in an 
approved manner which yields the noise evaluation measure designated as 
Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) in units of EPNdB, as prescribed 
in Appendix B of this part.
    (2) The aircraft height and lateral position relative to the 
extended centerline of the runway must be determined by an FAA approved 
method which is independent of normal flight instrumentation, such as 
radar tracking, theodolite triangulation, laser trajectography, or 
photographic scaling techniques.
    (3) The aircraft position along the flight path must be related to 
the noise recorded at the noise measuring stations by means of 
synchronizing signals at an approved sampling rate. The position of the 
aircraft must be recorded relative to the runway during the entire time 
period in which the recorded signal is within 10 dB of PNLTM. Measuring 
and sampling equipment must be approved by the FAA.
    (4) Each takeoff test must meet the conditions of section C36.7 of 
Appendix C of this part.
    (5) If a takeoff test series is conducted at weights other than the 
maximum takeoff weight for which noise certification is requested, the 
following additional requirements apply:
    (i) At least one takeoff test must be conducted at a weight at, or 
above, the maximum certification weight.
    (ii) Each test weight must be within +5 percent or -10 percent of 
the maximum certification weight.
    (6) Each approach test must be conducted with the aircraft 
stabilized and following a 3.0 degree <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.5 degree 
approach angle and must meet the requirements of section C36.9 of 
Appendix C of this part.
    (7) If an approach test series is conducted at weights other than 
the maximum landing weight for which certification is requested, the 
following additional requirements apply:
    (i) At least one approach test must be conducted at a weight at, or 
above, the maximum landing weight.
    (ii) Each test weight must exceed 90 percent of the maximum landing 
weight.
    (8) Aircraft performance data sufficient to make the correction 
required under section A36.5 of this appendix must be recorded at an 
approved sampling rate using FAA approved equipment.

Section A36.3  Measurement of aircraft noise received on the ground.
    (a) General. (1) The measurements prescribed in this section provide 
the data for determining the one-third octave band noise produced by 
aircraft during testing at specific noise measuring stations, as a 
function of time.
    (2) Sound pressure level data for aircraft noise certification 
purposes must be obtained with approved acoustical equipment and 
measurement practices.
    (3) Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section prescribe the 
required equipment specifications. Paragraphs (e) and (f) prescribe the 
calibration and measurement procedures required for each certification 
test series.
    (b) Measurement system. The acoustical measurement system must 
consist of approved equipment equivalent to the following:
    (1) A microphone system with frequency response and directivity 
which are compatible with the measurement and analysis system accuracy 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Tripods or similar microphone mountings that minimize 
interference with the sound energy being measured.
    (3) Recording and reproducing equipment whose characteristics, 
frequency response, and dynamic range are compatible with the response 
and accuracy requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) Calibrators using sine wave, or pink noise, of known levels. 
When pink noise (defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) is used, 
the signal must be described in terms of its root-mean-square (rms) 
value.
    (5) Analysis equipment with the response and accuracy which meets or 
exceeds the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (6) Attenuators used for range changing in sensing, recording, 
reproducing, or analyzing aircraft sound must be capable of being 
operated in equal-interval decibel steps with no error between any two 
settings which exceeds 0.2 dB.
    (c) Sensing, recording, and reproducing equipment. (1) The sound 
produced by the aircraft must be recorded in such a way that the 
complete information, including time history, is retained. A magnetic 
tape recorder is acceptable.

[[Page 771]]

    (2) The microphone must be a pressure sensitive capacitive type, or 
its approved equivalent, such as free field type with incidence 
corrector.
    (i) After an adequate ``warm-up'' period, at least as long as that 
specified by the equipment manufacturer, the system output for constant 
acoustical input shall change by not more than 0.3 dB within any one 
hour nor by more than 0.4 dB within 5 hours.
    (ii) The variation of microphone and preamplifier system sensitivity 
within an angle of <plus-minus>30 degrees of grazing (60-120 degrees 
from the normal to the diaphragm) must not exceed the following values:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Frequency (HZ)                 Change in sensitivity (dB)  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
45 to 1,120............................  1.0                            
1,120 to 2,240.........................  1.5                            
2,240 to 4,500.........................  2.5                            
4,500 to 7,100.........................  4.0                            
7,100 to 11,200........................  5.0                            
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With the wind screen in place, the variation in sensitivity in the 
plane of the diaphragm of the microphone system shall not exceed 1.0 dB 
over the frequency range 45 to 11,200 Hz.
    (iii) The free-field frequency response of the microphone system at 
the reference incidence direction shall lie within an envelope having 
the following values:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Frequency (HZ)                  Change in Tolerance (dB)   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
45 to 4,500............................  <plus-minus>1.0                
4,500 to 5,600.........................  <plus-minus>1.5                
5,600 to 7,100.........................  +1.5 to -2.0                   
7,100 to 9,000.........................  +1.5 to -3.0                   
9,000 to 11,200........................  +2.0 to -4.0                   
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note: The requirements of this paragraph may be determined by a 
pressure response calibration (which may be obtained from an 
electrostatic calibrator in combination with manufacturer provided 
corrections) or an anechoic free-field facility.
    (iv) Specifications concerning sensitivity to environmental factors 
such as temperature, relative humidity, and vibration must in conformity 
with the recommendations of International Electrotechnical Commission 
(IEC) Publication No. 179, entitled ``Precision Sound Level Meters'' (as 
incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part).
    (v) If the wind speed exceeds 6 knots, a windscreen must be employed 
with the microphone during each measurement of aircraft noise. 
Correction for any insertion loss produced by the windscreen as a 
function of frequency, must be applied to the measured data and any 
correction applied must be reported.
    (3) If a magnetic tape recorder is used to store data for subsequent 
analysis, the record/replay system (including tape) must conform to the 
following:
    (i) The electric background noise produced by the system in each 
one-third octave must be at least 35 dB below the standand recording 
level, which is defined as that level which is either 10 dB below the 3 
pecent harmonic distortion level for direct recording or <plus-minus>40 
percent deviation for frequency modulation (FM) recording.
    (ii) At the standard recording level, the corrected frequency 
response in each selected one-third octave band between 44 Hz and 180 Hz 
must be flat within <plus-minus>0.75 dB, and in each band between 180 Hz 
and 11,200 Hz must be flat within <plus-minus>0.25 dB.
    (iii) If the overall system satisfies the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section, and if the limitations of the dynamic range 
of the equipment are insufficient to obtain adequate spectral 
information, high frequency pre-emphasis may be added to the recording 
channel with the converse de-emphasis on playback. If pre-emphasis is 
added, the instantaneously recorded sound pressure level between 800 Hz 
and 11,200 Hz of the maximum measured noise signal must not vary more 
than 20 dB between the levels of the maximum and minimum one-third 
octave bands.
    (d) Analysis equipment. (1) A frequency analysis of the acoustic 
signal must be performed using one-third octave filters which conform to 
the recommendations of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 
Publication No. 225, entitled ``Octave, Half-Octave, and Third-Octave 
Band Filters Intended for Analysis of Sounds and Vibrations'' (as 
incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part).
    (2) A set of 24 consecutive one-third octave filters must be used. 
The first filter of the set must be centered at a geometric mean 
frequency of 50 Hz and the last filter at 10,000 Hz.
    (i) The output of each filter must contain less than 0.5 dB ripple.
    (ii) The correction for effective bandwidth relative to the response 
at the center frequency response for each one-third octave band filter 
must be determined by measuring the filter response to sinusoidal 
signals at a minimum of 20 frequencies equally spaced between the two 
adjacent preferred one-third octave frequencies or by using an approved 
equivalent procedure.
    (3) The analyzer indicating device may be either analog or digital, 
or a combination of both. The preferred sequence of signal processing 
is:
    (i) Squaring the one-third octave filter outputs;
    (ii) Averaging or intergrating; and
    (iii) Coverting linear formulation to logarithmic.
    (4) Each detector must operate over a minimum dynamic range of 60 dB 
and perform as

[[Page 772]]

a true-mean-square device for sinusoidal tone bursts having crest 
factors of at least 3 over the following dynamic range:
    (i) Up to 30 dB below full-scale reading must be accurate within 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.5 dB;
    (ii) Between 30 dB and 40 dB below full-scale reading must be 
accurate within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1.0 dB; and
    (iii) In excess of 40 dB below full-scale reading must be accurate 
within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2.5 dB.
    (5) The averaging properties of the integrator must be tested as 
follows:
    (i) White noise must be passed through the 200 Hz one-third octave 
band filter and the output fed in turn to each detector/integrator. The 
standard deviation of the measured levels must then be determined from a 
large number of samples of the filtered white noise taken at intervals 
of not less than 5 seconds. The value of the standard deviation must be 
within the interval 0.48<plus-minus>0.06 dB for a probability limit of 
95 percent. (An approved equivalent method may be substituted for this 
test on those analyzers where the test signal cannot readily be fed 
directly to each detector/integrator.)
    (ii) For each detector/integrator, the response to a sudden onset or 
interruption of a constant amplitude sinusoidal signal at the respective 
one-third octave band center, frequency must be measured at sampling 
times 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 seconds after the onset or interruption. 
The rising responses must be the following amounts before the steady-
state level:

                                                0.5 seconds.............
                ...................................4.0<plus-minus>1.0 dB
                                              1.0 seconds...............
                  ...............................1.75<plus-minus>0.75 dB
                                                1.5 seconds.............
                ...................................1.0<plus-minus>0.5 dB
                                                2.0 seconds.............
                ...................................0.6<plus-minus>0.5 dB

    (iii) The falling response must be such that the sum of the decibel 
readings (below the initial steady-state level) and the corresponding 
rising response reading are 6.5<plus-minus>1.0 dB, at each sampling 
time.
    (iv) Analyzers using true integration cannot meet the requirements 
of paragraphs (d)(5)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section directly, 
because their overall average time is greater than the sampling 
interval. For these analyzers, compliance must be demonstrated in terms 
of the equivalent output of the data processor. Further, in cases where 
readout and resetting require a dead-time during acquisition, the 
percentage loss of the total data must not exceed one percent.
    (6) The sampling interval between successive readouts shall not 
exceed 500 milliseconds and its precise value must be known to within 
<plus-minus>one (1) percent. The instant in time by which a readout is 
characterized, shall be the midpoint of the average period. (The 
averaging period is defined as twice the effective time constant of the 
analyzer.)
    (7) The amplitude resolution of the analyzer must be at least 0.25 
dB.
    (8) After all systematic errors have been eliminated, each output 
level from the analyzer must be accurate within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1.0 
dB of the level of the input signal. The total systematic errors for 
each of the output levels must not exceed <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.0 dB. 
For contiguous filter systems, the systematic correction between 
adjacent one-third octave channels must not exceed 4.0 dB.
    (9) The dynamic range capability of the analyzer for display of a 
single aircraft noise event (in terms of the difference between full-
scale output level and the maximum noise level of the analyzer 
equipment) must be at least 60 dB.
    (e) Calibrations. (1) Within the five days before the beginning of 
each test series, the complete electronic system (as installed in the 
field, including cables) must be electronically calibrated for frequency 
and amplitude by the use of a pink noise signal of known amplitudes 
covering the range of signal levels furnished by the microphone. For 
purposes of this section, a ``pink noise'' means a noise whose noise-
power/unit-frequency is inversely proportional to frequency at 
frequencies within the range of 44 Hz to 11,200 Hz. The signal used must 
be described in terms of its average root-mean-square (rms) values for a 
nonoverload signal level. This system calibration must be repeated 
within five days of the end of each test series, or as required by the 
FAA.
    (2) Immediately before and after each day's testing, a recorded 
acoustic calibration of the system must be made in the field with an 
acoustic calibrator to check the system sensitivity and provide an 
acoustic reference level for the analysis of the sound level data. The 
performance of equipment in the system will be considered satisfactory 
if, during each day's testing, the variation does not exceed 0.5 dB.
    (3) A normal incidence pressure calibration of the combined 
microphone/preamplifier must be performed with pure tones at each 
preferred one-third octave frequency from 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz. This 
calibration must be completed within the 90 days before the beginning of 
each test series.
    (4) Each reel of magnetic tape must:
    (i) Be pistonphone calibrated; and
    (ii) At its beginning and end, carry a calibration signal consisting 
of at least a 15 second burst of pink noise, as defined in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (5) Data obtained from tape recorded signals are not considered 
reliable if the difference between the pink noise signal levels, before 
and after the tests in each one-third octave band, exceeds 0.75 dB.
    (6) The one-third octave filters must have been demonstrated to be 
in conformity with the recommendations of IEC Publication 225 (as 
incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part) during the six 
calendar months preceding the beginning of each test series.

[[Page 773]]

However, the correction for effective bandwidth relative to the center 
frequency response may be determined for each filter--
    (i) By measuring the filter response to sinusoidal signals at a 
minimum of twenty frequencies equally spaced between the two adjacent 
preferred one-third octave frequencies; or
    (ii) By using an approved alternative technique.
    (7) A performance calibration analysis of each piece of calibration 
equipment, including piston phones, reference microphones, and voltage 
insert devices, must have been made during the six calendar months 
preceding the beginning of each day's test series. Each calibration must 
be traceable to the National Bureau of Standards.
    (f) Noise measurement procedures. (1) Each microphone must be 
oriented so that the diaphragm is substantially in the plane defined by 
the flight path of the aircraft and the measuring station. The 
microphone located at each noise measuring station must be placed so 
that its sensing element is approximately 4 feet above ground.
    (2) Immediately before and immediately after each series of test 
runs and each day's testing, a recorded acoustic calibration of the 
system prescribed in section A36.3(e)(2) of this appendix must be made 
in the field to check the acoustic reference level for the analysis of 
the sound level data. Ambient noise must be recorded for at least 10 
seconds and be representative of the acoustical background, including 
systemic noise, that exists during the flyover test run. During that 
recorded period, each component of the system must be set at the gain-
levels used for aircraft noise measurement.
    (3) The mean background noise spectrum must contain the sound 
pressure levels, which, in each preferred third octave band in the range 
of 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz, are the averages of the energy of the sound 
pressure levels in every preferred third octave. When analyzed in PNL, 
the resulting mean background noise level must be at least 20 PNdB below 
the maximum PNL of the aircraft.
    (4) Corrections for recorded levels of background noise are allowed, 
within the limits prescribed in Sec. A36.5(d)(3) of this appendix.

    (a) General. Data representing physical measurements, or corrections 
to measured data, including corrections to measurements for equipment 
response deviations, must be recorded in permanent form and appended to 
the record. Each correction must be reported and is subject to FAA 
approval. An estimate must be made of each individual error inherent in 
each of the operations employed in obtaining the final data.
    (b) Data reporting. (1) Measured and corrected sound pressure levels 
must be presented in one-third octave band levels obtained with 
equipment conforming to the standards prescribed in section A36.3 of 
this appendix.
    (2) The type of equipment used for measurement and analysis of all 
acoustics, aircraft performance, and meteorological data must be 
reported.
    (3) The atmospheric environmental data required to demonstrate 
compliance with section A36.1(c) of this appendix, measured throughout 
the test period under section A36.9(b)(3) of this appendix, must be 
reported.
    (4) Conditions of local topography, ground cover, or events which 
may interfere with sound recording must be reported.
    (5) The following aircraft information must be reported:
    (i) Type, model, and serial numbers (if any) of aircraft engines.
    (ii) Gross dimensions of aircraft and location of engines.
    (iii) Aircraft gross weight for each test run.
    (iv) Aircraft configuration, including flap and landing gear 
positions.
    (v) Airspeed in knots.
    (vi) Engine performance parameters relevant to noise generation, 
such as net thrust, engine pressure ratio, exhaust temperatures, and fan 
or compressor rotational speeds.
    (vii) Aircraft flight path (above ground level in feet) determined 
by an FAA approved method which is independent of normal flight 
instrumentation, such as radar tracking, theodolite triangulation, laser 
trajectography, or photographic scaling techniques.
    (6) Aircraft speed and position, and engine performance parameters 
must be recorded at an approved sampling rate sufficient to correct to 
the noise certification reference conditions prescribed in paragraph (c) 
of this section. Lateral position relative to the extended centerline of 
the runway, configuration, and gross weight must be reported.
    (c) Noise certification reference conditions. (1) Meteorological 
conditions. Aircraft position and performance data and the noise 
measurements must be corrected to the following homogeneous noise 
certification reference atmospheric conditions:
    (i) Sea level pressure of 2116 psf (76 cm mercury).
    (ii) Ambient temperature of 77 degrees F (25 degrees C).
    (iii) Relative humidity of 70 percent.
    (iv) Zero wind.
    (2) Aircraft conditions. The reference condition for takeoff is the 
maximum weight, except as provided in Sec. 36.1581(b) of this part. The 
reference conditions for approach tests consist of--
    (i) Maximum landing weight, except as provided in Sec. 36.1581(d) of 
this part;

[[Page 774]]

    (ii) Approach angle of 3 degrees; and
    (iii) Aircraft height of 394 feet above the ground at the noise 
measuring station.
    (d) Data corrections. (1) Aircraft position and performance data and 
the noise measurement must be corrected to the noise certification 
reference conditions as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. The 
measured atmospheric conditions must be those obtained in accordance 
with section A36.1(c) of this appendix and paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section. Atmospheric attenuation sound corrections must be made under 
section A36.9 of this appendix.
    (2) The measured flight path must be corrected by an amount equal to 
the difference between the applicants predicted flight path for the 
certification reference conditions and the measured flight path at the 
test conditions. Necessary corrections relating to aircraft flight path 
or performance may be derived from approved data other than 
certification test data. The source noise must be corrected from 
approved data for the difference between measured and reference engine 
conditions, together with appropriate allowances for sound attenuation 
with distance. The Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) correction 
must be less than 2.0 EPNdB for any combination of the following:
    (i) The aircraft's not passing vertically above the measuring 
station.
    (ii) Any difference between 394 feet and the actual minimum distance 
of the aircraft's ILS antenna from the approach measuring station.
    (iii) Any difference between the actual approach angle and the noise 
certification reference approach flight path.
    (iv) Any correction of the measured noise levels which accounts for 
any difference between the test engine thrust or power and the reference 
engine thrust or power.
    Detailed correction requirements are prescribed in section A36.11 of 
this appendix.
    (3) Aircraft sound pressure levels within the 10 dB-down points 
(described in section B36.9 of Appendix B) must exceed the mean 
background sound pressure levels determined under section A36.3(f)(3) by 
at least 3 dB in each one-third octave band (or be corrected under an 
FAA approved method) to be included in the computation of the overall 
noise level of the aircraft. An EPNL may not be computed or reported 
from data from which more than four one-third octave bands in any 
spectrum within the 10 dB-down points have been excluded under this 
paragraph.
    (4) Where more than seven one-third octaves are within 3 dB of the 
ambient noise levels, a time/frequency interpolation of the noise data 
shall be performed using an approved procedure.
    (5) If equivalent test procedures, different from the reference 
procedures, are used, the test procedures and all methods for adjusting 
the results to the reference procedures must be approved by the FAA. The 
amounts of adjustments must not exceed 16 EPNdB on takeoff and 8 EPNdB 
on approach, and if the adjustments are more than 8 EPNdB and 4 EPNdB 
respectively, the resulting numbers must not be within 2 EPNdB of the 
appropriate Appendix C noise levels including tradeoffs.
    (e) Validity of results. (1) The test results must produce three 
mean EPNL values within the 90 percent confidence limits, each value 
consisting of the arithmetic mean of the corrected noise measurements 
for all valid test runs at the takeoff, approach, and sideline measuring 
stations, respectively. If more than one noise measurement system is 
used at any single measuring station, the resulting data for each test 
run (after correction) must be averaged as a single measurement. If more 
than one test site or noise measuring station location is used, each 
valid test run must be included in the computation of the mean EPNL 
values and their confidence limits.
    (2) The minimum sample size acceptable for each of the three 
certification measurements (takeoff, approaches, and sideline) is six. 
The number of samples must be large enough to establish statistically 
for each of the three mean noise certification levels a 90 percent 
confidence limit which does not exceed <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1.5 EPNdB. 
No test result may be omitted from the averaging process, unless 
otherwise specified by the FAA.
    (3) The mean EPNL values and their 90 percent confidence limits 
obtained by the procedure described in this paragraph must be those by 
which the noise emission of the aircraft is assessed against the noise 
certification criteria, and must be reported.
    (4) If equivalent procedures are to be used to certificate several 
airplane configurations of the same type from noise tests of a single 
airplane, the test procedures and analysis methods must be approved by 
the FAA. The request for approval must identify the noise measurement 
test procedures and data base, the airplane configurations, procedures 
and analysis methods, the method for establishing the 90 percent 
confidence limit for each noise certification level, and the proposed 
equivalent procedures.

Section A36.9  Atmospheric attenuation of sound.
    (a) General. The measured values of the one-third octave band 
spectra must conform, or be corrected, to the reference-day conditions 
listed in section A36.5(c) of this appendix. Each correction must 
account for any differences in the atmospheric attenuation of sound 
between the test-day conditions and the reference-day conditions along 
the sound

[[Page 778]]

propagation path between the aircraft and the microphone. Unless the 
meteorological conditions conform to those prescribed in section 
A36.1(c) of this appendix, the test data are not acceptable.
    (b) Meteorological measurements. (1) The wind velocity, temperature 
and relative humidity measurements required under this part must be 
measured in the vicinity of the noise measuring stations. The location 
of the meteorological measurements must be approved by the FAA as 
representative of those atmospheric conditions existing near the surface 
over the geographical area in which aircraft noise measurements are 
made. In some cases, a fixed meteorological station (such as those found 
at airports or other facilities) may meet this requirement.
    (2) The temperature and relative humidity must be measured from a 
point 10 meters above the surface at the measuring stations to the 
altitude of the aircraft, using previously approved equipment and 
methods.
    (3) Meteorological measurements must be obtained within 25 minutes 
of each noise test measurement. Meteorological data must be interpolated 
to actual times of each noise measurement.
    (c) Attenuation rates. The atmospheric attenuation rates of sound 
with distance for each one-third octave band from 50Hz to 10,000 Hz must 
be determined in accordance with the formulations and tabulations of SAE 
ARP 866A, entitled ``Standard Values of Atmospheric Absorption as a 
Function of Temperatures and Humidity for Use in Evaluating Aircraft 
Flyover Noise'' (as incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this 
part).
    (d) Correction for atmospheric attenuation. (1) EPNL values 
calculated for measured data must be corrected by the methods prescribed 
in section A36.11(d) of this appendix whenever--
    (i) The ambient atmospheric conditions of temperature and relative 
humidity do not conform to the reference conditions (77 degrees F. and 
70 percent, respectively), or
    (ii) The measured takeoff and approach flight paths do not conform 
to the reference flight paths.
    (2) If the atmospheric absorption coefficients do not vary over the 
PNLTM sound propagation path by more than <plus-minus> 1.6 dB/1000 ft 
(<plus-minus> 0.5 dB/100 meters) in the 3150 Hz one-third octave band 
from the value of the absorption coefficient derived from the 
meteorological measurement obtained at 10 meters above the surface, the 
mean of the values of the atmospheric absorption coefficients at 10 
meters above the surface and at the altitude of the aircraft at PNLTM 
may be used to determine the atmospheric attenuation rates for each one-
third octave band. The resulting atmospheric attenuation rate may be 
used to compute the PNLTM correction under section A36.11(d) of this 
appendix.
    (3) If the conditions do not conform to those prescribed in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the corrections for atmospheric 
attenuation must be determined by the following layered-atmosphere 
procedure:
    (i) The sound propagation path must be divided into increments no 
greater than 100 feet in altitude, and the average temperature and 
relative humidity that exists within each increment at the time of the 
test must be calculated from the meteorological data required under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Atmospheric attenuation rates must be determined under 
paragraph (c) of this section for each one-third octave band in each 
altitude increment.
    (iii) The mean attenuation rate over the complete sound propagation 
path from the aircraft to the microphone must be computed for each one-
third octave band from 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz. These rates must be used in 
computing the corrections required in section A36.11(d) of this 
appendix.

Section A36.11  Detailed correction procedures.
    (a) General. If the test conditions do not conform to those 
prescribed as noise certification reference conditions under section 
A36.5 of this appendix, the following correction procedure and 
requirements apply:
    (1) If a positive value results from any difference between 
reference and test conditions, and appropriate positive correction must 
be made to the EPNL calculated from the measured data. Conditions which 
can result in a positive value include:
    (i) Atmospheric absorption of sound under test conditions which is 
greater than the reference;
    (ii) Test flight path at an altitude which is higher than the 
reference; or
    (iii) Test weight which is less than maximum certification weight.
    (2) If a negative value results from any difference between 
reference and test conditions, no correction may be made to the EPNL 
calculated from the measured data, unless the difference results from:
    (i) An atmospheric absorption of sound under test conditions which 
is less than the reference; or
    (ii) A test flight path at an altitude which is lower than the 
reference.
    (3) The following correction procedures may produce one or more 
possible correction values which must be added algebraically to the EPNL 
calculated as if the tests were conducted completely under the noise 
certification reference conditions:
    (i) The flight profiles must be determined for both takeoff and 
approach, and for both reference and test conditions. The procedures 
require noise and flight path recording with a synchronized time signal 
from which the test profile can be delineated, including the aircraft 
position for which PNLTM is observed at the noise measuring station. For

[[Page 779]]

takeoff, the flight profile corrected to reference conditions may be 
derived from FAA approved manufacturer's data; however, for approach, 
the reference profile is prescribed under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (ii) The sound propagation paths to the microphone from the aircraft 
position corresponding to PNLTM are determined for both the test and 
reference profiles. The SPL values in the spectrum of PNLTM must then be 
corrected for the effects of--
    (A) Change in atmospheric sound absorption;
    (B) Atmospheric sound absorption on the change in sound propagation 
path length; and
    (C) Inverse square law on the change in sound propagation path 
length. The corrected values of SPL are then converted to PNLT from 
which must be subtracted PNLTM. The resulting difference represents the 
correction which must be added algebraically to the EPNL calculated from 
the measured data.
    (iii) The minimum distances from both the test and reference 
profiles to the noise measuring station must be calculated and used to 
determine a noise duration correction due to any change in the altitude 
of aircraft flyover. The duration correction must be added algebraically 
to the EPNL calculated from the measured data.
    (iv) From approved data in the form of curves or tables giving the 
variation of EPNL with engine thrust or test speed, corrections are 
determined and must be added to the EPNL (which is calculated from the 
measured data) to account for noise level changes due to differences 
between test conditions and reference conditions.
    (v) From approved data corrections are determined and must be added 
algebraically to the EPNL (which is calculated from measured data) to 
account for noise level changes due to differences between 3 degrees and 
the test approach angle.
    (b) Takeoff profiles. (1) Figure A1 illustrates a typical takeoff 
profile.
    (i) The aircraft begins the takeoff roll at point A, lifts off at 
point B, and initiates the first constant climb at point C at an angle 
<greek-b>. The noise abatement thrust cutback is started at point D and 
completed at point E where the second constant climb is defined by the 
angle <greek-g> (usually expressed in terms of the gradient in percent). 
The end of the noise certification takeoff flight path is represented by 
aircraft position F whose vertical projection on the flight track 
(extended centerline of the runway) is point M. The position of the 
aircraft must be recorded for the entire interval during which the 
measured aircraft noise level is within 10 dB of PNLTM. Position K is 
the takeoff noise measuring station whose distance AK is specified as 
21,325 feet (6,500 meters). However, if it is necessary to reduce AK to 
less than 21,325 feet, the procedures prescribed in paragraph (f) of 
this section must be followed. Position L is the sideline noise 
measuring station located on a line parallel to, and the prescribed 
distance from, the runway centerline where the noise level during 
takeoff is greatest.
    (ii) The takeoff profile is defined by five parameters--(A) AB, the 
length of takeoff roll; (B) <greek-b> the first constant climb angle; 
(C) <greek-g>, the second constant climb angle; and (D) <greek-d>, and 
e, the thrust cutback angles. These five parameters are functions of the 
aircraft performance and weight, and the atmospheric conditions of 
temperature, pressure, and wind velocity and direction.
    (2) If the test conditions do not conform to those prescribed as 
reference conditions under section A36.5 of this appendix, the 
corresponding test and reference profile parameters will be different, 
as shown in Figure A2. The profile parameter changes, identifies as 
<greek-D>AB, <greek-D><greek-b>, <greek-D><greek-g>, <greek-D><greek-d>, 
and <greek-D><greek-e may be derived from the manufacturer's data (if 
approved by the FAA) and may be used to define the fight profile 
corrected to the reference conditions. The relationships between the 
measured and corrected takeoff flight profiles may then be used to 
determine the corrections, which, if positive, must be applied to the 
EPNL calculated from the measured data.

    Note: Under reference atmospheric conditions and with maximum 
takeoff weight, the gradient of the second constant climb angle 
(<greek-g>) may not be less than 4 percent. However, the actual gradient 
will depend upon the test atmospheric conditions, assuming maximum 
takeoff weight and the parameters characterizing engine performance are 
constant (rpm, epr, or any other parameter used by the pilot).
    (3) Figure A3 illustrates portions of the measured and corrected 
takeoff flight paths including the significant geometrical relationships 
influencing sound propagation. EF represents the measured second 
constant flight path with climb angle <greek-g>, and EcFc represents the

path at reduced climb angle <greek-g>-<greek-D><greek-g>. Position Q 
represents the aircraft location on the measured takeoff flight path for 
which PNLTM is observed at the noise measuring station K, and Qc is the 
corresponding position on the corrected flight path. The measured and 
corrected sound propagation paths are KQ and KQc, respectively, which 
form the same angle <greek-th with their flight paths. Position R 
represents the point on the measured takeoff flight path nearest the 
noise measuring station K, and Rc is the corresponding position on the 
corrected flight path. The minimum distance to the measured and 
corrected flight paths are indicated by the lines KR and KRc, 
respectively, which are normal to their flight paths.

    (c) Approach profiles. (1) Figure A4 illustrates a typical approach 
profile.
    (i) The beginning of the noise certification approach profile is 
represented by aircraft position G whose vertical projection on the 
flight track (extended centerline of the runway) is point P. The 
position of the aircraft should be recorded for a distance OP from the 
runway threshold O to ensure recording of the entire interval during 
which the measured aircraft noise is within 10 dB of PNLTM.
    (ii) The aircraft approaches at an angle passes vertically over the 
noise measuring station N at a height of NH, begins the level off at 
position I, and touches down at position J. The distance ON is 
prescribed as 6,562 feet (2,000 meters).
    (iii) The approach profile is defined by the approach angle    and 
the height NH which are functions of the aircraft operating conditions 
controlled by the pilot. If the measured approach profile parameters do 
not conform to the corresponding reference approach parameters (3 
degrees and 394 feet, respectively, as shown in Figure A5), corrections, 
if positive, must be applied to the EPNL calculated from the measured 
data.

    (2) Figure A6 illustrates portions of the measured and reference 
approach flight paths, including the significant geometrical 
relationships influencing sound propagation. GI represents the measured 
approach path with approach angle --, and GrIr represents the reference 
approach flight path at lower altitude and approach angle of 3 degrees. 
Position S represents the aircraft location on the measured approach 
flight path for which PNLTM is observed at the noise measuring station 
N, and Sr is the corresponding position on the reference approach flight 
path. The measured and corrected sound propagation paths are NS and NSr, 
respectively, which form the same angle <greek-l> with their flight 
paths. Position T represents the point on the measured approach flight 
path nearest the noise measuring station N, and Tr is the corresponding 
point on the reference approach flight path. The minimum distances to 
the measured and reference flight paths are indicated by the lines NT 
and NTr, respectively, which are normal to their flight paths. NOTE: The 
reference approach flight path is defined by --=3 degrees and NH=394 
feet. Consequently NTr can also be defined; NTr=393 feet to the nearest 
foot and is, therefore, considered to be one of the reference 
parameters.
    (d) PNLT corrections. If the ambient atmospheric conditions of 
temperature and relative humidity are not those prescribed as reference 
conditions under Sec. A36.5(c) of this appendix (77 degrees F and 70 
percent, respectively), corrections to the EPNL values must be 
calculated from the measured data under paragraph (a) of this section as 
follows:
    (1) Takeoff flight path. For the takeoff flight path shown in Figure 
A3, the spectrum of PNLTM observed at station K for the aircraft at 
position Q is decomposed into its individual SPLi values.
    (i) Step 1. A set of corrected values are then computed as follows:

SPLic=SPLi
  
  
+(<greek-a>i-<greek-a>io) KQ
+<greek-a>io (KQ-KQc)
+20 log (KQ/KQc)

where SPLi and SPLic are the measured and corrected sound pressure 
levels, respectively, in the i-th one-third octave band. The first 
correction term accounts for the effects of change in atmospheric sound 
absorption where <greek-a>i and <greek-a>io are the sound absorption 
coefficients for the test (determined under section A36.9(d)) and 
reference atmospheric conditions, respectively, for the i-th one-third 
octave band and KQ is the measured takeoff sound propagation path. The 
second correction term accounts for the effects of atmospheric sound 
absorption on the change in the sound propagation path length where KQc 
is the corrected takeoff sound propagation path. The third correction 
term accounts for the effects of the inverse square law on the change in 
the sound propagation path length.
    (ii) Step 2. The corrected values of SPLic are then converted to 
PNLT and a correction term calculated as follows:

[[Page 784]]

                          <greek-D>1=PNLT-PNLTM

which represents the correction to be added algebraically to the EPNL 
calculated from the measured data.
    (2) Approach flight path.
    (i) The procedure prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for 
takeoff flight paths is also used for the approach flight path, except 
that the value for SPLic relate to the approach sound propagation paths 
shown in Figure A6 as follows:

SPLic=SPLi
  
  
+(<greek-a>i-<greek-a>io) NS
+<greek-a>io (NS-NSr)
+20 log (NS/NSr)

where NS and NSr are the measured and reference approach sound 
propagation paths, respectively.
    (ii) The remainder of the procedure is the same as that prescribed 
in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, regarding takeoff flight path.
    (3) Sideline flight path. The procedure prescribed in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section for takeoff flight paths is also used for the 
sideline flight path, except that the values of SPLic relate only to the 
measured sideline sound propagation path as follows:

SPLic=SPLi
  
  
+(<greek-a>i-<greek-a>io) LX
+<greek-a>io (LX-LXc)
+20 log (LX/LXc)

where LX is the measured sideline sound propagation path from station L 
(Figure A1) to position X of the aircraft for which PNLTM is observed at 
station L and LXc is the corrected sideline sound propagation path.
    (e) Duration corrections. If the measured takeoff and approach 
flight paths do not conform to those prescribed as the corrected and 
reference flight paths, under section A36.11 (b) and (c) respectively, 
it will be necessary to apply duration corrections to the EPNL values 
calculated from the measured data. Such corrections must be calculated 
as follows:
    (1) Takeoff flight path. For the takeoff flight path shown in Figure 
A3, the correction term is calculated using the formula--

<greek-D>2 = -7.5 log (KR/KRc)

which represents the correction which must be added algebraically to the 
EPNL calculated from the measured data. The lengths KR and KRc are the 
measured and corrected takeoff minimum distances from the noise 
measuring station K to the measured and the corrected flight paths 
respectively. A negative sign indicates that, for the particular case of 
a duration correction, the EPNL calculated from the measured data must 
be reduced if the measured flight path is at a greater altitude than the 
corrected flight path.
    (2) Approach flight path. For the approach flight path shown in 
Figure A6, the correction term is calculated using the formula--

<greek-D> 2 = -7.5 log (NT/393)

where NT is the measured approach minimum distance from the noise 
measuring station N to the measured flight path and 393 feet is the 
minimum distance from station N to the reference flight path.
    (3) Sideline flight path. For the sideline flight path, the 
correction term is calculated using the formula--

<greek-D> 2 = -7.5 log (LX/LXc)

 where LX and LXc are the measured and corrected sideline noise 
measuring distances, respectively, from the noise measuring station L to 
the aircraft position X or X<INF>c</INF>, respectively on the takeoff 
flight path.
    (f) Nonstandard location correction. When takeoff and approach noise 
measurements are conducted at points other than those prescribed in 
section C36.1 of Appendix C, the EPNL value computed from these 
measurements must be corrected to the value that would have occurred at 
the prescribed measuring points under one of the following procedures:
    (1) Simplified procedure. Unless the amount of adjustment exceeds 8 
dB on takeoff or 4 dB on approach, or the correction results in a final 
EPNL value which is within 1.0 dB of the noise levels prescribed in 
Appendix C of this part, the correction procedures prescribed in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section may be used. Since this procedure 
accounts for extrapolation of PNLTM from the close-in measurement 
station to the prescribed measuring point, the remaining corrections for 
differences between test and reference conditions, including thrust and 
airspeed, must be made afterward.
    (2) Integrated procedure. If the correction factor exceeds 8 dB on 
takeoff or 4 dB on approach, or the correction results in a final EPNL 
value which is within 1.0 dB of the noise levels prescribed in Appendix 
C of this part, the following correction procedure must be used:
    (i) Each \1/2\ second spectrum measured during a flyover at a noise 
measuring station which is closer to the flight path than the prescribed 
reference distance must be adjusted under a procedure similar to that 
prescribed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, regarding PNLT 
corrections. However, the distances which must be used are those values 
of KQ and KQc for the sound propagation path (and hence value of 
<greek-th) for PNLTM which represents the actual, measured sound 
propagation path (and path angle), and the corresponding sound 
propagation path (and path angle) as if the measurements had been made 
at the 21,325 foot measuring point under reference acoustic-day 
conditions.

[[Page 785]]

    (ii) After the measured one half (\1/2\) second spectra have been 
corrected to the measuring points prescribed in section C36.1 of 
Appendix C, the remaining noise evaluation must be conducted under the 
procedures prescribed in Appendix B of this part, including the 
appropriate reference thrust and air speed corrections.

    Section B36.1 General. The procedures in this appendix must be used 
to determine the noise evaluation quantity designated as effective 
perceived noise level, EPNL, under Secs. 36.103 and 36.803. These 
procedures, which use the physical properties of noise measured as 
prescribed by Appendix A of this part, consist of the following:
    (a) The 24 one-third octave bands of sound pressure level are 
converted to perceived noisiness by means of a noy table. The noy values 
are combined and then converted to instantaneous perceived noise levels, 
PNL(k).
    (b) A tone correction factor, C(k), is calculated for each spectrum 
to account for the subjective response to the presence of the maximum 
tone.
    (c) The tone correction factor is added to the perceived noise level 
to obtain tone corrected perceived noise levels, PNLT(k), at each one-
half second increment of time. The instantaneous values of tone 
corrected perceived noise level are noted with respect to time and the 
maximum value, PNLTM, is determined.

                           PNLT(k)=PNL(k)+C(k)

    (d) A duration correction factor, D, is computed by integration 
under the curve of tone corrected perceived noise level versus time.
    (e) Effective perceived noise level, EPNL, is determined by the 
algebraic sum of the maximum tone corrected perceived noise level and 
the duration correction factor.

                              EPNL=PNLTM+D

    Section B36.3 Perceived noise level. Instantaneous perceived noise 
levels, PNL(k), must be calculated from instantaneous one-third octave 
band sound pressure levels, SPL(i,k), as follows:
    (a) Step 1. Convert each one-third octave band SPL(i,k), from 50 to 
10,000 Hz, to perceived noisiness, n(i,k), by reference to Table B1, or 
to the mathematical formulation of the noy table given in Sec. B36.13 of 
this appendix.
    (b) Step 2. Combine the perceived noisiness values, n(i,k), found in 
step 1 by the following formula:
N(k)=n(k)+0.15 [[<greek-S><SUP>24</SUP>i-1
n(i,k)]-n (k)]=0.85
n(K)+0.15<greek-S><SUP>24</SUP>i-1n(i,k)

where n(k) is the largest of the 24 values of n(i,k) and N(k) is the 
total perceived noisiness.
    (c) Step 3. Convert the total perceived noisiness, N(k), into 
perceived noise level, PNL(k), by the following formula:

                       PNL(k)=40.0+33.22 log N(k)

which is plotted in Figure B1. PNL(k) may also be obtained by choosing 
N(k) in the 1,000 Hz column of Table B1 and then reading the 
corresponding value of SPL(i,k) which, at 1,000 Hz, equals PNL(k).

    Section B36.5 Correction for spectral irregularities. Noise having 
pronounced irregularities in the spectrum (for example, discrete 
frequency components or tones), must be adjusted by the correction 
factor C(k) calculated as follows:
    (a) Step 1. Starting with the corrected sound pressure level in the 
80 Hz one-third octave band (band number 3), calculate the changes in 
sound pressure level (or ``slopes'') in the remainder of the one-third 
octave bands as follows:

s(3,k)=no value
s(4,k)=SPL(4,k)-SPL(3,k)
.
.
.
s(i,k)=SPL(i,k)-SPL[(i-l),k]
.
.
.
s(24,k)=SPL(24,k)-SPL(23,k)

    (b) Step 2. Encircle the value of the slope, s(i,k), where the 
absolute value of the change in slope is greater than 5; that is, where

           || <greek-D>s(i,k) || = || s(i,k)-s[(i-1),k] || >5

    (c) Step 3. (1) If the encircled value of the slope s(i,k) is 
positive and algebraically greater than the slope s[(i-1),k], encircle 
SPL(I,K).
    (2) If the encircled value of the slope s(1,k) is zero or negative 
and the slope s[i-1),k] is positive, encircle (SPL[(i-1),k])
    (3) For all other cases, no sound pressure level value is to be 
encircled.
    (d) Step 4. Omit all SPL(i,k) encircled in Step 3 and compute new 
sound pressure levels SPL'(i,k) as follows:
    (1) For nonencircled sound pressure levels, let the new sound 
pressure levels equal the original sound pressure levels,

                           SPL'(i,k)=SPL(i,k)

    (2) For encircled sound pressure levels in bands 1-23, let the new 
sound pressure level equal the arithmetic average of the preceding and 
following sound pressure levels.

              SPL'(i,k)=(\1/2\)[SPL[(i-1),k]+SPL[(i+1),k]]

    (3) If the sound pressure level in the highest frequency band (i=24) 
is encircled, let the new sound pressure level in that band equal

                      SPL'(24,k)=SPL(23,k+s(23,k).

    (e) Step 5. Recompute new slopes s' (i,k), including one for an 
imaginary 25-th band, as follows:

s'(3,k)=s'(4,k)
s'(4,k)=SPL'(4,k)-SPL'(3,k)
.
.
.
s'(i,k)=SPL'(i,k)-SPL'[(i-1),k]
s'(24,k)=SPL'(24,k)-SPL'(23,k)
s'(25,k)=s'(24,k)

    (f) Step 6. For i from 3 to 23, compute the arithmetic average of 
the three adjacent slopes as follows:
s(i,k)=(\1/3\)[s'(i,k)+s'[(i+1),k] +s'[(i+2),k]]
    (g) Step 7. Compute final adjusted one-third octave-band sound 
pressure levels, SPL'' (i,k), by beginning with band number 3 and 
proceeding to band number 24 as follows:

SPL''(3,k)=SPL(3,k)
SPL''(4,k)=SPL''(3.k)+s(3.k)
.
.
.
SPL''(i,k)=SPL''[(i-1),k]+s[(i-1),k]
.
.
.
SPL''(24,k)=SPL''(23,k)+s(23,k)

    (h) Step 8. Calculate the differences, F(i,k), between the original 
and the adjusted sound pressure levels as follows:

                       F(i,k)=SPL(i,k)-SPL''(i,k)

and note only value greater than one and a half.
    (i) Step 9. For each of the 24 one-third octave bands, determine 
tone correction factors from the sound pressure level differences F(i,k) 
and Table B2.

    (j) Step 10. Designate the largest of the tone correction factors, 
determined in Step 9, as C(k). An example of the tone correction 
procedure is given in Table B3.
    (k) Tone corrected perceived noise levels PNLT(k) are determined by 
adding the C(k) values to corresponding PNL(k) values, that is,

                           PNLT(k)=PNL(k)+C(k)

    (l) For any i-th one-third octave band, at any k-th increment of 
time, for which the tone correction factor is suspected to result from 
something other than (or in addition to) an actual tone (or any special 
irregularity other than aircraft noise), an additional analysis may be 
made using a filter with a bandwidth narrower than one-third of an 
octave. If the narrow band analysis corroborates that suspicion, then a 
revised value for the background sound pressure level, SPL''(i,k) may be 
determined from the analysis and used to compute a revised tone 
correction factor, F(i,k), for that particular one-third octave band.
    (m) Tones resulting from ground-plane reflections in the 800 Hz and 
lower one-third octave bands may be excluded from the calculation of 
corrections for spectral irregularities. To qualify for this exclusion, 
the pseudotones must be clearly identified as not being related to the 
engine noise. This identification may be made either by comparing 
measured data with data from a flush

[[Page 793]]

mounted microphone, or by observing the Doppler shift characteristics of 
the tone during the flyover-noise/time history. Since pseudotones are 
related to ground reflections, a microphone mounted flush to the ground 
will yield a spectral shape which can be distinguished from that 
produced by the 4-foot high microphone at those frequencies which can be 
related to ground reflection's geometrical relationships. Identification 
through Doppler shifting (the symmetric variation of frequency with 
time) can be made because the Doppler frequency variation yields a 
frequency increase for an approaching signal and a frequency decrease 
for a receding signal. Pseudotones at frequencies above 800 Hz generally 
should not yield significant tone corrections. However, for consistency, 
each tone correction value must be included in the computation for 
spectral irregularities. While the tone corrections below 800 Hz may be 
ignored for the spectral irregularity correction, the SPL values must be 
included in the noy calculation prescribed in section B36.13 of this 
appendix.
    (n) After the value of PNLTM for each flyover-noise/time history, is 
identified, the frequency for the largest tone correction factor (C(k)) 
must be identified for the two preceding and the two succeeding, 500-
milli-second time intervals, to identify possible tone suppression at 
PNLTM as a result of band sharing of the tone. If the value of C(k) for 
PNLTM is less than the average value of C(k) for those five consecutive 
time intervals, that average value of C(k) must be used to compute a new 
value for PNLTM.
    Section B36.7 Maximum tone corrected perceived noise level. (a) The 
maximum tone corrected perceived noise level, PNLTM, is the maximum 
calculated value of the tone corrected perceived noise level, PNLT(k), 
calculated in accordance with the procedure of section B36.5 of this 
appendix. Figure B2 is an example of a flyover noise time history where 
the maximum value is clearly indicated. Half-second time intervals, 
<greek-D>t, are small enough to obtain a satisfactory noise time

    (b) If there are no pronounced irregularities in the spectrum, then 
the procedure of Sec. B36.5 of this Appendix would be redundant since 
PNLT(k) would be identically equal to PNL(k). For this case, PNLTM would 
be the maximum value of PNL(k) and would equal PNLM.
    Section B36.9 Duration correction. The duration correction factor D 
is determined by the integration technique defined by the expression:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.106

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.107

Where T is a normalizing time constant, PNLTM is the maximum value of 
PNLT, and t(1) and t(2) are the limits of the significant noise time 
history.
    (a) Since PNLT is calculated from measured values of SPL, there 
will, in general, be no obvious equation for PNLT as a function of time. 
Consequently, the equation can be rewritten with a summation sign 
instead of an integral sign as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.108


[[Page 796]]


where <greek-D>t is the length of the equal increments of time for which 
PNLT(k) is calculated and d is the time interval to the nearest 1.0 
second during which PNLT(k) is within a specified value, h, of PNLTM.
    (b) Half-second time intervals for <greek-D>t are small enough to 
obtain a satisfactory history of the perceived noise level. A shorter 
time interval may be selected by the applicant provided approved limits 
and constants are used.
    (c) The following values for T, <greek-D>t,and h, must be used in 
calculating D:

                                T=10 sec,

    <greek-D>t=0.5 sec. (or the approved sampling time interval), and

                                h=10 dB.

Using the above values, the equation for D becomes
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.109

Where the integer d is the duration time defined by the points that are 
10 dB less than PNLTM.
    (d) If the 10 dB-down points fall between calculated PNLT(k) values 
(the usual case), the applicable limits for the duration time must be 
chosen from the PNLT(k) values closest to PNLTM-10. For those cases with 
more than one peak value of PNLT(k), the applicable limits must be 
chosen to yield the largest possible value for the duration time.
    (e) If the value of PNLT(k) at the 10 dB-down points is 90 PNdB or 
less, the value of d may be taken as the time interval between the 
initial and the final times for which PNLT(k) equals 90 PNdB.
    (f) The aircraft testing procedures must include the 10 dB-down 
points in the flyover noise/time record.
    Section B36.11 Effective perceived noise level. (a) The total 
subjective effect of an aircraft flyover is designated ``effective 
perceived noise level,'' EPNL, and is equal to the algebraic sum of the 
maximum value of the tone corrected perceived noise level, PNLTM, and 
the duration correction, D. That is,

                              EPNL=PNLTM+D

where PNLTM and D are calculated under sections B36.7 and B36.9 of this 
appendix.
    (b) The above equation can be rewritten by substituting the equation 
for D from Sec. B36.9 of this appendix, that is,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.110

    (c) If, during a test flight, one or more peak values of PNLT are 
observed which are within 2 dB of PNLTM, the value of EPNL shall be 
calculated for each, as well as for PNLTM. If any EPNL value exceeds the 
value at the moment of PNLTM, the maximum value of such exceedance must 
be added as a further adjustment to the EPNL calculated from the 
measured data.

    Section B36.13  Mathematical formulation of noy tables.
    (a) The relationship between sound pressure level and perceived 
noisiness given in Table B1 is illustrated in Figure B3. The variation 
of log (n) with SPL for a given one-third octave band can be expressed 
by straight lines as shown in Figure B3.
    (1) The slopes of the straight lines M(b), M(c), and M(d) and M(e);
    (2) The intercepts of the lines on the SPL axis, SPL (b) and SPL 
(c); and
    (3) The coordinates of the discontinuities, SPL (a) and log n(a); 
SPL (d) and log n = -1.0; and SPL (e) and log n = log (0.3).
    (b) The important aspects of the mathematical formulation are:

(1) SPL <gr-thn-eq> SPL (a)

    n = antilog [M(c)*(SPL-SPL(c))]

(2) SPL (b) <ls-thn-eq> SPL < SPL (a)

    n = antilog [M(b)*(SPL-SPL(b))]

(3) SPL (e) <ls-thn-eq> SPL < SPL (b)

    n = antilog [M(e)*(SPL-SPL(b))]

(4) SPL (d) <ls-thn-eq> SPL < SPL (e)

    n = 0.1 antilog [M(d)*(SPL-SPL(d))]

    (c) Table B4 lists the values of the important constants necessary 
to calculate sound

procedures for measuring and correcting noise data for the propeller 
driven small airplanes specified in Secs. 36.1 and 36.501(b).

                        part b--noise measurement

Sec. F36.101   General test conditions.

    (a) The test area must be relatively flat terrain having no 
excessive sound absorption characteristics such as those caused by 
thick, matted, or tall grass, by shrubs, or by wooded areas. No 
obstructions which significantly influence the sound field from the 
airplane may exist within a conical space above the measurement 
position, the cone being defined by an axis normal to the ground and by 
a half-angle 75 degrees from this axis.
    (b) The tests must be carried out under the following conditions:
    (1) There may be no precipitation.
    (2) Relative humidity may not be higher than 90 percent or lower 
than 30 percent.
    (3) Ambient temperature may not be above 86 degrees F. or below 41 
degrees F. at 33' above ground. If the measurement site is within 1 n.m. 
of an airport thermometer the airport reported temperature may be used.
    (4) Reported wind may not be above 10 knots at 33' above ground. If 
wind velocities of more than 4 knots are reported, the flight direction 
must be aligned to within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>15 degrees of wind 
direction and flights with tail wind and head wind must be made in equal 
numbers. If the measurement site is within 1 n.m. of an airport 
anemometer, the airport reported wind may be used.
    (5) There may be no temperature inversion or anomalous wind 
conditions that would significantly alter the noise level of the 
airplane when the noise is recorded at the required measuring point.
    (6) The flight test procedures, measuring equipment, and noise 
measurement procedures must be approved by the FAA.
    (7) Sound pressure level data for noise evaluation purposes must be 
obtained with acoustical equipment that complies with section F36.103 of 
this appendix.

Sec. F36.103   Acoustical measurement system. The acoustical measurement 
          system must consist of approved equipment equivalent to the 
          following:

    (a) A microphone system with frequency response compatible with 
measurement and analysis system accuracy as prescribed in section 
F36.105 of this appendix.
    (b) Tripods or similar microphone mountings that minimize 
interference with the sound being measured.
    (c) Recording and reproducing equipment characteristics, frequency 
response, and dynamic range compatible with the response and accuracy 
requirements of section F36.105 of this appendix.
    (d) Acoustic calibrators using sine wave or broadband noise of known 
sound pressure level. If broadband noise is used, the signal must be 
described in terms of its average and maximum root-mean-square (rms) 
value for nonoverload signal level.

Sec. F36.105   Sensing, recording, and reproducing equipment.

    (a) The noise produced by the airplane must be recorded. A magnetic 
tape recorder is acceptable.
    (b) The characteristics of the system must comply with the 
recommendations in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 
Publication No. 179, entitled ``Precision Sound Level Meters'' as 
incorporated by reference in Part 36 under Sec. 36.6 of this part.
    (c) The response of the complete system to a sensibly plane 
progressive sinusoidal wave of constant amplitude must lie within the 
tolerance limits specified in IEC Publication No. 179, dated 1973, over 
the frequency range 45 to 11,200 Hz.
    (d) If limitations of the dynamic range of the equipment make it 
necessary, high frequency pre-emphasis must be added to the recording 
channel with the converse de-emphasis on playback. The pre-emphasis must 
be applied such that the instantaneous recorded sound pressure level of 
the noise signal between 800 and 11,200 Hz does not vary more than 20 dB 
between the maximum and minimum one-third octave bands.
    (e) If requested by the Administrator, the recorded noise signal 
must be read through an ``A'' filter with dynamic characteristics 
designated ``slow,'' as defined in IEC Publication No. 179, dated 1973. 
The output signal from the filter must be fed to a rectifying circuit 
with square law rectification, integrated with time constants for charge 
and discharge of about 1 second or 800 milliseconds.
    (f) The equipment must be acoustically calibrated using facilities 
for acoustic freefield calibration and if analysis of the tape recording 
is requested by the Administrator, the analysis equipment shall be 
electronically calibrated by a method approved by the FAA.
    (g) A windscreen must be employed with microphone during all 
measurements of aircraft noise when the wind speed is in excess of 6 
knots.

Sec. F36.107   Noise measurement procedures.

    (a) The microphones must be oriented in a known direction so that 
the maximum sound

[[Page 803]]

received arrives as nearly as possible in the direction for which the 
microphones are calibrated. The microphone sensing elements must be 
approximately 4' above ground.
    (b) Immediately prior to and after each test; a recorded acoustic 
calibration of the system must be made in the field with an acoustic 
calibrator for the two purposes of checking system sensitivity and 
providing an acoustic reference level for the analysis of the sound 
level data.
    (c) The ambient noise, including both acoustical background and 
electrical noise of the measurement systems, must be recorded and 
determined in the test area with the system gain set at levels that will 
be used for aircraft noise measurements. If aircraft sound pressure 
levels do not exceed the background sound pressure levels by at least 10 
dB(A), approved corrections for the contribution of background sound 
pressure level to the observed sound pressure level must be applied.

Sec. F36.109   Data recording, reporting, and approval.

    (a) Data representing physical measurements or corrections to 
measured data must be recorded in permanent form and appended to the 
record except that corrections to measurements for normal equipment 
response deviations need not be reported. All other corrections must be 
approved. Estimates must be made of the individual errors inherent in 
each of the operations employed in obtaining the final data.
    (b) Measured and corrected sound pressure levels obtained with 
equipment conforming to the specifications described in section F36.105 
of this appendix must be reported.
    (c) The type of equipment used for measurement and analysis of all 
acoustic, airplane performance, and meteorological data must be 
reported.
    (d) The following atmospheric data, measured immediately before, 
after, or during each test at the observation points prescribed in 
section F36.101 of this appendix must be reported:
    (1) Air temperature and relative humidity.
    (2) Maximum, minimum, and average wind velocities.
    (e) Comments on local topography, ground cover, and events that 
might interfere with sound recordings must be reported.
    (f) The following airplane information must be reported:
    (1) Type, model and serial numbers (if any) of airplanes, engines, 
and propellers.
    (2) Any modifications or nonstandard equipment likely to affect the 
noise characteristics of the airplane.
    (3) Maximum certificated takeoff weights.
    (4) Airspeed in knots for each overflight of the measuring point.
    (5) Engine performance in terms of revolutions per minute and other 
relevant parameters for each overflight.
    (6) Aircraft height in feet determined by a calibrated altimeter in 
the aircraft, approved photographic techniques, or approved tracking 
facilities.
    (g) Aircraft speed and position and engine performance parameters 
must be recorded at an approved sampling rate sufficient to ensure 
compliance with the test procedures and conditions of this appendix.

Sec. F36.111   Flight procedures.

    (a) Tests to demonstrate compliance with the noise level 
requirements of this appendix must include at least six level flights 
over the measuring station at a height of 1,000<SUP>'</SUP> 
plus-minus</SUP>30' and <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 degrees from the zenith 
when passing overhead.
    (b) Each test over flight must be conducted:
    (1) At not less than the highest power in the normal operating range 
provided in an Airplane Flight Manual, or in any combination of approved 
manual material, approved placard, or approved instrument markings; and
    (2) At stabilized speed with propellers synchronized and with the 
airplane in cruise configuration, except that if the speed at the power 
setting prescribed in this paragraph would exceed the maximum speed 
authorized in level flight, accelerated flight is acceptable.

                         part c--data correction

Sec. F36.201   Correction of data.

    (a) Noise data obtained when the temperature is outside the range of 
68 degrees F. <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 degrees F., or the relative 
humidity is below 40 percent, must be corrected to 77 degrees F. and 70 
percent relative humidity by a method approved by the FAA.
    (b) The performance correction prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section must be used. It must be determined by the method described in 
this appendix, and must be added algebraically to the measured value. It 
is limited to 5dB(A).
    (c) The performance correction must be computed by using the 
following formula:

[[Page 804]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.113


Where:
D<INF>50</INF>=Takeoff distance to 50 feet at maximum certificated 
takeoff weight.
R/C=Certificated best rate of climb (fpm).
Vy =Speed for best rate of climb in the same units as rate of climb.

    (d) When takeoff distance to 50' is not listed as approved 
performance information, the figures of 2000 for single-engine airplanes 
and 1600' for multi-engine airplanes must be used.

Sec. F36.203   Validity of results.

    (a) The test results must produce an average dB(A) and its 90 
percent confidence limits, the noise level being the arithmetic average 
of the corrected acoustical measurements for all valid test runs over 
the measuring point.
    (b) The samples must be large enough to establish statistically a 90 
pecent confidence limit not to exceed <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1.5 dB(A). No 
test result may be omitted from the averaging process, unless omission 
is approved by the FAA.

                          part d--noise limits

Sec. F36.301   Aircraft noise limits.

    (a) Compliance with this section must be shown with noise data 
measured and corrected as prescribed in Parts B and C of this appendix.
    (b) For airplanes for which application for a type certificate is 
made on or after October 10, 1973, the noise level must not exceed 68 
dB(A) up to and including aircraft weights of 1,320 pounds (600 kg.). 
For weights greater than 1,320 pounds up to and including 3,630 pounds 
(1.650 kg.) the limit increases at the rate of 1 dB/165 pounds (1 dB/75 
kg.) to 82 dB(A) at 3,630 pounds, after which it is constant at 82 
dB(A). However, airplanes produced under type certificates covered by 
this paragraph must also meet paragraph (d) of this section for the 
original issuance of standard airworthiness certificates or restricted 
category airworthiness certificates if those airplanes have not had 
flight time before the date specified in that paragraph.
    (c) For airplanes for which application for a type certificate is 
made on or after January 1, 1975, the noise levels may not exceed the 
noise limit curve prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, except 
that 80 dB(A) may not be exceeded.
    (d) For airplanes for which application is made for a standard 
airworthiness certificate or for a restricted category airworthiness 
certificate, and that have not had any flight time before January 1, 
1980, the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section apply, 
regardless of date of application, to the original issuance of the 
certificate for that airplane.

                             part a--general

Section G36.1 Scope. This appendix prescribes limiting noise levels and 
procedures for measuring noise and adjusting these data to standard 
conditions, for propeller driven small airplanes and propeller-driven, 
commuter category airplanes specified in Secs. 36.1 and 36.501(c).

                        part b--noise measurement

Sec. G36.101 General Test Conditions.
    (a) The test area must be relatively flat terrain having no 
excessive sound absorption characteristics such as those caused by

[[Page 805]]

thick, matted, or tall grass, by shrubs, or by wooded areas. No 
obstructions which significantly influence the sound field from the 
airplane may exist within a conical space above the measurement 
position, the cone being defined by an axis normal to the ground and by 
a half-angle 75 degrees from the normal ground axis.
    (b) The tests must be carried out under the following conditions:
    (1) No precipitation;
    (2) Ambient air temperature between 36 and 95 degrees F (2.2 and 35 
degrees C);
    (3) Relative humidity between 20 percent and 95 percent, 
inclusively;
    (4) Wind speed may not exceed 10 knots (19 km/h) and cross wind may 
not exceed 5 knots (9 km/h), using a 30-second average;
    (5) No temperature inversion or anomalous wind condition that would 
significantly alter the noise level of the airplane when the nose is 
recorded at the required measuring point, and
    (6) The meteorological measurements must be made between 4 ft. (1.2 
m) and 33 ft. (10 m) above ground level. If the measurement site is 
within 1 n.m. of an airport meteorological station, measurements from 
that station may be used.
    (c) The flight test procedures, measuring equipment, and noise 
measurement procedures must be approved by the FAA.
    (d) Sound pressure level data for noise evaluation purposes must be 
obtained with acoustical equipment that complies with section G36.103 of 
this appendix.
Sec. G36.103 Acoustical Measurement System.
    The acoustical measurement system must consist of approved equipment 
with the following characteristics: (a) A microphone system with 
frequency response compatible with measurement and analysis system 
accuracy as prescribed in section G36.105 of this appendix.
    (b) Tripods or similar microphone mountings that minimize 
interference with the sound being measured.
    (c) Recording and reproducing equipment characteristics, frequency 
response, and dynamic range compatible with the response and accuracy 
requirements of section G36.105 of this appendix.
    (d) Acoustic calibrators using sine wave or broadband noise of known 
sound pressure level. If broadband noise is used, the signal must be 
described in terms of its average and maximum root-mean-square (rms) 
value for non-overload signal level.
Sec. G36.105 Sensing, Recording, and Reproducing Equipment.
    (a) The noise produced by the airplane must be recorded. A magnetic 
tape recorder, graphic level recorder, or sound level meter is 
acceptable when approved by the regional certificating authority.
    (b) The characteristics of the complete system must comply with the 
requirements in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 
Publications No. 651, entitled ``Sound Level Meters'' and No. 561, 
entitled ``Electro-acoustical Measuring Equipment for Aircraft Noise 
Certification'' as incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this 
part. Sound level meters must comply with the requirements for Type 1 
sound level meters as specified in IEC Publication No. 651.
    (c) The response of the complete system to a sensibly plane 
progressive sinusoidal wave of constant amplitude must be within the 
tolerance limits specified in IEC Publication No. 651, over the 
frequency range 45 to 11,200 Hz.
    (d) If equipment dynamic range limitations make it necessary, high 
frequency pre-emphasis must be added to the recording channel with the 
converse de-emphasis on playback. The pre-emphasis must be applied such 
that the instantaneous recorded sound pressure level of the noise signal 
between 800 and 11,200 Hz does not vary more than 20 dB between the 
maximum and minimum one-third octave bands.
    (e) The output noise signal must be read through an ``A'' filter 
with dynamic characteristics designated ``slow'' as defined in IEC 
Publication No. 651. A graphic level recorder, sound level meter, or 
digital equivalent may be used.
    (f) The equipment must be acoustically calibrated using facilities 
for acoustic free-field calibration and if analysis of the tape 
recording is requested by the Administrator, the analysis equipment 
shall be electronically calibrated by a method approved by the FAA. 
Calibrations shall be performed, as appropriate, in accordance with 
paragraph A36.3(e) of Appendix A of this part.
    (g) A windscreen must be employed with the microphone during all 
measurements of aircraft noise when the wind speed is in excess of 5 
knots (9 km/hr).

Sec. G36.107  Noise Measurement Procedures.

    (a) The microphones must be oriented in a known direction so that 
the maximum sound received arrives as nearly as possible in the 
direction for which the microphones are calibrated. The microphone 
sensing elements must be 4 ft. (1.2m) above ground level.
    (b) Immediately prior to and after each test, a recorded acoustic 
calibration of the system must be made in the field with an acoustic 
calibrator for the purposes of checking system sensitivity and providing 
an acoustic reference level for the analysis of the sound level data. If 
a tape recorder or graphic level recorder is used, the frequency 
response of the electrical system must be determined at a level within 
10 dB of the full-scale reading used during the test, utilizing pink or 
pseudorandom noise.
    (c) The ambient noise, including both acoustic background and 
electrical systems noise, must be recorded and determined in

[[Page 806]]

the test area with the system gain set at levels which will be used for 
aircraft noise measurements. If aircraft sound pressure levels do not 
exceed the background sound pressure levels by at least 10 dB(A), a 
takeoff measurement point nearer to the start of the takeoff roll must 
be used and the results must be adjusted to the reference measurement 
point by an approved method.

Sec. G36.109  Data Recording, Reporting, and Approval.

    (a) Data representing physical measurements and adjustments to 
measured data must be recorded in permanent form and appended to the 
record, except that corrections to measurements for normal equipment 
response deviations need not be reported. All other adjustments must be 
approved. Estimates must be made of the individual errors inherent in 
each of the operations employed in obtaining the final data.
    (b) Measured and corrected sound pressure levels obtained with 
equipment conforming to the specifications in section G36.105 of this 
appendix must be reported.
    (c) The type of equipment used for measurement and analysis of all 
acoustical, airplane performance, and meteorological data must be 
reported.
    (d) The following atmospheric data, measured immediately before, 
after, or during each test at the observation points prescribed in 
section G36.101 of this appendix must be reported:
    (1) Ambient temperature and relative humidity.
    (2) Maximum and average wind speeds and directions for each run.
    (e) Comments on local topography, ground cover, and events that 
might interfere with sound recordings must be reported.
    (f) The aircraft position relative to the takeoff reference flight 
path must be determined by an approved method independent of normal 
flight instrumentation, such as radar tracking, theodolite 
triangulation, or photographic scaling techniques.
    (g) The following airplane information must be reported:
    (1) Type, model, and serial numbers (if any) of airplanes, engines, 
and propellers;
    (2) Any modifications or nonstandard equipment likely to affect the 
noise characteristics of the airplane;
    (3) Maximum certificated takeoff weight;
    (4) For each test flight, airspeed and ambient temperature at the 
flyover altitude over the measuring site determined by properly 
calibrated instruments;
    (5) For each test flight, engine performance parameters, such as 
manifold pressure or power, propeller speed (rpm) and other relevant 
parameters. Each parameter must be determined by properly calibrated 
instruments. For instance, propeller RPM must be validated by an 
independent device accurate to within <plus-minus>1 percent, when the 
airplane is equipped with a mechanical tachometer.
    (6) Airspeed, position, and performance data necessary to make the 
corrections required in section G36.201 of this appendix must be 
recorded by an approved method when the airplane is directly over the 
measuring site.

Sec. G36.111  Flight Procedures.

    (a) The noise measurement point is on the extended centerline of the 
runway at a distance of 8200 ft (2500 m) from the start of takeoff roll. 
The aircraft must pass over the measurement point within <plus-minus>10 
degrees from the vertical and within 20% of the reference altitude. The 
flight test program shall be initiated at the maximum approved takeoff 
weight and the weight shall be adjusted back to this maximum weight 
after each hour of flight time. Each flight test must be conducted at 
the speed for the best rate of climb (V<INF>y</INF>) <plus-minus>5 knots 
(<plus-minus>9 km/hour) indicated airspeed. All test, measurement, and 
data correction procedures must be approved by the FAA.
    (b) The takeoff reference flight path must be calculated for the 
following atmospheric conditions:
    (1) Sea level atmospheric pressure of 1013.25 mb (013.25 hPa);
    (2) Ambient air temperature of 59 deg.F (15 deg.C);
    (3) Relative humidity of 70 percent; and
    (4) Zero wind.
    (c) The takeoff reference flight path must be calculated assuming 
the following two segments:
    (1) First segment.
    (i) Takeoff power must be used from the brake release point to the 
point at which the height of 50 ft (15m) above the runway is reached.
    (ii) A constant takeoff configuration selected by the applicant must 
be maintained through this segment.
    (iii) The maximum weight of the airplane at brake-release must be 
the maximum for which noise certification is requested.
    (iv) The length of this first segment must correspond to the 
airworthiness approved value for a takeoff on a level paved runway (or 
the corresponding value for seaplanes).
    (2) Second segment.
    (i) The beginning of the second segment corresponds to the end of 
the first segment.
    (ii) The airplane must be in the climb configuration with landing 
gear up, if retractable, and flap setting corresponding to normal climb 
position throughout this second segment.
    (iii) The airplane speed must be the speed for the best rate of 
climb (V<INF>y</INF>).
    (iv) Maximum continuous installed power and rpm for variable pitch 
propeller(s) shall be used. For fixed pitch propeller(s), the maximum 
power and rpm that can be delivered by the engine(s) must be maintained 
throughout the second segment.

[[Page 807]]

                        part c--data corrections

Sec. G36.201 Corrections to Test Results.
    (a) These corrections account for the effects of:
    (1) Differences in atmospheric absorption of sound between 
meteorological test conditions and reference conditions.
    (2) Differences in the noise path length between the actual airplane 
flight path and the reference flight path.
    (3) The change in the helical tip Mach number between test and 
reference conditions.
    (4) The change in the engine power between test and reference 
conditions.
    (b) Atmospheric absorption correction is required for noise data 
obtained when the test conditions are outside those specified in Figure 
G1. Noise data outside the applicable range must be corrected to 77 F 
and 70 percent relative humidity by a FAA approved method.
    (c) Helical tip Mach number and power corrections must be made if:
    (1) The propeller is a variable pitch type, or
    (2) The propeller is a fixed pitch type and the test power is not 
within 5 percent of the reference power.
    (d) When the test conditions are outside those specified, 
corrections must be applied by an approved procedure or by the following 
simplified procedure:
    (1) Measured sound levels must be corrected from test day 
meteorological conditions to reference conditions by adding an increment 
equal to

    Delta (M) = (<greek-a>-0.7) H<INF>T</INF>/1000

where H<INF>T</INF> is the height in feet of the test aircraft when 
directly over the noise measurement point and <greek-a> is the rate of 
absorption for the test day conditions at 500 Hz as specified in SAE ARP 
866A, entitled ``Standard Values of Atmospheric Absorption as a function 
of Temperature and Humidity for use in Evaluating Aircraft Flyover 
Noise'' as incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part.
    (2) Measured sound levels in decibels must be corrected for height 
by algebraically adding an increment equal to Delta (1). When test day 
conditions are within those specified in figure G1:

    Delta (1) = 22 log (H<INF>T</INF>/H<INF>R</INF>)

where H<INF>T</INF> is the height of the test aircraft when directly 
over the noise measurement point and H<INF>R</INF> is the reference 
height.
    When test day conditions are outside those specified in figure G1:
    Delta (1) = 20 log (H<INF>T</INF>/H<INF>R</INF>)

    (3) Measured sound levels in decibels must be corrected for helical 
tip Mach number by algebraically adding an increment equal to:
    Delta (2) = k log (M<INF>R</INF>/M<INF>T</INF>)

where M<INF>T</INF> and M<INF>R</INF> are the test and reference helical 
tip Mach numbers, respectively. The constant ``k'' is equal to the slope 
of the line obtained for measured values of the sound level in dB(A) 
versus helical tip Mach number. The value of k may be determined from 
approved data. A nominal value of k = 150 may be used when M<INF>T</INF> 
is smaller than

[[Page 808]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.114


      
M<INF>R</INF>. No correction may be made using the nominal value of k 
when M<INF>T</INF> is larger than M<INF>R</INF>. The reference helical 
tip Mach number M<INF>R</INF> is the Mach number corresponding to the 
reference conditions (RPM, airspeed, temperature) above the measurement 
point.
    (4) Measured sound levels in decibels must be corrected for engine 
power by algebraically adding an increment equal to:

    Delta (3) = 17 log (P<INF>R</INF>/P<INF>T</INF>)

where P<INF>T</INF> and P<INF>R</INF> are the test and reference engine 
powers respectively.

Sec. G36.203 Validity of Results.

    (a) The measuring point must be overflown at least six times. The 
test results must produce an average noise level (L<INF>Amax</INF>) 
value within a 90 percent confidence limit. The average noise level is 
the arithmetic average of the corrected acoustical measurements for all 
valid test runs over the measuring point.
    (b) The samples must be large enough to establish statistically a 90 
percent confidence limit not exceeding <plus-minus>1.5 dB(A). No test 
results may be omitted from the averaging process unless omission is 
approved by the FAA.

                          part d--noise limits

Sec. G36.301 Aircraft noise limits.

    (a) Compliance with this section must be shown with noise data 
measured and corrected as prescribed in Parts B and C of this appendix.
    (b) The noise level must not exceed 73 dB(A) up to and including 
aircraft weights of 1,320 pounds (600 kg). For weights greater than 
1,320 pounds the limit increases at the rate of 1 dB/165

pounds (1 dB/75 kg) up to 85 dB(A) at 3,300 pounds (1,500 kg), after 
which it is constant at 85 dB(A) up to and including 19,000 pounds 
(8,640). Figure G2 shows noise level limits vs airplane weight.

                      Part A--Reference Conditions

    Section H36.1 General. This appendix prescribes noise requirements 
for helicopters specified under Sec. 36.1, including:
    (a) The conditions under which helicopter noise certification tests 
under Part H must be conducted and the measurement procedures that must 
be used under Sec. 36.801 to measure helicopter noise during each test;
    (b) The procedures which must be used under Sec. 36.803 to correct 
the measured data to

[[Page 810]]

the reference conditions and to calculate the noise evaluation quantity 
designated as Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL); and
    (c) The noise limits for which compliance must be shown under 
Sec. 36.805.
    Section H36.3 Reference Test Conditions.
    (a) Meteorological conditions. Aircraft position, performance data 
and noise measurements must be corrected to the following noise 
certification reference atmospheric conditions which shall be assumed to 
exist from the surface to the aircraft altitude:
    (1) Sea level pressure of 2116 psf (76 cm mercury).
    (2) Ambient temperature of 77 degrees F (25 degrees C).
    (3) Relative humidity of 70 percent.
    (4) Zero wind.
    (b) Reference test site. The reference test site is flat and without 
line-of-sight obstructions across the flight path that encompasses the 
10 dB down points.
    (c) Takeoff reference profile. (1) Figure H1 illustrates a typical 
takeoff profile, including reference conditions.
    (2) The reference flight path is defined as a straight line segment 
inclined from the starting point (1640 feet prior to the center 
microphone location at 65 feet above ground level) at an angle<greek-b> 
defined by the certificated best rate of climb and V<INF>y</INF> for 
minimum engine performance. The constant climb angle <greek-B> is 
derived from the manufacturer's data (FAA-approved by the FAA) to define 
the flight profile for the reference conditions. The constant climb 
angle <greek-b> is drawn through C<INF>r</INF> and continues, crossing 
over station A, to the position corresponding to the end of the type 
certification takeoff path represented by position I<INF>r</INF>.
    (d) Level flyover reference profile. The beginning of the level 
flyover reference profile is represented by helicopter position D 
(Figure H2). The helicopter approaches position D in level flight 492 
feet above ground level as measured at station A. Airspeed is stabilized 
at either 0.9 V<INF>H</INF> or 0.45 V<INF>H</INF> + 65 knots (0.45 
V<INF>H</INF> + 120 km/hr), whichever speed is less. Rotor speed is 
stabilized at the maximum continuous RPM throughout the 10 dB down time 
period. The helicopter crosses station A in level flight and proceeds to 
position J.
    (e) For noise certification purposes, V<INF>H</INF> is defined as 
the airspeed in level flight obtained using the minimum specification 
engine torque corresponding to maximum continuous power available for 
sea level, 25 deg. C ambient conditions at the relevant maximum 
certificated weight. The value of V<INF>H</INF> thus defined must be 
listed in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual.
    (f) Approach reference profile. (1) Figure H3 illustrates approach 
profile, including reference conditions.
    (i) The beginning of the approach profile is represented by 
helicopter position E. The position of the helicopter is recorded for a 
sufficient distance (EK) to ensure recording of the entire interval 
during which the measured helicopter noise level is within 10 dB of 
Maximum Tone Corrected Perceived Noise Level (PNLTM), as required. EK 
represents a stable flight condition in terms of torque, rpm, indicated 
airspeed, and rate of descent resulting in a 6 deg. <plus-minus> 
0.5 deg. approach angle.
    (ii) The approach profile is defined by the approach angle <greek-b> 
passing directly over the station A at a height of AH, to position K, 
which terminates the approach noise certification profile.
    (2) The helicopter approaches position H along a constant 6 deg. 
approach slope throughout the 10 dB down time period. The helicopter 
crosses position E and proceeds along the approach slope crossing over 
station A until it reaches position K.

used in this appendix for helicopter noise certification have the 
following meanings.

               Part B--Noise Measurement Under Sec. 36.801

    Section H36.101 Noise certification test and measurement conditions.
    (a) General. This section prescribes the conditions under which 
aircraft noise certification tests must be conducted and the

[[Page 812]]

measurement procedures that must be used to measure helicopter noise 
during each test.
    (b) Test site requirements. (1) Tests to show compliance with 
established helicopter noise certification levels must consist of a 
series of takeoffs, level flyovers, and approaches during which 
measurement must be taken at noise measuring stations located at the 
measuring points prescribed in this section.
    (2) Each takeoff test, flyover test, and approach test includes 
simultaneous measurements at the flight-track noise measuring station 
vertically below the reference flight path and at two sideline noise 
measuring stations, one on each side of the reference flight track 492 
feet (150m) from, and on a line perpendicular to, the flight track of 
the noise measuring station.
    (3) The difference between the elevation of either sideline noise 
measuring station may not differ from the flight-track noise measuring 
station by more than 20 feet.
    (4) Each noise measuring station must be surrounded by terrain 
having no excessive sound absorption characteristics, such as might be 
caused by thick, matted, or tall grass, shrubs, or wooded areas.
    (5) During the period when the takeoff, flyover, or approach noise/
time record indicates the noise measurement is within 10 dB of PNLTM, no 
obstruction that significantly influences the sound field from the 
aircraft may exist--
    (i) For any flight-track or sideline noise measuring station, within 
a conical space above the measuring position (the point on the ground 
vertically below the microphone), the cone being defined by an axis 
normal to the ground and by half-angle 80 deg. from this axis; and
    (ii) For any sideline noise measuring station, above the line of 
sight between the microphone and the helicopter.
    (6) If a takeoff or flyover test series is conducted at weights 
other than the maximum takeoff weight for which noise certification is 
requested, the following additional requirements apply:
    (i) At least one takeoff test must be conducted at a weight at, or 
above, the maximum certification weight.
    (ii) Each test weight must be within +5 percent or -10 percent of 
the maximum certification weight.
    (iii) FAA-approved data must be used to determine the variation of 
EPNL with weight for takeoff test conditions.
    (7) Each approach test must be conducted with the aircraft 
stabilized and following a 6.0 degree <plus-minus>0.5 degree approach 
angle and must meet the requirements of section H36.107 of this part.
    (8) If an approach test series is conducted at weights other than 
the maximum landing weight for which certification is requested, the 
following additional requirements apply:
    (i) At least one approach test must be conducted at a weight at, or 
above, the maximum landing weight.
    (ii) Each test weight must exceed 90 percent of the maximum landing 
weight.
    (iii) FAA-approved data must be used to determine the variation of 
EPNL with weight for approach test conditions.
    (9) Aircraft performance data sufficient to make the corrections 
required under section H36.205 of this appendix must be recorded at an 
FAA-approved sampling rate using FAA approved equipment.
    (c) Weather restrictions. The tests must be conducted under the 
following atmospheric conditions:
    (1) No rain or other precipitation.
    (2) Ambient air temperature between 36 deg. F and 95 deg. F (2.2 
C deg. and 35 deg. C), inclusively, over that portion of the sound 
propagation path between the aircraft and a point 10 meters above the 
ground at the noise measuring station. The temperature and relative 
humidity measured at aircraft altitude and at 10 meters above ground 
shall be averaged and used to adjust for propagation path absorption.
    (3) Relative humidity and ambient temperature over the portion of 
the sound propagation path between the aircraft and a point 10 meters 
above the ground at the noise measuring station is such that the sound 
attenuation in the one-third octave band centered at 8 kHz is not 
greater than 12 dB/100 meters and the relative humidity is between 20 
percent and 95 percent, inclusively.
    (4) Wind velocity as measured at 10 meters above ground does not 
exceed 10 knots (19 km/h) and the crosswind component does not exceed 5 
knots (9 km/h). The wind shall be determined using a continuous thirty-
second averaging period spanning the 10dB down time interval.
    (5) No anomalous wind conditions (including turbulence) which will 
significantly affect the noise level of the aircraft when the noise is 
recorded at each noise measuring station.
    (6) The wind velocity, temperature, and relative humidity 
measurements required under the appendix must be measured in the 
vicinity of noise measuring stations 10 meters above the ground. The 
location of the meteorological measurements must be approved by the FAA 
as representative of those atmospheric conditions existing near the 
surface over the geographical area which aircraft noise measurements are 
made. In some cases, a fixed meteorological station (such as those found 
at airports or other facilities) may meet this requirement.
    (7) Temperature and relative humidity measurements must be obtained 
within 25 minutes of each noise test measurement. Meteorological data 
must be interpolated to actual times of each noise measurement.

[[Page 813]]

    (d) Aircraft testing procedures. (1) The aircraft testing procedures 
and noise measurements must be conducted and processed in a manner which 
yields the noise evaluation measure designated as Effective Perceived 
Noise Level (EPNL) in units of EPNdB, as prescribed in Appendix B of 
this part.
    (2) The aircraft height and lateral position relative to the 
centerline of the reference flight-track (which passes through the noise 
measuring point) must be determined by an FAA approved method which is 
independent of normal flight instrumentation, such as radar tracking, 
theodolite triangulation, laser trajectography, or photographic scaling 
techniques.
    (3) The aircraft position along the flight path must be related to 
the noise recorded at the noise measuring stations by means of 
synchronizing signals at an approved sampling rate. The position of the 
aircraft must be recorded relative to the runway during the entire time 
period in which the recorded signal is within 10 dB of PNLTM. Measuring 
and sampling equipment must be approved by the FAA.

    Section H36.109 Measurement of helicopter noise received on the 
ground.
    (a) General. (1) The measurements prescribed in this section provide 
the data needed to determine the one-third octave band noise produced by 
an aircraft during testing, at specific noise measuring stations, as a 
function of time.
    (2) Sound pressure level data for aircraft noise certification 
purposes must be obtained with FAA-approved acoustical equipment and 
measurement practices.
    (3) Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section prescribe the 
required equipment specifications. Paragraphs (e) and (f) prescribe the 
calibration and measurement procedures required for each certification 
test series.
    (b) Measurement system. The acoustical measurement system must 
consist of FAA-approved equipment equivalent to the following:
    (1) A microphone system with frequency response and directivity 
which are compatible with the measurement and analysis system accuracy 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Tripods or similar microphone mountings that minimize 
interference with the sound energy being measured.
    (3) Recording and reproducing equipment, the characteristics, 
frequency response, and dynamic range of which are compatible with the 
response and accuracy requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) Calibrators using sine wave, or pink noise, of known levels. 
When pink noise (defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) is used, 
the signal must be described in terms of its root-mean-square (rms) 
value.
    (5) Analysis equipment with the response and accuracy which meets or 
exceeds the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (6) Attenuators used for range changing in sensing, recording, 
reproducing, or analyzing aircraft sound must be capable of being 
operated in equal-interval decibel steps with no error between any two 
settings which exceeds 0.2 dB.
    (c) Sensing, recording, and reproducing equipment. (1) The sound 
produced by the aircraft must be recorded in such a way that the 
complete information, including time history, is retained. A magnetic 
tape recorder is acceptable.
    (2) The microphone must be a pressure-sensitive capacitive type, or 
its FAA-approved equivalent, such as a free-field type with incidence 
corrector.
    (i) The variation of microphone and preamplifier system sensitivity 
within an angle of <plus-minus>30 degrees of grazing (60-120 degrees 
from the normal to the diaphragm) must not exceed the following values:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Change in 
                       Frequency (Hz)                        sensitivity
                                                                 (dB)   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
45 to 1,120................................................           1 
1,120 to 2,240.............................................         1.5 
2,240 to 4,500.............................................         2.5 
4,500 to 7,100.............................................           4 
7,100 to 11,200............................................           5 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the windscreen in place, the sensitivity variation in the plane of 
the microphone diaphragm shall not exceed 1.0 dB over the frequency 
range 45 to 11,200 Hz.
    (ii) The overall free-field frequency response at 90 degrees 
(grazing incidence) of the combined microphone (including incidence 
corrector, if applicable) preamplifier, and windscreen must be 
determined by using either (A) an electrostatic calibrator in 
combination with manufacturer-provided corrections, or (B) an anechoic 
free-field facility. The calibration unit must include pure tones at 
each preferred one-third octave frequency from 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz. The 
frequency response (after corrections based on that determination) must 
be flat and within the following tolerances:

                                                   44-3,549 Hz..........
            .........................................<plus-minus>0.25 dB
                                                 3,550-7,099 Hz.........
              ........................................<plus-minus>0.5 dB
                                                7,100-11,200 Hz.........
               .......................................<plus-minus>1.0 dB

    (iii) Specifications concerning sensitivity to environmental factors 
such as temperature, relative humidity, and vibration must be in 
conformity with the recommendations of International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC) Publication No. 179, entitled ``Precision Sound Level 
Meters'', as incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part.
    (iv) If the wind speed exceeds 6 knots, a windscreen must be 
employed with the microphone during each measurement of aircraft noise. 
Correction for any insertion loss produced by the windscreen, as a 
function of frequency, must be applied to the measured data and any 
correction applied must be reported.
    (3) If a magnetic tape recorder is used to store data for subsequent 
analysis, the record/replay system (including tape) must conform to the 
following:
    (i) The electric background noise produced by the system in each 
one-third octave must be at least 35 dB below the standard recording 
level, which is defined as the level that is either 10 dB below the 3 
percent harmonic distortion level for direct recording or <plus-minus>40 
percent deviation for frequency modulation (FM) recording.
    (ii) At the standard recording level, the corrected frequency 
response in each selected one-third octave band between 44 Hz and 180 Hz 
must be flat and within <plus-minus>0.75 dB,

[[Page 815]]

and in each band between 180 Hz and 11,200 Hz must be flat and within 
<plus-minus>0.25 dB.
    (iii) If the overall system satisfies the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section, and if the limitations of the dynamic range 
of the equipment are insufficient to obtain adequate spectral 
information, high frequency pre-emphasis may be added to the recording 
channel with the converse de-emphasis on playback. If pre-emphasis is 
added, the instantaneously recorded sound-pressure level between 800 Hz 
and 11,200 Hz of the maximum measured noise signal must not vary more 
than 20 dB between the levels of the maximum and minimum one-third 
octave bands.
    (d) Analysis equipment. (1) A frequency analysis of the acoustic 
signal must be performed using one-third octave filters which conform to 
the recommendations of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 
Publication No. 225, entitled ``Octave, Half-Octave, and Third-Octave 
Band Filters Intended for Analysis of Sound and Vibrations,'' as 
incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part.
    (2) A set of 24 consecutive one-third octave filters must be used. 
The first filter of the set must be centered at a geometric mean 
frequency of 50 Hz and the last filter at 10,000 Hz. The output of each 
filter must contain less than 0.5 dB ripple.
    (3) The analyzer indicating device may be either analog or digital, 
or a combination of both. The preferred sequence of signal processing 
is:
    (i) Squaring the one-third octave filter outputs;
    (ii) Averaging or integrating; and
    (iii) Converting linear formulation to logarithmic.
    (4) Each detector must operate over a minimum dynamic range of 60 dB 
and perform as a root-mean-square device for sinusoidal tone bursts 
having crest factors of at least 3 over the following dynamic range:
    (i) Up to 30 dB below full-scale reading must be accurate within 
<plus-minus>0.5 dB;
    (ii) Between 30 dB and 40 dB below full-scale reading must be 
accurate within <plus-minus>1.0 dB; and
    (iii) In excess of 40 dB below full-scale reading must be accurate 
within <plus-minus>2.5 dB.
    (5) The averaging properties of the integrator must be tested as 
follows:
    (i) White noise must be passed through the 200 Hz one-third octave 
band filter and the output fed in turn to each detector/integrator. The 
standard deviation of the measured levels must then be determined from a 
statistically significant number of samples of the filtered white noise 
taken at intervals of not less than 5 seconds. The value of the standard 
deviation must be within the interval 0.48<plus-minus>0.06 dB for a 
probability limit of 95 percent. An approved equivalent method may be 
substituted for this test on those analyzers where the test signal 
cannot readily be fed directly to each detector/integrator.
    (ii) For each detector/integrator, the response to a sudden onset or 
interruption of a constant amplitude sinusoidal signal at the respective 
one-third octave band center frequency must be measured at sampling 
times 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 seconds after the onset or interruption. 
The rising responses must be in the following amounts before the steady-
state level:

0.5 seconds, 4.0<plus-minus>1.0 dB
1.0 seconds, 1.75<plus-minus>0.5 dB
1.5 seconds, 1.0<plus-minus>0.5 dB
2.0 seconds, 0.6<plus-minus>0.25 dB

    (iii) The falling response must be such that the sum of the decibel 
readings below the initial steady-state level, and the corresponding 
rising response reading is   6.5<plus-minus> 1.0 dB, at both 0.5 and 1.0 
seconds and, on subsequent records, the sum of the onset plus decay must 
be greater than 7.5 decibels.
    Note 1: For analyzers with linear detection, an approximation of 
this response would be given by:

SPL (i, k)-10 log...................  [0.17 (10<SUP>0.1 <SUP>(Li, <SUP>k-3))           
                                      +10.21 (0<SUP>0.1 <SUP>(Li, <SUP>k-2))           
                                      +0.24 (10<SUP>0.1 <SUP>(Li, <SUP>k-1))           
                                      +0.33 (10<SUP>0.1 <SUP>(Li, <SUP>k))]            
                                                                        
                                                                        

    When this approximation is used, the calibration signal should be 
established without this weighting.
    Note 2: Some analyzers have been shown to have signal sampling rates 
that are insufficiently accurate to detect signals with crest factor 
ratios greater than three which is common to helicopter noise. 
Preferably, such analyzers should not be used for helicopter 
certification. Use of analysis systems with high signal sampling rates 
(greater than 40KHz) or those with analog detectors prior to 
digitization at the output of each one-third octave filter is 
encouraged.
    (iv) Analyzers using true integration cannot meet the requirements 
of (i), (ii), and (iii) directly, because their overall average time is 
greater than the sampling interval. For these analyzers, compliance must 
be demonstrated in terms of the equivalent output of the data processor. 
Further, in cases where readout and resetting require a dead-time during 
acquisition, the percentage loss of the total data must not exceed one 
percent.
    (6) The sampling interval between successive readouts shall not 
exceed 500 milliseconds and its precise value must be known to within 
<plus-minus>1 one percent. The instant in time by which a readout is 
characterized shall be the midpoint of the average period where the 
averaging period is defined as twice the effective time constant of the 
analyzer.
    (7) The amplitude resolution of the analyzer must be at least 0.25 
dB.

[[Page 816]]

    (8) After all systematic errors have been eliminated, each output 
level from the analyzer must be accurate within <plus-minus>1.0 dB of 
the level of the input signal. The total systematic errors for each of 
the output levels must not exceed <plus-minus>3.0 dB. For contiguous 
filter systems, the systematic corrections between adjacent one-third 
octave channels must not exceed 4.0 dB.
    (9) The dynamic range capability of the analyzer to display a single 
aircraft noise event, in terms of the difference between full-scale 
output level and the maximum noise level of the analyzer equipment, must 
be at least 60 dB.
    (e) Calibrations. (1) Within five days prior to beginning each test 
series, the complete electronic system, as installed in field including 
cables, must be electronically calibrated for frequency and amplitude by 
the use of a pink noise signal of known amplitudes covering the range of 
signal levels furnished by the microphone. For purposes of this section, 
``pink noise'' means a noise whose noise-power/unit-frequency is 
inversely proportional to frequency at frequencies within the range of 
44 Hz to 11,200 Hz. The signal used must be described in terms of its 
average root-mean-square (rms) values for a nonoverload signal level. 
This system calibration must be repeated within five days of the end of 
each test series, or as required by the FAA.
    (2) Immediately before and after each day's testing, a recorded 
acoustic calibration of the system must be made in the field with an 
acoustic calibrator to check the system sensitivity and provide an 
acoustic reference level for the sound level data analysis. The 
performance of equipment in the system will be considered satisfactory 
if, during each day's testing, the variation in the calibration value 
does not exceed 0.5 dB.
    (3) A normal incidence pressure calibration of the combined 
microphone/preamplifier must be performed with pure tones at each 
preferred one-third octave frequency from 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz. This 
calibration must be completed within 90 days prior to the beginning of 
each test series.
    (4) Each reel of magnetic tape must:
    (i) Be pistonphone calibrated; and
    (ii) At its beginning and end, carry a calibration signal consisting 
of at least a 15 second burst of pink noise, as defined in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (5) Data obtained from tape recorded signals are not considered 
reliable if the difference between the pink noise signal levels, before 
and after the tests in each one-third octave band, exceeds 0.75 dB.
    (6) The one-third octave filters must have been demonstrated to be 
in conformity with the recommendations of IEC Publication 225 as 
incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part, during the six 
calendar months preceding the beginning of each test series. However, 
the correction for effective bandwidth relative to the center frequency 
response may be determined for each filter by:
    (i) Measuring the filter response to sinusoidal signals at a minimum 
of twenty frequencies equally spaced between the two adjacent preferred 
one-third octave frequencies; or
    (ii) Using an FAA approved equivalent technique.
    (7) A performance calibration analysis of each piece of calibration 
equipment, including pistonphones, reference microphones, and voltage 
insert devices, must have been made during the six calendar months 
preceding the beginning of each day's test series. Each calibration must 
be traceable to the National Bureau of Standards.
    (f) Noise measurement procedures. (1) Each microphone must be 
oriented so that the diaphragm is substantially in the plane defined by 
the flight path of the aircraft and the measuring station. The 
microphone located at each noise measuring station must be placed so 
that its sensing element is approximately 4 feet above ground.
    (2) Immediately before and immediately after each series of test 
runs and each day's testing, acoustic calibrations of the system 
prescribed in this section of this appendix must be recorded in the 
field to check the acoustic reference level for the analysis of the 
sound level data. Ambient noise must be recorded for at least 10 seconds 
and be representative of the acoustical background, including system 
noise, that exists during the flyover test run. During that recorded 
period, each component of the system must be set at the gain-levels used 
for aircraft noise measurement.
    (3) The mean background noise spectrum must contain the sound 
pressure levels, which, in each preferred third octave band in the range 
of 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz, are the averages of the energy of the sound 
pressure levels in every preferred third octave. When analyzed in PNL, 
the resulting mean background noise level must be at least 20 PNdB below 
the maximum PNL of the helicopter.
    (4) Corrections for recorded levels of background noise are allowed, 
within the limits prescribed in section H36.111(c)(3) of this appendix.

         Section H36.111  Reporting and correcting measured data

    (a) General. Data representing physical measurements, and 
corrections to measured data, including corrections to measurements for 
equipment response deviations, must be recorded in permanent form and 
appended to the record. Each correction must be reported and is subject 
to FAA approval. An estimate must be made of each individual error 
inherent in each of the operations employed in obtaining the final data.

[[Page 817]]

    (b) Data reporting. (1) Measured and corrected sound pressure levels 
must be presented in one-third octave band levels obtained with 
equipment conforming to the standards prescribed in section H36.109 of 
this appendix.
    (2) The type of equipment used for measurement and analysis of all 
acoustic, aircraft performance, and meteorological data must be 
reported.
    (3) The atmospheric environmental data required to demonstrate 
compliance with this appendix, measured throughout the test period, must 
be reported.
    (4) Conditions of local topography, ground cover, or events which 
may interfere with sound recording must be reported.
    (5) The following aircraft information must be reported:
    (i) Type, model, and serial numbers, if any, of aircraft engines and 
rotors.
    (ii) Gross dimensions of aircraft and location of engines.
    (iii) Aircraft gross weight for each test run.
    (iv) Aircraft configuration, including landing gear positions.
    (v) Airspeed in knots.
    (vi) Helicopter engine performance as determined from aircraft 
instruments and manufacturer's data.
    (vii) Aircraft flight path, above ground level in feet, determined 
by an FAA approved method which is independent of normal flight 
instrumentation, such as radar tracking, theodolite triangulation, laser 
trajectography, or photographic scaling techniques.
    (6) Aircraft speed, and position, and engine performance parameters 
must be recorded at an approved sampling rate sufficient to correct to 
the noise certification reference test conditions prescribed in section 
H36.3 of this appendix. Lateral position relative to the reference 
flight-track must be reported.
    (c) Data corrections. (1) Aircraft position, performance data and 
noise measurement must be corrected to the noise certification reference 
conditions as prescribed in sections H36.3 and H36.205 of this appendix.
    (2) The measured flight path must be corrected by an amount equal to 
the difference between the applicant's predicted flight path for the 
certification reference conditions and the measured flight path at the 
test conditions. Necessary corrections relating to aircraft flight path 
or performance may be derived from FAA-approved data for the difference 
between measured and reference engine conditions, together with 
appropriate allowances for sound attenuation with distance. The 
Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) correction must be less than 2.0 
EPNdB for any combination of the following:
    (i) The aircraft's not passing vertically above the measuring 
station.
    (ii) Any difference between the reference flight-track and the 
actual minimum distance of the aircraft's ILS antenna from the approach 
measuring station.
    (iii) Any difference between the actual approach angle and the noise 
certification reference approach flight path.
    (iv) Any correction of the measured level flyover noise levels which 
accounts for any difference between the test engine thrust or power and 
the reference engine thrust or power.

Detailed correction requirements are prescribed in section H36.205 of 
this appendix.
    (3) Aircraft sound pressure levels within the 10 dB-down points must 
exceed the mean background sound pressure levels determined under 
section A36.3(f)(3) by at least 5 dB in each one-third octave band or be 
corrected under an FAA approved method to be included in the computation 
of the overall noise level of the aircraft. An EPNL may not be computed 
or reported from data from which more than four one-third octave bands 
in any spectrum within the 10 dB-down points have been excluded under 
this paragraph.
    (d) Validity of results. (1) The test results must produce three 
average EPNL values within the 90 percent confidence limits, each value 
consisting of the arithmetic average of the corrected noise measurements 
for all valid test runs at the takeoff, level flyovers, and approach 
conditions. The 90 percent confidence limit applies separately to 
takeoff, flyover, and approach.
    (2) The minimum sample size acceptable for each takeoff, approach, 
and flyover certification measurements is six. The number of samples 
must be large enough to establish statistically for each of the three 
average noise certification levels a 90 percent confidence limit which 
does not exceed <plus-minus>1.5 EPNdB. No test result may be omitted 
from the averaging process, unless otherwise specified by the FAA.
    (3) To comply with this appendix, a minimum of six takeoffs, six 
approaches, and six level flyovers is required. To be counted toward 
this requirement, each flight event must be validly recorded at all 
three noise measuring stations.
    (4) The approved values of V<INF>H</INF> and V<INF>y</INF> used in 
calculating test and reference conditions and flight profiles must be 
reported along with measured and corrected sound pressure levels.

           Section H36.113  Atmospheric attenuation of sound.

    (a) The values of the one-third octave band spectra measured during 
helicopter noise certification tests under this appendix must conform, 
or be corrected, to the reference conditions prescribed in section 
H36.3(a).

[[Page 818]]

Each correction must account for any differences in the atmospheric 
attenuation of sound between the test-day conditions and the reference-
day conditions along the sound propagation path between the aircraft and 
the microphone. Unless the meteorological conditions are within the test 
window prescribed in this appendix, the test data are not acceptable.
    (b) Attenuation rates. The atmospheric attenuation rates of sound 
with distance for each one-third octave band from 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz 
must be determined in accordance with the formulations and tabulations 
of SAE ARP 866A, entitled ``Standard Values of Atmospheric Absorption as 
a Function of Temperatures and Humidity for Use in Evaluating Aircraft 
Flyover Noise'', as incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this 
part.
    (c) Correction for atmospheric attenuation. (1) EPNL values 
calculated for measured data must be corrected whenever--
    (i) The ambient atmospheric conditions of temperature and relative 
humidity do not conform to the reference conditions, 77  deg.F and 70%, 
respectively, or
    (ii) The measured flight paths do not conform to the reference 
flight paths.
    (iii) The temperature and relative humidity measured at aircraft 
altitude and at 10 meters above the ground shall be averaged and used to 
adjust for propagation path absorption.
    (2) The mean attenuation rate over the complete sound propagation 
path from the aircraft to the microphone must be computed for each one-
third octave band from 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz. These rates must be used in 
computing the corrections required in section H36.111(d) of this 
appendix.

       Part C--Noise Evaluation and Calculation Under Sec. 36.803

               Section H36.201  Noise Evaluation in EPNdB.

    (a) Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL), in units of effective 
perceived noise decibels (EPNdB), shall be used for evaluating noise 
level values under Sec. 36.803 of this part. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the procedures in Appendix B of Part 36 
must be used for computing EPNL. Appendix B includes requirements 
governing determination of noise values, including calculations of:
    (1) Instantaneous perceived noise levels;
    (2) Corrections for spectral irregularities;
    (3) Tone corrections;
    (4) Duration corrections;
    (5) Effective perceived noise levels; and
    (6) Mathematical formulation of noy tables.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section B36.5(a), for 
helicopter noise certification, corrections for spectral irregularities 
shall start with the corrected sound pressure level in the 50 Hz one-
third octave band.

              Section H36.203  Calculation of noise levels.

    (a) To demonstrate compliance with the noise level limits of section 
H36.305, the noise values measured simultaneously at the three noise 
measuring points must be arithmetically averaged to obtain a single 
EPNdB value for each flight.
    (b) The calculated noise level for each noise test series, i.e., 
takeoff, flyover, or approach must be the numerical average of at least 
six separate flight EPNdB values. The 90 percent confidence limit for 
all valid test runs under section H36.111(d) of this appendix applies 
separately to the EPNdB values for each noise test series.

          Section H36.205  Detailed data correction procedures

    (a) General. If the test conditions do not conform to those 
prescribed as noise certification reference conditions under section 
H36.305 of this appendix, the following correction procedure shall 
apply:
    (1) If a positive value results from any difference between 
reference and test conditions, an appropriate positive correction must 
be made to the EPNL calculated from the measured data. Conditions which 
can result in a positive value include:
    (i) Atmospheric absorption of sound under test conditions which is 
greater than the reference;
    (ii) Test flight path at an altitude which is higher than the 
reference; or
    (iii) Test weight which is less than maximum certification weight.
    (2) If a negative value results from any difference between 
reference and test conditions, no correction may be made to the EPNL 
calculated from the measured data, unless the difference results from:
    (i) An atmospheric absorption of sound under test conditions which 
is less than the reference; or
    (ii) A test flight path at an altitude which is lower than the 
reference.
    (3) The following correction procedures may produce one or more 
possible correction values which must be added algebraically to the 
calculated EPNL to bring it to reference conditions:
    (i) The flight profiles must be determined for both reference and 
test conditions. The procedures require noise and flight path recording 
with a synchronized time signal from which the test profile can be 
delineated, including the aircraft position for which PNLTM is observed 
at the noise measuring station. For takeoff, the flight profile 
corrected to reference conditions may be derived from FAA approved 
manufacturer's data.
    (ii) The sound propagation paths to the microphone from the aircraft 
position corresponding to PNLTM are determined for both the test and 
reference profiles. The SPL

[[Page 819]]

values in the spectrum of PNLTM must then be corrected for the effects 
of--
    (A) Change in atmospheric sound absorption;
    (B) Atmospheric sound absorption on the linear difference between 
the two sound path lengths; and
    (C) Inverse square law on the difference in sound propagation path 
length. The corrected values of SPL are then converted to PNLTM from 
which PNLTM must be subtracted. The resulting difference represents the 
correction which must be added algebraically to the EPNL calculated from 
the measured data.
    (iii) The minimum distances from both the test and reference 
profiles to the noise measuring station must be calculated and used to 
determine a noise duration correction due to any change in the altitude 
of aircraft flyover. The duration correction must be added algebraically 
to the EPNL calculated from the measured data.
    (iv) From FAA approved data in the form of curves or tables giving 
the variation of EPNL with rotor rpm and test speed, corrections are 
determined and must be added to the EPNL, which is calculated from the 
measured data to account for noise level changes due to differences 
between test conditions and reference conditions.
    (v) From FAA approved data in the form of curves or tables giving 
the variation of EPNL with approach angle, corrections are determined 
and must be added algebraically to the EPNL, which is calculated from 
measured data, to account for noise level changes due to differences 
between the 6 degree and the test approach angle.
    (b) Takeoff profiles. (1) Figure H1 illustrates a typical takeoff 
profile, including reference conditions.
    (i) The reference takeoff flight path is described in section 
H36.3(c).
    (ii) The test parameters are functions of the helicopter's 
performance and weight and the atmospheric conditions of temperature, 
pressure, wind velocity and direction.
    (2) For the actual takeoff, the helicopter approaches position C in 
level flight at 65 feet (20 meters) above ground level at the flight 
track noise measuring station and at either V<INF>y</INF><plus-minus>5 
knots (<plus-minus>9 km/hr) or the maximum speed of the curve tangential 
at the ordinate of the height-speed envelope plus 3.0 knots 
(<plus-minus>5 knots), whichever speed is greater. Rotor speed is 
stabilized at the normal operating RPM (<plus-minus>1 percent), 
specified in the flight manual. The helicopter is stabilized in level 
flight at the speed for best rate of climb using minimum engine 
specifications (power or torque and rpm) along a path starting from a 
point located 1640 feet (500 meters) forward of the flight-track noise 
measuring station and 65 feet (20 meters) above the ground. Starting at 
point B, the helicopter climbs through point C to the end of the noise 
certification takeoff flight path represented by position I. The 
position of point C may vary within limits allowed by the FAA. The 
position of the helicopter shall be recorded for a distance (CI) 
sufficient to ensure recording of the entire interval during which the 
measured helicopter noise level is within 10 dB of PNLTM, as required by 
this rule. Station A is the flight-track noise measuring station. The 
relationships between the measured and corrected takeoff flight profiles 
can be used to determine the corrections which must be applied to the 
EPNL calculated from the measured data.
    (3) Figure H1 also illustrates the significant geometrical 
relationships influencing sound propagation. Position L represents the 
helicopter location on the measured takeoff flight path from which PNLTM 
is observed at station A, and L<INF>r </INF>is the A and N<greek-r> 
corresponding position on the reference sound propagation path. AL and 
AL<INF>r</INF> both form the angle <greek-PH> with their respective 
flight paths. Position T represents the point on the measured takeoff 
flight path nearest station A, and T<INF>r </INF>is the corresponding 
position on the reference flight path. The minimum distance to the 
measured and reference flight paths are indicated by the lines AT and 
AT<INF>r, </INF>respectively, which are normal to their flight paths.
    (c) Level flyover profiles. (1) The noise type certification level 
flyover profile is shown in Figure H2. Airspeed must be stabilized 
within <plus-minus>5 knots of the reference airspeed given in section 
H36.3(d). For each run, the difference between airspeed and ground speed 
shall not exceed 10 knots between the 10 dB down points. Rotor speed 
must be stabilized at the maximum continuous RPM within one percent, 
throughout the 10 dB down time period. If the test requirements are 
otherwise met, flight direction may be reversed for each subsequent 
flyover, to obtain three test runs in each direction.

[[Page 821]]

    (2) Figure H2 illustrates comparative flyover profiles when test 
conditions do not conform to prescribed reference conditions. The 
position of the helicopter shall be recorded for a distance (DJ) 
sufficient to ensure recording of the entire interval during which the 
measured helicopter noise level is within 10 dB of PNLTM, as required. 
The flyover profile is defined by the height AG which is a function of 
the operating conditions controlled by the pilot. Position M represents 
the helicopter location on the measured flyover flight path for which 
PNLTM is observed at station A, and M<INF>r</INF> is the corresponding 
position on the reference flight path.
    (d) Approach profiles. (1) Figure H3 illustrates a typical approach 
profile, including reference conditions.
    (2) The helicopter approaches position H along a 6 deg. 
(<plus-minus>0.5 deg.) average approach slope throughout the 10 dB down 
period. The approach procedure shall be acceptable to the FAA and shall 
be included in the Flight Manual.
    (3) Figure H3 illustrates portions of the measured and reference 
approach flight paths including the significant geometrical 
relationships influencing sound propagation. EK represents the measured 
approach path with approach angle <greek-ee>, and E<INF>r</INF> and 
K<INF>r</INF> represent the reference approach angle of 6 deg.. Position 
N represents the helicopter location on the measured approach flight 
path for which PNLTM is observed at station A, and N<INF>r</INF> is the 
corresponding position on the reference approach flight path. The 
measured and corrected noise propagation paths are AN and 
AN<INF>r</INF>, respectively, both of which form the same angle with 
their flight paths. Position S represents the point on the measured 
approach flight path nearest station A, and S<INF>r</INF> is the 
corresponding point on the reference approach flight path. The minimum 
distance to the measured and reference flight paths are indicated by the 
lines AS and AS<INF>r</INF>, respectively, which are normal to their 
flight paths.

    (e) Correction of noise at source during level flyover. (1) For 
level overflight, if any combination of the following three factors, 1) 
airspeed deviation from reference, 2) rotor speed deviation from 
reference, and 3) temperature deviation from reference, results in an 
advancing blade tip Mach number which deviates from the reference Mach 
value, then source noise adjustments shall be determined. This 
adjustment shall be determined from the manufacturer supplied data 
approved by the FAA.

[[Page 822]]

    (2) Off-reference tip Mach number adjustments shall be based upon a 
sensitivity curve of PNLTM versus advancing blade tip Mach number, 
deduced from overflights carried out at different airspeeds around the 
reference airspeed. If the test aircraft is unable to attain the 
reference value, then an extrapolation of the sensitivity curve is 
permitted if data cover at least a range of 0.3 Mach units. The 
advancing blade tip Mach number shall be computed using true airspeed, 
onboard outside air temperature, and rotor speed. A separate PNLTM 
versus advancing blade tip Mach number function shall be derived for 
each of the three certification microphone locations, i.e., centerline, 
sideline left, and sideline right. Sideline left and right are defined 
relative to the direction of the flight on each run. PNLTM adjustments 
are to be applied to each microphone datum using the appropriate PNLTM 
function.
    (f) PNLT corrections. If the ambient atmospheric conditions of 
temperature and relative humidity are not those prescribed as reference 
conditions under this appendix (77 degrees F and 70 percent, 
respectively), corrections to the EPNL values must be calculated from 
the measured data under paragraph (a) of this section as follows:
    (1) Takeoff flight path. For the takeoff flight path shown in Figure 
H1, the spectrum of PNLTM observed at station A for the aircraft at 
position L<INF>r</INF> is decomposed into its individual SPLi values.
    (i) Step 1. A set of corrected values are then computed as follows:

        SPLic = SPLi + (<greek-a> i-<greek-a> io)AL
    + (<greek-a> io)AL-ALr)
    + 20 log(AL/ALr)

Where SPLi and SPLic are the measured and corrected sound pressure 
levels, respectively, in the i-th one-third octave band. The first 
correction term accounts for the effects of change in atmospheric sound 
absorption where ai and aio are the sound absorption coefficients for 
the test and reference atmospheric conditions, respectively, for the -
ith one-third octave band and L<INF>r</INF>A is the measured takeoff 
sound propagation path. The second correction term accounts for the 
effects of atmospheric sound absorption on the change in the sound 
propagation path length where L<INF>r</INF>A is the corrected takeoff 
sound propagation path. The third correction term accounts for the 
effects of the inverse square law on the change in the sound propagation 
path length.
    (ii) Step 2. The corrected values of the SPLic are then converted to 
PNLT and a correction term calculated as follows:

                    <greek-D><INF>1</INF>=PNLT-PNLTM

Which represents the correction to be added algebraically to the EPNL 
calculated from the measured data.
    (2) Approach flight path. (i) The procedure described in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section for takeoff flight paths is also used for the 
approach flight path, except that the value for SPLic relate to the 
approach sound propagation paths shown in Figure H3 as follows:

    SPLic = SPLi+(<greek-a>-<greek-a>io) AM+
    <greek-a> (AM-AMr)+ 20 log (AM/AMr)

Where the lines NS and N<INF>r</INF>S<INF>r</INF> are the measured and 
referenced approach sound propagation paths, respectively.
    (ii) The remainder of the procedure is the same as that prescribed 
in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, regarding takeoff flight path.
    (3) Sideline microphones. The procedure prescribed in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section for takeoff flight paths is also used for the 
propagation to the sideline microphones, except that the values of SPLic 
relate only in the measured sideline sound propagation path as follows:

    SPLic - SPLi + (<greek-a>io-<greek-a>+io)KX
    + <greek-a>io (KX-KXr) +20 log (KX/KXr)

K is the sideline measuring station where

X=L and Xr=Ln for takeoff
X=M and Xr=Mn for approach
X=N and Xr=Nr for flyover

    (4) Level flyover flight path. The procedure prescribed in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section for takeoff flight paths is also used for the 
level flyover flight path, except that the values of SPLic relate only 
to the flyover sound propagation paths as follows:

SPLic=SPLi+(<greek-a>-<greek-a>io) AN + <greek-a>io (AN-ANr)+20 log (AN/
          ANr)

    (g) Duration corrections. (1) If the measured takeoff and approach 
flight paths do not conform to those prescribed as the corrected and 
reference flight paths, respectively, under section A36.5(d)(2) it will 
be necessary to apply duration corrections to the EPNL values calculated 
from the measured data. Such corrections must be calculated as follows:
    (i) Takeoff flight path. For the takeoff flight path shown in Figure 
H1, the correction term is calculated using the formula--

 <greek-D> <INF>2</INF> = -10 log (AT/ATr) + 10 log (V/Vr)

which represents the correction which must be added algebraically to the 
EPNL calculated from the measured data. The lengths AT and ATr are the 
measured and corrected takeoff minimum distances from the noise 
measuring station A to the measured and the corrected flight paths, 
respectively. A negative sign indicates that, for the particular case of 
a duration correction, the EPNL calculated from the measured data must 
be reduced if the measured flight path is at greater altitude than the 
corrected flight path.

[[Page 823]]

    (ii) Approach flight path. For the approach flight path shown in 
Figure H3, the correction term is calculated using the formula--

<greek-D> <INF>2</INF> = -10 log (AS/ASr) + 10 log (V/Vr)

where AS is the measured approach minimum distance from the noise 
measuring station A to the measured flight path and 394 feet is the 
minimum distance from station A to the reference flight path.
    (iii) Sideline microphones. For the sideline flight path, the 
correction term is calculated using the formula--

<greek-D> <INF>2</INF> = -10 log (KX/KXr)+10 log (V/Vr)

K is the sideline measuring station

where X=T and Xr=Tr for takeoff
where X=S and Xr=Sr for approach
where X=G and Xr=Gr for flyover

    (iv) Level flyover flight paths. For the level flyover flight path, 
the correction term is calculated using the formula--

<greek-D> <INF>2</INF> = -10 log (AG/AGr)+10 log (V/Vr)

where AG is the measured flyover altitude over the noise measuring 
station A.
    (2) The adjustment procedure described in this section shall apply 
to the sideline microphones in the take-off, overflight, and approach 
cases. Although the noise emission is strongly dependent on the 
directivity pattern, variable from one helicopter type to another, the 
propagation angle <greek-th> shall be the same for test and reference 
flight paths. The elevation angle <greek-ps> shall not be constrained 
but must be determined and reported. The certification authority shall 
specify the acceptable limitations on <greek-ps>. Corrections to data 
obtained when these limits are exceeded shall be applied using FAA 
approved procedures.

                 Part D--Noise Limits Under Sec. 36.805

     Section H36.301  Noise measurement, evaluation, and calculation

    Compliance with this part of this appendix must be shown with noise 
levels measured, evaluated, and calculated as prescribed under Parts B 
and C of this appendix.

                       Section H36.303  [Reserved]

                      Section H36.305  Noise levels

    (a) Limits. For compliance with this appendix, it must be shown by 
flight test that the calculated noise levels of the helicopter, at the 
measuring points described in section H36.305(a) of this appendix, do 
not exceed the following, with appropriate interpolation between 
weights:
    (1) Stage 1 noise limits for acoustical changes for helicopters are 
as follows:
    (i) For takeoff, flyover, and approach calculated noise levels, the 
noise levels of each Stage 1 helicopter that exceed the Stage 2 noise 
limits plus 2 EPNdB may not, after a change in type design, exceed the 
noise levels created prior to the change in type design.
    (ii) For takeoff, flyover, and approach calculated noise levels, the 
noise levels of each Stage 1 helicopter that do not exceed the Stage 2 
noise limits plus 2 EPNdB may not, after the change in type design, 
exceed the Stage 2 noise limits plus 2 EPNdB.
    (2) Stage 2 noise limits are as follows:
    (i) For takeoff calculated noise levels--109 EPNdB for maximum 
takeoff weights of 176,370 pounds or more, reduced by 3.01 EPNdB per 
halving of the weight down to 89 EPNdB for maximum weights of 1,764 
pounds or less.
    (ii) For flyover calculated noise levels--108 EPNdB for maximum 
weights of 176,370 pounds or more, reduced by 3.01 EPNdB per halving of 
the weight down to 88 EPNdB for maximum weights of 1,764 pounds or less.
    (iii) For approach calculated noise levels--110 EPNdB for maximum 
weights of 176,370 pounds or more, reduced by 3.01 EPNdB per halving of 
the weight down 90 EPNdB for maximum weight of 1,764 pounds or less.
    (b) Tradeoffs. Except to the extent limited under Sec. 36.11(b) of 
this part, the noise limits prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section 
may be exceeded by one or two of the takeoff, flyover, or approach 
calculated noise levels determined under section H36.203 of this 
appendix if
    (1) The sum of the exceedances is not greater than 4 EPNdB;
    (2) No exceedance is greater than 3 EPNdB; and
    (3) The exceedances are completely offset by reduction in the other 
required calculated noise levels.

                          Section J36.1 General

    This appendix prescribes the alternative noise certification 
requirements identified under Sec. 36.1 of this part and subpart H of 
this part for helicopters in the primary, normal, transport, and 
restricted categories having maximum certificated takeoff weight of not 
more than 6,000 pounds including:
    (a) The conditions under which an alternative noise certification 
test under subpart H of this part must be conducted and the alternative 
measurement procedure that must be used under Sec. 36.801 of this part 
to measure the helicopter noise during the test;
    (b) The alternative procedures which must be used under Sec. 36.803 
of this part to correct the measured data to the reference conditions 
and to calculate the noise evaluation quantity designated as Sound 
Exposure Level (SEL); and
    (c) The noise limits for which compliance must be shown under 
Sec. 36.805 of this part.

                Section J36.3  Reference Test Conditions

    (a) Meteorological conditions. The following are the noise 
certification reference atmospheric conditions which shall be assumed to 
exist from the surface to the helicopter altitude:
    (1) Sea level pressure of 2116 pounds per square foot (76 
centimeters mercury);
    (2) Ambient temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees 
Celsius);
    (3) Relative humidity of 70 percent; and
    (4) Zero wind.
    (b) Reference test site. The reference test site is flat and without 
line-of-sight obstructions across the flight path that encompasses the 
10 dB down points of the A-weighted time history.
    (c) Level flyover reference profile. The reference flyover profile 
is a level flight 492 feet (150 meters) above ground level as measured 
at the noise measuring station. The reference flyover profile has a 
linear flight track and passes directly over the noise monitoring 
station. Airspeed is stabilized at 0.9V<INF>H</INF>; 0.9V<INF>NE</INF>; 
0.45V<INF>H</INF> + 65 kts (0.45V<INF>H</INF> + 120 km/h); or 
0.45V<INF>NE</INF> + 65 kts (0.45V<INF>NE</INF> + 120 km/h), whichever 
of the four speeds is least. Rotor speed is stabilized at the power on 
maximum normal operating RPM throughout the 10 dB down time period.
    (1) For noise certification purposes, V<INF>H</INF> is defined as 
the airspeed in level flight obtained using the minimum specification 
engine power corresponding to maximum continuous power available for sea 
level, 77 degree Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) ambient conditions at 
the relevant maximum certificated weight. The value of V<INF>H</INF> 
thus defined must be listed in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual.
    (2) V<INF>NE</INF> is the never-exceed airspeed.
    (d) The weight of the helicopter shall be the maximum takeoff weight 
at which noise certification is requested.

                        Section J36.5  [Reserved]

          Part B--Noise Measurement Procedure Under Sec. 36.801

  Section J36.101  Noise certification test and measurement conditions

    (a) General. This section prescribes the conditions under which 
helicopter noise certification tests must be conducted and the 
measurement procedures that must be used to measure helicopter noise 
during each test.
    (b) Test site requirements. (1) The noise measuring station must be 
surrounded by terrain having no excessive sound absorption 
characteristics, such as might be caused by thick, matted, or tall 
grass, shrubs, or wooded areas.
    (2) During the period when the flyover noise measurement is within 
10 dB of the maximum A-weighted sound level, no obstruction that 
significantly influences the sound field from the helicopter may exist 
within a conical space above the noise measuring position (the point on 
the ground vertically below the microphone), the cone is defined by an 
axis normal to the ground and by half-angle 80 degrees from this axis.
    (c) Weather restrictions. The test must be conducted under the 
following atmospheric conditions:
    (1) No rain or other precipitation;
    (2) Ambient air temperature between 36 degrees and 95 degrees 
Fahrenheit (2 degrees and 35 degrees Celsius), inclusively, and relative 
humidity between 20 percent and 95 percent inclusively, except that 
testing may not take place where combinations of temperature and 
relative humidity result in a rate of atmospheric attenuation greater 
than 10 dB per 100 meters (30.5 dB per 1000 ft) in

[[Page 825]]

the one-third octave band centered at 8 kiloHertz.
    (3) Wind velocity that does not exceed 10 knots (19 km/h) and a 
crosswind component that does not exceed 5 knots (9 km/h). The wind 
shall be determined using a continuous averaging process of no greater 
than 30 seconds;
    (4) Measurements of ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind 
speed, and wind direction must be made between 4 feet (1.2 meters) and 
33 feet (10 meters) at the noise monitoring station. Unless otherwise 
approved by the FAA, ambient temperature and relative humidity must be 
measured at the noise measuring station at the same height above the 
ground.
    (5) No anomalous wind conditions (including turbulence) or other 
anomalous meteorological conditions that will significantly affect the 
noise level of the helicopter when the noise is recorded at the noise 
measuring station; and
    (6) The location of the meteorological instruments must be approved 
by the FAA as representative of those atmospheric conditions existing 
near the surface over the geographical area where the helicopter noise 
measurements are made. In some cases, a fixed meteorological station 
(such as those found at airports or other facilities) may meet this 
requirement.
    (d) Helicopter testing procedures. (1) The helicopter testing 
procedures and noise measurements must be conducted and processed in a 
manner which yields the noise evaluation measure designated Sound 
Exposure Level (SEL) as defined in section J36.109(b) of this appendix.
    (2) The helicopter height relative to the noise measurement point 
sufficient to make corrections required under section J36.205 of this 
appendix must be determined by an FAA-approved method that is 
independent of normal flight instrumentation, such as radar tracking, 
theodolite triangulation, laser trajectography, or photographic scaling 
techniques.
    (3) If an applicant demonstrates that the design characteristics of 
the helicopter would prevent flight from being conducted in accordance 
with the reference test conditions prescribed under section J36.3 of 
this appendix, then with FAA approval, the reference test conditions 
used under this appendix may vary from the standard reference test 
conditions, but only to the extent demanded by those design 
characteristics which make compliance with the reference test conditions 
impossible.

                       Section J36.103  [Reserved]

                Section J36.105  Flyover test conditions

    (a) This section prescribes the flight test conditions and allowable 
random deviations for flyover noise tests conducted under this appendix.
    (b) A test series must consist of at least six flights with equal 
numbers of flights in opposite directions over the noise measuring 
station:
    (1) In level flight and in cruise configuration;
    (2) At a height of 492 feet <plus-minus>50 feet (150 <plus-minus>15 
meters) above the ground level at the noise measuring station; and
    (3) Within <plus-minus>10 degrees from the zenith.
    (c) Each flyover noise test must be conducted:
    (1) At the reference airspeed specified in section J36.3(c) of this 
appendix, with such airspeed adjusted as necessary to produce the same 
advancing blade tip Mach number as associated with the reference 
conditions;
    (i) Advancing blade tip Mach number (M<INF>AT</INF>) is defined as 
the ratio of the arithmetic sum of blade tip rotational speed 
(V<INF>R</INF>) and the helicopter true air speed (V<INF>T</INF>) over 
the speed of sound (c) at 77 degrees Fahrenheit (1135.6 ft/sec or 346.13 
m/sec) such that M<INF>AT</INF> = (V<INF>R</INF> + V<INF>T</INF>)/c; and
    (ii) The airspeed shall not vary from the adjusted reference 
airspeed by more than <plus-minus>3 knots (<plus-minus>5 km/hr) or an 
equivalent FAA-approved variation from the reference advancing blade tip 
Mach number. The adjusted reference airspeed shall be maintained 
throughout the measured portion of the flyover.
    (2) At rotor speed stabilized at the power on maximum normal 
operating rotor RPM (<plus-minus>1 percent); and
    (3) With the power stabilized during the period when the measured 
helicopter noise level is within 10 dB of the maximum A-weighted sound 
level (L<INF>AMAX</INF>).
    (d) The helicopter test weight for each flyover test must be within 
plus 5 percent or minus 10 percent of the maximum takeoff weight for 
which certification under this part is requested.
    (e) The requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
notwithstanding, flyovers at an FAA-approved lower height may be used 
and the results adjusted to the reference measurement point by an FAA-
approved method if the ambient noise in the test area, measured in 
accordance with the requirements prescribed in section J36.109 of this 
appendix, is found to be within 15 dB(A) of the maximum A-weighted 
helicopter noise level (L<INF>AMAX</INF>) measured at the noise 
measurement station in accordance with section J36.109 of this appendix.

                       Section J36.107  [Reserved]

 Section J36.109  Measurement of helicopter noise received on the ground

    (a) General. (1) The helicopter noise measured under this appendix 
for noise certification purposes must be obtained with FAA-

[[Page 826]]

approved acoustical equipment and measurement practices.
    (2) Paragraph (b) of this section identifies and prescribes the 
specifications for the noise evaluation measurements required under this 
appendix. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section prescribe the required 
acoustical equipment specifications. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of this 
section prescribe the calibration and measurement procedures required 
under this appendix.
    (b) Noise unit definition. (1) The value of sound exposure level 
(SEL, or as denoted by symbol, L<INF>AE</INF>), is defined as the level, 
in decibels, of the time integral of squared `A'-weighted sound pressure 
(P<INF>A</INF>) over a given time period or event, with reference to the 
square of the standard reference sound pressure (P<INF>O</INF>) of 20 
micropascals and a reference duration of one second.
    (2) This unit is defined by the expression:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.118
    
Where T<INF>O</INF> is the reference integration time of one second and 
(t<INF>2</INF>-t<INF>1</INF>) is the integration time interval.
    (3) The integral equation of paragraph (b)(2) of this section can 
also be expressed as:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC28SE91.119

Where L<INF>A</INF>(t) is the time varying A-weighted sound level.
    (4) The integration time (t<INF>2</INF>-t<INF>1</INF>) in practice 
shall not be less than the time interval during which L<INF>A</INF>(t) 
first rises to within 10 dB(A) of its maximum value (L<INF>AMAX</INF>) 
and last falls below 10 dB(A) of its maximum value.
    (5) The SEL may be approximated by the following expression:

L<INF>AE</INF> = L<INF>AMAX</INF> + <delta> A

    where <delta> A is the duration allowance given by:

<delta> A = 10 log<INF>10</INF> (T)

    where T = (t<INF>2</INF>-t<INF>1</INF>)/2 and L<INF>AMAX</INF> is 
defined as the maximum level, in decibels, of the A-weighted sound 
pressure (slow response) with reference to the square of the standard 
reference sound pressure (P<INF>0</INF>).
    (c) Measurement system. The acoustical measurement system must 
consist of FAA-approved equipment equivalent to the following:
    (1) A microphone system with frequency response that is compatible 
with the measurement and analysis system accuracy prescribed in 
paragraph (d) of this section;
    (2) Tripods or similar microphone mountings that minimize 
interference with the sound energy being measured;
    (3) Recording and reproducing equipment with characteristics, 
frequency response, and dynamic range that are compatible with the 
response and accuracy requirements of paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (4) Acoustic calibrators using sine wave noise and, if a tape 
recording system is used, pink noise, of known levels. When pink noise 
(defined in section H36.109(e)(1) of Appendix H of this part) is used, 
the signal must be described in terms of its root-mean-square (rms) 
value.
    (d) Sensing, recording, and reproducing equipment. (1) The noise 
levels measured from helicopter flyovers under this appendix may be 
determined directly by an integrating sound level meter, or the A-
weighted sound level time history may be written onto a graphic level 
recorder set at ``slow'' response from which the SEL value may be 
determined. With the approval of the FAA, the noise signal may be tape 
recorded for subsequent analysis.
    (i) The SEL values from each flyover test may be directly determined 
from an integrating sound level meter complying with the Standards of 
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Publication No. 804, 
``Integrating-averaging Sound Level Meters,'' as incorporated by 
reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part, for a Type 1 instrument set at 
``slow'' response.
    (ii) The acoustic signal from the helicopter, along with the 
calibration signals specified under paragraph (e) of this section and 
the background noise signal required under paragraph (f) of this section 
may be recorded on a magnetic tape recorder for subsequent analysis by 
an integrating sound level meter identified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of 
this section. The record/playback system (including the audio tape) of 
the tape recorder must conform to the requirements prescribed in section 
H36.109(c)(3) of Appendix H of this part. The tape recorder shall comply 
with specifications of IEC Publication No. 561, ``Electro-acoustical 
Measuring Equipment for Aircraft Noise Certification,'' as incorporated 
by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part.
    (iii) The characteristics of the complete system shall comply with 
the recommendations given in IEC Publication No. 651, ``Sound Level 
Meters,'' as incorporated by reference under Sec. 36.6 of this part, 
with regard to the specifications concerning microphone, amplifier, and 
indicating instrument characteristics.
    (iv) The response of the complete system to a sensibly plane 
progressive wave of constant amplitude shall lie within the tolerance 
limits specified in Table IV and Table V for Type 1 instruments in IEC 
Publication

[[Page 827]]

No. 651, ``Sound Level Meters,'' as incorporated by reference under 
Sec. 36.6 of this part, for weighting curve ``A'' over the frequency 
range of 45 Hz to 11500 Hz.
    (v) A windscreen must be used with the microphone during each 
measurement of the helicopter flyover noise. Correction for any 
insertion loss produced by the windscreen, as a function of the 
frequency of the acoustic calibration required under paragraph (e) of 
this section, must be applied to the measured data and any correction 
applied must be reported.
    (e) Calibrations. (1) If the helicopter acoustic signal is tape 
recorded for subsequent analysis, the measuring system and components of 
the recording system must be calibrated as prescribed under section 
H36.109(e) of Appendix H of this part.
    (2) If the helicopter acoustic signal is directly measured by an 
integrating sound level meter:
    (i) The overall sensitivity of the measuring system shall be checked 
before and after the series of flyover tests and at intervals (not 
exceeding one-hour duration) during the flyover tests using an acoustic 
calibrator using sine wave noise generating a known sound pressure level 
at a known frequency.
    (ii) The performance of equipment in the system will be considered 
satisfactory if, during each day's testing, the variation in the 
calibration value does not exceed 0.5 dB. The SEL data collected during 
the flyover tests shall be adjusted to account for any variation in the 
calibration value.
    (iii) A performance calibration analysis of each piece of 
calibration equipment, including acoustic calibrators, reference 
microphones, and voltage insertion devices, must have been made during 
the six calendar months proceeding the beginning of the helicopter 
flyover series. Each calibration shall be traceable to the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology.
    (f) Noise measurement procedures. (1) The microphone shall be of the 
pressure-sensitive capacitive type designed for nearly uniform grazing 
incidence response. The microphone shall be mounted with the center of 
the sensing element 4 feet (1.2 meters) above the local ground surface 
and shall be oriented for grazing incidence such that the sensing 
element, the diaphragm, is substantially in the plane defined by the 
nominal flight path of the helicopter and the noise measurement station.
    (2) If a tape recorder is used, the frequency response of the 
electrical system must be determined at a level within 10 dB of the 
full-scale reading used during the test, utilizing pink or pseudorandom 
noise.
    (3) The ambient noise, including both acoustical background and 
electrical noise of the measurement systems shall be determined in the 
test area and the system gain set at levels which will be used for 
helicopter noise measurements. If helicopter sound levels do not exceed 
the background sound levels by at least 15 dB(A), flyovers at an FAA-
approved lower height may be used and the results adjusted to the 
reference measurement point by an FAA-approved method.
    (4) If an integrating sound level meter is used to measure the 
helicopter noise, the instrument operator shall monitor the continuous 
A-weighted (slow response) noise levels throughout each flyover to 
ensure that the SEL integration process includes, at minimum, all of the 
noise signal between the maximum A-weighted sound level 
(L<INF>AMAX</INF>) and the 10 dB down points in the flyover time 
history. The instrument operator shall note the actual db(A) levels at 
the start and stop of the SEL integration interval and document these 
levels along with the value of L<INF>AMAX</INF> and the integration 
interval (in seconds) for inclusion in the noise data submitted as part 
of the reporting requirements under section J36.111(b) of this appendix.

                 Section J36.111  Reporting Requirements

    (a) General. Data representing physical measurements, and 
corrections to measured data, including corrections to measurements for 
equipment response deviations, must be recorded in permanent form and 
appended to the record. Each correction is subject to FAA approval.

conforming to the standards prescribed in section J36.109 of this 
appendix;
    (2) The type of equipment used for measurement and analysis of all 
acoustic, aircraft performance and flight path, and meteorological data;
    (3) The atmospheric environmental data required to demonstrate 
compliance with this appendix, measured throughout the test period;

may interfere with the sound recording;
    (5) The following helicopter information:
    (i) Type, model, and serial numbers, if any, of helicopter, 
engine(s) and rotor(s);
    (ii) Gross dimensions of helicopter, location of engines, rotors, 
type of antitorque system, number of blades for each rotor, and 
reference operating conditions for each engine and rotor;
    (iii) Any modifications of non-standard equipment likely to affect 
the noise characteristics of the helicopter;
    (iv) Maximum takeoff weight for which certification under this 
appendix is requested;
    (v) Aircraft configuration, including landing gear positions;

[[Page 828]]

    (vi) V<INF>H</INF> or V<INF>NE</INF> (whichever is less) and the 
adjusted reference airspeed;
    (vii) Aircraft gross weight for each test run;
    (viii) Indicated and true airspeed for each test run;
    (ix) Ground speed, if measured, for each run;
    (x) Helicopter engine performance as determined from aircraft 
instruments and manufacturer's data; and
    (xi) Aircraft flight path above ground level, referenced to the 
elevation of the noise measurement station, in feet, determined by an 
FAA-approved method which is independent of normal flight 
instrumentation, such as radar tracking, theodolite triangulation, laser 
trajectography, or photoscaling techniques; and
    (6) Helicopter position and performance data required to make the 
adjustments prescribed under section J36.205 of this appendix and to 
demonstrate compliance with the performance and position restrictions 
prescribed under section J36.105 of this appendix must be recorded at an 
FAA-approved sampling rate.

                       Section J36.113  [Reserved]

       Part C--Noise Evaluation and Calculations Under Sec. 36.803

                Section J36.201  Noise Evaluation in SEL

    The noise evaluation measure shall be the sound exposure level (SEL) 
in units of dB(A) as prescribed under section J36.109(b) of this 
appendix. The SEL value for each flyover may be directly determined by 
use of an integrating sound level meter. Specifications for the 
integrating sound level meter and requirements governing the use of such 
instrumentation are prescribed under section J36.109 of this appendix.

              Section J36.203  Calculation of Noise Levels

    (a) To demonstrate compliance with the noise level limits specified 
under section J36.305 of this appendix, the SEL noise levels from each 
valid flyover, corrected as necessary to reference conditions under 
section J36.205 of this appendix, must be arithmetically averaged to 
obtain a single SEL dB(A) mean value for the flyover series. No 
individual flyover run may be omitted from the averaging process, unless 
otherwise specified or approved by the FAA.
    (b) The minimum sample size acceptable for the helicopter flyover 
certification measurements is six. The number of samples must be large 
enough to establish statistically a 90 percent confidence limit that 
does not exceed <plus-minus>1.5 dB(A).
    (c) All data used and calculations performed under this section, 
including the calculated 90 percent confidence limits, must be 
documented and provided under the reporting requirements of section 
J36.111 of this appendix.

          Section J36.205  Detailed Data Correction Procedures

    (a) When certification test conditions measured under part B of this 
appendix differ from the reference test conditions prescribed under 
section J36.3 of this appendix, appropriate adjustments shall be made to 
the measured noise data in accordance with the methods set out in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. At minimum, appropriate 
adjustments shall be made for off-reference altitude and for the 
difference between reference airspeed and adjusted reference airspeed.
    (b) The adjustment for off-reference altitude may be approximated 
from:

<delta>J<INF>1</INF>=12.5 log<INF>10</INF>(H<INF>T</INF>/492) dB;

 where <delta>J<INF>1</INF> is the quantity in decibels that must be 
algebraically added to the measured SEL noise level to correct for an 
off-reference flight path, H<INF>T</INF> is the height, in feet, of the 
test helicopter when directly over the noise measurement point, and the 
constant (12.5) accounts for the effects on spherical spreading and 
duration from the off-reference altitude.
    (c) The adjustment for the difference between reference airspeed and 
adjusted reference airspeed is calculated from:

<delta>J<INF>3</INF>=10 log<INF>10</INF>(V<INF>RA</INF>/V<INF>R</INF>) 
dB;

Where <delta>J<INF>3</INF> is the quantity in decibels that must be 
algebraically added to the measured SEL noise level to correct for the 
influence of the adjustment of the reference airspeed on the duration of 
the measured flyover event as perceived at the noise measurement 
station, V<INF>R</INF> is the reference airspeed as prescribed under 
section J36.3.(c) of this appendix, and V<INF>RA</INF> is the adjusted 
reference airspeed as prescribed under section J36.105(c) of this 
appendix.
    (d) No correction for source noise during the flyover other than the 
variation of source noise accounted for by the adjustment of the 
reference airspeed prescribed for under section J36.105(c) of this 
appendix need be applied.
    (e) No correction for the difference between the reference ground 
speed and the actual ground speed need be applied.
    (f) No correction for off-reference atmospheric attenuation need be 
applied.
    (g) The SEL adjustments must be less than 2.0 dB(A) for differences 
between test and reference flight procedures prescribed under section 
J36.105 of this appendix unless a larger adjustment value is approved by 
the FAA.
    (h) All data used and calculations performed under this section must 
be documented and provided under the reporting requirements specified 
under section J36.111 of this appendix.

            Part D--Noise Limits Procedure Under Sec. 36.805

     Section J36.301  Noise Measurement, Evaluation, and Calculation

    Compliance with this part of this appendix must be shown with noise 
levels measured, evaluated, and calculated as prescribed under parts B 
and C of this appendix.

                       Section J36.303  [Reserved]

                      Section J36.305  Noise Limits

    For compliance with this appendix, the calculated noise levels of 
the helicopter, at the measuring point described in section J36.101 of 
this appendix, must be shown to not exceed the following (with 
appropriate interpolation between weights):
    (a) For primary, normal, transport, and restricted category 
helicopters having a maximum certificated takeoff weight of not more 
than 6,000 pounds and noise tested under this appendix, the Stage 2 
noise limit is 82 decibels SEL for helicopters with maximum certificated 
takeoff weight at which the noise certification is requested, of up to 
1,764 pounds and increasing at a rate of 3.01 decibels per doubling of 
weight thereafter. The limit may be calculated by the equation:

L<INF>AE(limit)</INF>=82+3.01[log<INF>10</INF>(MTOW/1764)/
log<INF>10</INF>(2)] dB;

where MTOW is the maximum takeoff weight, in pounds, for which 
certification under this appendix is requested.
    (b) The procedures required in this amendment shall be done in 
accordance with the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC 
Publication No. 804, entitled ``Integrating-averaging Sound Level 
Meters,'' First Edition, dated 1985. This incorporation by reference was 
approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5

Sec. 23.1325 or Sec. 25.1325, whichever is applicable.
    (3) Determine that the static port heater, if installed, is 
operative.
    (4) Ensure that no alterations or deformations of the airframe 
surface have been made that would affect the relationship between air 
pressure in the static pressure system and true ambient static air 
pressure for any flight condition.
    (b) Altimeter:
    (1) Test by an appropriately rated repair facility in accordance 
with the following subparagraphs. Unless otherwise specified, each test 
for performance may be conducted with the instrument subjected to 
vibration. When tests are conducted with the temperature substantially 
different from ambient temperature of approximately 25 degrees C., 
allowance shall be made for the variation from the specified condition.
    (i) Scale error. With the barometric pressure scale at 29.92 inches 
of mercury, the altimeter shall be subjected successively to pressures 
corresponding to the altitude specified in Table I up to the maximum 
normally expected operating altitude of the airplane in which the 
altimeter is to be installed. The reduction in pressure shall be made at 
a rate not in excess of 20,000 feet per minute to within approximately 
2,000 feet of the test point. The test point shall be approached at a 
rate compatible with the test equipment. The altimeter shall be kept at 
the pressure corresponding to each test point for at least 1 minute, but 
not more than 10 minutes, before a reading is taken. The error at all 
test points must not exceed the tolerances specified in Table I.

[[Page 842]]

    (ii) Hysteresis. The hysteresis test shall begin not more than 15 
minutes after the altimeter's initial exposure to the pressure 
corresponding to the upper limit of the scale error test prescribed in 
subparagraph (i); and while the altimeter is at this pressure, the 
hysteresis test shall commence. Pressure shall be increased at a rate 
simulating a descent in altitude at the rate of 5,000 to 20,000 feet per 
minute until within 3,000 feet of the first test point (50 percent of 
maximum altitude). The test point shall then be approached at a rate of 
approximately 3,000 feet per minute. The altimeter shall be kept at this 
pressure for at least 5 minutes, but not more than 15 minutes, before 
the test reading is taken. After the reading has been taken, the 
pressure shall be increased further, in the same manner as before, until 
the pressure corresponding to the second test point (40 percent of 
maximum altitude) is reached. The altimeter shall be kept at this 
pressure for at least 1 minute, but not more than 10 minutes, before the 
test reading is taken. After the reading has been taken, the pressure 
shall be increased further, in the same manner as before, until 
atmospheric pressure is reached. The reading of the altimeter at either 
of the two test points shall not differ by more than the tolerance 
specified in Table II from the reading of the altimeter for the 
corresponding altitude recorded during the scale error test prescribed 
in paragraph (b)(i).
    (iii) After effect. Not more than 5 minutes after the completion of 
the hysteresis test prescribed in paragraph (b)(ii), the reading of the 
altimeter (corrected for any change in atmospheric pressure) shall not 
differ from the original atmospheric pressure reading by more than the 
tolerance specified in Table II.
    (iv) Friction. The altimeter shall be subjected to a steady rate of 
decrease of pressure approximating 750 feet per minute. At each altitude 
listed in Table III, the change in reading of the pointers after 
vibration shall not exceed the corresponding tolerance listed in Table 
III.
    (v) Case leak. The leakage of the altimeter case, when the pressure 
within it corresponds to an altitude of 18,000 feet, shall not change 
the altimeter reading by more than the tolerance shown in Table II 
during an interval of 1 minute.
    (vi) Barometric scale error. At constant atmospheric pressure, the 
barometric pressure scale shall be set at each of the pressures (falling 
within its range of adjustment) that are listed in Table IV, and shall 
cause the pointer to indicate the equivalent altitude difference shown 
in Table IV with a tolerance of 25 feet.
    (2) Altimeters which are the air data computer type with associated 
computing systems, or which incorporate air data correction internally, 
may be tested in a manner and to specifications developed by the 
manufacturer which are acceptable to the Administrator.
    (c) Automatic Pressure Altitude Reporting Equipment and ATC 
Transponder System Integration Test. The test must be conducted by an 
appropriately rated person under the conditions specified in paragraph 
(a). Measure the automatic pressure altitude at the output of the 
installed ATC transponder when interrogated on Mode C at a sufficient 
number of test points to ensure that the altitude reporting equipment, 
altimeters, and ATC transponders perform their intended functions as 
installed in the aircraft. The difference between the automatic

      Appendix F to Part 43--ATC Transponder Tests and Inspections

    The ATC transponder tests required by Sec. 91.413 of this chapter 
may be conducted using a bench check or portable test equipment and must 
meet the requirements prescribed in paragraphs (a) through (j) of this 
appendix. If portable test equipment with appropriate coupling to the 
aircraft antenna system is used, operate the test equipment for ATCRBS 
transponders at a nominal rate of 235 interrogations per second to avoid 
possible ATCRBS interference. Operate the test equipment at a nominal 
rate of 50 Mode S interrogations per second for Mode S. An additional 3 
dB loss is allowed to compensate for antenna coupling errors during 
receiver sensitivity measurements conducted in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1) when using portable test equipment.
    (a) Radio Reply Frequency:
    (1) For all classes of ATCRBS transponders, interrogate the 
transponder and verify that the reply frequency is 1090<plus-minus>3 
Megahertz (MHz).
    (2) For classes 1B, 2B, and 3B Mode S transponders, interrogate the 
transponder and verify that the reply frequency is 1090<plus-minus>3 
MHz.
    (3) For classes 1B, 2B, and 3B Mode S transponders that incorporate 
the optional 1090<plus-minus>1 MHz reply frequency, interrogate the 
transponder and verify that the reply frequency is correct.
    (4) For classes 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4 Mode S transponders, interrogate 
the transponder and verify that the reply frequency is 1090<plus-minus>1 
MHz.
    (b) Suppression: When Classes 1B and 2B ATCRBS Transponders, or 
Classes 1B, 2B, and 3B Mode S transponders are interrogated Mode 3/A at 
an interrogation rate between 230 and 1,000 interrogations per second; 
or when Classes 1A and 2A ATCRBS Transponders, or Classes 1B, 2A, 3A, 
and 4 Mode S transponders are interrogated at a rate between 230 and 
1,200 Mode 3/A interrogations per second:
    (1) Verify that the transponder does not respond to more than 1 
percent of ATCRBS interrogations when the amplitude of P<INF>2</INF> 
pulse is equal to the P<INF>1</INF> pulse.
    (2) Verify that the transponder replies to at least 90 percent of 
ATCRBS interrogations when the amplitude of the P<INF>2</INF> pulse is 9 
dB less than the P<INF>1</INF> pulse. If the test is conducted with a 
radiated test signal, the interrogation rate shall be 235<plus-minus>5 
interrogations per second unless a higher rate has been approved for the 
test equipment used at that location.
    (c) Receiver Sensitivity:
    (1) Verify that for any class of ATCRBS Transponder, the receiver 
minimum triggering level (MTL) of the system is -73<plus-minus>4 dbm, or 
that for any class of Mode S transponder the receiver MTL for Mode S 
format (P6 type) interrogations is -74<plus-minus>3 dbm by use of a test 
set either:
    (i) Connected to the antenna end of the transmission line;
    (ii) Connected to the antenna terminal of the transponder with a 
correction for transmission line loss; or
    (iii) Utilized radiated signal.
    (2) Verify that the difference in Mode 3/A and Mode C receiver 
sensitivity does not exceed 1 db for either any class of ATCRBS 
transponder or any class of Mode S transponder.
    (d) Radio Frequency (RF) Peak Output Power:
    (1) Verify that the transponder RF output power is within 
specifications for the class of transponder. Use the same conditions as 
described in (c)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) above.
    (i) For Class 1A and 2A ATCRBS transponders, verify that the minimum 
RF peak output power is at least 21.0 dbw (125 watts).
    (ii) For Class 1B and 2B ATCRBS Transponders, verify that the 
minimum RF peak output power is at least 18.5 dbw (70 watts).

[[Page 844]]

    (iii) For Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4 and those Class 1B, 2B, and 3B 
Mode S transponders that include the optional high RF peak output power, 
verify that the minimum RF peak output power is at least 21.0 dbw (125 
watts).
    (iv) For Classes 1B, 2B, and 3B Mode S transponders, verify that the 
minimum RF peak output power is at least 18.5 dbw (70 watts).
    (v) For any class of ATCRBS or any class of Mode S transponders, 
verify that the maximum RF peak output power does not exceed 27.0 dbw 
(500 watts).
    Note: The tests in (e) through (j) apply only to Mode S 
transponders.
    (e) Mode S Diversity Transmission Channel Isolation: For any class 
of Mode S transponder that incorporates diversity operation, verify that 
the RF peak output power transmitted from the selected antenna exceeds 
the power transmitted from the nonselected antenna by at least 20 db.
    (f) Mode S Address: Interrogate the Mode S transponder and verify 
that it replies only to its assigned address. Use the correct address 
and at least two incorrect addresses. The interrogations should be made 
at a nominal rate of 50 interrogations per second.
    (g) Mode S Formats: Interrogate the Mode S transponder with uplink 
formats (UF) for which it is equipped and verify that the replies are 
made in the correct format. Use the surveillance formats UF=4 and 5. 
Verify that the altitude reported in the replies to UF=4 are the same as 
that reported in a valid ATCRBS Mode C reply. Verify that the identity 
reported in the replies to UF=5 are the same as that reported in a valid 
ATCRBS Mode 3/A reply. If the transponder is so equipped, use the 
communication formats UF=20, 21, and 24.
    (h) Mode S All-Call Interrogations: Interrogate the Mode S 
transponder with the Mode S-only all-call format UF=11, and the ATCRBS/
Mode S all-call formats (1.6 microsecond P<INF>4</INF> pulse) and verify 
that the correct address and capability are reported in the replies 
(downlink format DF=11).
    (i) ATCRBS-Only All-Call Interrogation: Interrogate the Mode S 
transponder with the ATCRBS-only all-call interrogation (0.8 microsecond 
P<INF>4</INF> pulse) and verify that no reply is generated.
    (j) Squitter: Verify that the Mode S transponder generates a correct 
squitter approximately once per second.
    (k) Records: Comply with the provisions of Sec. 43.9 of this chapter 
as to content, form, and disposition of the records.

who produces a replacement or modification part under a Parts 
Manufacturer Approval issued under Sec. 21.303 of this chapter shall 
permanently and legibly mark the part with--
    (1) The letters ``FAA-PMA'';
    (2) The name, trademark, or symbol of the holder of the Parts 
Manufacturer Approval;
    (3) The part number; and
    (4) The name and model designation of each type certificated product 
on which the part is eligible for installation.
    (b) If the Administrator finds that a part is too small or that it 
is otherwise impractical to mark a part with any of the information 
required by paragraph (a) of this section, a tag attached to the part or 
its container must include the information that could not be marked on 
the part. If the marking required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section is 
so extensive that to mark it on a tag is impractical, the tag attached 
to the part or the container may refer to a specific readily available

<R05>
Sec. 47.3  Registration required.

    (a) Section 501(b) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 
1401 (b)) defines eligibility for registration as follows:

    (b) An aircraft shall be eligible for registration if, but only if--
    (1)(A) it is--
    (i) owned by a citizen of the United States or by an individual 
citizen of a foreign country who has lawfully been admitted for 
permanent residence in the United States; or
    (ii) owned by a corporation (other than a corporation which is a

under the laws of the United States or any State thereof so long as such 
aircraft is based and primarily used in the United States; and
    (B) it is not registered under the laws of any foreign country; or

[[Page 851]]

    (2) it is an aircraft of the Federal Government, or of a State, 
territory, or possession of the United States or the District of 
Columbia or a political subdivision thereof.

    (b) No person may operate on aircraft that is eligible for 
registration under section 501 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958

its owner.
    (c) Section 501(f) of the Act (49 U.S.C. 1401(f)), provides that 
registration is not evidence of ownership of aircraft in any proceeding 
in which ownership by a particular person is in issue. The FAA does not 
issue any certificate of ownership or endorse any information with 
respect to ownership on a Certificate of Aircraft Registration. The FAA 
issues a Certificate of Aircraft Registration to the person who appears 
to be the owner on the basis of the evidence of ownership submitted 
pursuant to Sec. 47.11 with the Application for Aircraft Registration, 
or recorded at the FAA Aircraft Registry.
    (d) In this part, ``owner'' includes a buyer in possession, a 
bailee, or a lessee of an aircraft under a contract of conditional sale, 
and the assignee of that person.

<R05>
Sec. 47.7  United States citizens and resident aliens.

    (a) U.S. citizens. An applicant for aircraft registration under this 
part who is a U.S. citizen must certify to this in the application.
    (b) Resident aliens. An applicant for aircraft registration under 
section 501(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act who is a resident alien must furnish 
a representation of permanent residence and the applicant's alien 
registration number issued by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service.
    (c) Trustees. An applicant for aircraft registration under section 
501(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act that holds legal title to an aircraft in 
trust must comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Each trustee must be either a U.S. citizen or a resident alien.
    (2) The applicant must submit with the application--
    (i) A copy of each document legally affecting a relationship under 
the trust;
    (ii) If each beneficiary under the trust, including each person 
whose security interest in the aircraft is incorporated in the trust, is 
either a U.S. citizen or a resident alien, an affidavit by the applicant 
to that effect; and
    (iii) If any beneficiary under the trust, including any person whose 
security interest in the aircraft is incorporated in the trust, is not a 
U.S. citizen or resident alien, an affidavit from each trustee stating 
that the trustee is not aware of any reason, situation, or relationship 
(involving beneficiaries or other persons who are not U.S. citizens or 
resident aliens) as a result of which those persons together would have 
more than 25 percent of the aggregate power to influence or limit the 
exercise of the trustee's authority.
    (3) If persons who are neither U.S. citizens nor resident aliens 
have the power to direct or remove a trustee, either directly or 
indirectly through the control of another person, the trust instrument 
must provide that those persons together may not have more than 25 
percent of the aggregate power to direct or remove a trustee. Nothing in 
this paragraph prevents those persons from having more than 25 percent 
of the beneficial interest in the trust.
    (d) Partnerships. A partnership may apply for a Certificate of 
Aircraft Registration under section 501(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act only if 
each partner, whether a general or limited partner, is a citizen of the 
United States. Nothing in this section makes ineligible for registration 
an aircraft which is not owned as

[[Page 852]]

a partnership asset but is co-owned by--
    (1) Resident aliens; or
    (2) One or more resident aliens and one or more U.S. citizens.

[Amdt. 47-20, 44 FR 61939, Oct. 29, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 47.8  Voting trusts.

    (a) If a voting trust is used to qualify a domestic corporation as a 
U.S. citizen, the corporate applicant must submit to the FAA Aircraft 
Registry--
    (1) A true copy of the fully executed voting trust agreement, which 
must identify each voting interest of the applicant, and which must be 
binding upon each voting trustee, the applicant corporation, all foreign 
stockholders, and each other party to the transaction; and
    (2) An affidavit executed by each person designated as voting 
trustee in the voting trust agreement, in which each affiant 
represents--
    (i) That each voting trustee is a citizen of the United States 
within the meaning of section 101(16) of the Act;
    (ii) That each voting trustee is not a past, present, or prospective 
director, officer, employee, attorney, or agent of any other party to 
the trust agreement;
    (iii) That each voting trustee is not a present or prospective 
beneficiary, creditor, debtor, supplier or contractor of any other party 
to the trust agreement;
    (iv) That each voting trustee is not aware of any reason, situation, 
or relationship under which any other party to the agreement might 
influence the exercise of the voting trustee's totally independent 
judgment under the voting trust agreement.
    (b) Each voting trust agreement submitted under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section must provide for the succession of a voting trustee in the 
event of death, disability, resignation, termination of citizenship, or 
any other event leading to the replacement of any voting trustee. Upon 
succession, the replacement voting trustee shall immediately submit to 
the FAA Aircraft Registry the affidavit required by paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (c) If the voting trust terminates or is modified, and the result is 
less than 75 percent control of the voting interest in the corporation 
by citizens of the United States, a loss of citizenship of the holder of 
the registration certificate occurs, and Sec. 47.41(a)(5) of this part 
applies.
    (d) A voting trust agreement may not empower a trustee to act 
through a proxy.

[Amdt. 47-20, 44 FR 61939, Oct. 29, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 47.9  Corporations not U.S. citizens.

used in the United States; and
    (4) The location where the records required by paragraph (e) of this 
section will be maintained.
    (b) For the purposes of registration, an aircraft is based and 
primarily used in the United States if the flight hours accumulated 
within the United States amount to at least 60 percent of the total 
flight hours of the aircraft during--
    (1) For aircraft registered on or before January 1, 1980, the 6-

Sec. 47.15  Identification number.

    (a) Number required. An applicant for Aircraft Registration must 
place a U.S. identification number (registration mark) on his Aircraft 
Registration Application, AC Form 8050-1, and on any evidence submitted 
with the application. There is no charge for the assignment of numbers 
provided in this paragraph. This paragraph does not apply to an aircraft 
manufacturer who applies for a group of U.S. identification numbers 
under paragraph (c) of this section; a person who applies for a special 
identification number under paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section; 
or a holder of a Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate who applies 
for a temporary registration number under Sec. 47.16.
    (1) Aircraft not previously registered anywhere. The applicant must 
obtain the U.S. identification number from the FAA Aircraft Registry by 
request in writing describing the aircraft by make, type, model, and 
serial number (or, if it is amateur-built, as provided in Sec. 47.33(b)) 
and stating that the aircraft has not previously been registered 
anywhere. If the aircraft was brought into the United States from a 
foreign country, the applicant must submit evidence that the aircraft 
has never been registered in a foreign country.
    (2) Aircraft last previously registered in the United States. Unless 
he applies for a different number under paragraphs (d) through (g) of 
this section, the applicant must place the U.S. identification number 
that is already assigned to the aircraft on his application and the 
supporting evidence.
    (3) Aircraft last previously registered in a foreign country. 
Whether or not the foreign registration has ended, the applicant must 
obtain a U.S. identification number from the FAA Aircraft Registry for 
an aircraft last previously registered in a foreign country, by request 
in writing describing the aircraft by make, model, and serial number, 
accompanied by--
    (i) Evidence of termination of foreign registration in accordance 
with Sec. 47.37(b) or the applicant's affidavit showing that foreign 
registration has ended; or
    (ii) If foreign registration has not ended, the applicant's 
affidavit stating that the number will not be placed on the aircraft 
until foreign registration has ended.

Authority to use the identification number obtained under paragraph 
(a)(1) or (3) of this section expires 90 days after the date it is 
issued unless the applicant submits an Aircraft Registration 
Application, AC Form 8050-1, and complies with Sec. 47.33 or Sec. 47.37, 
as applicable, within that period of time. However, the applicant may 
obtain an extension of this 90-day period from the FAA Aircraft Registry 
if he shows that his delay in complying with that section is due to 
circumstances beyond his control.
    (b) A U.S. identification number may not exceed five symbols in 
addition to the prefix letter ``N''. These symbols may be all numbers 
(N10000), one to four numbers and one suffix letter (N 1000A), or one to 
three numbers and two suffix letters (N 100AB). The letters ``I'' and 
``O'' may not be used. The first zero in a number must always be 
preceded by at least one of the numbers 1 through 9.
    (c) An aircraft manufacturer may apply to the FAA Aircraft Registry 
for enough U.S. identification numbers to supply his estimated 
production for the next 18 months. There is no charge for this 
assignment of numbers.
    (d) Any unassigned U.S. identification number may be assigned as a 
special identification number. An applicant who wants a special 
identification number or wants to change the identification number of 
his aircraft may apply for it to the FAA Aircraft Registry. The fee 
required by Sec. 47.17 must accompany the application.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) The FAA Aircraft Registry assigns a special identification 
number on AC Form 8050-64. Within 5 days after he affixes the special 
identification number to his aircraft, the owner must complete and sign 
the receipt contained in AC Form 8050-64, state the date he affixed the 
number to his aircraft, and return the original form to the FAA Aircraft 
Registry. The owner shall carry the duplicate of AC Form 8050-64 and the 
present Certificate of Aircraft

[[Page 856]]

Registration in the aircraft as temporary authority to operate it. This 
temporary authority is valid until the date the owner receives the 
revised Certificate of Aircraft Registration issued by the FAA Aircraft 
Registry.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) A special identification number may be reserved for no more than 
1 year. If a person wishes to renew his reservation from year to year, 
he must apply to the FAA aircraft Registry for renewal and submit the 
fee required by Sec. 47.17 for a special identification number.

Sec. 47.16  Temporary registration numbers.

    (a) Temporary registration numbers are issued by the FAA to 
manufacturers, distributors, and dealers who are holders of Dealer's 
Aircraft Registration Certificates for temporary display on aircraft 
during flight allowed under Subpart C of this part.
    (b) The holder of a Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate may 
apply to the FAA Aircraft Registry for as many temporary registration 
numbers as are necessary for his business. The application must be in 
writing and include--
    (1) Sufficient information to justify the need for the temporary 
registration numbers requested; and
    (2) The number of each Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate 
held by the applicant.

There is no charge for these numbers.
    (c) The use of temporary registration numbers is subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The numbers may be used and reused--
    (i) Only in connection with the holder's Dealer's Aircraft 
Registration Certificate;
    (ii) Within the limitations of Sec. 47.69 where applicable, 
including the requirements of Sec. 47.67; and
    (iii) On aircraft not registered under Subpart B of this part or in 
a foreign country, and not displaying any other identification markings.
    (2) A temporary registration number may not be used on more than one 
aircraft in flight at the same time.
    (3) Temporary registration numbers may not be used to fly aircraft 
into the United States for the purpose of importation.
    (d) The assignment of any temporary registration number to any 
person lapses upon the expiration of all of his Dealer's Aircraft 
Registration Certificates. When a temporary registration number is used 
on a flight outside the United States for delivery purposes, the holder 
shall record the assignment of that number to the aircraft and shall 
keep that record for at least 1 year after the removal of the number 
from that aircraft. Whenever the owner of an aircraft bearing a 
temporary registration number applies for an airworthiness certificate 
under Part 21 of this chapter he shall furnish that number in the 
application. The temporary registration number must be removed from the 
aircraft not later than the date on which either title or possession 
passes to another person.

    (3) The fee required by Sec. 47.17.

The FAA rejects an application when any form is not completed, or when

<R05>
Sec. 49.17  Conveyances recorded.

    (a) Each instrument recorded under this part is a ``conveyance'' 
within the following definition in section 101(17) of the Federal 
Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1301):

    (17) ``Conveyance'' means a bill of sale, contract of conditional 
sale, mortgage, assignment of mortgage, or other instrument affecting 
title to, or interest in, property.

A notice of Federal tax lien is not recordable under this part, since it 
is required to be filed elsewhere by the Internal Revenue Code (26 
U.S.C. 6321, 6323; 26 CFR 301.6321-1, 301.6323-1).
    (b) The kinds of conveyance recordable under this part include those 
used as evidence of ownership under Sec. 47.11 of this chapter.
    (c) The validity of any instrument, eligible for recording under 
this part, is governed by the laws of the State, possession, Puerto 
Rico, or District of Columbia, as the case may be, in which the 
instrument was delivered, regardless of the location or place of 
delivery of the property affected by the instrument. If the place where 
an instrument is intended to be delivered is stated in the instrument, 
it is presumed that the instrument was delivered at that place. The 
recording of a conveyance is not a decision of the FAA that the 
instrument does, in fact, affect title to, or an interest in, the 
aircraft or other property it covers.
    (d) The following rules apply to conveyances executed for security 
purposes and assignments thereof:
    (1) A security agreement must be signed by the debtor. If the debtor 
is not the registered owner of the aircraft, the security agreement must 
be accompanied by the debtor's Application for Aircraft Registration and 
evidence of ownership, as prescribed in Part 47 of this chapter, unless 
the debtor--

[[Page 864]]

    (i) Holds a Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate and submits 
evidence of ownership as provided in Sec. 47.67 of this chapter (if 
applicable);
    (ii) Was the owner of the aircraft on the date the security 
agreement was signed, as shown by documents recorded at the FAA Aircraft 
Registry; or
    (iii) Is the vendor, bailor, or lessor under a contract of 
conditional sale.
    (2) The name of a cosigner may not appear in the security agreement 
as a debtor or owner. If a person other than the registered owner signs 
the security agreement, that person must show the capacity in which that 
person signs, such as ``cosigner'' or ``guarantor''.
    (3) An assignment of an interest in a security agreement must be 
signed by the assignor and, unless it is attached to and is a part of 
the original agreement, must describe the agreement in sufficient detail 
to identify it, including its date, the names of the parties, the date 
of FAA recording, and the recorded conveyance number.
    (4) An amendment of, or a supplement to, a conveyance executed for 
security purposes that has been recorded by the FAA must meet the 
requirements for recording the original conveyance and must describe the 
original conveyance in sufficient detail to identify it, including its 
date, the names of the parties, the date of FAA recording, and the 
recorded conveyance number.
    (5) Immediately after a debt secured by a conveyance given for 
security purposes has been satisfied, or any of the encumbered aircraft 
have been released from the conveyance, the holder shall execute a 
release on AC Form 8050-41, Part II--Release, provided to him by the FAA 
when the conveyance was recorded by the FAA, or its equivalent, and 
shall send it to the FAA Aircraft Registry for recording. If the debt is 
secured by more than one aircraft and all of the collateral is released, 
the collateral need not be described in detail in the release. However, 
the original conveyance must be clearly described in enough detail to 
identify it, including its date, the names of the parties, the date of 
FAA recording, and the recorded conveyance number.
    (6) A contract of conditional sale, as defined in section 101(19) of 
the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1301(19)), must be signed by 
all parties to the contract.

recording, the copy is kept by the FAA and the original is returned to 
the applicant stamped with the date and time of recording. The copy must 
be imprinted on paper permanent in nature, including dates, and 
signatures, to which is attached a certificate of the person submitting 
the conveyance stating that the copy has been compared with the original 
and that it is a true copy.
