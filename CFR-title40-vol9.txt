                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2000), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

    (c) Table 1 of this section specifies the provisions of subpart A 
(General

[[Page 11]]

Provisions, Secs. 63.1-63.15) that apply and those that do not apply to 
sources affected by this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1201  Definitions and acronyms used in this subpart.

    (a) The terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in 
subpart A of this part, or in this section as follows:
    Air pollution control system means the equipment used to reduce the 
release of particulate matter and other pollutants to the atmosphere.
    Automatic waste feed cutoff (AWFCO) system means a system comprised 
of cutoff valves, actuator, sensor, data manager, and other necessary 
components and electrical circuitry designed, operated and maintained to 
stop the flow of hazardous waste to the combustion unit automatically 
and immediately (except as provided by Sec. 63.1206(c)(2)(viii)) when 
any operating requirement is exceeded.
    By-pass duct means a device which diverts a minimum of 10 percent of 
a cement kiln's off gas, or a device which the Administrator determines 
on a case-by-case basis diverts a sample of kiln gas that contains 
levels of carbon monoxide or hydrocarbons representative of the levels 
in the kiln.
    Combustion chamber means the area in which controlled flame 
combustion of hazardous waste occurs.
    Continuous monitor means a device which continuously samples the 
regulated parameter specified in Sec. 63.1209 without interruption, 
evaluates the detector response at least once every 15 seconds, and 
computes and records the average value at least every 60 seconds, except 
during allowable periods of calibration and except as defined otherwise 
by the CEMS Performance Specifications in appendix B, part 60 of this 
chapter.
    Dioxin/furan and dioxins and furans mean tetra-, penta-, hexa-, 
hepta-, and octa-chlorinated dibenzo dioxins and furans.
    Existing source means any affected source that is not a new source.
    Feedrate operating limits means limits on the feedrate of materials 
(e.g., metals, chlorine) to the combustor that are established based on 
comprehensive performance testing. The limits are established and 
monitored by knowing the concentration of the limited material (e.g., 
chlorine) in each feedstream and the flowrate of each feedstream.
    Feedstream means any material fed into a hazardous waste combustor, 
including, but not limited to, any pumpable or nonpumpable solid, 
liquid, or gas.
    Flowrate means the rate at which a feedstream is fed into a 
hazardous waste combustor.
    Hazardous waste is defined in Sec. 261.3 of this chapter.
    Hazardous waste burning cement kiln means a rotary kiln and any 
associated preheater or precalciner devices that produce clinker by 
heating limestone and other materials for subsequent production of 
cement for use in commerce, and that burns hazardous waste at any time.
    Hazardous waste combustor means a hazardous waste incinerator, 
hazardous waste burning cement kiln, or hazardous waste burning 
lightweight aggregate kiln.
    Hazardous waste incinerator means a device defined as an incinerator 
in Sec. 260.10 of this chapter and that burns hazardous waste at any 
time.
    Hazardous waste lightweight aggregate kiln means a rotary kiln that 
produces clinker by heating materials such as slate, shale and clay for 
subsequent production of lightweight aggregate used in commerce, and 
that burns hazardous waste at any time.
    Hazardous waste residence time means the time elapsed from cutoff of 
the flow of hazardous waste into the combustor (including, for example, 
the time required for liquids to flow from the cutoff valve into the 
combustor) until solid, liquid, and gaseous materials from the hazardous 
waste, excluding residues that may adhere to combustion chamber 
surfaces, exit the combustion chamber. For combustors with multiple 
firing systems whereby the residence time may vary for the firing 
systems, the hazardous waste residence time for purposes of complying 
with this subpart means the longest residence time for any firing system 
in use at the time of waste cutoff.
    Initial comprehensive performance test means the comprehensive 
performance

[[Page 12]]

test that is used as the basis for initially demonstrating compliance 
with the standards.
    In-line kiln raw mill means a hazardous waste burning cement kiln 
design whereby kiln gas is ducted through the raw material mill for 
portions of time to facilitate drying and heating of the raw material.
    Instantaneous monitoring means continuously sampling, detecting, and 
recording the regulated parameter without use of an averaging period.
    Monovent means an exhaust configuration of a building or emission

principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must calculate DRE for each POHC 
from the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.021

Where:

W<INF>in</INF>=mass feedrate of one principal organic hazardous 
          constituent (POHC) in a waste feedstream; and
W<INF>out</INF>=mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust 
          emissions prior to release to the atmosphere

    (2) 99.9999% DRE. If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes 
FO20, FO21, FO22, FO23, FO26, or FO27 (see Sec. 261.31 of this chapter), 
you must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.9999% 
for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) that you 
designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must demonstrate 
this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than 
tetro-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-dioxins and dibenzofurans. You 
must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section calculate DRE 
for each POHC. In addition, you must notify the Administrator of your 
intent to burn hazardous wastes FO20, FO21, FO22, FO23, FO26, or FO27.
    (3) Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs). (i) You must 
treat the Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs) in the waste 
feed that you specify under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to the 
extent required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
    (ii) You must specify one or more POHCs from the list of hazardous 
air pollutants established by 42 U.S.C. 7412(b)(1), excluding 
caprolactam (CAS number 105602) as provided by Sec. 63.60, for each 
waste to be burned. You must base this specification on the degree of 
difficulty of incineration of the organic constituents in the waste and 
on their concentration or mass in the waste feed, considering the 
results of waste analyses or other data and information.
    (d) Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. 
Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three 
significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two 
significant figures to document compliance.
    (e) Air emission standards for equipment leaks, tanks, surface 
impoundments, and containers. You are subject to the air emission 
standards of subparts BB and CC, part 264, of this chapter.

                  Monitoring and Compliance Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 63.1206  When and how must you comply with the standards and operating requirements?

    (a) Compliance dates--(1) Compliance date for existing sources. You 
must comply with the standards of this subpart no later than September 
30, 2002 unless the Administrator grants you an extension of time under 
Sec. 63.6(i) or Sec. 63.1213, or you comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section for sources that do not intend to 
comply with the emission standards.
    (2) Sources that do not intend to comply. Except for those sources 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 63.1210(b)(1)(iv), sources:
    (i) That signify in their Notification of Intent to Comply (NIC) an 
intent not to comply with the requirements of this subpart, must stop 
burning hazardous waste on or before October 1, 2001.
    (ii) That do not intend to comply with this subpart must include in 
their NIC a schedule that includes key dates for the steps to be taken 
to stop burning hazardous waste. Key dates include the date for 
submittal of RCRA closure

[[Page 21]]

documents required under subpart G, part 264, of this chapter.
    (3) New or reconstructed sources. (i) If you commenced construction 
or reconstruction of your hazardous waste combustor after April 19, 
1996, you must comply with this subpart by the later of September 30, 
1999 or the date the source starts operations, except as provided by 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) For a standard in this subpart that is more stringent than the 
standard proposed on April 19, 1996, you may achieve compliance no later 
than September 30, 2002 if you comply with the standard proposed on 
April 19, 1996 after September 30, 1999. This exception does not apply, 
however, to new or reconstructed area source hazardous waste combustors 
that become major sources after September 30, 1999. As provided by 
Sec. 63.6(b)(7), such sources must comply with this subpart at startup.
    (b) Compliance with standards--(1) Applicability. The emission 
standards and operating requirements set forth in this subpart apply at 
all times except:
    (i) During startup, shutdown, and malfunction, provided that 
hazardous waste is not in the combustion chamber (i.e., the hazardous 
waste feed to the combustor has been cutoff for a period of time not 
less than the hazardous waste residence time) during those periods of 
operation, as provided by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section; and
    (ii) When hazardous waste is not in the combustion chamber (i.e., 
the hazardous waste feed to the combustor has been cutoff for a period 
of time not less than the hazardous waste residence time), and you have:
    (A) Submitted a written, one-time notice to the Administrator 
documenting compliance with all applicable requirements and standards 
promulgated under authority of the Clean Air Act, including sections 112 
and 129; and
    (B) Documented in the operating record that you are complying with 
such applicable requirements in lieu of the emission standards and 
operating requirements of this subpart.
    (2) Methods for determining compliance. The Administrator will 
determine compliance with the emission standards of this subpart as 
provided by Sec. 63.6(f)(2). Conducting performance testing under 
operating conditions representative of the extreme range of normal 
conditions is consistent with the requirements of 
Secs. 63.6(f)(2)(iii)(B) and 63.7(e)(1) to conduct performance testing 
under representative operating conditions.
    (3) Finding of compliance. The Administrator will make a finding 
concerning compliance with the emission standards and other requirements 
of this subpart as provided by Sec. 63.6(f)(3).
    (4) Extension of compliance with emission standards. The 
Administrator may grant an extension of compliance with the emission 
standards of this subpart as provided by Secs. 63.6(i) and 63.1213.
    (5) Changes in design, operation, or maintenance--(i) Changes that 
may adversely affect compliance. If you plan to change (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section) the design, operation, or 
maintenance practices of the source in a manner that may adversely 
affect compliance with any emission standard that is not monitored with 
a CEMS:
    (A) Notification. You must notify the Administrator at least 60 days 
prior to the change, unless you document circumstances that dictate that 
such prior notice is not reasonably feasible. The notification must 
include:
    (1) A description of the changes and which emission standards may be 
affected; and
    (2) A comprehensive performance test schedule and test plan under 
the requirements of Sec. 63.1207(f) that will document compliance with 
the affected emission standard(s);
    (B) Performance test. You must conduct a comprehensive performance 
test under the requirements of Secs. 63.1207(f)(1) and (g)(1) to 
document compliance with the affected emission standard(s) and establish 
operating parameter limits as required under Sec. 63.1209, and submit to 
the Administrator a Notification of Compliance under Secs. 63.1207(j) 
and 63.1210(d); and
    (C) Restriction on waste burning. (1) Except as provided by 
paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C)(2) of this section, after the change and prior to 
submitting the notification of compliance, you must not burn hazardous 
waste for more than a total of 720 hours and only for purposes

[[Page 22]]

of pretesting or comprehensive performance testing.
    (2) You may petition the Administrator to obtain written approval to 
burn hazardous waste in the interim prior to submitting a Notification 
of Compliance for purposes other than testing or pretesting. You must 
specify operating requirements, including limits on operating 
parameters, that you determine will ensure compliance with the emission 
standards of this subpart based on available information. The 
Administrator will review, modify as necessary, and approve if warranted 
the interim operating requirements.
    (ii) Changes that will not affect compliance. If you determine that 
a change will not adversely affect compliance with the emission 
standards or operating requirements, you must document the change in the 
operating record upon making such change. You must revise as necessary 
the performance test plan, Documentation of Compliance, Notification of 
Compliance, and start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan to reflect 
these changes.
    (iii) Definition of ``change''. For purposes of paragraph (b)(6) of 
this section, ``change'' means any change in design, operation, or 
maintenance practices that were documented in the comprehensive 
performance test plan, Notification of Compliance, or startup, shutdown, 
and malfunction plan.
    (6) Compliance with the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission 
standards. This paragraph applies to sources that elect to comply with 
the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions standards under 
Secs. 63.1203 through 63.1205 by documenting continuous compliance with 
the carbon monoxide standard using a continuous emissions monitoring 
system and documenting compliance with the hydrocarbon standard during 
the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) performance test or its 
equivalent.
    (i) If a DRE test performed after March 30, 1998 is acceptable as 
documentation of compliance with the DRE standard, you may use the 
highest hourly rolling average hydrocarbon level achieved during those 
DRE test runs to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard. An 
acceptable DRE test is a test that was used to support successful 
issuance or reissuance of an operating permit under part 270 of this 
chapter.
    (ii) If during this acceptable DRE test you did not obtain 
hydrocarbon emissions data sufficient to document compliance with the 
hydrocarbon standard, you must either:
    (A) Perform, as part of the performance test, an ``equivalent DRE 
test'' to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard. An 
equivalent DRE test is comprised of a minimum of three runs each with a 
minimum duration of one hour during which you operate the combustor as 
close as reasonably possible to the operating parameter limits that you 
established based on the initial DRE test. You must use the highest 
hourly rolling average hydrocarbon emission level achieved during the 
equivalent DRE test to document compliance with the hydrocarbon 
standard; or (B) Perform a DRE test as part of the performance test.
    (7) Compliance with the DRE standard. (i) Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(7)(ii) and (b)(7)(iii) of this section:
    (A) You must document compliance with the Destruction and Removal 
Efficiency (DRE) standard under Secs. 63.1203 through 63.1205 only once 
provided that you do not modify the source after the DRE test in a 
manner that could affect the ability of the source to achieve the DRE 
standard; and
    (B) You may use DRE testing performed after March 30, 1998 for 
purposes of issuance or reissuance of a RCRA permit under part 270 of 
this chapter to document conformance with the DRE standard if you have 
not modified the design or operation of the source since the DRE test in 
a manner that could affect the ability of the source to achieve the DRE 
standard.
    (ii) For sources that feed hazardous waste at a location in the 
combustion system other than the normal flame zone:
    (A) You must demonstrate compliance with the DRE standard during 
each comprehensive performance test; and
    (B) You may use DRE testing performed after March 30, 1998 for 
purposes of issuance or reissuance of a RCRA permit under part 270 of 
this chapter to document conformance with

[[Page 23]]

the DRE standard in lieu of DRE testing during the initial comprehensive 
performance test if you have not modified the design or operation of the 
source since the DRE test in a manner that could affect the ability of 
the source to achieve the DRE standard.
    (iii) For sources that do not use DRE testing performed prior to the 
compliance date to document conformance with the DRE standard, you must 
perform DRE testing during the initial comprehensive performance test.
    (8) Applicability of particulate matter and opacity standards during 
particulate matter CEMS correlation tests. (i) Any particulate matter 
and opacity standards of parts 60, 61, 63, 264, 265, and 266 of this 
chapter (i.e., any title 40 particulate or opacity standards) applicable 
to a hazardous waste combustor do not apply while you conduct 
particulate matter continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) 
correlation tests (i.e., correlation with manual stack methods) under 
the conditions of paragraphs (b)(8)(iii) through (vii) of this section.
    (ii) Any permit or other emissions or operating parameter limits or 
conditions, including any limitation on workplace practices, that are 
applicable to hazardous waste combustors to ensure compliance with any 
particulate matter and opacity standards of parts 60, 61, 63, 264, 265, 
and 266 of this chapter (i.e., any title 40 particulate or opacity 
standards) do not apply while you conduct particulate matter CEMS 
correlation tests under the conditions of paragraphs (b)(8)(iii) through 
(vii) of this section.
    (iii) For the provisions of this section to apply, you must:
    (A) Develop a particulate matter CEMS correlation test plan that 
includes the following information. This test plan may be included as 
part of the comprehensive performance test plan required under 
Secs. 63.1207(e) and (f):
    (1) Number of test conditions and number of runs for each test 
condition;
    (2) Target particulate matter emission level for each test 
condition;
    (3) How you plan to modify operations to attain the desired 
particulate matter emission levels; and
    (4) Anticipated normal particulate matter emission levels; and
    (B) Submit the test plan to the Administrator for approval at least 
90 calendar days before the correlation test is scheduled to be 
conducted.
    (iv) The Administrator will review and approve/disapprove the 
correlation test plan under the procedures for review and approval of 
the site-specific test plan provided by Sec. 63.7(c)(3)(i) and (iii). If 
the Administrator fails to approve or disapprove the correlation test 
plan within the time period specified by Sec. 63.7(c)(3)(i), the plan is 
considered approved, unless the Administrator has requested additional 
information.
    (v) The particulate matter and opacity standards and associated 
operating limits and conditions will not be waived for more than 96 
hours, in the aggregate, for a correlation test, including all runs of 
all test conditions.
    (vi) The stack sampling team must be on-site and prepared to perform 
correlation testing no later than 24 hours after you modify operations 
to attain the desired particulate matter emissions concentrations, 
unless you document in the correlation test plan that a longer period of 
conditioning is appropriate.
    (vii) You must return to operating conditions indicative of 
compliance with the applicable particulate matter and opacity standards 
as soon as possible after correlation testing is completed.
    (9) Alternative standards for existing or new hazardous waste 
burning lightweight aggregate kilns using MACT. (i) You may petition the 
Administrator to recommend alternative semivolatile metal, low volatile 
metal, mercury, or hydrochloric acid/chlorine gas emission standards if:
    (A) You cannot achieve one or more of these standards while using 
maximum achievable control technology (MACT) because of the raw material 
contribution to emissions of the regulated metals or hydrochloric acid/
chlorine gas; or
    (B) You determine that mercury is not present at detectable levels 
in your raw material.
    (ii) The alternative standard that you recommend under paragraph

low volatility metal alternative standard petitions that you submit 
under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this section documenting that increased 
chlorine feedrates associated with the burning of hazardous waste, when 
compared to non-hazardous waste operations, do not significantly 
increase metal emissions attributable to raw materials.
    (vi) You must include data or information with semivolatile metal, 
low volatile metal, and hydrochloric acid/chlorine gas alternative 
standard petitions that you submit under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this

on the arithmetic average of the emission results of each run, except 
that you must document compliance with the destruction and removal 
efficiency standard for each run of the comprehensive performance test 
individually.
    (13) Cement kilns and lightweight aggregate kilns that feed 
hazardous waste at a location other than the end where products are 
normally discharged and where fuels are normally fired. (i) Cement kilns 
that feed hazardous waste at a location other than the end where 
products are normally discharged and where fuels are normally fired must 
comply with the hydrocarbon standards of Sec. 63.1204 as follows:

    (14) Alternative particulate matter standard for incinerators with 
de minimis metals. (i) General. You may petition the Administrator for 
an alternative particulate matter standard of 68 mg/dscm, corrected to 
7% oxygen, if you meet the de minimis metals criteria of paragraph 
(b)(14)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Documentation required. The alternative standard petition you 
submit under paragraph (b)(14)(i) of this section must include data or 
information documenting that:
    (A) Your feedstreams do not contain detectable levels of antimony, 
cobalt, manganese, nickel, selenium, lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic 
and beryllium;
    (B) Your combined uncontrolled lead, cadmium and selenium emissions, 
when assuming these metals are present in your feedstreams at one-half 
the detection limit, are below 240 ug/dscm, corrected to 7% oxygen.
    (C) Your combined uncontrolled antimony, cobalt, manganese, nickel, 
chromium, arsenic and beryllium emissions, when assuming these metals

feedstreams at least annually to document that you meet the de minimis 
criteria in paragraph (b)(14)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) You must not operate pursuant to this alternative standard 
unless the Administrator determines and provides written confirmation 
that you meet the eligibility requirements in paragraph (b)(14)(ii) of 
this section.
    (c) Operating requirements--(1) General. (i) You must operate only 
under the operating requirements specified in the Documentation of 
Compliance under Sec. 63.1211(d) or the Notification of Compliance under 
Secs. 63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d), except:

[[Page 27]]

    (A) During performance tests under approved test plans according to 
Sec. 63.1207(e), (f), and (g), and
    (B) Under the conditions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section;
    (ii) The Documentation of Compliance and the Notification of 
Compliance must contain operating requirements including, but not 
limited to, the operating requirements in this section and Sec. 63.1209
    (iii) Failure to comply with the operating requirements is failure 
to ensure compliance with the emission standards of this subpart;
    (iv) Operating requirements in the Notification of Compliance are 
applicable requirements for purposes of parts 70 and 71 of this chapter;
    (v) The operating requirements specified in the Notification of 
Compliance will be incorporated in the title V permit.
    (2) Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan. (i) Except as provided 
by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, you are subject to the startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan requirements of Sec. 63.6(e)(3).
    (ii) Even if you follow the startup and shutdown procedures and the 
corrective measures upon a malfunction that are prescribed in the 
startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the emission standards and 
operating requirements of this subpart apply if hazardous waste is in 
the combustion chamber (i.e., if you are feeding hazardous waste or if 
startup, shutdown, or a malfunction occurs before the hazardous waste 
residence time has transpired after hazardous waste cutoff).
    (iii) You must identify in the plan a projected oxygen correction 
factor based on normal operations to use during periods of startup and 
shutdown.
    (iv) You must record the plan in the operating record.
    (3) Automatic waste feed cutoff (AWFCO)--(i) General. Upon the 
compliance date, you must operate the hazardous waste combustor with a 
functioning system that immediately and automatically cuts off the 
hazardous waste feed, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of 
this section:
    (A) When any of the following are exceeded: Operating parameter 
limits specified under Sec. 63.1209; an emission standard monitored by a 
CEMS; and the allowable combustion chamber pressure;
    (B) When the span value of any CMS detector, except a CEMS, is met 
or exceeded;
    (C) Upon malfunction of a CMS monitoring an operating parameter 
limit specified under Sec. 63.1209 or an emission level; or
    (D) When any component of the automatic waste feed cutoff system 
fails.
    (ii) Ducting of combustion gases. During an AWFCO, you must continue 
to duct combustion gasses to the air pollution control system while 
hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., if the 
hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous 
waste feed cutoff system was activated).
    (iii) Restarting waste feed. You must continue to monitor during the 
cutoff the operating parameters for which limits are established under 
Sec. 63.1209 and the emissions required under that section to be 
monitored by a CEMS, and you must not restart the hazardous waste feed 
until the operating parameters and emission levels are within the 
specified limits.
    (iv) Failure of the AWFCO system. If the AWFCO system fails to 
automatically and immediately cutoff the flow of hazardous waste upon 
exceedance of parameter required to be interlocked with the AWFCO system 
under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, you have failed to comply 
with the AWFCO requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (v) Corrective measures. If, after any AWFCO, there is an exceedance 
of an emission standard or operating requirement, irrespective of 
whether the exceedance occurred while hazardous waste remained in the 
combustion chamber (i.e., whether the hazardous waste residence time has 
transpired since the hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated), 
you must investigate the cause of the AWFCO, take appropriate corrective 
measures to minimize future AWFCOs, and record the findings and 
corrective measures in the operating record.
    (vi) Excessive exceedance reporting. (A) For each set of 10 
exceedances of an

[[Page 28]]

emission standard or operating requirement while hazardous waste remains 
in the combustion chamber (i.e., when the hazardous waste residence time 
has not transpired since the hazardous waste feed was cutoff) during a 
60-day block period, you must submit to the Administrator a written 
report within 5 calendar days of the 10th exceedance documenting the 
exceedances and results of the investigation and corrective measures 
taken.
    (B) On a case-by-case basis, the Administrator may require excessive 
exceedance reporting when fewer than 10 exceedances occur during a 60-
day block period.
    (vii) Testing. The AWFCO system and associated alarms must be tested 
at least weekly to verify operability, unless you document in the 
operating record that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset 
operations and that less frequent inspection will be adequate. At a 
minimum, you must conduct operability testing at least monthly. You must 
document and record in the operating record AWFCO operability test 
procedures and results.
    (viii) Ramping down waste feed. (A) You may ramp down the waste 
feedrate of pumpable hazardous waste over a period not to exceed one 
minute, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii)(B) of this section. 
If you elect to ramp down the waste feed, you must document ramp down 
procedures in the operating and maintenance plan. The procedures must 
specify that the ramp down begins immediately upon initiation of 
automatic waste feed cutoff and the procedures must prescribe a bona 
fide ramping down. If an emission standard or operating limit is 
exceeded during the ramp down, you have failed to comply with the 
emission standards or operating requirements of this subpart.
    (B) If the automatic waste feed cutoff is triggered by an exceedance 
of any of the following operating limits, you may not ramp down the 
waste feed cutoff: Minimum combustion chamber temperature, maximum 
hazardous waste feedrate, or any hazardous waste firing system operating 
limits that may be established for your combustor.
    (4) ESV openings--(i) Failure to meet standards. If an emergency 
safety vent (ESV) opens when hazardous waste remains in the combustion 
chamber (i.e., when the hazardous waste residence time has not 
transpired since the hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated) 
such that combustion gases are not treated as during the most recent 
comprehensive performance test (e.g., if the combustion gas by-passes 
any emission control device that was operating during the performance 
test), it is evidence of your failure to comply with the emission 
standards of this subpart.
    (ii) ESV operating plan. (A) You must develop an ESV operating plan, 
comply with the operating plan, and keep the plan in the operating 
record.
    (B) The ESV operating plan must provide detailed procedures for 
rapidly stopping the waste feed, shutting down the combustor, and 
maintaining temperature and negative pressure in the combustion chamber 
during the hazardous waste residence time, if feasible. The plan must 
include calculations and information and data documenting the 
effectiveness of the plan's procedures for ensuring that combustion 
chamber temperature and negative pressure are maintained as is 
reasonably feasible.
    (iii) Corrective measures. After any ESV opening that results in a 
failure to meet the emission standards as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) 
of this section, you must investigate the cause of the ESV opening, take 
appropriate corrective measures to minimize such future ESV openings, 
and record the findings and corrective measures in the operating record.
    (iv) Reporting requirement. You must submit to the Administrator a 
written report within 5 days of an ESV opening that results in failure 
to meet the emission standards of this subpart (as defined in paragraph 
(c)(4)(i) of this section) documenting the result of the investigation 
and corrective measures taken.
    (5) Combustion system leaks. (i) Combustion system leaks of 
hazardous air pollutants must be controlled by:
    (A) Keeping the combustion zone sealed to prevent combustion system 
leaks; or

[[Page 29]]

    (B) Maintaining the maximum combustion zone pressure lower than 
ambient pressure using an instantaneous monitor; or
    (C) Upon prior written approval of the Administrator, an alternative 
means of control to provide control of combustion system leaks 
equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than ambient 
pressure; and
    (ii) You must specify in the operating record the method used for 
control of combustion system leaks.
    (6) Operator training and certification. (i) You must establish a 
training and certification program for each person who has 
responsibilities affecting operations that may affect emissions of 
hazardous air pollutants from the source. Such persons include, but are 
not limited to, chief facility operators, control room operators, 
continuous monitoring system operators, persons that sample and analyze 
feedstreams, persons that manage and charge feedstreams to the 
combustor, persons that operate emission control devices, ash and waste 
handlers, and maintenance personnel.
    (ii) You must ensure that the source is operated and maintained at 
all times by persons who are trained and certified to perform these and 
any other duties that may affect emissions of hazardous air pollutants.
    (iii) For hazardous waste incinerators, the training and 
certification program must conform to a state-approved training and 
certification program or, if there is no such state program, to the 
American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standard Number QHO-1-1994.
    (iv) For hazardous waste burning cement and lightweight aggregate 
kilns, the training and certification program must be approved by the 
state or the Administrator, and must be complete and reliable and 
conform to principles of good operator and operating practices 
(including training and certification).
    (v) You must record the operator training and certification program 
in the operating record.
    (7) Operation and maintenance plan--(i) General. (A) You must 
prepare and at all times operate according to an operation and 
maintenance plan that describes in detail procedures for operation, 
inspection, maintenance, and corrective measures for all components of 
the combustor, including associated pollution control equipment, that 
could affect emissions of regulated hazardous air pollutants.
    (B) The plan must prescribe how you will operate and maintain the 
combustor in a manner consistent with good air pollution control 
practices for minimizing emissions at least to the levels achieved 
during the comprehensive performance test.
    (C) This plan ensures compliance with the operation and maintenance 
requirements of Sec. 63.6(e) and minimizes emissions of pollutants, 
automatic waste feed cutoffs, and malfunctions.
    (D) You must record the plan in the operating record.
    (ii) Requirements for baghouses at lightweight aggregate kilns and 
incinerators. If you own or operate a hazardous waste incinerator or 
hazardous waste burning lightweight aggregate kiln equipped with a 
baghouse (fabric filter), you must prepare and at all times operate 
according to an operations and maintenance plan that describes in detail 
procedures for inspection, maintenance, and bag leak detection and 
corrective measures for each baghouse used to comply with the standards 
under this subpart.
    (A) The operation and maintenance plan for baghouses must be 
submitted to the Administrator with the initial comprehensive 
performance test plan for review and approval.
    (B) The procedures specified in the operations and maintenance plan 
for inspections and routine maintenance of a baghouse must, at a 
minimum, include the following requirements:
    (1) Daily visual observation of baghouse discharge or stack;
    (2) Daily confirmation that dust is being removed from hoppers 
through visual inspection, or equivalent means of ensuring the proper 
functioning of removal mechanisms;

    (6) Weekly check of bag cleaning mechanisms for proper functioning 
through visual inspection or equivalent means;
    (7) Weekly check of bag tension on reverse air and shaker-type 
baghouses. Such checks are not required for shaker-type baghouses using 
self-tensioning (spring loaded) devices;
    (8) Monthly confirmation of the physical integrity of the baghouse 
through visual inspection of the baghouse interior for air leaks;
    (9) Monthly inspection of bags and bag connections;
    (10) Quarterly inspection of fans for wear, material buildup, and

means; and
    (11) Continuous operation of a bag leak detection system as a 
continuous monitor.
    (C) The procedures for maintenance specified in the operation and 
maintenance plan must, at a minimum, include a preventative maintenance 
schedule that is consistent with the baghouse manufacturer's 
instructions for routine and long-term maintenance.
    (D) The bag leak detection system required by paragraph 
(c)(7)(ii)(B)(11) of this section must meet the following specifications 
and requirements:
    (1) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of continuously detecting and recording 
particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1.0 milligram per 
actual cubic meter or less;
    (2) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative particulate matter loadings;
    (3) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound an audible alarm when an increase in relative 
particulate loadings is detected over a preset level;
    (4) The bag leak detection system shall be installed and operated in 
a manner consistent with available written guidance from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency or, in the absence of such written 
guidance, the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations 
for installation, operation, and adjustment of the system;
    (5) The initial adjustment of the system shall, at a minimum, 
consist of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity 
(range) and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the

    (6) Following initial adjustment, you must not adjust the 
sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay 
time, except as detailed in the operation and maintenance plan required 
under paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A) of this section. You must not increase the 
sensitivity by more than 100 percent or decrease the sensitivity by more 
than 50 percent over a 365 day period unless such adjustment follows a 
complete baghouse inspection which demonstrates the baghouse is in good 
operating condition;
    (7) For negative pressure or induced air baghouses, and positive 
pressure baghouses that are discharged to the atmosphere through a 
stack, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the 
baghouse and upstream of any wet acid gas scrubber; and
    (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm system may be shared among the detectors.
    (E) The operation and maintenance plan required by paragraph

specifies the procedures you will follow in the case of a bag leak 
detection system alarm. The corrective measures plan must include, at a 
minimum, the procedures used to determine and record the time and cause 
of the alarm as well as the corrective measures taken to correct the 
control device malfunction or minimize emissions as specified below. 
Failure to initiate the corrective measures required by this paragraph 
is failure to ensure compliance with the emission standards in this 
subpart.
    (1) You must initiate the procedures used to determine the cause of 
the alarm within 30 minutes of the time the alarm first sounds; and
    (2) You must alleviate the cause of the alarm by taking the 
necessary corrective measure(s) which may include, but are not to be 
limited to, the following measures:

Sec. 63.1207  What are the performance testing requirements?

    (a) General. The provisions of Sec. 63.7 apply, except as noted 
below.
    (b) Types of performance tests--(1) Comprehensive performance test. 
You must conduct comprehensive performance tests to demonstrate 
compliance with the emission standards provided by Secs. 63.1203, 
63.1204, and 63.1205, establish limits for the operating parameters 
provided by Sec. 63.1209, and demonstrate compliance with the 
performance specifications for continuous monitoring systems.
    (2) Confirmatory performance test. You must conduct confirmatory 
performance tests to:
    (i) Demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard 
when the source operates under normal operating conditions; and
    (ii) Conduct a performance evaluation of continuous monitoring 
systems required for compliance assurance with the dioxin/furan emission 
standard under Sec. 63.1209(k).
    (c) Initial comprehensive performance test--(1) Test date. Except as 
provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must commence the 
initial comprehensive performance test not later than six months after 
the compliance date.
    (2) Data in lieu of the initial comprehensive performance test. (i) 
You may request that previous emissions test data serve as documentation 
of conformance with the emission standards of this subpart provided that 
the previous testing was:
    (A) Initiated after March 30, 1998;
    (B) For the purpose of demonstrating emissions under a RCRA permit 
issuance or reissuance proceeding under part 270 of this chapter;
    (C) In conformance with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section; and
    (D) Sufficient to establish the applicable operating parameter 
limits under Sec. 63.1209.
    (ii) You must submit data in lieu of the initial comprehensive 
performance test in lieu of (i.e., if the data are in lieu of all 
performance testing) or with the notification of performance test 
required under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Frequency of testing. You must conduct testing periodically as 
prescribed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. The date of 
commencement of the initial comprehensive performance test is the basis 
for establishing the deadline to commence the initial confirmatory 
performance test and the next comprehensive performance test. You may 
conduct performance testing at any time prior to the required date. The 
deadline for commencing subsequent confirmatory and comprehensive 
performance testing is based on the date of commencement of the previous 
comprehensive performance test. Unless the Administrator grants a time 
extension under paragraph (i) of this section, you must conduct testing 
as follows:
    (1) Comprehensive performance testing. You must commence testing no 
later than 61 months after the date of commencing the previous 
comprehensive performance test. If you submit data in lieu of the 
initial performance test, you must commence the subsequent comprehensive 
performance test within 61 months of the date six months after the 
compliance date.
    (2) Confirmatory performance testing. You must commence confirmatory 
performance testing no later than 31 months after the date of commencing 
the previous comprehensive performance test. If you submit data in lieu 
of the initial performance test, you must commence the initial 
confirmatory performance test within 31 months of the date six months 
after the compliance date. To ensure that the confirmatory test is 
conducted approximately midway between comprehensive performance tests, 
the Administrator will

[[Page 32]]

not approve a test plan that schedules testing within 18 months of 
commencing the previous comprehensive performance test.
    (3) Duration of testing. You must complete performance testing 
within 60 days after the date of commencement, unless the Administrator 
determines that a time extension is warranted based on your 
documentation in writing of factors beyond your control that prevent you 
from meeting the 60-day deadline.
    (e) Notification of performance test and CMS performance evaluation, 
and approval of test plan and CMS performance evaluation plan. (1) The 
provisions of Sec. 63.7(b) and (c) and Sec. 63.8(e) apply, except:
    (i) Comprehensive performance test. You must submit to the 
Administrator a notification of your intention to conduct a 
comprehensive performance test and CMS performance evaluation and a 
site-specific test plan and CMS performance evaluation plan at least one 
year before the performance test and performance evaluation are 
scheduled to begin.
    (A) The Administrator will notify you of approval or intent to deny 
approval of the test plan and CMS performance evaluation plan within 9 
months after receipt of the original plan.
    (B) You must submit to the Administrator a notification of your 
intention to conduct the comprehensive performance test at least 60 
calendar days before the test is scheduled to begin.
    (ii) Confirmatory performance test. You must submit to the 
Administrator a notification of your intention to conduct a confirmatory 
performance test and CMS performance evaluation and a test plan and CMS 
performance evaluation plan at least 60 calendar days before the 
performance test is scheduled to begin. The Administrator will notify 
you of approval or intent to deny approval of the test and CMS 
performance evaluation plans within 30 calendar days after receipt of 
the original plans.
    (2) After the Administrator has approved the test and CMS 
performance evaluation plans, you must make the plans available to the 
public for review. You must issue a public notice announcing the 
approval of the plans and the location where the plans are available for 
review.
    (f) Content of performance test plan. The provisions of 
Secs. 63.7(c)(2)(i)-(iii) and (v) regarding the content of the test plan 
apply. In addition, you must include the following information in the 
test plan:
    (1) Content of comprehensive performance test plan. (i) An analysis 
of each feedstream, including hazardous waste, other fuels, and 
industrial furnace feedstocks, as fired, that includes:

exclude from analysis and explain the basis for excluding them. You must 
conduct the feedstream analysis according to Sec. 63.1208(g);
    (B) An approximate quantification of such identified organic 
hazardous air pollutants in the feedstreams, within the precision 
produced by the analytical procedures of Sec. 63.1208(g); and
    (C) A description of blending procedures, if applicable, prior to 
firing the feedstream, including a detailed analysis of the materials 
prior to blending, and blending ratios;

[[Page 34]]

    (vii) A detailed test protocol, including, for each hazardous waste 
identified, the ranges of hazardous waste feedrate for each feed system, 
and, as appropriate, the feedrates of other fuels and feedstocks, and 
any other relevant parameters that may affect the ability of the 
hazardous waste combustor to meet the dioxin/furan emission standard;
    (viii) A description of, and planned operating conditions for, any

    (x) Such other information as the Administrator reasonably finds 
necessary to determine whether to approve the confirmatory test plan.
    (g) Operating conditions during testing. You must comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 63.7(e). Conducting performance testing under 
operating conditions representative of the extreme range of normal 
conditions is consistent with the requirement of Sec. 63.7(e)(1) to 
conduct performance testing under representative operating conditions.
    (1) Comprehensive performance testing--(i) Operations during 
testing. For the following parameters, you must operate the combustor 
during the performance test under normal conditions (or conditions that 
will result in higher than normal emissions):
    (A) Chlorine feedrate. You must feed normal (or higher) levels of 
chlorine during the dioxin/furan performance test;
    (B) Ash feedrate. For hazardous waste incinerators, you must conduct 
the following tests when feeding normal (or higher) levels of ash: The 
semivolatile metal and low volatile metal performance tests; and the 
dioxin/furan and mercury performance tests if activated carbon injection 
or a carbon bed is used; and
    (C) Cleaning cycle of the particulate matter control device. You 
must conduct the following tests when the particulate matter control 
device undergoes its normal (or more frequent) cleaning cycle: The 
particulate matter, semivolatile metal, and low volatile metal 
performance tests; and the dioxin/furan and mercury performance tests if 
activated carbon injection or a carbon bed is used.
    (ii) Modes of operation. Given that you must establish limits for 
the applicable operating parameters specified in Sec. 63.1209 based on 
operations during the comprehensive performance test, you may conduct 
testing under two or more operating modes to provide operating 
flexibility.
    (iii) Steady-state conditions. (A) Prior to obtaining performance 
test data, you must operate under performance test conditions until you 
reach steady-state operations with respect to emissions of pollutants 
you must measure during the performance test and operating parameters 
under Sec. 63.1209 for which you must establish limits. During system 
conditioning, you must ensure that each operating parameter for which 
you must establish a limit is held at the level planned for the 
performance test. You must include documentation in the performance test 
plan under paragraph (f) of this section justifying the duration of 
system conditioning.
    (B) If you own or operate a hazardous waste cement kiln that 
recycles collected particulate matter (i.e., cement kiln dust) into the 
kiln, you must sample and analyze the recycled particulate matter prior 
to obtaining performance test data for levels of selected metals that 
must be measured during performance testing to document that the system 
has reached steady-state conditions (i.e., that metals levels have 
stabilized). You must document the rationale for selecting metals that 
are indicative of system equilibrium and include the information in the 
performance test plan under paragraph (f) of this section. To determine 
system equilibrium, you must sample and analyze the recycled particulate 
matter hourly for each selected metal, unless you submit in the 
performance test plan a justification for reduced sampling and analysis 
and the Administrator approves in writing a reduced sampling and 
analysis frequency.
    (2) Confirmatory performance testing. You must conduct confirmatory 
performance testing for dioxin/furan under normal operating conditions 
for the following parameters:

[[Page 35]]

    (i) Carbon monoxide (or hydrocarbon) CEMS emission levels must be 
within the range of the average value to the maximum value allowed. The 
average value is defined as the sum of the hourly rolling average values 
recorded (each minute) over the previous 12 months divided by the number 
of rolling averages recorded during that time;
    (ii) Each operating limit (specified in Sec. 63.1209) established to 
maintain compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard must be held 
within the range of the average value over the previous 12 months and 
the maximum or minimum, as appropriate, that is allowed. The average 
value is defined as the sum of the rolling average values recorded over 
the previous 12 months divided by the number of rolling averages 
recorded during that time. The average value must not include 
calibration data, malfunction data, and data obtained when not burning 
hazardous waste;
    (iii) You must feed chlorine at normal feedrates or greater; and 
(iv) If the combustor is equipped with carbon injection or carbon bed, 
normal cleaning cycle of the particulate matter control device.
    (h) Operating conditions during subsequent testing. (1) Current 
operating parameter limits established under Sec. 63.1209 are waived 
during subsequent comprehensive performance testing under an approved 
test plan.
    (2) Current operating parameter limits are also waived during 
pretesting prescribed in the approved test plan prior to comprehensive 
performance testing for an aggregate time not to exceed 720 hours of 
operation. Pretesting means:
    (i) Operations when stack emissions testing for dioxin/furan, 
mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, particulate matter, 
or hydrochloric acid/chlorine gas is being performed; and
    (ii) Operations to reach steady-state operating conditions prior to 
stack emissions testing under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (i) Time extension for subsequent performance tests. After the 
initial comprehensive performance test, you may request up to a one-year 
time extension for conducting a comprehensive or confirmatory 
performance test to consolidate performance testing with other state or 
federally required emission testing, or for other reasons deemed 
acceptable by the Administrator. If the Administrator grants a time 
extension for a comprehensive performance test, the deadlines for 
commencing the next comprehensive and confirmatory tests are based on 
the date that the subject comprehensive performance test commences.
    (1) You must submit in writing to the Administrator any request 
under this paragraph for a time extension for conducting a performance 
test.
    (2) You must include in the request for an extension for conducting 
a performance test the following:
    (i) A description of the reasons for requesting the time extension;
    (ii) The date by which you will commence performance testing.
    (3) The Administrator will notify you in writing of approval or 
intention to deny approval of your request for an extension for 
conducting a performance test within 30 calendar days after receipt of 
sufficient information to evaluate your request. The 30-day approval or 
denial period will begin after you have been notified in writing that 
your application is complete. The Administrator will notify you in 
writing whether the application contains sufficient information to make 
a determination within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original 
application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any 
supplementary information that you submit.
    (4) When notifying you that your application is not complete, the 
Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the 
application. The Administrator will also provide notice of opportunity 
for you to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after 
notification of the incomplete application, additional information or 
arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the 
application.
    (5) Before denying any request for an extension for performance 
testing, the Administrator will notify you in writing of the 
Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with:

[[Page 36]]

    (i) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended 
denial is based; and
    (ii) Notice of opportunity for you to present in writing, within 15 
calendar days after notification of the intended denial, additional 
information or arguments to the Administrator before further action on 
the request.
    (6) The Administrator's final determination to deny any request for 
an extension will be in writing and will set forth specific grounds upon 
which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 
30 calendar days after the presentation of additional information or 
argument (if the application is complete), or within 30 calendar days 
after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation 
is made.
    (j) Notification of compliance--(1) Comprehensive performance test. 
(i) Except as provided by paragraph (j)(4) of this section, within 90 
days of completion of a comprehensive performance test, you must 
postmark a Notification of Compliance documenting compliance or 
noncompliance with the emission standards and continuous monitoring 
system requirements, and identifying operating parameter limits under 
Sec. 3.1209.
    (ii) Upon postmark of the Notification of Compliance, you must 
comply with all operating requirements specified in the Notification of 
Compliance in lieu of the limits specified in the Documentation of 
Compliance required under Sec. 63.1211(d).
    (2) Confirmatory performance test. Except as provided by paragraph 
(j)(4) of this section, within 90 days of completion of a confirmatory 
performance test, you must postmark a Notification of Compliance 
documenting compliance or noncompliance with the applicable dioxin/furan 
emission standard.
    (3) See Secs. 63.7(g), 63.9(h), and 63.1210(d) for additional 
requirements pertaining to the Notification of Compliance (e.g., you 
must include results of performance tests in the Notification of 
Compliance).
    (4) Time extension. You may submit a written request to the 
Administrator for a time extension documenting that, for reasons beyond 
your control, you may not be able to meet the 90-day deadline for 
submitting the Notification of Compliance after completion of testing. 
The Administrator will determine whether a time extension is warranted.
    (k) Failure to submit a timely notification of compliance. (1) If 
you fail to postmark a Notification of Compliance by the specified date, 
you must cease hazardous waste burning immediately.
    (2) Prior to submitting a revised Notification of Compliance as 
provided by paragraph (k)(3) of this section, you may burn hazardous 
waste only for the purpose of pretesting or comprehensive performance 
testing and only for a maximum of 720 hours (renewable at the discretion 
of the Administrator).
    (3) You must submit to the Administrator a Notification of 
Compliance subsequent to a new comprehensive performance test before 
resuming hazardous waste burning.
    (l) Failure of performance test--(1) Comprehensive performance test. 
(i) If you determine (based on CEM recordings, results of analyses of 
stack samples, or results of CMS performance evaluations) that you have 
exceeded any emission standard during a comprehensive performance test 
for a mode of operation, you must cease hazardous waste burning 
immediately under that mode of operation. You must make this 
determination within 90 days following completion of the performance 
test.
    (ii) If you have failed to demonstrate compliance with the emission 
standards for any mode of operation:
    (A) Prior to submitting a revised Notification of Compliance as 
provided by paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, you may burn 
hazardous waste only for the purpose of pretesting or comprehensive 
performance testing under revised operating conditions, and only for a 
maximum of 720 hours (renewable at the discretion of the Administrator), 
except as provided by paragraph (l)(3) of this section;
    (B) You must conduct a comprehensive performance test under revised 
operating conditions following the requirements for performance testing 
of this section; and
    (C) You must submit to the Administrator a Notification of 
Compliance subsequent to the new comprehensive performance test.

[[Page 37]]

    (2) Confirmatory performance test. If you determine (based on CEM 
recordings, results of analyses of stack samples, or results of CMS 
performance evaluations) that you have failed the dioxin/furan emission 
standard during a confirmatory performance test, you must cease burning 
hazardous waste immediately. You must make this determination within 90 
days following completion of the performance test. To burn hazardous 
waste in the future:
    (i) You must submit to the Administrator for review and approval a 
test plan to conduct a comprehensive performance test to identify 
revised limits on the applicable dioxin/furan operating parameters 
specified in Sec. 63.1209(k);
    (ii) You must submit to the Administrator a Notification of 
Compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard under the provisions 
of paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section and this paragraph (l). You 
must include in the Notification of Compliance the revised limits on the 
applicable dioxin/furan operating parameters specified in 
Sec. 63.1209(k); and
    (iii) Until the Notification of Compliance is submitted, you must 
not burn hazardous waste except for purposes of pretesting or 
confirmatory performance testing, and for a maximum of 720 hours 
(renewable at the discretion of the Administrator), except as provided 
by paragraph (l)(3) of this section.
    (3) You may petition the Administrator to obtain written approval to 
burn hazardous waste in the interim prior to submitting a Notification 
of Compliance for purposes other than testing or pretesting. You must 
specify operating requirements, including limits on operating 
parameters, that you determine will ensure compliance with the emission 
standards of this subpart based on available information including data 
from the failed performance test. The Administrator will review, modify 
as necessary, and approve if warranted the interim operating 
requirements. An approval of interim operating requirements will include 
a schedule for submitting a Notification of Compliance.
    (m) Waiver of performance test. (1) The waiver provision of this 
paragraph applies in addition to the provisions of Sec. 63.7(h).
    (2) You are not required to conduct performance tests to document 
compliance with the mercury, semivolatile metal, low volatile metal or 
hydrochloric acid/chlorine gas emission standards under the conditions 
specified below. You are deemed to be in compliance with an emission 
standard if the twelve-hour rolling average maximum theoretical emission 
concentration (MTEC) determined as specified below does not exceed the 
emission standard:
    (i) Determine the feedrate of mercury, semivolatile metals, low 
volatile metals, or total chlorine and chloride from all feedstreams;
    (ii) Determine the stack gas flowrate; and
    (iii) Calculate a MTEC for each standard assuming all mercury, 
semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, or total chlorine (organic and 
inorganic) from all feedstreams is emitted;
    (3) To document compliance with this provision, you must:
    (i) Monitor and record the feedrate of mercury, semivolatile metals, 
low volatile metals, and total chlorine and chloride from all 
feedstreams according to Sec. 63.1209(c);
    (ii) Monitor with a CMS and record in the operating record the gas 
flowrate (either directly or by monitoring a surrogate parameter that 
you have correlated to gas flowrate);
    (iii) Continuously calculate and record in the operating record the 
MTEC under the procedures of paragraph (m)(2) of this section; and
    (iv) Interlock the MTEC calculated in paragraph (m)(2)(iii) of this 
section to the AWFCO system to stop hazardous waste burning when the 
MTEC exceeds the emission standard.
    (4) In lieu of the requirement in paragraphs (m)(3)(iii) and (iv) of 
this section, you may:
    (i) Identify in the notification of compliance a minimum gas 
flowrate limit and a maximum feedrate limit of mercury, semivolatile 
metals, low volatile metals, and/or total chlorine and chloride from all 
feedstreams that ensures the MTEC as calculated in paragraph (m)(2)(iii) 
of this section is

[[Page 38]]

below the applicable emission standard; and
    (ii) Interlock the minimum gas flowrate limit and maximum feedrate 
limit in paragraph (m)(3)(iv) of this section to the AWFCO system to 
stop hazardous waste burning when the gas flowrate or mercury, 
semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and/or total chlorine and 
chloride feedrate exceeds the limit in paragraph (m)(4)(i) of this 
section.
    (5) When you determine the feedrate of mercury, semivolatile metals, 
low volatile metals, or total chlorine and chloride for purposes of this 
provision, except as provided by paragraph (m)(6) of this section, you 
must assume that the analyte is present at the full detection limit when 
the feedstream analysis determines that the analyte is not detected in 
the feedstream.
    (6) Owners and operators of hazardous waste burning cement kilns and 
lightweight aggregate kilns may assume that mercury is present in raw 
material at half the detection limit when the raw material feedstream 
analysis determines that mercury is not detected.
    (7) You must state in the site-specific test plan that you submit 
for review and approval under paragraph (e) of this section that you 
intend to comply with the provisions of this paragraph. You must include 
in the test plan documentation that any surrogate that is proposed for 
gas flowrate adequately correlates with the gas flowrate.
    (n) Feedrate limits for nondetectable constituents. (1) You must 
establish separate semivolatile metal, low volatile metal, mercury, and 
total chlorine (organic and inorganic), and/or ash feedrate limits for 
each feedstream for which the comprehensive performance test feedstream 
analysis determines that these constituents are not present at 
detectable levels.
    (2) You must define the feedrate limits established under paragraph 
(n)(1) of this section as nondetect at the full detection limit achieved 
during the performance test.
    (3) You will not be deemed to be in violation of the feedrate limit 
established in paragraph (n)(2) of this section when detectable levels 
of the constituent are measured, whether at levels above or below the 
full detection limit achieved during the performance test, provided 
that:
    (i) Your total feedrate for that constituent, including the 
detectable levels in the feedstream which is limited to nondetect 
levels, is below your feedrate limit for that constituent; or
    (ii) Except for ash, your maximum theoretical emission concentration 
(MTEC) for the constituent (i.e., semivolatile metal, low volatile 
metal, mercury, and/or hydrochloric acid/chlorine gas) calculated 
according to paragraph (m) of this section, and considering the 
contribution from all feedstreams including the detectable levels in the 
feedstream which is limited to nondetect levels, is below the emission 
standard in Secs. 63.1203, 63.1204, and 63.1205.

    (B) Compliance is based on six-minute block average.
    (iii) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a 
particulate matter CEMS to demonstrate and monitor compliance with the 
particulate matter standards under this subpart. However, compliance 
with the requirements in their section to install, calibrate, maintain 
and operate the PM CEMS is not required until such time

[[Page 40]]

that the Agency promulgates all performance specifications and 
operational requirements applicable to PM CEMS.
    (iv) If you operate a cement kiln subject to the provisions of this 
subpart and use a fabric filter with multiple stacks or an electrostatic 
precipitator with multiple stacks, you may, in lieu of installing the 
COMS required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, comply with the 
opacity standard in accordance with the procedures of Method 9 to part 
60 of this chapter:
    (A) You must conduct the Method 9 test while the affected source is 
operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected to 
occur within the day;
    (B) The duration of the Method 9 test shall be at least 30 minutes 
each day;
    (C) You must use the Method 9 procedures to monitor and record the 
average opacity for each six-minute block period during the test; and
    (D) To remain in compliance, all six-minute block averages must not 
exceed the opacity standard under Secs. 63.1204(a)(7) and (b)(7).
    (v) If you operate a cement kiln subject to the provisions of this 
subpart and use a particulate matter control device that exhausts 
through a monovent, or if the use of a COMS in accordance with the 
installation specification of Performance Specification 1 (PS-1) of 
appendix B to part 60 of this chapter is not feasible, you may, in lieu 
of installing the COMS required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, 
comply with the opacity standard in accordance with the procedures of 
Method 9 to part 60 of this chapter:
    (A) You must conduct the Method 9 test while the affected source is 
operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected to 
occur within the day;
    (B) The duration of the Method 9 test shall be at least 30 minutes 
each day;
    (C) You must use the Method 9 procedures to monitor and record the 
average opacity for each six-minute block period during the test; and
    (D) To remain in compliance, all six-minute block averages must not 
exceed the opacity standard under Secs. 63.1204(a)(7) and (b)(7).
    (2) Performance specifications. You must install, calibrate,

the quality assurance procedures provided in the appendix to this 
subpart and Performance Specifications 1 (opacity), 4B (carbon monoxide 
and oxygen), and 8A (hydrocarbons) in appendix B, part 60 of this 
chapter.
    (3) Carbon monoxide readings exceeding the span. (i) Except as 
provided by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if a carbon monoxide 
CEMS detects a response that results in a one-minute average at or above 
the 3,000 ppmv span level required by Performance Specification 4B in 
appendix B, part 60 of this chapter, the one-minute average must be 
recorded as 10,000 ppmv. The one-minute 10,000 ppmv value must be used 
for calculating the hourly rolling average carbon monoxide level.
    (ii) Carbon monoxide CEMS that use a span value of 10,000 ppmv when 
one-minute carbon monoxide levels are equal to or exceed 3,000 ppmv are 
not subject to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. Carbon monoxide CEMS 
that use a span value of 10,000 are subject to the same CEMS performance 
and equipment specifications when operating in the range of 3,000 ppmv 
to 10,000 ppmv that are provided by Performance Specification 4B for 
other carbon monoxide CEMS, except:
    (A) Calibration drift must be less than 300 ppmv; and
    (B) Calibration error must be less than 500 ppmv.
    (4) Hydrocarbon readings exceeding the span. (i) Except as provided

response that results in a one-minute average at or above the 100 ppmv 
span level required by Performance Specification 8A in appendix B, part 
60 of this chapter, the one-minute average must be recorded as 500 ppmv. 
The one-minute 500 ppmv value must be used for calculating the hourly 
rolling average HC level.
    (ii) Hydrocarbon CEMS that use a span value of 500 ppmv when one-
minute hydrocarbon levels are equal to or exceed 100 ppmv are not 
subject to paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. Hydrocarbon CEMS that 
use a span value

[[Page 41]]

of 500 ppmv are subject to the same CEMS performance and equipment 
specifications when operating in the range of 100 ppmv to 500 ppmv that 
are provided by Performance Specification 8A for other hydrocarbon CEMS, 
except:
    (A) The zero and high-level calibration gas must have a hydrocarbon 
level of between 0 and 100 ppmv, and between 250 and 450 ppmv, 
respectively;
    (B) The strip chart recorder, computer, or digital recorder must be 
capable of recording all readings within the CEM measurement range and 
must have a resolution of 2.5 ppmv;
    (C) The CEMS calibration must not differ by more than <plus-minus>15 
ppmv after each 24-hour period of the seven day test at both zero and 
high levels;
    (D) The calibration error must be no greater than 25 ppmv; and
    (E) The zero level, mid-level, and high level calibration gas used 
to determine calibration error must have a hydrocarbon level of 0-200 
ppmv, 150-200 ppmv, and 350-400 ppmv, respectively.
    (5) Petitions to use CEMS for other standards. You may petition the 
Administrator to use CEMS for compliance monitoring for particulate 
matter, mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and 
hydrochloric acid/chlorine gas under Sec. 63.8(f) in lieu of compliance 
with the corresponding operating parameter limits under this section.
    (6) Calculation of rolling averages--(i) Calculation of rolling 
averages initially. The carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon CEMS must begin 
recording one-minute average values by 12:01 am and hourly rolling 
average values by 1:01 am, when 60 one-minute values will be available 
for calculating the initial hourly rolling average.
    (ii) Calculation of rolling averages upon intermittent operations. 
You must ignore periods of time when one-minute values are not available 
for calculating the hourly rolling average. When one-minute values 
become available again, the first one-minute value is added to the 
previous 59 values to calculate the hourly rolling average.
    (iii) Calculation of rolling averages when the hazardous waste feed 
is cutoff. (A) Except as provided by paragraph (a)(6)(iii)(B) of this 
section, you must continue to monitoring carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon 
when the hazardous waste feed is cutoff if the source is operating. You 
must not resume feeding hazardous waste if the emission levels exceed 
the standard.
    (B) You are not subject to the CEMS requirements of this subpart 
during periods of time you meet the requirements of 
Sec. 63.1206(b)(1)(ii) (compliance with emissions standards for 
nonhazardous waste burning sources when you are not burning hazardous 
waste).
    (7) Operating parameter limits for hydrocarbons. If you elect to 
comply with the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission standards by 
continuously monitoring carbon monoxide with a CEMS, you must 
demonstrate that hydrocarbon emissions during the comprehensive 
performance test do not exceed the hydrocarbon emissions standard. In 
addition, the limits you establish on the destruction and removal 
efficiency (DRE) operating parameters required under paragraph (j) of 
this section also ensure that you maintain compliance with the 
hydrocarbon emission standard. If you do not conduct the hydrocarbon 
demonstration and DRE tests concurrently, you must establish separate 
operating parameter limits under paragraph (j) of this section based on 
each test and the more restrictive of the operating parameter limits 
applies.
    (b) Other continuous monitoring systems (CMS). (1) You must use CMS 
(e.g., thermocouples, pressure transducers, flow meters) to document 
compliance with the applicable operating parameter limits under this 
section.
    (2) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (ii) of this 
section, you must install and operate non-CMS in conformance with 
Sec. 63.8(c)(3) that requires you, at a minimum, to comply with the 
manufacturer's written specifications or recommendations for 
installation, operation, and calibration of the system:
    (i) Calibration of thermocouples. The calibration of a thermocouple 
or other temperature sensor must be verified at least once every three 
months; and
    (ii) Accuracy and calibration of weight measurement devices. The 
accuracy of weight measurement devices used to

[[Page 42]]

monitor flowrate of a feedstream (e.g., activated carbon feedrate, 
sorbent feedrate, nonpumpable waste) must be <plus-minus> 1 percent of 
the weight being measured. The calibration of the device must be 
verified at least once every three months.
    (3) CMS must sample the regulated parameter without interruption, 
and evaluate the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and 
compute and record the average values at least every 60 seconds.
    (4) The span of the non-CEMS CMS detector must not be exceeded. You 
must interlock the span limits into the automatic waste feed cutoff 
system required by Sec. 63.1206(c)(3).
    (5) Calculation of rolling averages--(i) Calculation of rolling 
averages initially. Continuous monitoring systems must begin recording 
one-minute average values at 12:01 am on the compliance data and begin 
recording rolling averages when enough one-minute average values are 
available to calculate the required rolling average (e.g., when 60 one-
minute averages are available to calculate an hourly rolling average; 
when 720 one-minute averages are available to calculate a 12-hour 
rolling average).
    (ii) Calculation of rolling averages upon intermittent operations. 
You must ignore periods of time when one-minute values are not available 
for calculating rolling averages. When one-minute values become 
available again, the first one-minute value is added to the previous 
one-minute values to calculate rolling averages.
    (iii) Calculation of rolling averages when the hazardous waste feed 
is cutoff. (A) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this 
section, you must continue to monitoring operating parameter limits with 
a CMS when the hazardous waste feed is cutoff if the source is 
operating. You must not resume feeding hazardous waste if an operating 
parameter exceeds its limit.
    (B) You are not subject to the CMS requirements of this subpart 
during periods of time you meet the requirements of 
Sec. 63.1206(b)(1)(ii) (compliance with emissions standards for 
nonhazardous waste burning sources when you are not burning hazardous 
waste).
    (c) Analysis of feedstreams--(1) General. Prior to feeding the 
material, you must obtain an analysis of each feedstream that is 
sufficient to document compliance with the applicable feedrate limits 
provided by this section.
    (2) Feedstream analysis plan. You must develop and implement a 
feedstream analysis plan and record it in the operating record. The plan 
must specify at a minimum:
    (i) The parameters for which you will analyze each feedstream to 
ensure compliance with the operating parameter limits of this section;
    (ii) Whether you will obtain the analysis by performing sampling and 
analysis or by other methods, such as using analytical information 
obtained from others or using other published or documented data or 
information;
    (iii) How you will use the analysis to document compliance with 
applicable feedrate limits (e.g., if you blend hazardous wastes and 
obtain analyses of the wastes prior to blending but not of the blended, 
as-fired, waste, the plan must describe how you will determine the 
pertinent parameters of the blended waste);
    (iv) The test methods which you will use to obtain the analyses;
    (v) The sampling method which you will use to obtain a 
representative sample of each feedstream to be analyzed using sampling 
methods described in appendix I, part 26, of this chapter, or an 
equivalent method; and
    (vi) The frequency with which you will review or repeat the initial 
analysis of the feedstream to ensure that the analysis is accurate and 
up to date.
    (3) Review and approval of analysis plan. You must submit the 
feedstream analysis plan to the Administrator for review and approval, 
if requested.
    (4) Compliance with feedrate limits. To comply with the applicable 
feedrate limits of this section, you must monitor and record feedrates 
as follows:
    (i) Determine and record the value of the parameter for each 
feedstream by sampling and analysis or other method;
    (ii) Determine and record the mass or volume flowrate of each 
feedstream by a CMS. If you determine flowrate of a feedstream by 
volume, you must determine and record the density of the

[[Page 43]]

feedstream by sampling and analysis (unless you report the constituent 
concentration in units of weight per unit volume (e.g., mg/l)); and
    (iii) Calculate and record the mass feedrate of the parameter per 
unit time.
    (5) Waiver of monitoring of constituents in certain feedstreams. You 
are not required to monitor levels of metals or chlorine in the 
following feedstreams to document compliance with the feedrate limits 
under this section provided that you document in the comprehensive 
performance test plan the expected levels of the constituent in the 
feedstream and account for those assumed feedrate levels in documenting 
compliance with feedrate limits: natural gas, process air, and 
feedstreams from vapor recovery systems.
    (d) Performance evaluations. (1) The requirements of Secs. 63.8(d) 
(Quality control program) and (e) (Performance evaluation of continuous 
monitoring systems) apply, except that you must conduct performance 
evaluations of components of the CMS under the frequency and procedures 
(for example, submittal of performance evaluation test plan for review 
and approval) applicable to performance tests as provided by 
Sec. 63.1207.
    (2) You must comply with the quality assurance procedures for CEMS 
prescribed in the appendix to this subpart.
    (e) Conduct of monitoring. The provisions of Sec. 63.8(b) apply.
    (f) Operation and maintenance of continuous monitoring systems. The 
provisions of Sec. 63.8(c) apply except:
    (1) Section 63.8(c)(3). The requirements of Sec. 63.1211(d), that 
requires CMSs to be installed, calibrated, and operational on the 
compliance date, shall be complied with instead of section 63.8(c)(3);
    (2) Section 63.8(c)(4)(ii). The performance specifications for 
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and oxygen CEMSs in subpart B, part 60 of 
this chapter that requires detectors to measure the sample concentration 
at least once every 15 seconds for calculating an average emission rate 
once every 60 seconds shall be complied with instead of section 
63.8(c)(4)(ii); and
    (3) Sections 63.8(c)(4)(i), (c)(5), and (c)(7)(i)(C) pertaining to 
COMS apply only to owners and operators of hazardous waste burning 
cement kilns..
    (g) Alternative monitoring requirements other than continuous 
emissions monitoring systems (CEMS)--(1) Requests to use alternative 
methods. (i) You may submit an application to the Administrator under 
this paragraph for approval of alternative monitoring requirements to 
document compliance with the emission standards of this subpart. For 
requests to use additional CEMS, however, you must use paragraph (a)(5) 
of this section and Sec. 63.8(f).
    (A) The Administrator will not approve averaging periods for 
operating parameter limits longer than specified in this section unless 
you document using data or information that the longer averaging period 
will ensure that emissions do not exceed levels achieved during the 
comprehensive performance test over any increment of time equivalent to 
the time required to conduct three runs of the performance test.
    (B) If the Administrator approves the application to use an 
alternative monitoring requirement, you must continue to use that 
alternative monitoring requirement until you receive approval under this 
paragraph to use another monitoring requirement.
    (ii) You may submit an application to waive an operating parameter 
limit specified in this section based on documentation that neither that 
operating parameter limit nor an alternative operating parameter limit 
is needed to ensure compliance with the emission standards of this 
subpart.
    (iii) You must comply with the following procedures for applications 
submitted under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:
    (A) Timing of the application. You must submit the application to 
the Administrator not later than with the comprehensive performance test 
plan.
    (B) Content of the application. You must include in the application:
    (1) Data or information justifying your request for an alternative 
monitoring requirement (or for a waiver of an operating parameter 
limit), such as the technical or economic infeasibility or the 
impracticality of using the required approach;

[[Page 44]]

    (2) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring 
requirement, including the operating parameter to be monitored, the 
monitoring approach/technique (e.g., type of detector, monitoring 
location), the averaging period for the limit, and how the limit is to 
be calculated; and
    (3) Data or information documenting that the alternative monitoring 
requirement would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance 
with the relevant emission standard, or that it is the monitoring 
requirement that best assures compliance with the standard and that is 
technically and economically practicable.
    (C) Approval of request to use an alternative monitoring requirement 
or waive an operating parameter limit. The Administrator will notify you 
of approval or intention to deny approval of the request within 90 
calendar days after receipt of the original request and within 60 
calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that you 
submit. The Administrator will not approve an alternative monitoring 
request unless the alternative monitoring requirement provides 
equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission 
standard, or is the monitoring requirement that best assures compliance 
with the standard and that is technically and economically practicable. 
Before disapproving any request, the Administrator will notify you of 
the Administrator's intention to disapprove the request together with:
    (1) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended 
disapproval is based; and
    (2) Notice of opportunity for you to present additional information 
to the Administrator before final action on the request. At the time the 
Administrator notifies you of intention to disapprove the request, the 
Administrator will specify how much time you will have after being 
notified of the intended disapproval to submit the additional 
information.
    (D) Responsibility of owners and operators. You are responsible for 
ensuring that you submit any supplementary and additional information 
supporting your application in a timely manner to enable the 
Administrator to consider your application during review of the 
comprehensive performance test plan. Neither your submittal of an 
application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove 
the application, relieves you of the responsibility to comply with the 
provisions of this subpart.
    (2) Administrator's discretion to specify additional or alternative 
requirements. The Administrator may determine on a case-by-case basis at 
any time (e.g., during review of the comprehensive performance test 
plan, during compliance certification review) that you may need to limit 
additional or alternative operating parameters (e.g., opacity in 
addition to or in lieu of operating parameter limits on the particulate 
matter control device) or that alternative approaches to establish 
limits on operating parameters may be necessary to document compliance 
with the emission standards of this subpart.
    (h) Reduction of monitoring data. The provisions of Sec. 63.8(g) 
apply.
    (i) When an operating parameter is applicable to multiple standards. 
Paragraphs (j) through (p) of this section require you to establish 
limits on operating parameters based on comprehensive performance 
testing to ensure you maintain compliance with the emission standards of 
this subpart. For several parameters, you must establish a limit for the 
parameter to ensure compliance with more than one emission standard. An 
example is a limit on minimum combustion chamber temperature to ensure 
compliance with both the DRE standard of paragraph (j) of this section 
and the dioxin/furan standard of paragraph (k) of this section. If the 
performance tests for such standards are not performed simultaneously, 
the most stringent limit for a parameter derived from independent 
performance tests applies.
    (j) DRE. To remain in compliance with the destruction and removal 
efficiency (DRE) standard, you must establish operating limits during 
the comprehensive performance test (or during a previous DRE test under 
provisions of Sec. 63.1206(b)(7)) for the following parameters, unless 
the limits are based on manufacturer specifications, and comply with 
those limits at

[[Page 45]]

all times that hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., 
the hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the 
hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated):
    (1) Minimum combustion chamber temperature. (i) You must measure the 
temperature of each combustion chamber at a location that best 
represents, as practicable, the bulk gas temperature in the combustion 
zone. You must document the temperature measurement location in the test 
plan you submit under Sec. 63.1207(e);
    (ii) You must establish a minimum hourly rolling average limit as 
the average of the test run averages;
    (2) Maximum flue gas flowrate or production rate. (i) As an 
indicator of gas residence time in the control device, you must 
establish and comply with a limit on the maximum flue gas flowrate, the 
maximum production rate, or another parameter that you document in the 
site-specific test plan as an appropriate surrogate for gas residence 
time, as the average of the maximum hourly rolling averages for each 
run.
    (ii) You must comply with this limit on a hourly rolling average 
basis;
    (3) Maximum hazardous waste feedrate. (i) You must establish limits 
on the maximum pumpable and total (i.e., pumpable and nonpumpable) 
hazardous waste feedrate for each location where hazardous waste is fed.
    (ii) You must establish the limits as the average of the maximum 
hourly rolling averages for each run.
    (iii) You must comply with the feedrate limit(s) on a hourly rolling 
average basis;
    (4) Operation of waste firing system. You must specify operating 
parameters and limits to ensure that good operation of each hazardous 
waste firing system is maintained.
    (k) Dioxins and furans. You must comply with the dioxin and furans 
emission standard by establishing and complying with the following 
operating parameter limits. You must base the limits on operations 
during the comprehensive performance test, unless the limits are based 
on manufacturer specifications.
    (1) Gas temperature at the inlet to a dry particulate matter control 
device. (i) For hazardous waste burning incinerators and cement kilns, 
if the combustor is equipped with an electrostatic precipitator, 
baghouse (fabric filter), or other dry emissions control device where 
particulate matter is suspended in contact with combustion gas, you must 
establish a limit on the maximum temperature of the gas at the inlet to 
the device on an hourly rolling average. You must establish the hourly 
rolling average limit as the average of the test run averages.
    (ii) For hazardous waste burning lightweight aggregate kilns, you 
must establish a limit on the maximum temperature of the gas at the exit 
of the (last) combustion chamber (or exit of any waste heat recovery 
system) on an hourly rolling average. The limit must be established as 
the average of the test run averages;
    (2) Minimum combustion chamber temperature. (i) You must measure the 
temperature of each combustion chamber at a location that best 
represents, as practicable, the bulk gas temperature in the combustion 
zone. You must document the temperature measurement location in the test 
plan you submit under Secs. 63.1207(e) and (f);
    (ii) You must establish a minimum hourly rolling average limit as 
the average of the test run averages.
    (3) Maximum flue gas flowrate or production rate. (i) As an 
indicator of gas residence time in the control device, you must 
establish and comply with a limit on the maximum flue gas flowrate, the 
maximum production rate, or another parameter that you document in the 
site-specific test plan as an appropriate surrogate for gas residence 
time, as the average of the maximum hourly rolling averages for each 
run.
    (ii) You must comply with this limit on a hourly rolling average 
basis;
    (4) Maximum waste feedrate. (i) You must establish limits on the 
maximum pumpable and total (pumpable and nonpumpable) waste feedrate for 
each location where waste is fed.
    (ii) You must establish the limits as the average of the maximum 
hourly rolling averages for each run.
    (iii) You must comply with the feedrate limit(s) on a hourly rolling 
average basis;

[[Page 46]]

    (5) Particulate matter operating limit. If your combustor is 
equipped with an activated carbon injection or a carbon bed system, you 
must limit particulate matter emissions to the level achieved during the 
comprehensive performance test as prescribed by paragraph (m) of this 
section;
    (6) Activated carbon injection parameter limits. If your combustor 
is equipped with an activated carbon injection system:
    (i) Carbon feedrate. You must establish a limit on minimum carbon 
injection rate on an hourly rolling average calculated as the average of 
the test run averages. If your carbon injection system injects carbon at 
more than one location, you must establish a carbon feedrate limit for 
each location.
    (ii) Carrier fluid. You must establish a limit on minimum carrier 
fluid (gas or liquid) flowrate or pressure drop as an hourly rolling 
average based on the manufacturer's specifications. You must document 
the specifications in the test plan you submit under Secs. 63.1207(e) 
and (f);
    (iii) Carbon specification. (A) You must specify and use the brand 
(i.e., manufacturer) and type of carbon used during the comprehensive 
performance test until a subsequent comprehensive performance test is 
conducted, unless you document in the site-specific performance test 
plan required under Secs. 63.1207(e) and (f) key parameters that affect 
adsorption and establish limits on those parameters based on the carbon 
used in the performance test.
    (B) You may substitute at any time a different brand or type of 
carbon provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved 
properties compared to the carbon used in the performance test and 
conforms to the key sorbent parameters you identify under paragraph 
(k)(6)(iii)(A) of this section. You must include in the operating record 
documentation that the substitute carbon will provide the same level of 
control as the original carbon.
    (7) Carbon bed parameter limits. If your combustor is equipped with 
a carbon bed system:
    (i) Maximum bed age. (A) Except as provided by paragraph 
(k)(7)(i)(C) of this section, the maximum age of the carbon in each 
segment of the bed before you must replace the carbon is the age of the 
bed during the comprehensive performance test.
    (B) You must measure carbon age in terms of the cumulative volume of 
combustion gas flow through carbon since its addition. For beds with 
multiple segments, you must establish the maximum age for each segment.
    (C) For the initial comprehensive performance test, you may base the 
initial limit on maximum age of the carbon in each segment of the bed on 
manufacturer's specifications. If you use manufacturer's specifications 
rather than actual bed age to establish the initial limit, you must also 
recommend in the initial comprehensive performance test plan a schedule 
for subsequent dioxin/furan emissions testing, prior to the confirmatory 
performance test, that you will use to document to the Administrator 
that the initial limit on maximum bed age ensures compliance with the 
dioxin/furan emission standard. If you fail to confirm compliance with 
the emission standard during this testing, you must conduct additional 
testing as necessary to document that a revised lower limit on maximum 
bed age ensures compliance with the standard.
    (ii) Carbon specification. (A) You must specify and use the brand 
(i.e., manufacturer) and type of carbon used during the comprehensive 
performance test until a subsequent comprehensive performance test is 
conducted, unless you document in the site-specific performance test 
plan required under Secs. 63.1207(e) and (f) key parameters that affect 
adsorption and establish limits on those parameters based on the carbon 
used in the performance test.
    (B) You may substitute at any time a different brand or type of 
carbon provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved 
properties compared to the carbon used in the performance test. You must 
include in the operating record documentation that the substitute carbon 
will provide an equivalent or improved level of control as the original 
carbon.
    (iii) Maximum temperature. You must measure the temperature of the 
carbon bed at either the bed inlet or exit and

[[Page 47]]

you must establish a maximum temperature limit on an hourly rolling 
average as the average of the test run averages.
    (8) Catalytic oxidizer parameter limits. If your combustor is 
equipped with a catalytic oxidizer, you must establish limits on the 
following parameters:
    (i) Minimum flue gas temperature at the entrance of the catalyst. 
You must establish a limit on minimum flue gas temperature at the 
entrance of the catalyst on an hourly rolling average as the average of 
the test run averages.
    (ii) mum time in-use. You must replace a catalytic oxidizer with a 
new catalytic oxidizer when it has reached the maximum service time 
specified by the manufacturer.
    (iii) Catalyst replacement specifications. When you replace a 
catalyst with a new one, the new catalyst must be equivalent to or 
better than the one used during the previous comprehensive test, as 
measured by:
    (A) Catalytic metal loading for each metal;
    (B) Space time, expressed in the units s<SUP>-1</SUP>, the maximum 
rated volumetric flow of combustion gas through the catalyst divided by 
the volume of the catalyst; and
    (C) Substrate construction, including materials of construction, 
washcoat type, and pore density.
    (iv) Maximum flue gas temperature. You must establish a maximum flue 
gas temperature limit at the entrance of the catalyst as an hourly 
rolling average, based on manufacturer's specifications.
    (9) Inhibitor feedrate parameter limits. If you feed a dioxin/furan 
inhibitor into the combustion system, you must establish limits for the 
following parameters:
    (i) Minimum inhibitor feedrate. You must establish a limit on 
minimum inhibitor feedrate on an hourly rolling average as the average 
of the test run averages.
    (ii) Inhibitor specifications. (A) You must specify and use the 
brand (i.e., manufacturer) and type of inhibitor used during the 
comprehensive performance test until a subsequent comprehensive 
performance test is conducted, unless you document in the site-specific 
performance test plan required under Secs. 63.1207(e) and (f) key 
parameters that affect the effectiveness of the inhibitor and establish 
limits on those parameters based on the inhibitor used in the 
performance test.
    (B) You may substitute at any time a different brand or type of 
inhibitor provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved 
properties compared to the inhibitor used in the performance test and 
conforms to the key parameters you identify under paragraph 
(k)(9)(ii)(A) of this section. You must include in the operating record 
documentation that the substitute inhibitor will provide the same level 
of control as the original inhibitor.
    (l) Mercury. You must comply with the mercury emission standard by 
establishing and complying with the following operating parameter 
limits. You must base the limits on operations during the comprehensive 
performance test, unless the limits are based on manufacturer 
specifications.
    (1) Feedrate of total mercury. You must establish a 12-hour rolling 
average limit for the total feedrate of mercury in all feedstreams as 
the average of the hourly rolling averages for each run, unless mercury 
feedrate limits are extrapolated from performance test feedrate levels 
under the following provisions.
    (i) You may request as part of the performance test plan under 
Secs. 63.7(b) and (c) and Secs. 63.1207(e) and (f) to use the mercury 
feedrates and associated emission rates during the comprehensive 
performance test to extrapolate to higher allowable feedrate limits and 
emission rates.
    (ii) The extrapolation methodology will be reviewed and approved, as 
warranted, by the Administrator. The review will consider in particular 
whether:
    (A) Performance test metal feedrates are appropriate (i.e., whether 
feedrates are at least at normal levels; depending on the heterogeneity 
of the waste, whether some level of spiking would be appropriate; and 
whether the physical form and species of spiked material is 
appropriate); and
    (B) Whether the extrapolated feedrates you request are warranted 
considering historical metal feedrate data.

[[Page 48]]

    (iii) The Administrator will review the performance test results in 
making a finding of compliance required by Secs. 63.6(f)(3) and 
63.1206(b)(3) to ensure that you have interpreted emission test results 
properly and that the extrapolation procedure is appropriate for your 
source.
    (2) Wet scrubber. If your combustor is equipped with a wet scrubber, 
you must establish operating parameter limits prescribed by paragraph 
(o)(3) of this section.
    (3) Activated carbon injection. If your combustor is equipped with 
an activated carbon injection system, you must establish operating 
parameter limits prescribed by paragraph (k)(7) of this section.
    (4) Activated carbon bed. If your combustor is equipped with a 
carbon bed system, you must establish operating parameter limits 
prescribed by paragraph (k)(8) of this section.
    (m) Particulate matter. You must comply with the particulate matter 
emission standard by establishing and complying with the following 
operating parameter limits. You must base the limits on operations 
during the comprehensive performance test, unless the limits are based 
on manufacturer specifications.
    (1) Control device operating parameter limits (OPLs). (i) Wet 
scrubbers. For sources equipped with wet scrubbers, including ionizing 
wet scrubbers, high energy wet scrubbers such as venturi, hydrosonic, 
collision, or free jet wet scrubbers, and low energy wet scrubbers such 
as spray towers, packed beds, or tray towers, you must establish limits 
on the following parameters:
    (A) For high energy scrubbers only, minimum pressure drop across the 
wet scrubber on an hourly rolling average, established as the average of 
the test run averages;
    (B) For all wet scrubbers:
    (1) To ensure that the solids content of the scrubber liquid does 
not exceed levels during the performance test, you must either:
    (i) Establish a limit on solids content of the scrubber liquid using 
a CMS or by manual sampling and analysis. If you elect to monitor solids 
content manually, you must sample and analyze the scrubber liquid hourly 
unless you support an alternative monitoring frequency in the 
performance test plan that you submit for review and approval; or
    (ii) Establish a minimum blowdown rate using a CMS and either a 
minimum scrubber tank volume or liquid level using a CMS.
    (2) For maximum solids content monitored with a CMS, you must 
establish a limit on a twelve-hour rolling average as the average of the 
test run averages.
    (3) For maximum solids content measured manually, you must establish 
an hourly limit, as measured at least once per hour, unless you support 
an alternative monitoring frequency in the performance test plan that 
you submit for review and approval. You must establish the maximum 
hourly limit as the average of the manual measurement averages for each

    (C) For high energy wet scrubbers only, you must establish limits on 
either the minimum liquid to gas ratio or the minimum scrubber water 
flowrate and maximum flue gas flowrate on an hourly rolling average. If 
you establish limits on maximum flue gas flowrate under this paragraph, 
you need not establish a limit on maximum flue gas flowrate under 
paragraph (m)(2) of this section. You must establish these hourly 
rolling average limits as the average of the test run averages; and
    (D) You must establish limits on minimum power input for ionizing 
wet scrubbers on an hourly rolling average as the average of the test

[[Page 49]]

input (kVa) for each field on an hourly rolling average as the average 
of the test run averages. Secondary power is power actually fed to the 
electrostatic precipitator rather than primary power fed to the 
transformer-rectifier sets.
    (iv) Other particulate matter control devices. For each control 
device that is not a high energy or ionizing wet scrubber, baghouse, or 
electrostatic precipitator but is operated to comply with the 
particulate matter emission standards of this subpart, you must ensure 
that the control device is properly operated and maintained as required 
by Sec. 63.1206(c)(7) and by monitoring the operation of the control 
device as follows:
    (A) During each comprehensive performance test conducted to 
demonstrate compliance with the particulate matter emissions standard, 
you must establish a range of operating values for the control device 
that is a representative and reliable indicator that the control device 
is operating within the same range of conditions as during the 
performance test. You must establish this range of operating values as 
follows:
    (1) You must select a set of operating parameters appropriate for 
the control device design that you determine to be a representative and 
reliable indicator of the control device performance.
    (2) You must measure and record values for each of the selected 
operating parameters during each test run of the performance test. A 
value for each selected parameter must be recorded using a continuous 
monitor.
    (3) For each selected operating parameter measured in accordance 
with the requirements of paragraph (m)(1)(iv)(A)(1) of this section, you 
must establish a minimum operating parameter limit or a maximum 
operating parameter limit, as appropriate for the parameter, to define 
the operating limits within which the control device can operate and 
still continuously achieve the same operating conditions as during the 
performance test.
    (4) You must prepare written documentation to support the operating 
parameter limits established for the control device and you must include 
this documentation in the performance test plan that you submit for 
review and approval. This documentation must include a description for 
each selected parameter and the operating range and monitoring frequency 
required to ensure the control device is being properly operated and 
maintained.
    (B) You must install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a monitoring 
device equipped with a recorder to measure the values for each operating 
parameter selected in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 
(m)(1)(iv)(A)(1) of this section. You must install, calibrate, and 
maintain the monitoring equipment in accordance with the equipment 
manufacturer's specifications. The recorder must record the detector 
responses at least every 60 seconds, as required in the definition of 
continuous monitor.
    (C) You must regularly inspect the data recorded by the operating 
parameter monitoring system at a sufficient frequency to ensure the 
control device is operating properly. An excursion is determined to have 
occurred any time that the actual value of a selected operating 
parameter is less than the minimum operating limit (or, if applicable, 
greater than the maximum operating limit) established for the parameter 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (m)(1)(iv)(A)(3) of 
this section.
    (D) Operating parameters selected in accordance with paragraph 
(m)(1)(iv) of this section may be based on manufacturer specifications 
provided you support the use of manufacturer specifications in the 
performance test plan that you submit for review and approval.
    (2) Maximum flue gas flowrate or production rate. (i) As an 
indicator of gas residence time in the control device, you must 
establish a limit on the maximum flue gas flowrate, the maximum 
production rate, or another parameter that you document in the site-
specific test plan as an appropriate surrogate for gas residence time, 
as the average of the maximum hourly rolling averages for each run.
    (ii) You must comply with this limit on a hourly rolling average 
basis;
    (3) Maximum ash feedrate. Owners and operators of hazardous waste 
incinerators must establish a maximum ash feedrate limit as the average 
of the highest hourly rolling averages for each run.

    (n) Semivolatile metals and low volatility metals. You must comply 
with the semivolatile metal (cadmium and lead) and low volatile metal 
(arsenic, beryllium, and chromium) emission standards by establishing 
and complying with the following operating parameter limits. You must 
base the limits on operations during the comprehensive performance test, 
unless the limits are based on manufacturer specifications.
    (1) Maximum inlet temperature to dry particulate matter air 
pollution control device. You must establish a limit on the maximum 
inlet temperature to the primary dry metals emissions control device 
(e.g., electrostatic precipitator, baghouse) on an hourly rolling 
average basis as the average of the test run averages.
    (2) Maximum feedrate of semivolatile and low volatile metals. (i) 
General. You must establish feedrate limits for semivolatile metals 
(cadmium and lead) and low volatile metals (arsenic, beryllium, and

    (C) You must establish a 12-hour rolling average limit for the 
feedrate of arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, combined, in all pumpable 
feedstreams as the average of the average hourly rolling averages for 
each run. Dual feedrate limits for both pumpable and total feedstreams 
are not required, however, if you base the total feedrate limit solely 
on the feedrate of pumpable feedstreams.
    (ii) Feedrate extrapolation. (A) You may request as part of the 
performance test plan under Secs. 63.7(b) and (c) and Secs. 63.1207(e) 
and (f) to use the semivolatile metal and low volatile metal feedrates 
and associated emission rates during the comprehensive performance test 
to extrapolate to higher allowable feedrate limits and emission rates.
    (B) The extrapolation methodology will be reviewed and approved, as 
warranted, by the Administrator. The review will consider in particular 
whether:
    (1) Performance test metal feedrates are appropriate (i.e., whether 
feedrates are at least at normal levels; depending on the heterogeneity 
of the waste, whether some level of spiking would be appropriate; and 
whether the physical form and species of spiked material is 
appropriate); and
    (2) Whether the extrapolated feedrates you request are warranted 
considering historical metal feedrate data.
    (C) The Administrator will review the performance test results in 
making a finding of compliance required by Secs. 63.6(f)(3) and 
63.1206(b)(3) to ensure that you have interpreted emission test results 
properly and that the extrapolation procedure is appropriate for your 
source.
    (3) Control device operating parameter limits (OPLs). You must 
establish operating parameter limits on the particulate matter control 
device as specified by paragraph (m)(1) of this section;
    (4) Maximum total chlorine and chloride feedrate. You must establish 
a 12-hour rolling average limit for the feedrate of total chlorine and 
chloride in all feedstreams as the average of the average hourly rolling 
averages for each run.
    (5) Maximum flue gas flowrate or production rate. (i) As an 
indicator of gas residence time in the control device, you must 
establish a limit on the maximum flue gas flowrate, the maximum 
production rate, or another parameter that you document in the site-
specific test plan as an appropriate surrogate for gas residence time, 
as the average of the maximum hourly rolling averages for each run.
    (ii) You must comply with this limit on a hourly rolling average 
basis.
    (o) Hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas. You must comply with the 
hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emission

parameter limits. You must base the limits on operations during the 
comprehensive performance test, unless the limits are based on 
manufacturer specifications.
    (1) Feedrate of total chlorine and chloride. You must establish a 
12-hour rolling average limit for the total feedrate of chlorine 
(organic and inorganic) in all feedstreams as the average of the average 
hourly rolling averages for each run.
    (2) Maximum flue gas flowrate or production rate. (i) As an 
indicator of gas residence time in the control device, you must 
establish a limit on the maximum flue gas flowrate, the maximum 
production rate, or another parameter that you document in the site-
specific test plan as an appropriate surrogate for gas residence time, 
as the average of the maximum hourly rolling averages for each run.
    (ii) You must comply with this limit on a hourly rolling average 
basis;
    (3) Wet scrubber. If your combustor is equipped with a wet scrubber:
    (i) If your source is equipped with a high energy wet scrubber such 
as a venturi, hydrosonic, collision, or free jet wet scrubber, you must 
establish a limit on minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber on an 
hourly rolling average as the average of the test run averages;
    (ii) If your source is equipped with a low energy wet scrubber such 
as a spray tower, packed bed, or tray tower, you must establish a 
minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber based on manufacturer's 
specifications. You must comply with the limit on an hourly rolling 
average;
    (iii) If your source is equipped with a low energy wet scrubber, you 
must establish a limit on minimum liquid feed pressure to the wet 
scrubber based on manufacturer's specifications. You must comply with 
the limit on an hourly rolling average;
    (iv) You must establish a limit on minimum pH on an hourly rolling 
average as the average of the test run averages;
    (v) You must establish limits on either the minimum liquid to gas 
ratio or the minimum scrubber water flowrate and maximum flue gas 
flowrate on an hourly rolling average as the average of the test run 
averages. If you establish limits on maximum flue gas flowrate under 
this paragraph, you need not establish a limit on maximum flue gas 
flowrate under paragraph (o)(2) of this section; and
    (vi) You must establish a limit on minimum power input for ionizing 
wet scrubbers on an hourly rolling average as the average of the test 
run averages.

(i.e., manufacturer) and type of sorbent used during the comprehensive 
performance test until a subsequent comprehensive performance test is 
conducted, unless you document in the site-specific performance test 
plan required under Secs. 63.1207(e) and (f) key parameters that affect 
adsorption and establish limits on those parameters based on the sorbent 
used in the performance test.
    (B) You may substitute at any time a different brand or type of 
sorbent provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved 
properties compared to the sorbent used in the performance test and 
conforms to the key sorbent parameters you identify under paragraph 
(o)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. You must record in the operating record 
documentation that the substitute sorbent will provide the same level of 
control as the original sorbent.
    (p) Maximum combustion chamber pressure. If you comply with the 
requirements for combustion system leaks under Sec. 63.1206(c)(5) by 
maintaining the maximum combustion chamber zone pressure lower than 
ambient pressure, you must monitor the pressure instantaneously and the 
automatic waste

[[Page 52]]

feed cutoff system must be engaged when negative pressure is not 
maintained at any time.
    (q) Operating under different modes of operation. If you operate 
under different modes of operation, you must establish operating 
parameter limits for each mode. You must document in the operating

operating parameter limits for an alternative mode of operation. You 
must begin calculating rolling averages anew (i.e., without considering 
previous recordings) when you begin complying with the operating 
parameter limits for the alternative mode of operation.

Sec. 63.1213  How can the compliance date be extended to install pollution prevention or waste minimization controls?

    (a) Applicability. You may request from the Administrator or State 
with an approved Title V program an extension of the compliance data of 
up to one year. An extension may be granted if you can reasonably 
document that the installation of pollution prevention or waste 
minimization measures will significantly reduce the amount and/or 
toxicity of hazardous wastes entering the feedstream(s) of the hazardous 
waste combustor(s), and that you could not install the necessary control 
measures and comply with the emission standards and operating 
requirements of this subpart within three years after their effective 
date.
    (b) Requirements for requesting an extension. (1) You must make your 
requests for a (up to) one-year extension in writing, and it must be 
received not later than 12 months before the compliance date. The 
request must contain the following information:
    (i) A description of pollution prevention or waste minimization 
controls that, when installed, will significantly reduce the amount and/
or toxicity of hazardous wastes entering the feedstream(s) of the 
hazardous waste combustor(s). Pollution prevention or waste minimization 
measures may include: equipment or technology modifications, 
reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, 
improvements in work practices, maintenance, training, inventory 
control, or recycling practices conducted as defined in Sec. 261.1(c) of 
this chapter;
    (ii) A description of other pollution controls to be installed that 
are necessary to comply with the emission standards and operating 
requirements;
    (iii) A reduction goal or estimate of the annual reductions in 
quantity and/or toxicity of hazardous waste(s) entering combustion 
feedstream(s) that you will achieve by installing the proposed pollution 
prevention or waste minimization measures;
    (iv) A comparison of reductions in the amounts and/or toxicity of 
hazardous wastes combusted after installation of pollution prevention or 
waste minimization measures to the amounts and/or toxicity of hazardous 
wastes combusted prior to the installation of these measures. If the 
difference is less than a fifteen percent reduction, include a 
comparison to pollution prevention and waste minimization reductions 
recorded during the previous five years;
    (v) Reasonable documentation that installation of the pollution 
prevention or waste minimization changes will not result in a net 
increase (except for documented increases in production) of hazardous 
constituents released to the environment through other emissions, wastes 
or effluents;
    (vi) Reasonable documentation that the design and installation of 
waste minimization and other measures that are necessary for compliance 
with the emission standards and operating requirements of this subpart 
cannot otherwise be installed within the three year compliance period, 
and
    (vii) The information required in Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i)(B) through (D).
    (2) You may enclose documentation prepared under an existing State-
required pollution prevention program that contains the information 
prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section with a request for extension 
in lieu of complying with the time extension requirements of that 
paragraph.
    (c) Approval of request for extension of compliance date. Based on 
the information provided in any request made under paragraph (a) of this

  Appendix to Subpart EEE of Part 63--Quality Assurance Procedures for 
    Continuous Emissions Monitors Used for Hazardous Waste Combustors

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1  Applicability. a. These quality assurance requirements are used 
to evaluate the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality 
assurance (QA) procedures and the quality of data produced by continuous 
emission monitoring systems (CEMS) that are used for determining 
compliance with the emission standards on a continuous basis as 
specified in the applicable regulation. The QA procedures specified by 
these requirements represent the minimum requirements necessary for the 
control and assessment of the quality of CEMS data used to demonstrate 
compliance with the emission standards provided under subpart EEE of 
this part 63. Owners and operators must meet these minimum requirements 
and are encouraged to develop and implement a more extensive QA program. 
These requirements superede those found in part 60, appendix F of this 
chapter. Appendix F does not apply to hazardous waste-burning devices.
    b. Data collected as a result of the required QA and QC measures are 
to be recorded in the operating record. In addition, data collected as a 
result of CEMS performance evaluations required by Section 5 in 
conjunction with an emissions performance test are to be submitted to 
the Administrator as provided by Sec. 63.8(e)(5). These data are to be 
used by both the Agency and the CEMS operator in assessing the 
effectiveness of the CEMS QA and QC procedures in the maintenance of 
acceptable CEMS operation and valid emission data.
    1.2  Principle. The QA procedures consist of two distinct and 
equally important functions. One function is the assessment of the 
quality of the CEMS data by estimating accuracy. The other function is 
the control and improvement of the quality of the CEMS data by 
implementing QC policies and corrective actions. These two functions 
form a control loop. When the assessment function indicates that the 
data quality is inadequate, the source must immediately stop burning 
hazardous waste. The CEM data control effort must be increased until the 
data quality is acceptable before hazardous waste burning can resume.
    a. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of 
data quality, this procedure explicitly specifies the assessment methods 
for response drift and accuracy. The methods are based on procedures 
included in the applicable performance specifications provided in 
appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. These procedures also require the 
analysis of the EPA audit samples concurrent with certain reference 
method (RM) analyses as specified in the applicable RM's.
    b. Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a 
variety of policies, specifications, standards, and corrective measures, 
this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow each 
source owner or operator to develop a QC system that is most effective 
and efficient for the circumstances.

                             2. Definitions

    2.1  Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). The total 
equipment required for the determination of a pollutant concentration. 
The system consists of the following major subsystems:
    2.1.1  Sample Interface. That portion of the CEMS used for one or 
more of the following: sample acquisition, sample transport, and sample 
conditioning, or protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack 
effluent.

[[Page 61]]

    2.1.2  Pollutant Analyzer. That portion of the CEMS that senses the 
pollutant concentration and generates a proportional output.
    2.1.3  Diluent Analyzer. That portion of the CEMS that senses the 
diluent gas (O2) and generates an output proportional to the gas 
concentration.
    2.1.4  Data Recorder. That portion of the CEMS that provides a 
permanent record of the analyzer output. The data recorder may provide 
automatic data reduction and CEMS control capabilities.
    2.2  Relative Accuracy (RA). The absolute mean difference between 
the pollutant concentration determined by the CEMS and the value 
determined by the reference method (RM) plus the 2.5 percent error 
confidence coefficient of a series of test divided by the mean of the RM 
tests or the applicable emission limit.
    2.3  Calibration Drift (CD). The difference in the CEMS output 
readings from the established reference value after a stated period of 
operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment 
took place.
    2.4  Zero Drift (ZD). The difference in CEMS output readings at the 
zero pollutant level after a stated period of operation during which no 
unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place.
    2.5  Calibration Standard. Calibration standards produce a known and 
unchanging response when presented to the pollutant analyzer portion of 
the CEMS, and are used to calibrate the drift or response of the 
analyzer.
    2.6  Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). Comparison of CEMS 
measurements to reference method measurements in order to evaluate 
relative accuracy following procedures and specification given in the 
appropriate performance specification.
    2.7  Absolute Calibration Audit (ACA). Equivalent to calibration 
error (CE) test defined in the appropriate performance specification 
using NIST traceable calibration standards to challenge the CEMS and 
assess accuracy.
    2.8  Rolling Average. The average emissions, based on some 
(specified) time period, calculated every minute from a one-minute 
average of four measurements taken at 15-second intervals. CEMS other 
than carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbon CEMS may have rolling 
averages calculated every hour from a one-hour average of at least four 
measurements taken at intervals not exceeding 15 minutes.

                          c. QA/QC Requirements

    3.1  QC Requirements. a. Each owner or operator must develop and 
implement a QC program. At a minimum, each QC program must include 
written procedures describing in detail complete, step-by-step 
procedures and operations for the following activities.
    1. Checks for component failures, leaks, and other abnormal 
conditions.
    2. Calibration of CEMS.
    3. CD determination and adjustment of CEMS.
    4. Integration of CEMS with the automatic waste feed cutoff (AWFCO) 
system.
    5. Preventive Maintenance of CEMS (including spare parts inventory).
    6. Data recording, calculations, and reporting.
    7. Checks of record keeping.
    8. Accuracy audit procedures, including sampling and analysis 
methods.
    9. Program of corrective action for malfunctioning CEMS.
    10. Operator training and certification.
    11. Maintaining and ensuring current certification or naming of 
cylinder gasses, metal solutions, and particulate samples used for audit 
and accuracy tests, daily checks, and calibrations.
    b. Whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive 
quarters, the current written procedures must be revised or the CEMS 
modified or replaced to correct the deficiency causing the excessive 
inaccuracies. These written procedures must be kept on record and 
available for inspection by the enforcement agency.
    3.2  QA Requirements. Each source owner or operator must develop and 
implement a QA plan that includes, at a minimum, the following.
    1. QA responsibilities (including maintaining records, preparing 
reports, reviewing reports).
    2. Schedules for the daily checks, periodic audits, and preventive 
maintenance.
    3. Check lists and data sheets.
    4. Preventive maintenance procedures.
    5. Description of the media, format, and location of all records and 
reports.
    6. Provisions for a review of the CEMS data at least once a year. 
Based on the results of the review, the owner or operator must revise or 
update the QA plan, if necessary.

             d. CD and ZD Assessment and Daily System Audit

    4.1  CD and ZD Requirement. Owners and operators must check, record, 
and quantify the ZD and the CD at least once daily (approximately 24 
hours) in accordance with the method prescribed by the manufacturer. The 
CEMS calibration must, at a minimum, be adjusted whenever the daily ZD 
or CD exceeds the limits in the Performance Specifications. If, on any 
given ZD and/or CD check the ZD and/or CD exceed(s) two times the limits 
in the Performance Specifications, or if the cumulative adjustment to 
the ZD and/or CD (see Section 4.2) exceed(s) three

[[Page 62]]

times the limits in the Performance Specifications, hazardous waste 
burning must immediately cease and the CEMS must be serviced and 
recalibrated. Hazardous waste burning cannot resume until the owner or 
operator documents that the CEMS is in compliance with the Performance 
Specifications by carrying out an ACA.
    4.2  Recording Requirements for Automatic ZD and CD Adjusting 
Monitors. Monitors that automatically adjust the data to the corrected 
calibration values must record the unadjusted concentration measurement 
prior to resetting the calibration, if performed, or record the amount 
of the adjustment.
    4.3  Daily System Audit. The audit must include a review of the 
calibration check data, an inspection of the recording system, an 
inspection of the control panel warning lights, and an inspection of the 
sample transport and interface system (e.g., flowmeters, filters, etc.) 
as appropriate.
    4.4  Data Recording and Reporting. All measurements from the CEMS 
must be retained in the operating record for at least 5 years.

                        5. Performance Evaluation

    Carbon Monoxide (CO), Oxygen (O<INF>2</INF>), and Hydrocarbon (HC) 
CEMS. An Absolute Calibration Audit (ACA) must be conducted quarterly, 
and a Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA) (if applicable, see sections 
5.1 and 5.2) must be conducted yearly. An Interference Response Tests 
must be performed whenever an ACA or a RATA is conducted. When a 
performance test is also required under Sec. 63.1207 to document 
compliance with emission standards, the RATA must coincide with the 
performance test. The audits must be conducted as follows.
    5.1  Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). This requirement applies 
to O<INF>2</INF> and CO CEMS. The RATA must be conducted at least 
yearly. Conduct the RATA as described in the RA test procedure (or 
alternate procedures section) described in the applicable Performance 
Specifications. In addition, analyze the appropriate performance audit 
samples received from the EPA as described in the applicable sampling 
methods.
    5.2  Absolute Calibration Audit (ACA). The ACA must be conducted at 
least quarterly except in a quarter when a RATA (if applicable, see 
section 5.1) is conducted instead. Conduct an ACA as described in the 
calibration error (CE) test procedure described in the applicable 
Performance Specifications.
    5.3  Interference Response Test. The interference response test must 
be conducted whenever an ACA or RATA is conducted. Conduct an 
interference response test as described in the applicable Performance 
Specifications.
    5.4  Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. If the RA from the RATA or the CE 
from the ACA exceeds the criteria in the applicable Performance 
Specifications, hazardous waste burning must cease immediately. 
Hazardous waste burning cannot resume until the owner or operator takes 
corrective measures and audit the CEMS with a RATA to document that the 
CEMS is operating within the specifications.

                          6. Other Requirements

    6.1  Performance Specifications. CEMS used by owners and operators 
of HWCs must comply with the following performance specifications in 
appendix B to part 60 of this chapter:

              Table I: Performance Specifications for CEMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            Performance
                           CEMS                            specification
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carbon monoxide..........................................          4B
Oxygen...................................................          4B
Total hydrocarbons.......................................          8A
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.2  Downtime due to Calibration. Facilities may continue to burn 
hazardous waste for a maximum of 20 minutes while calibrating the CEMS. 
If all CEMS are calibrated at once, the facility must have twenty 
minutes to calibrate all the CEMS. If CEMS are calibrated individually, 
the facility must have twenty minutes to calibrate each CEMS. If the 
CEMS are calibrated individually, other CEMS must be operational while 
the individual CEMS is being calibrated.
    6.3  Span of the CEMS.
    6.3.1  CO CEMS. The CO CEM must have two ranges, a low range with a 
span of 200 ppmv and a high range with a span of 3000 ppmv at an oxygen 
correction factor of 1. A one-range CEM may be used, but it must meet 
the performance specifications for the low range in the specified span 
of the low range.
    6.3.2  O<INF>2 CEMS.</INF> The O<INF>2</INF> CEM must have a span of 
25 percent. The span may be higher than 25 percent if the O<INF>2</INF> 
concentration at the sampling point is greater than 25 percent.
    6.3.3  HC CEMS. The HC CEM must have a span of 100 ppmv, expressed 
as propane, at an oxygen correction factor of 1.
    6.3.4  CEMS Span Values. When the Oxygen Correction Factor is 
Greater than 2. When an owner or operator installs a CEMS at a location 
of high ambient air dilution, i.e., where the maximum oxygen correction 
factor as determined by the permitting agency is greater than 2, the 
owner or operator must install a CEM with a lower span(s), proportionate 
to the larger oxygen correction factor, than those specified above.
    6.3.5  Use of Alternative Spans. Owner or operators may request 
approval to use alternative spans and ranges to those specified.

[[Page 63]]

Alternate spans must be approved in writing in advance by the 
Administrator. In considering approval of alternative spans and ranges, 
the Administrator will consider that measurements beyond the span will 
be recorded as values at the maximum span for purposes of calculating 
rolling averages.
    6.3.6  Documentation of Span Values. The span value must be 
documented by the CEMS manufacturer with laboratory data.
    6.4.1  Moisture Correction. Method 4 of appendix A, part 60 of this 
chapter, must be used to determine moisture content of the stack gasses.
    6.4.2  Oxygen Correction Factor. Measured pollutant levels must be 
corrected for the amount of oxygen in the stack according to the 
following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.022

Where:

P<INF>c</INF> = concentration of the pollutant or standard corrected to 
          7 percent oxygen, dry basis;
P<INF>m</INF> = measured concentration of the pollutant, dry basis;
E = volume fraction of oxygen in the combustion air fed into the device, 
          on a dry basis (normally 21 percent or 0.21 if only air is 
          fed);
Y = measured fraction of oxygen on a dry basis at the sampling point.

    The oxygen correction factor is:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.023
    
    6.4.3  Temperature Correction. Correction values for temperature are 
obtainable from standard reference materials.
    6.5  Rolling Average. A rolling average is the arithmetic average of 
all one-minute averages over the averaging period.
    6.5.1  One-Minute Average for CO and HC CEMS and Operating Parameter 
Limits. One-minute averages are the arithmetic average of the four most 
recent 15-second observations and must be calculated using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.024

Where:

c = the one minute average
c<INF>i</INF> = a fifteen-second observation from the CEM

    Fifteen second observations must not be rounded or smoothed. 
Fifteen-second observations may be disregarded only as a result of a 
failure in the CEMS and allowed in the source's quality assurance plan 
at the time of the CMS failure. One-minute averages must not be rounded, 
smoothed, or disregarded.
    6.5.2  Ten Minute Rolling Average Equation. The ten minute rolling 
average must be calculated using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.025

Where:

C<INF>RA</INF> = The concentration of the standard, expressed as a 
          rolling average
c<INF>i</INF> = a one minute average

    6.5.3  Hourly Rolling Average Equation for CO and THC CEMS and 
Operating Parameter Limits. The rolling average, based on a specific 
number integer of hours, must be calculated using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.026

Where:

c<INF>RA</INF> = The concentration of the standard, expressed as a 
          rolling average
c<INF>i</INF> = a one minute average

    6.5.4  Averaging Periods for CEMS other than CO and THC. The 
averaging period for CEMS other than CO and THC CEMS must be calculated 
as a rolling average of all one-hour values over the averaging period. 
An hourly average is comprised of 4 measurements taken at equally spaced 
time intervals, or at most every 15 minutes. Fewer than 4 measurements 
might be available within an hour for reasons such as facility downtime 
or CEMS calibration. If at least two measurements (30 minutes of data) 
are available, an hourly average must be calculated. The n-hour rolling 
average is calculated by averaging the n most recent hourly averages.
    6.6  Units of the Standards for the Purposes of Recording and 
Reporting Emissions. Emissions must be recorded and reported expressed 
after correcting for oxygen, temperature, and moisture. Emissions must 
be reported in metric, but may also be reported in the English system of 
units, at 7 percent oxygen, 20 deg.C, and on a dry basis.
    6.7  Rounding and Significant Figures. Emissions must be rounded to 
two significant figures using ASTM procedure E-29-90 or its successor. 
Rounding must be avoided prior to rounding for the reported value.

 Subpart GGG--National Emission Standards for Pharmaceuticals Production

    Source: 63 FR 50326, Sept. 21, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1250  Applicability.

    (a) Definition of affected source. The affected source subject to 
this subpart is the pharmaceutical manufacturing operation, as defined 
in Sec. 63.1251. Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, 
the provisions of this subpart apply to pharmaceutical manufacturing 
operations that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) of this section as follows:
    (1) Manufacture a pharmaceutical product, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1251;
    (2) Are located at a plant site that is a major source as defined in 
section 112(a) of the Act; and
    (3) Process, use, or produce HAP.
    (b) New source applicability. A new affected source subject to this 
subpart and to which the requirements for new sources apply is: an 
affected source for which construction or reconstruction commenced after 
April 2, 1997 and the standard was applicable at the time of 
construction or reconstruction; or a pharmaceutical manufacturing 
process unit (PMPU), dedicated to manufacturing a single product, that 
has the potential to emit 10 tons per year of any one HAP or 25 tons per 
year of combined HAP, for which construction commenced after April 2, 
1997.
    (c) General Provisions. Table 1 of this subpart specifies the 
provisions of subpart A of this part that apply to an owner or operator 
of an affected source subject to this subpart, and clarifies specific 
provisions in subpart A of this part as necessary for this subpart.
    (d) Processes exempted from the affected source. The provisions of 
this subpart do not apply to research and development facilities.
    (e) Storage tank ownership determination. The owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through 
(e)(5) of this section to determine to which PMPU a storage tank shall 
belong.
    (1) If a storage tank is dedicated to a single PMPU, the storage 
tank shall belong to that PMPU.
    (2) If a storage tank is shared among PMPU's, then the storage tank 
shall belong to that PMPU located on the same plant site as the storage 
tank that has the greatest annual volume input into or output from the 
storage tank (i.e., said PMPU has the predominant use of the storage 
tank).
    (3) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage tank that 
is shared among PMPU's and if one of those PMPU's is subject to this 
subpart, the storage tank shall belong to said PMPU.
    (4) If the predominant use of a storage tank varies from year to 
year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization 
that occurred during the year preceding September 21, 1998 for existing 
affected sources. For new affected sources, predominant use will be 
based on the first year after initial startup. The determination of 
predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance 
Status required by Sec. 63.1260(f). If the predominant use changes, the 
redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next 
Periodic Report.
    (5) If the storage tank begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) another PMPU; or ceases to receive material from (or send 
material to) a PMPU; or if the applicability of this subpart to a 
storage tank has been determined according to the provisions of 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section and there is a significant 
change in the use of the storage tank that could reasonably change the 
predominant use, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the 
applicability of this subpart to the storage tank, and report such 
changes to EPA in the next Periodic report.
    (f) Compliance dates. The compliance dates for affected sources are 
as follows:
    (1) An owner or operator of an existing affected source must comply 
with the provisions of this subpart within 3 years after September 21, 
1998.
    (2) An owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source 
must comply with the provisions of this subpart on September 21, 1998 or 
upon startup, whichever is later.

[[Page 65]]

    (3) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of 
this section, a new source which commences construction or 
reconstruction after April 2, 1997 and before September 21, 1998 shall 
not be required to comply with such promulgated standard until 3 years 
after September 21, 1998 if:
    (i) The promulgated standard is more stringent than the proposed 
standard; and
    (ii) The owner or operator complies with the standard as proposed 
during the 3-year period immediately after September 21, 1998.
    (4) Pursuant to section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, an owner or 
operator may request an extension allowing the existing source up to 1 
additional year to comply with section 112(d) standards.
    (i) For purposes of this subpart, a request for an extension shall 
be submitted no later than 120 days prior to the compliance dates 
specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section, except as 
provided in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section. The dates specified in 
Sec. 63.6(i) for submittal of requests for extensions shall not apply to 
sources subject to this subpart.
    (ii) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request 
after the date specified in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section provided 
the need for the compliance extension arose after that date and before 
the otherwise applicable compliance date, and the need arose due to 
circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This 
request shall include the data described in Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), 
(C), and (D).
    (g) Applicability of this subpart except during periods of startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction. (1) Each provision set forth in this subpart 
shall apply at all times except that emission limitations shall not 
apply during periods of: startup; shutdown; and malfunction, if the 
startup, shutdown, and malfunction precludes the ability of a particular 
emission point of an affected source to comply with one or more specific 
emission limitations to which it is subject and the owner or operator 
follows the provisions for periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction, as specified in Secs. 63.1259(a)(3) and 63.1260(i). 
Startup, shutdown, and malfunction are defined in Sec. 63.1251.
    (2) The provisions set forth in Sec. 63.1255 of this subpart shall 
apply at all times except during periods of nonoperation of the PMPU (or 
specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and 
depressurized resulting in the cessation of the emissions to which 
Sec. 63.1255 of this subpart applies.
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with the emissions 
limitations of this subpart during times when emissions (or, where 
applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such 
items of equipment, if the shutdown would contravene emissions 
limitations of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment. This 
paragraph does not apply if the item of equipment is malfunctioning, or 
if the owner or operator must shut down the equipment to avoid damage 
due to a malfunction of the PMPU or portion thereof.
    (4) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emissions 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) 
through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to 
the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions to the extent practical. For purposes of this paragraph, 
``excess emissions'' means emissions in excess of those that would have 
occurred if there were no startup, shutdown, or malfunction and the 
owner or operator complied with the relevant provisions of this subpart. 
The measures to be taken shall be identified in the applicable startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan, and may include, but are not limited to, 
air pollution control technologies, work practices, pollution 
prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the 
source. Back-up control devices are not required, but may be used if 
available.
    (h) Consistency with other regulations. (1) Consistency with other 
MACT standards. After the compliance dates specified in this section, an 
affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart that is also 
subject to the provisions of any other subpart of 40 CFR

[[Page 66]]

part 63 may elect, to the extent the subparts are consistent, which 
subpart under which to maintain records and report to EPA. The affected 
source shall identify in the Notification of Compliance Status report 
required by Sec. 63.1260(f) under which authority such records will be 
maintained.
    (2) Consistency with 40 CFR parts 264 and 265, subparts AA, BB, and/
or CC. After the compliance dates specified in this section, if any 
affected source subject to this subpart is also subject to monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 264, subpart 
AA, BB, or CC, or is subject to monitoring and recordkeeping 
requirements in 40 CFR part 265, subpart AA, BB, or CC and the owner or 
operator complies with the periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR 
part 264, subpart AA, BB, or CC that would apply to the device if the 
facility had final-permitted status, the owner or operator may elect to 
comply either with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements of this subpart, or with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in 
this paragraph, which shall constitute compliance with the monitoring, 
record keeping, and reporting requirements of this subpart. If the owner 
or operator elects to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, the owner or 
operator shall report all information required by Sec. 63.1260(g). The 
owner or operator shall identify in the Notification of Compliance 
Status required by Sec. 63.1260(f) the monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting authority under which the owner or operator will comply.
    (3) Consistency with 40 CFR 60.112b. After the compliance dates 
specified in this section, a storage tank controlled with a floating 
roof and in compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR 60.112b, subpart 
Kb, constitutes compliance with the provisions of this subpart GGG. A 
storage tank with a fixed roof, closed vent system, and control device 
in compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR 60.112b, subpart Kb must 
comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting provisions of 
this subpart GGG. The owner or operator shall identify in the 
Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec. 63.1260(f) 
which tanks are in compliance with subpart Kb.
    (4) Consistency with subpart I of this part. After the compliance 
dates specified in this section, for equipment at an affected source 
subject to this subpart that is also subject to subpart I of this part, 
an owner or operator may elect to comply with either the provisions of 
this subpart GGG or the provisions of subpart I of this part. The owner 
or operator shall identify in the Notification of Compliance Status 
report required by Sec. 63.1260(f) the provisions with which the owner 
elects to comply.
    (5) Consistency with other regulations for wastewater. After the 
compliance dates specified in this section, the owner or operator of an 
affected wastewater that is also subject to provisions in 40 CFR parts 
260 through 272 shall comply with the more stringent control 
requirements (e.g., waste management units, numerical treatment 
standards, etc.) and the more stringent testing, monitoring, recording, 
and recordkeeping requirements that overlap between the provisions of

owner or operator shall keep a record of the information used to 
determine which requirements were the most stringent and shall submit 
this information if requested by the Administrator.
    (i) For the purposes of establishing whether a person is in 
violation of this subpart, nothing in this subpart shall preclude the 
use of any credible evidence or information relevant to whether a source 
would have been in compliance with applicable requirements.

Sec. 63.1251  Definitions.

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in subpart A of 
this part, or in this section. If the same term is defined in subpart A 
of this part and in this section, it shall have the meaning given in 
this section for the purposes of this subpart.

[[Page 67]]

    Active ingredient means any component that is intended to furnish 
pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, 
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the 
structure or any function of the body of man or other animals. The term 
includes those components that may undergo chemical change in the 
manufacture of the pharmaceutical product and be present in the 
pharmaceutical product in a modified form intended to furnish the 
specified activity or effect.
    Actual HAP emissions means the HAP emitted to the atmosphere from 
either uncontrolled or controlled emission points.
    Air pollution control device or Control device means equipment 
installed on a process vent, storage tank, wastewater treatment exhaust 
stack, or combination thereof that reduces the mass of HAP emitted to 
the air. The equipment may consist of an individual device or a series 
of devices. Examples include, but are not limited to, incinerators, 
carbon adsorption units, condensers, flares, boilers, process heaters, 
and gas absorbers. Process condensers are not considered air pollution 
control devices or control devices.

reading of monitoring instruments and manual transcription of data 
values. Automated monitoring and recording systems include, but are not 
limited to, computerized systems and strip charts.
    Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode that may be 
associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more 
than one batch emission episode. For example, a displacement of vapor 
resulting from the charging of a vessel with HAP will result in a 
discrete emission episode that will last through the duration of the 
charge and will have an average flowrate equal to the rate of the 
charge. If the vessel is then heated, there will also be another 
discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded 
vapor. Both emission episodes may occur in the same vessel or unit 
operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may occur 
from the vessel or other process equipment, depending on process 
operations.
    Batch operation or Batch process means a noncontinuous operation 
involving intermittent or discontinuous feed into equipment, and, in 
general, involves the emptying of the equipment after the batch

of an affected source or a PMPU.
    Consumption means the quantity of HAP entering a process that is not 
used as reactant (makeup). If the same HAP component is generated in the 
process as well as added as makeup, consumption shall include the 
quantity generated in the process, as calculated assuming 100 
theoretical conversion. The quantity of material used as reactant is the 
theoretical amount needed assuming a 100 percent stoichiometric 
conversion. Makeup is the net amount of material that must be added to 
the process to replenish losses.
    Container, as used in the wastewater provisions, means any portable 
waste management unit that has a capacity greater than or equal to 0.1

minimize air emissions. A cover may have openings necessary for 
operation, inspection, and maintenance of the waste management unit such 
as access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells provided that each 
opening is closed when not in use. Examples of covers include a fixed 
roof installed on a wastewater tank, a lid installed on a container, and 
an air-supported enclosure installed over a waste management unit.
    Dedicated PMPU means a PMPU that is composed of equipment that is 
used to manufacture the same product for a continuous period of 6 months 
or greater. The PMPU includes any shared storage tank(s) that are 
determined to belong to the PMPU according to the procedures in

treatment process means an aerated, thoroughly mixed treatment unit(s) 
that contains biomass suspended in water followed by a clarifier that 
removes biomass from the treated water and recycles recovered biomass to 
the aeration unit. The mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (biomass) 
is greater than 1 kilogram per cubic meter throughout each aeration 
unit. The biomass is suspended and aerated in the water of the aeration 
unit(s) by either submerged air flow or mechanical agitation. A 
thoroughly mixed treatment unit is a unit that is designed and operated 
to approach or achieve uniform biomass distribution and organic compound 
concentration throughout the aeration unit by quickly dispersing the 
recycled biomass and the wastewater entering the unit.

    Excipient means any substance other than the active drug or product 
which have been appropriately evaluated for safety and are included in a 
drug delivery system to either aid the processing of the drug delivery 
system during its manufacture; protect, support or enhance stability, 
bioavailability, or patient acceptability; assist in product 
identification; or enhance any other attribute of the overall safety and 
effectiveness of the drug delivery system during storage or use.

determined through process knowledge, test results using Method 18 of 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A, or test results using any other test method 
that has been validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of 
appendix A of this part.

    (2) The total concentration of the pure organic compounds 
constituents having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kilopascals at 
20 deg.C is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight of the total

wastewater streams or residuals to a waste management unit. The term 
includes hard piping; all process drains and junction boxes; and 
associated sewer lines, other junction boxes, manholes, sumps, and lift 
stations conveying wastewater streams or residuals. A segregated 
stormwater sewer system, which is a drain and collection system designed 
and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall-runoff at a 
facility, and which is segregated from all other individual drain 
systems, is excluded from this definition.
    Initial startup means the first time a new or reconstructed source

other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only 
valves nominally 0.5 inches and smaller, and connectors nominally 0.75 
inches and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems 
for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 0.5 
inches and connectors greater than nominally 0.75 inches associated with

dripping, spraying, misting, clouding, and ice formation. Indications of 
liquid dripping include puddling or new stains that are indicative of an 
existing evaporated drip.
    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, emissions 
monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a 
normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused all or in part by poor 
maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
    Maximum true vapor pressure means the equilibrium partial pressure 
exerted by the total organic HAP in the stored or transferred liquid at 
the temperature equal to the highest calendar-month average of the 
liquid storage or transferred temperature for liquids stored or 
transferred above or below the ambient temperature or at the local 
maximum monthly average temperature as reported by the National Weather 
Service for liquids stored or transferred at the ambient temperature, as

elements not previously reported, except for paragraph (5) of this 
definition, shall constitute a new operating scenario.
    Partially soluble HAP means a HAP listed in Table 2 of this subpart.
    Pharmaceutical manufacturing operations means the facility-wide 
collection of PMPU's and any other equipment such as heat exchanger 
systems, or cooling towers that are not associated with an individual 
PMPU, but that are located at a facility for the purpose of 
manufacturing pharmaceutical products and are under common control.
    Pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit (PMPU) means the process, 
as defined in this subpart, and any associated storage tanks, equipment 
identified in Sec. 63.1252(f), and components such as pumps, 
compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection 
systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, and 
instrumentation systems that are used in the manufacturing of a 
pharmaceutical product.
    Pharmaceutical product means:
    (1) Any material described by the standard industrial classification 
(SIC) code 2833 or 2834;
    (2) Any material whose manufacturing process is described by north 
american industrial classification system (NAICS) code 325411 or 325412;
    (3) A finished dosage form of a drug, for example, a tablet,

but not necessarily, in association with inactive ingredients; or
    (4) Any component whose intended primary use is to furnish 
pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, 
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the 
structure or any function of the body of man or other animals (the term 
does not include excipients, but includes drug components such as raw 
starting materials or precursors that undergo chemical change or 
processing before they become active ingredients).
    Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common control, including properties that are separated only by a road 
or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that 
are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, 
subsidiary, or any combination thereof.
    Point of determination (POD) means the point where a wastewater 
stream exits the process, storage tank, or last recovery device. If 
soluble and/or partially soluble HAP compounds are not recovered from 
water before discharge, the discharge point from the process equipment 
or storage tank is a POD. If water streams are routed to a recovery 
device, the discharge from the recovery device is a POD. There can be 
more than 1 POD per process or PMPU.
    Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the 
system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure 
relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases 
over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
    Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to 
prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working 
pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a 
spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by 
a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 psig or by a vacuum are not 
pressure relief devices.
    Primary use means the single largest use of a material.
    Process means all equipment which collectively function to produce a 
pharmaceutical product. A process may consist of one or more unit 
operations. For the purposes of this subpart, process includes all or a 
combination of reaction, recovery, separation, purification, or other 
activity, operation, manufacture, or treatment which are used to produce 
a pharmaceutical product. Cleaning operations conducted are considered 
part of the process. The holding of the pharmaceutical product in tanks 
or other holding equipment for more than 30 consecutive days, or 
transfer of the pharmaceutical product to containers for shipment, marks 
the end of a process, and the tanks are considered part of the PMPU that 
produced the stored material. When material from one unit operation is 
used as the feedstock for the production of two

[[Page 73]]

or more different pharmaceutical products, the unit operation is 
considered the endpoint of the process that produced the material, and 
the unit operations into which the material is routed mark the beginning 
of the other processes. Nondedicated recovery devices located within a 
contiguous area within the affected source are considered single 
processes. Nondedicated formulation operations occurring within a 
contiguous area are considered a single process that is used to 
formulate numerous materials and/or products. Quality Assurance and 
Quality Control laboratories are not considered part of any process.
    Process condenser means a condenser whose primary purpose is to 
recover material as an integral part of a process. The condenser must 
support a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods of source equipment 
operation that are at or above the boiling or bubble point of 
substance(s) at the liquid surface. Examples of process condensers 
include distillation condensers, reflux condensers, and condensers used 
in stripping or flashing operations. In a series of condensers, all 
condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas 
temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the substance(s) at the 
liquid surface are considered to be process condensers. All condensers 
in line prior to a vacuum source are included in this definition.
    Process shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that 
stops production from a process or part of a process during which it is 
technically feasible to clear process material from a process or part of 
a process consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs 
can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure 
that stops production from a process or part of a process for less than 
24 hours is not a process shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or 
operational procedure that would stop production from a process or part 
of a process for a shorter period of time than would be required to 
clear the process or part of the process of materials and start up the 
process, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of 
leaking components until the next scheduled process shutdown, is not a 
process shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible 
bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process 
shutdowns.
    Process tank means a tank that is used to collect material 
discharged from a feedstock storage tank or unit operation within the 
process and transfer this material to another unit operation within the 
process or to a product storage tank. Surge control vessels and bottoms 
receivers that fit these conditions are considered process tanks.
    Process vent means a vent from a unit operation or vents from 
multiple unit operations within a process that are manifolded together 
into a common header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or 
has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Examples of process 
vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for 
product recovery, bottom receivers, surge control vessels, reactors, 
filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. Emission streams that are 
undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP, as 
determined through process knowledge that no HAP are present in the 
emission stream or using an engineering assessment as discussed in 
Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(ii), test data using Methods 18 of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, or any other test method that has been validated according 
to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part, are not 
considered process vents. Process vents do not include vents on storage 
tanks regulated under Sec. 63.1253, vents on wastewater emission sources 
regulated under Sec. 63.1256, or pieces of equipment regulated under 
Sec. 63.1255.
    Production-indexed HAP consumption factor is the result of dividing 
the annual consumption of total HAP by the annual production rate, per 
process.
    Production-indexed volatile organic compound (VOC) consumption 
factor is the result of dividing the annual consumption of total VOC by 
the annual production rate, per process.
    Publicly owned treatment works (POTW) means any devices and systems 
used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal 
sewage or industrial wastes of a liquid

[[Page 74]]

nature as defined in section 212(2)(A) of the Clean Water Act, as 
amended [33 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(2)(A)]. A POTW includes the treatment 
works, intercepting sewers, outfall sewers, sewage collection systems, 
pumping, power, and other equipment. The POTW is defined at 40 CFR 
403.3(o).
    Reactor means a device or vessel in which one or more chemicals or 
reactants, other than air, are combined or decomposed in such a way that 
their molecular structures are altered and one or more new organic 
compounds are formed.
    Recovery device, as used in the wastewater provisions, means an 
individual unit of equipment used for the purpose of recovering 
chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, 
or for sale for fuel value, use or reuse. Examples of equipment that may 
be recovery devices include organic removal devices such as decanters, 
strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. To be a recovery device, a 
decanter and any other equipment based on the operating principle of 
gravity separation must receive only two-phase liquid streams.
    Repaired means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to 
eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable sections of Sec. 63.1255.
    Research and development facility means any stationary source whose 
primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new 
processes and products, where such source is operated under the close 
supervision of technically trained personnel, and is not engaged in the 
manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de 
minimis manner.
    Residual means any HAP-containing liquid or solid material that is 
removed from a wastewater stream by a waste management unit or treatment 
process that does not destroy organics (nondestructive unit). Examples 
of residuals from nondestructive waste management units are: the organic 
layer and bottom residue removed by a decanter or organic-water 
separator and the overheads from a steam stripper or air stripper. 
Examples of materials which are not residuals are: silt; mud; leaves; 
bottoms from a steam stripper or air stripper; and sludges, ash, or 
other materials removed from wastewater being treated by destructive 
devices such as biological treatment units and incinerators.
    Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief 
valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which 
functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent 
deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting 
gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions 
resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the 
purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine 
venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover 
such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this 
vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature 
fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position 
during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or 
another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting 
applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the 
owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable 
regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering 
codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of 
flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
    Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a 
process unit used during periods of representative operation to take 
samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab 
samples is not considered a sampling connection system.
    Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the 
change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, 
pH, or liquid level.
    Set pressure means the pressure at which a properly operating 
pressure relief device begins to open to relieve atypical process system 
operating pressure.
    Sewer line means a lateral, trunk line, branch line, or other 
conduit including, but not limited to, grates,

[[Page 75]]

trenches, etc., used to convey wastewater streams or residuals to a 
downstream waste management unit.
    Shutdown means the cessation of operation of a PMPU or an individual 
piece of equipment required or used to comply with this part or for 
emptying and degassing storage tanks. Shutdown occurs for purposes 
including but not limited to: periodic maintenance, replacement of 
equipment, or repair. Shutdown does not apply to routine batch 
operations or the rinsing or washing of equipment in batch operations 
between batches.
    Single-seal system means a floating roof having one continuous seal 
that completely covers the space between the wall of the storage tank 
and the edge of the floating roof. This seal may be a vapor-mounted, 
liquid-mounted, or metallic shoe seal.
    Small control device means a control device that controls process 
vents with total emissions of less than 10 tons of HAP per year, before 
control.
    Soluble HAP means a HAP listed in Table 3 of this subpart.
    Startup means the first time a new or reconstructed source begins 
production, or, for new equipment added, including equipment used to 
comply with this subpart, the first time the equipment is put into 
operation, or for the introduction of a new product/process, the first 
time the product or process is run in equipment. As used in 
Sec. 63.1255, startup means the setting in operation of a piece of 
equipment or a control device that is subject to this subpart.
    Storage tank means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
organic liquids that contain one or more HAP as feedstocks or products 
of a PMPU. The following are not considered storage tanks for the 
purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 
kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
    (3) Vessels storing organic liquids that contain HAP only as 
impurities;
    (4) Wastewater storage tanks; and
    (5) Process tanks.
    Surface impoundment means a waste management unit which is a natural 
topographic depression, manmade excavation, or diked area formed 
primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with manmade 
materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquid wastes 
or waste containing free liquids. A surface impoundment is used for the 
purpose of treating, storing, or disposing of wastewater or residuals, 
and is not an injection well. Examples of surface impoundments are 
equalization, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures of Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    Treatment process means a specific technique that removes or 
destroys the organics in a wastewater or residual stream such as a steam 
stripping unit, thin-film evaporation unit, waste incinerator, 
biological treatment unit, or any other process applied to wastewater 
streams or residuals to comply with Sec. 63.1256. Most treatment 
processes are conducted in tanks. Treatment processes are a subset of 
waste management units.
    Uncontrolled HAP emissions means a gas stream containing HAP which 
has exited the process (or process condenser, if any), but which has not 
yet been introduced into an air pollution control device to reduce the 
mass of HAP in the stream. If the process vent is not routed to an air 
pollution control device, uncontrolled emissions are those HAP emissions 
released to the atmosphere.
    Unit operation means those processing steps that occur within 
distinct equipment that are used, among other things, to prepare 
reactants, facilitate reactions, separate and purify products, and 
recycle materials. Equipment used for these purposes includes but is not 
limited to reactors, distillation columns, extraction columns, 
absorbers, decanters, dryers, condensers, and filtration equipment.
    Vapor-mounted seal means a continuous seal that completely covers 
the annular space between the wall, the storage tank or waste management 
unit and the edge of the floating roof and is mounted such that there is 
a vapor space between the stored liquid and the bottom of the seal.

[[Page 76]]

    Volatile organic compounds (VOC) means those materials defined in 40 
CFR 51.100.
    Waste management unit means the equipment, structure(s),and or 
devices used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of wastewater streams 
or residuals. Examples of waste management units include wastewater 
tanks, air flotation units, surface impoundments, containers, oil-water 
or organic-water separators, individual drain systems, biological 
wastewater treatment units, waste incinerators, and organic removal 
devices such as steam and air stripper units, and thin film evaporation 
units. If such equipment is used for recovery then it is part of a 
pharmaceutical process and is not a waste management unit.
    Wastewater means any portion of an individual wastewater stream or 
any aggregation of wastewater streams.
    Wastewater stream means water that is discarded from a PMPU through 
a single POD, that contains an annual average concentration of partially 
soluble and/or soluble HAP compounds of at least 5 parts per million by 
weight and a load of at least 0.05 kg/yr, and that is not exempted by 
the provisions of Sec. 63.1256(a)(3). For the purposes of this subpart, 
noncontact cooling water is not considered a wastewater stream. 
Wastewater streams are generated by both process operations and 
maintenance activities.
    Wastewater tank means a stationary waste management unit that is 
designed to contain an accumulation of wastewater or residuals and is 
constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, 
steel, plastic) which provide structural support. Wastewater tanks used 
for flow equalization are included in this definition.
    Water seal controls means a seal pot, p-leg trap, or other type of 
trap filled with water (e.g., flooded sewers that maintain water levels 
adequate to prevent air flow through the system) that creates a water 
barrier between the sewer line and the atmosphere. The water level of 
the seal must be maintained in the vertical leg of a drain in order to 
be considered a water seal.

    Each owner or operator of any affected source subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall control HAP emissions to the level 
specified in this section on and after the compliance dates specified in 
Sec. 63.1250(f). Compliance with the emission limits may be demonstrated 
initially through the provisions of Sec. 63.1257 (Test methods and 
compliance procedures) and continuously through the provisions of 
Sec. 63.1258 (Monitoring requirements).
    (a) Opening of a safety device. Opening of a safety device, as 
defined in Sec. 63.1251, is allowed at any time conditions require it to 
do so to avoid unsafe conditions.
    (b) Closed-vent systems. The owner or operator of a closed-vent 
system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away 
from a control device used to comply with the requirements in 
Secs. 63.1253, 63.1254, and 63.1256 shall comply with the requirements 
of Table 4 to this subpart and paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. 
Equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, 
open-ended valves or lines, rupture disks and pressure relief valves 
needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph.
    (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that 
determines whether vent stream flow is present at least once every 15 
minutes. Records shall be maintained as specified in 
Sec. 63.1259(i)(6)(i). The flow indicator shall be installed at the 
entrance to any bypass line that could divert the vent stream away from 
the control device to the atmosphere; or
    (2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car 
seal or lock and key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal 
or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to 
ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent 
stream is not diverted through the bypass line. Records shall be 
maintained as specified in Sec. 63.1259(i)(6)(ii).
    (c) Heat exchange systems. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, owners and operators of affected sources shall comply with 
the requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for heat exchange

operations.
    (1) The heat exchange system shall be treated according to the 
provisions of Sec. 63.104, except that the monitoring frequency shall be 
no less than quarterly.
    (2) For identifying leaking equipment, the owner or operator of heat 
exchange systems on equipment which meet current good manufacturing 
practice (CGMP) requirements of 21 CFR part 211 may elect to use the 
physical integrity of the reactor as the surrogate indicator of heat 
exchange system leaks around the reactor.
    (d) Emissions averaging provisions. Except as specified in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section, owners or operators of 
storage tanks or processes subject to the provisions of Secs. 63.1253 
and 63.1254 may choose to comply by using emissions averaging 
requirements specified in Sec. 63.1257(g) or (h) for any storage tank or 
process.
    (1) A State may prohibit averaging of HAP emissions and require the 
owner or operator of an existing source to comply with the provisions in 
Secs. 63.1253 and 63.1254.
    (2) Only emission sources subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 63.1253(b)(1) and (c)(1) or Sec. 63.1254(a)(2), (a)(3)(ii)(A) or 
(a)(3)(iii) may be included in any averaging group.
    (3) Processes which have been permanently shutdown or storage tanks 
permanently taken out of HAP service may not be included in any 
averaging group.
    (4) Processes and storage tanks already controlled on or before 
November 15, 1990 may not be included in an emissions averaging group, 
except where the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990. 
In these cases, the uncontrolled emissions shall be the controlled 
emissions as calculated on November 15, 1990 for the purpose of 
determining the uncontrolled emissions as specified in Sec. 63.1257(g) 
and (h).
    (5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal 
rule other than this subpart may not be included in an emission 
averaging group, unless the level of control has been increased after 
November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other State or Federal 
rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or 
Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been 
used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions 
average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or 
Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate 
emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the 
previously approved average.
    (6) Not more than 20 processes subject to Sec. 63.1254(a)(2)(i), 20 
storage tanks subject to Sec. 63.1253(b)(1), and 20 storage tanks 
subject to Sec. 63.1253(c)(1)(i) at an affected source may be included 
in an emissions averaging group.
    (7) Compliance with the emissions standards in Sec. 63.1253 shall be 
satisfied when the annual percent reduction efficiency is greater than 
or equal to 90 percent for those tanks meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 63.1253(a)(1) and 95 percent for those tanks meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 63.1253(a)(2), as demonstrated using the test 
methods and compliance procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(g).
    (8) Compliance with the emissions standards in Sec. 63.1254(a)(2) 
shall be satisfied when the annual percent reduction efficiency is 
greater than or equal to 93 percent, as demonstrated using the test 
methods and compliance procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(h).
    (e) Pollution prevention alternative. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, owners and operators may choose to 
meet the pollution prevention alternative requirement specified in 
either paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section for any PMPU, in lieu of 
the requirements specified in Secs. 63.1253, 63.1254, 63.1255, and 
63.1256. Compliance with paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section shall 
be demonstrated through the procedures in Sec. 63.1257(f).
    (1) The HAP that are generated in the PMPU that are not part of the 
production-indexed consumption factor must be controlled according to 
the requirements of Secs. 63.1253, 63.1254, 63.1255, and 63.1256. The 
HAP that are generated as a result of combustion control of emissions 
must be controlled according to the requirements of paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (2) The production-indexed HAP consumption factor (kg HAP consumed/
kg

[[Page 78]]

produced) shall be reduced by at least 75 percent from a 3 year average 
baseline established no earlier than the 1987 calendar year, or for the 
time period from startup of the process until the present in which the 
PMPU was operational and data are available, whichever is the lesser 
time period. If a time period less than 3 years is used to set the 
baseline, the data must represent at least 1 year's worth of data. For 
any reduction in the HAP factor achieved by reducing a HAP that is also 
a VOC, an equivalent reduction in the VOC factor is also required. For 
any reduction in the HAP factor that is achieved by reducing a HAP that 
is not a VOC, the VOC factor may not be increased.
    (3) Both requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of 
this section are met.
    (i) The production-indexed HAP consumption factor (kg HAP consumed/
kg produced) shall be reduced by at least 50 percent from a 3-year 
average baseline established no earlier than the 1987 calendar year, or 
for the time period from startup of the process until the present in 
which the PMPU was operational and data are available, whichever is 
less. If a time period less than 3 years is used to set the baseline, 
the data must represent at least 1 year's worth of data. For any 
reduction in the HAP factor achieved by reducing a HAP that is also a 
VOC, an equivalent reduction in the VOC factor is also required. For any 
reduction in the HAP factor that is achieved by reducing a HAP that is 
not a VOC, the VOC factor may not be increased.
    (ii) The total PMPU HAP emissions shall be reduced by an amount, in 
kg/yr, that, when divided by the annual production rate, in kg/yr, and 
added to the reduction of the production-indexed HAP consumption factor, 
in kg/kg, yields a value of at least 75 percent of the average baseline 
HAP production-indexed consumption factor established according to 
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section according to the equation provided 
in Sec. 63.1257(f)(2)(ii)(A). The total PMPU VOC emissions shall be 
reduced by an amount calculated according to the equation provided in 
Sec. 63.1257(f)(2)(ii)(B). The annual reduction in HAP and VOC air 
emissions must be due to the use of the following control devices:
    (A) Combustion control devices such as incinerators, flares or 
process heaters.
    (B) Control devices such as condensers and carbon adsorbers whose 
recovered product is destroyed or shipped offsite for destruction.
    (C) Any control device that does not ultimately allow for recycling 
of material back to the PMPU.
    (D) Any control device for which the owner or operator can 
demonstrate that the use of the device in controlling HAP emissions will 
have no effect on the production-indexed consumption factor for the 
PMPU.
    (f) Control requirements for certain liquid streams in open systems 
within a PMPU. (1) The owner or operator shall comply with the 
provisions of Table 5 of this subpart, for each item of equipment 
meeting all the criteria specified in paragraphs (f)(2) through (4) and 
either paragraph (f)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (2) The item of equipment is of a type identified in Table 5 of this 
subpart;
    (3) The item of equipment is part of a PMPU, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1251;
    (4) The item of equipment is controlled less stringently than in 
Table 5 of this subpart and the item of equipment is not otherwise 
exempt from controls by the provisions of this subpart or subpart A of 
this part; and
    (5) The item of equipment:
    (i) Is a drain, drain hub, manhole, lift station, trench, pipe, or 
oil/water separator that conveys water with an annual average 
concentration greater than or equal to 1,300 parts per million by weight 
(ppmw) of partially soluble HAP compounds; or an annual average 
concentration greater than or equal to 5,200 ppmw of partially soluble 
and/or soluble HAP compounds. The annual average concentration shall be 
determined according to the procedures in Sec. 63.1257(e)(1)(ii).
    (ii) Is a tank that receives one or more streams that contain water 
with an annual average concentration greater than or equal to 1,300 ppmw 
of partially soluble HAP compounds, or greater than or equal to 5,200 
ppmw of total partially soluble and/or soluble

[[Page 79]]

HAP compounds. The owner or operator of the source shall determine the 
average concentration of the stream at the inlet to the tank and 
according to the procedures in Sec. 63.1257(e)(1)(ii).
    (g) Control requirements for halogenated vent streams that are 
controlled by combustion devices. If a combustion device is used to 
comply with the provisions of Secs. 63.1253 (storage tanks), 63.1254 
(process vents), 63.1256(h) (wastewater vent streams) for a halogenated 
vent stream, then the vent stream shall be ducted to a halogen reduction 
device such as, but not limited to, a scrubber, before it is discharged 
to the atmosphere. The halogen reduction device must reduce emissions by 
the amounts specified in either paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) A halogen reduction device after the combustion control device 
must reduce overall emissions of hydrogen halides and halogens, as 
defined in Sec. 63.1251, by 95 percent or to a concentration less than 
or equal to 20 ppmv.
    (2) A halogen reduction device located before the combustion control 
device must reduce the halogen atom content of the vent stream to a 
concentration less than or equal to 20 ppmv.

and less than or equal to 20 ppmv as hydrogen halides and halogens; or
    (C) By a flare that meets the requirements of Sec. 63.11(b); or
    (D) By a control device specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(4).
    (iii) If the owner or operator can demonstrate that a control 
device, installed on a process vent that meets the conditions of 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section on or before April 2, 1997, was 
designed to reduce uncontrolled HAP emissions of total HAP by greater 
than or equal to 93 percent by weight, but less than 98 percent by 
weight, then the control device is required to be operated to reduce 
inlet emissions of total HAP by 93 percent by weight or greater.
    (b) New sources. Uncontrolled HAP emissions from the sum of all 
process vents within a process at a new affected source that are not 
controlled according to any of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), 
(2), or (3) of this section or paragraph (c) of this section shall be 
reduced by 98 percent or greater by weight if the uncontrolled HAP 
emissions from the sum of all process vents within a process is greater 
than 180 kg/yr (400 lb/yr). Compliance with the required emission limit 
or reduction is demonstrated using the initial compliance procedures in 
Sec. 63.1257(d) and the monitoring requirements described in 
Sec. 63.1258.
    (1) To outlet concentrations less than or equal to 20 ppmv as TOC 
and less than or equal to 20 ppmv as hydrogen halides and halogens;
    (2) By a flare that meets the requirements of Sec. 63.11(b); or
    (3) By a control device specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(4).
    (c) As an alternative standard, the owner or operator of an existing 
or new affected source may comply with the process vent standards by 
routing all vents from a process to a control device achieving an outlet 
TOC concentration, as calibrated on methane or the predominant HAP, of 
20 ppmv or less, and an outlet concentration of hydrogen halides and 
halogens of 20 ppmv or less. Any process vents within a process that are 
not routed to this control device must be controlled in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraphs (a)(2),(a)(3), and (b) of this section, as 
applicable. Compliance with the outlet concentrations shall be 
determined by the initial compliance procedures described in 
Sec. 63.1257(d)(1)(iv)

Sec. 63.1255  Standards: Equipment leaks.

    (a) General Equipment Leak Requirements. (1) The provisions of this 
section apply to pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, 
sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, 
connectors, instrumentation systems, control devices, and closed-vent 
systems required by this subpart that are intended to operate in organic 
hazardous air pollutant service 300 hours or more during the calendar 
year within a source subject to the provisions of this subpart.
    (2) Consistency with other regulations. After the compliance date 
for a process, equipment subject to both this section and either of the 
following will be required to comply only with the provisions of this 
subpart:
    (i) 40 CFR part 60.
    (ii) 40 CFR part 61.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) The provisions in Sec. 63.1(a)(3) of subpart A of this part do 
not alter the provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (5) Lines and equipment not containing process fluids are not 
subject to the provisions of this section. Utilities, and other 
nonprocess lines, such as heating and cooling systems which do not 
combine their materials with those in the processes they serve, are not 
considered to be part of a process.
    (6) The provisions of this section do not apply to bench-scale 
processes, regardless of whether the processes are located at the same 
plant site as a process subject to the provisions of this subpart.
    (7) Each piece of equipment to which this section applies shall be 
identified such that it can be distinguished readily from equipment that 
is not subject to this section. Identification of the equipment does not 
require physical tagging of the equipment. For example, the equipment 
may be identified on a plant site plan, in log entries, or by 
designation of process boundaries by some form of weatherproof 
identification. If changes are made to the affected source subject to 
the leak detection requirements, equipment identification for each type 
of component shall be updated, if needed, within 15 calendar days of the 
end of each monitoring period for that component.
    (8) Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the 
requirements of this section.
    (9) Equipment that is in organic HAP service, but is in such service 
less than 300 hours per calendar year, is excluded from the requirements 
of this section if it is identified as required in paragraph (g)(9) of 
this section.
    (10) When each leak is detected by visual, audible, or olfactory 
means, or by monitoring as described in Sec. 63.180(b) or (c), the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) A weatherproof and readily visible identification, marked with 
the equipment identification number, shall be attached to the leaking 
equipment.
    (ii) The identification on a valve or connector in light liquid or 
gas/vapor service may be removed after it has been monitored as 
specified in paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section and Sec. 63.174(e), 
and no leak has been detected during the follow-up monitoring.
    (iii) The identification on equipment, except on a valve or 
connector in light liquid or gas/vapor service, may be removed after it 
has been repaired.

    (i) Section 63.164, Compressors;
    (ii) Section 63.165, Pressure relief devices in gas/vapor service;
    (iii) Section 63.166, Sampling connection systems;
    (iv) Section 63.169, Pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators in 
heavy liquid service; instrumentation systems; and pressure relief 
devices in liquid service;
    (v) Section 63.171, Delay of repair, shall apply except 
Sec. 63.171(a) shall not apply. Instead, delay of repair of equipment 
for which leaks have been detected is allowed if one of the following 
conditions exist:
    (A) The repair is technically infeasible without a process shutdown. 
Repair of this equipment shall occur by the end of the next scheduled 
process shutdown.
    (B) The owner or operator determines that repair personnel would be 
exposed to an immediate danger if attempting to repair without a process 
shutdown. Repair of this equipment shall occur by the end of the next 
scheduled process shutdown.
    (vi) Section 63.172, Closed-vent systems and control devices, for 
closed-vent systems used to comply with this subpart, and for control 
devices used to comply with this section only, except
    (A) Sections 63.172(k) and (l) shall not apply. In place of 
Sec. 63.172(k) and (l), the owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (B) Owners or operators may, instead of complying with the 
provisions of Sec. 63.172(f), design a closed-vent system to operate at 
a pressure below atmospheric pressure. The system shall be equipped with 
at least one pressure gage or other pressure measurement device that can 
be read from a readily accessible location to verify that negative 
pressure is being maintained in the closed-vent system when the 
associated control device is operating.
    (vii) Section 63.174, Connectors, except:
    (A) Sections 63.174(f) and (g) shall not apply. In place of 
Sec. 63.174(f) and (g), the owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (B) Days that the connectors are not in organic HAP service shall 
not be considered part of the 3 month period in Sec. 63.174(e).

percent leaking connectors in the process unit was less than 0.5 
percent, but equal to or greater than 0.25 percent, during the last 
required monitoring period, monitoring shall be performed once every 4 
years. An owner or operator may comply with the requirements of this 
paragraph by monitoring at least 40 percent of the connectors in the 
first 2 years and the remainder of the connectors within the next 2 
years. The percent leaking connectors will be calculated for the total 
of all monitoring performed during the 4 year period.
    (D) Section 63.174(b)(3)(iv) shall not apply. Instead, the owner or 
operator shall increase the monitoring frequency to once every 2 years 
for the next monitoring period if leaking connectors comprise at least 
0.5 percent but less than 1.0 percent of the connectors monitored within 
the 4 years specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(C) of this section or the 
first 4 years specified in Sec. 63.174(b)(3)(iii). At the end of that 2 
year monitoring period, the owner or operator shall monitor once per 
year while the percent leaking connectors is greater than or equal to 
0.5 percent; if the percent leaking connectors is less than 0.5 percent, 
the owner or operator may return to monitoring once every 4 years or may 
monitor in accordance with Sec. 63.174(b)(3)(iii), if appropriate.
    (E) Section 63.174(b)(3)(v) shall not apply. Instead, if an owner or 
operator complying with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(C) and 
(D) of this section or Sec. 63.174 (b)(3)(iii) for a group of processes 
determines that 1 percent or greater of the connectors are leaking, the 
owner or operator shall increase the monitoring frequency to one time 
per year. The owner or operator may again elect to use the provisions

[[Page 84]]

of paragraphs (b)(1)(vii)(C) or (D) of this section after a monitoring 
period in which less than 0.5 percent of the connectors are determined 
to be leaking.
    (F) Section 63.174(b)(3)(iii) shall not apply. Instead, monitoring 
shall be required once every 8 years, if the percent leaking connectors 
in the process unit was less than 0.25 percent during the last required 
monitoring period. An owner or operator shall monitor at least 50 
percent of the connectors in the first 4 years and the remainder of the 
connectors within the next 4 years. If the percent leaking connectors in 
the first 4 years is equal to or greater than 0.35 percent, the 
monitoring program shall revert at that time to the appropriate 
monitoring frequency specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(vii)(C), (D), or (E) 
of this section.
    (viii) Section 63.177, Alternative means of emission limitation: 
General;
    (ix) Section 63.178, Alternative means of emission limitation: Batch 
processes, except that Sec. 63.178(b), requirements for pressure 
testing, shall apply to all processes, not just batch processes;

concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million 
methane for agitators; 2,000 parts per million for pumps; and 500 parts 
per million for all other equipment, except as provided in section 
63.180(b)(4)(iii).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) Standards for Pumps in Light Liquid Service and Agitators in 
Gas/Vapor Service and in Light Liquid Service. (1) The provisions of 
this section apply to each pump that is in light organic HAP liquid 
service, and to each agitator in organic HAP gas/vapor service or in 
light organic HAP liquid service.
    (2)(i) Monitoring. Each pump and agitator subject to this section 
shall be monitored quarterly to detect leaks by the method specified in 
Sec. 63.180(b) of subpart H, except as provided in Sec. 63.177 of 
subpart H, paragraph (f) of this section, and paragraphs (c)(5) through 
(c)(9) of this section.
    (ii) Leak definition. The instrument reading, as determined by the 
method as specified in Sec. 63.180(b), that defines a leak is:
    (A) For agitators, an instrument reading of 10,000 parts per million 
or greater.
    (B) For pumps, an instrument reading of 2,000 parts per million or 
greater.
    (iii) Visual Inspections. Each pump and agitator shall be checked by 
visual inspection each calendar week for indications of liquids dripping 
from the pump or agitator seal. If there are indications of liquids 
dripping from the seal, a leak is detected.
    (3) Repair provisions. (i) When a leak is detected, it shall be 
repaired as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 calendar days 
after it is detected, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this 
section.
    (ii) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 
calendar days after the leak is detected. First attempts at repair 
include, but are not limited to, the following practices where 
practicable:
    (A) Tightening of packing gland nuts.
    (B) Ensuring that the seal flush is operating at design pressure and 
temperature.
    (4) Calculation of percent leakers. (i) The owner or operator shall 
decide no later than the end of the first monitoring period what groups

all subsequent percent calculations shall be made on the same basis.
    (ii) If, calculated on a 1 year rolling average, the greater of 
either 10 percent or three of the pumps in a group of processes leak, 
the owner or operator shall monitor each pump once per month.
    (iii) The number of pumps in a group of processes shall be the sum 
of all the pumps in organic HAP service, except that pumps found leaking 
in a continuous process within 1 quarter after startup of the pump shall 
not count in the percent leaking pumps calculation for that one 
monitoring period only.
    (iv) Percent leaking pumps shall be determined by the following 
Equation 3:


[[Page 85]]


%P<INF>L</INF> = [(P<INF>L</INF>--P<INF>S</INF>)/(P<INF>T</INF>--
P<INF>S</INF>)]  x  100 (Eq. 3)

Where:
%P<INF>L</INF> = percent leaking pumps
P<INF>L</INF> = number of pumps found leaking as determined through 
quarterly monitoring as required in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) 
of this section.
P<INF>T</INF> = total pumps in organic HAP service, including those 
meeting the criteria in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section
PS = number of pumps in a continuous process leaking within 1 quarter of 
startup during the current monitoring period

    (5) Exemptions. Each pump or agitator equipped with a dual 
mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system is exempt

    (A) If there are indications of liquids dripping from the pump/
agitator seal at the time of the weekly inspection, the pump/agitator 
shall be monitored as specified in Sec. 63.180(b) to determine if there 
is a leak of organic HAP in the barrier fluid.
    (B) If an instrument reading of 2,000 parts per million or greater 
is measured for pumps, or 10,000 parts per million or greater is 
measured for agitators, a leak is detected.
    (v) Each sensor as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this 
section is observed daily or is equipped with an alarm unless the pump 
is located within the boundary of an unmanned plant site.
    (vi)(A) The owner or operator determines, based on design 
considerations and operating experience, criteria applicable to the 
presence and frequency of drips and to the sensor that indicate failure 
of the seal system, the barrier fluid system, or both.
    (B) If indications of liquids dripping from the pump/agitator seal 
exceed the criteria established in paragraph (c)(5)(vi)(A) of this 
section, or if, based on the criteria established in paragraph

    (3) Monitoring. The owner or operator of a source subject to this 
section shall monitor all valves, except as provided in paragraph (f) of 
this section and in Sec. 63.177, at the intervals specified in paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section and shall comply with all other provisions of 
this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, 
Sec. 63.178, and Sec. 63.179.
    (i) The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method 
specified in Sec. 63.180(b).
    (ii) An instrument reading of 500 parts per million or greater

    (4) Subsequent monitoring frequencies. After conducting the initial 
survey required in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the owner or 
operator shall monitor valves for leaks at the intervals specified 
below:
    (i) For a group of processes with 2 percent or greater leaking 
valves, calculated according to paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the 
owner or operator shall monitor each valve once per month, except as 
specified in paragraph (e)(9) of this section.
    (ii) For a group of processes with less than 2 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve once each 
quarter, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(4)(iii) through (e)(4)(v) 
of this section.
    (iii) For a group of processes with less than 1 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
2 quarters.
    (iv) For a group of processes with less than 0.5 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
4 quarters.
    (v) For a group of processes with less than 0.25 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
2 years.
    (5) Calculation of percent leakers. For a group of processes to 
which this subpart applies, an owner or operator may

[[Page 87]]

choose to subdivide the valves in the applicable group of processes and 
apply the provisions of paragraph (e)(4) of this section to each 
subgroup. If the owner or operator elects to subdivide the valves in the 
applicable group of processes, then the provisions of paragraphs 
(e)(5)(i) through (e)(5)(viii) of this section apply.
    (i) The overall performance of total valves in the applicable group 
of processes must be less than 2 percent leaking valves, as detected 
according to paragraphs (e)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section and as 
calculated according to paragraphs (e)(6) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section.
    (ii) The initial assignment or subsequent reassignment of valves to 
subgroups shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) 
(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) The owner or operator shall determine which valves are assigned 
to each subgroup. Valves with less than 1 year of monitoring data or 
valves not monitored within the last 12 months must be placed initially 
into the most frequently monitored subgroup until at least 1 year of 
monitoring data has been obtained.
    (B) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a less 
frequently monitored subgroup to a more frequently monitored subgroup 
provided that the valves to be reassigned were monitored during the most 
recent monitoring period for the less frequently monitored subgroup. The 
monitoring results must be included with the less frequently monitored 
subgroup's monitoring event and associated next percent leaking valves 
calculation for that group.
    (C) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a more 
frequently monitored subgroup to a less frequently monitored subgroup 
provided that the valves to be reassigned have not leaked for the period 
of the less frequently monitored subgroup (e.g., for the last 12 months, 
if the valve or group of valves is to be reassigned to a subgroup being 
monitored annually). Nonrepairable valves may not be reassigned to a 
less frequently monitored subgroup.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall determine every 6 months if the 
overall performance of total valves in the applicable group of processes 
is less than 2 percent leaking valves and so indicate the performance in 
the next periodic report. If the overall performance of total valves in 
the applicable group of processes is 2 percent leaking valves or 
greater, the owner or operator shall revert to the program required in 
paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(4) of this section. The overall 
performance of total valves in the applicable group of processes shall 
be calculated as a weighted average of the percent leaking valves of 
each subgroup according to the following Equation 4:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21SE98.002

where:

%V<INF>LO</INF> = overall performance of total valves in the applicable 
process or group of processes
%V<INF>Li</INF> = percent leaking valves in subgroup I, most recent 
value calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs (e)(6) (ii) 
and (iii) of this section
V<INF>i</INF> = number of valves in subgroup I
n = number of subgroups

    (iv) Records. In addition to records required by paragraph (g) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall maintain records specified in 
paragraphs (e)(5)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Which valves are assigned to each subgroup,
    (B) Monitoring results and calculations made for each subgroup for 
each monitoring period,
    (C) Which valves are reassigned and when they were reassigned, and
    (D) The results of the semiannual overall performance calculation 
required in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (v) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later 
than 30 days prior to the beginning of the next monitoring period of the

[[Page 88]]

    (vi) Semiannual reports. In addition to the information required by 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit in 
the periodic reports the information specified in paragraphs 
(e)(5)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) Valve reassignments occurring during the reporting period, and
    (B) Results of the semiannual overall performance calculation 
required by paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (vii) To determine the monitoring frequency for each subgroup, the 
calculation procedures of paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section shall be 
used.
    (viii) Except for the overall performance calculations required by 
paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (e)(5)(iii) of this section, each subgroup 
shall be treated as if it were a process for the purposes of applying 
the provisions of this section.
    (6)(i) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the 
implementation date of this subpart or upon revision of an operating 
permit how to group the processes. Once the owner or operator has 
decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the 
same basis.
    (ii) Percent leaking valves for each group of processes or subgroup 
shall be determined by the following Equation 5:

%V<INF>L</INF> = [V<INF>L</INF>/V<INF>T</INF>]  x  100    (Eq. 5)

Where:

%V<INF>L</INF> = percent leaking valves
V<INF>L</INF> = number of valves found leaking excluding nonrepairables 
as provided in paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(A) of this section
V<INF>T</INF> = total valves monitored, in a monitoring period excluding 
valves monitored as required by (e)(7)(iii) of this section

    (iii) When determining monitoring frequency for each group of 
processes or subgroup subject to monthly, quarterly, or semiannual 
monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the 
arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last two 
monitoring periods. When determining monitoring frequency for each group 
of processes or subgroup subject to annual or biennial (once every 2 
years) monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the 
arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last three 
monitoring periods.
    (iv)(A) Nonrepairable valves shall be included in the calculation of 
percent leaking valves the first time the valve is identified as leaking 
and nonrepairable and as required to comply with paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(B) 
of this section. Otherwise, a number of nonrepairable valves (identified 
and included in the percent leaking calculation in a previous period) up 
to a maximum of 1 percent of the total number of valves in organic HAP 
service at a process may be excluded from calculation of percent leaking 
valves for subsequent monitoring periods.
    (B) If the number of nonrepairable valves exceeds 1 percent of the 
total number of valves in organic HAP service at a process, the number 
of nonrepairable valves exceeding 1 percent of the total number of 
valves in organic HAP service shall be included in the calculation of 
percent leaking valves.
    (7) Repair provisions. (i) When a leak is detected, it shall be 
repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days 
after the leak is detected, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of 
this section.
    (ii) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 
calendar days after each leak is detected.
    (iii) When a leak is repaired, the valve shall be monitored at least 
once within the first 3 months after its repair. Days that the valve is 
not in organic HAP service shall not be considered part of this 3 month 
period.
    (8) First attempts at repair include, but are not limited to, the 
following practices where practicable:
    (i) Tightening of bonnet bolts,
    (ii) Replacement of bonnet bolts,
    (iii) Tightening of packing gland nuts, and
    (iv) Injection of lubricant into lubricated packing.
    (9) Any equipment located at a plant site with fewer than 250 valves 
in organic HAP service in the affected source is exempt from the 
requirements for monthly monitoring specified in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of 
this section. Instead, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve in 
organic

[[Page 89]]

HAP service for leaks once each quarter, or comply with paragraphs 
(e)(4)(iii) or (e)(4)(iv) of this section.
    (f) Unsafe to Monitor, Difficult to Monitor, and Inaccessible 
Equipment. (1) Equipment that is designated as unsafe to monitor, 
difficult to monitor, or inaccessible is exempt from the monitoring 
requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this

    (E) Not able to be accessed at any time in a safe manner to perform 
monitoring. Unsafe access includes, but is not limited to, the use of a 
wheeled scissor-lift on unstable or uneven terrain, the use of a 
motorized man-lift basket in areas where an ignition potential exists, 
or access would require near proximity to hazards such as electrical 
lines, or would risk damage to equipment.
    (ii) At an existing source, any connector, agitator, or valve that 
meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section may be 
designated as inaccessible. At a new affected source, an owner or 
operator may designate no more than 3 percent of each type of equipment 
as inaccessible.
    (iii) If any inaccessible equipment or ceramic or ceramic-lined 
connector is observed by visual, audible, olfactory, or other means to 
be leaking, the leak shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but no 
later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected, except as 
provided in paragraph (g) of this section.

owner or operator may use a combination of the approaches in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section for different affected wastewater 
generated at the source. The owner or operator shall also comply with 
the requirements for multiphase discharges in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section. Wastewater identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is 
exempt from the provisions of this subpart.
    (i) Determine characteristics of a wastewater stream. At new and 
existing sources, a wastewater stream is an affected wastewater stream 
if the annual average concentration and annual load exceed any of the 
criteria specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this 
section. At new sources, a wastewater stream is subject to additional

[[Page 95]]

control requirements if the annual average concentration and annual load 
exceed the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(D) of this 
section. The owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of 
Sec. 63.1257(e)(1) to determine the annual average concentrations and 
annual load of partially soluble and soluble HAP compounds.
    (A) The wastewater stream contains partially soluble HAP compounds 
at an annual average concentration greater than 1,300 ppmw, and the 
total soluble and partially soluble HAP load in all wastewater from the 
PMPU exceeds 1 Mg/yr.
    (B) The wastewater stream contains partially soluble and/or soluble 
HAP compounds at an annual average concentration of 5,200 ppmw, and the 
total soluble and partially soluble HAP load in all wastewater from the 
PMPU exceeds 1 Mg/yr.
    (C) The wastewater stream contains partially soluble and/or soluble 
HAP at an annual average concentration of greater than 10,000 ppmw, and 
the total partially soluble and/or soluble HAP load in all wastewater 
from the affected source is greater than 1 Mg/yr.
    (D) The wastewater stream contains soluble HAP compounds at an 
annual average concentration greater than 110,000 ppmw, and the total 
soluble and partially soluble HAP load in all wastewater from the PMPU 
exceeds 1 Mg/yr.
    (ii) Designate wastewater as affected wastewater. For existing 
sources, the owner or operator may elect to designate wastewater streams 
as meeting the criteria of either paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A),(B), or (C) of 
this section. For new sources, the owner or operator may elect to 
designate wastewater streams meeting the criterion in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(D) or for wastewater known to contain no soluble HAP, as 
meeting the criterion in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. For 
designated wastewater the procedures specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section shall be followed, except as 
specified in paragraphs (g)(8)(i), (g)(9)(i), and (g)(10) of this 
section. The owner or operator is not required to determine the annual 
average concentration or load for each designated wastewater stream for 
the purposes of this section.
    (A) From the POD for the wastewater stream that is designated as an 
affected wastewater stream to the location where the owner or operator 
elects to designate such wastewater stream as an affected wastewater 
stream, the owner or operator shall comply with all applicable emission 
suppression requirements specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section.
    (B) From the location where the owner or operator designates a 
wastewater stream as an affected wastewater stream, such wastewater 
stream shall be managed in accordance with all applicable emission 
suppression requirements specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section and with the treatment requirements in paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (iii) Scrubber Effluent. Effluent from a water scrubber that has 
been used to control Table 2 HAP-containing vent streams that are 
controlled in order to meet the process vent requirements in 
Sec. 63.1254 of this subpart is considered an affected wastewater 
stream.
    (2) Requirements for affected wastewater. (i) An owner or operator 
of a facility shall comply with the applicable requirements for 
wastewater tanks, surface impoundments, containers, individual drain 
systems, and oil/water separators as specified in paragraphs (b) through 
(f) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section.
    (ii) Comply with the applicable requirements for control of soluble 
and partially soluble compounds as specified in paragraph (g) of this 
section. Alternatively, the owner or operator may elect to comply with 
the treatment provisions specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (iii) Comply with the applicable monitoring and inspection 
requirements specified in Sec. 63.1258.
    (iv) Comply with the applicable recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements specified in Secs. 63.1259 and 63.1260.

shall not discharge a separate phase that can be isolated through 
gravity separation from the aqueous phase to a waste management or 
treatment unit, unless the stream is discharged to a treatment unit in 
compliance with paragraph (g)(13) of this section.
    (5) Offsite treatment or onsite treatment not owned or operated by 
the source. The owner or operator may elect to transfer affected 
wastewater streams that contain less than 50 ppmw of partially soluble 
HAP or a residual removed from such affected wastewater to an onsite 
treatment operation not owned or operated by the owner or operator of 
the source generating the wastewater or residual, or to an offsite 
treatment operation, provided that the waste management units up to the 
activated sludge unit are covered or the owner or operator demonstrates 
that less than 5 percent of the total soluble HAP is emitted from the 
these units.
    (i) The owner or operator transferring the wastewater or residual 
shall:
    (A) Comply with the provisions specified in paragraphs (b) through 
(f) of this section for each waste management unit that receives or 
manages affected wastewater or a residual removed from affected 
wastewater prior to shipment or transport.
    (B) Include a notice with each shipment or transport of affected 
wastewater or residual removed from affected wastewater. The notice 
shall state that the affected wastewater or residual contains organic 
HAP that are to be treated in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart. When the transport is continuous or ongoing (for example, 
discharge to a publicly-owned treatment works), the notice shall be 
submitted to the treatment operator initially and whenever there is a 
change in the required treatment. The owner or operator shall keep a 
record of the notice in accordance with Sec. 63.1259(g).
    (ii) The owner or operator may not transfer the affected wastewater 
or residual unless the transferee has submitted to the EPA a written 
certification that the transferee will manage and treat any affected 
wastewater or residual removed from affected wastewater received from a 
source subject to the requirements of this subpart in accordance with 
the requirements of either:
    (A) Paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section; or
    (B) Subpart D of this part if alternative emission limitations have 
been granted the transferor in accordance with those provisions; or
    (C) Section 63.6(g).
    (iii) The certifying entity may revoke the written certification by 
sending a written statement to the EPA and the owner or operator giving 
at least 90 days notice that the certifying entity is rescinding 
acceptance of responsibility for compliance with the regulatory 
provisions listed in this paragraph. Upon expiration of the notice 
period, the owner or operator may not transfer the wastewater stream or 
residual to the treatment operation.
    (iv) By providing this written certification to the EPA, the 
certifying entity accepts responsibility for compliance with the 
regulatory provisions listed in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section 
with respect to any shipment of wastewater or residual covered by the 
written certification. Failure to abide by any of those provisions with 
respect to such shipments may result in enforcement action by the EPA 
against the certifying entity in accordance with the enforcement 
provisions applicable to violations of these provisions by owners or 
operators of sources.
    (v) Written certifications and revocation statements, to the EPA 
from the transferees of wastewater or residuals shall be signed by the 
responsible official of the certifying entity, provide the name and 
address of the certifying entity, and be sent to the appropriate EPA 
Regional Office at the addresses listed in Sec. 63.13. Such written

    (i) For individual drain systems, improper work practice includes, 
but is not limited to, leaving open any access hatch or other opening 
when such hatch or opening is not in use for sampling or removal, or for 
equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.
    (ii) For individual drain systems, control equipment failure 
includes, but is not limited to, any time a joint, lid, cover, or door 
has a gap or crack, or is broken.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, when an 
improper

[[Page 102]]

work practice or a control equipment failure is identified, first 
efforts at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after 
identification and repair shall be completed within 15 calendar days 
after identification.
    (4) If the owner or operator elects to comply with this paragraph, 
the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs 
(e)(4) (i) through (iii) of this section:
    (i) Each drain shall be equipped with water seal controls or a 
tightly fitting cap or plug. The owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) For each drain equipped with a water seal, the owner or operator 
shall ensure that the water seal is maintained. For example, a flow-
monitoring device indicating positive flow from a main to a branch water 
line supplying a trap or water being continuously dripped into the trap 
by a hose could be used to verify flow of water to the trap. Visual 
observation is also an acceptable alternative.
    (B) If a water seal is used on a drain receiving affected 
wastewater, the owner or operator shall either extend the pipe 
discharging the wastewater below the liquid surface in the water seal of 
the receiving drain, or install a flexible shield (or other enclosure 
which restricts wind motion across the open area between the pipe and 
the drain) that encloses the space between the pipe discharging the 
wastewater to the drain receiving the wastewater. (Water seals which are 
used on hubs receiving wastewater that is not subject to the provisions 
of this subpart for the purpose of eliminating cross ventilation to 
drains carrying affected wastewater are not required to have a flexible 
cap or extended subsurface discharging pipe.)
    (ii) Each junction box shall be equipped with a tightly fitting 
solid cover (i.e., no visible gaps, cracks, or holes) which shall be 
kept in place at all times except during inspection and maintenance. If 
the junction box is vented, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
requirements in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) The junction box shall be vented to a process or through a 
closed-vent system to a control device. The closed-vent system shall be 
inspected in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 63.1258(h) and the 
control device shall be designed, operated, and inspected in accordance 
with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (B) If the junction box is filled and emptied by gravity flow (i.e., 
there is no pump) or is operated with no more than slight fluctuations 
in the liquid level, the owner or operator may vent the junction box to 
the atmosphere provided that the junction box complies with the 
requirements in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii)(B) (1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) The vent pipe shall be at least 90 centimeters in length and no 
greater than 10.2 centimeters in nominal inside diameter.
    (2) Water seals shall be installed and maintained at the wastewater 
entrance(s) to or exit from the junction box restricting ventilation in 
the individual drain system and between components in the individual 
drain system. The owner or operator shall demonstrate (e.g., by visual 
inspection or smoke test) upon request by the Administrator that the 
junction box water seal is properly designed and restricts ventilation.
    (iii) Each sewer line shall not be open to the atmosphere and shall 
be covered or enclosed in a manner so as to have no visible gaps or 
cracks in joints, seals, or other emission interfaces. (Note: This 
provision applies to sewers located inside and outside of buildings.)
    (5) Equipment used to comply with paragraphs (e)(4) (i), (ii), or 
(iii) of this section shall be inspected as follows:
    (i) Each drain using a tightly fitting cap or plug shall be visually 
inspected initially, and semiannually thereafter, to ensure caps or 
plugs are in place and that there are no gaps, cracks, or other holes in 
the cap or plug.
    (ii) Each junction box shall be visually inspected initially, and 
semiannually thereafter, to ensure that there are no gaps, cracks, or 
other holes in the cover.
    (iii) The unburied portion of each sewer line shall be visually 
inspected initially, and semiannually thereafter,

[[Page 103]]

for indication of cracks or gaps that could result in air emissions.
    (6) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, when a gap, 
hole, or crack is identified in a joint or cover, first efforts at 
repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after identification, 
and repair shall be completed within 15 calendar days after 
identification.
    (f) Oil-water separators. For each oil-water separator that 
receives, manages, or treats affected wastewater or a residual removed 
from affected wastewater, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (6) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall maintain one of the following:

    (g) Performance standards for treatment processes managing 
wastewater and/or residuals removed from wastewater. This section 
specifies the performance standards for treating affected wastewater. 
The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements as specified in 
paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section. Where multiple compliance 
options are provided, the options may be used in combination for 
different wastewater and/or for different compounds (e.g., soluble 
versus partially soluble compounds) in the same wastewater, except where 
otherwise provided in this section. Once affected wastewater or a 
residual removed from affected wastewater has been treated in accordance 
with this subpart, it is no longer subject to the requirements of this 
subpart.
    (1) Existing source. For a wastewater stream at an existing source 
that exceeds or is designated to exceed the concentration and load 
criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the owner or 
operator shall comply with a control option in paragraph (g)(8) of this 
section. For a wastewater stream at an existing source that exceeds the

    (3) Biological treatment processes. Biological treatment processes 
in compliance with this section may be either open or closed biological 
treatment processes as defined in Sec. 63.1251. An open biological 
treatment process in compliance with this section need not be covered 
and vented to a control device. An open or a closed biological treatment 
process in compliance with this section and using 
Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) to demonstrate compliance is not 
subject to the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. A 
closed biological treatment process in compliance with this section and 
using Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii)(G) to demonstrate compliance shall comply

management units upstream of an open or closed biological treatment 
process shall meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of 
this section, as applicable.
    (4) Performance tests and design evaluations. If the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) option [paragraph (g)(13) of this 
section] or the enhanced biological treatment process for soluble HAP 
compounds option [paragraph (g)(10) of this section] is selected to 
comply with this section, neither a design evaluation nor a performance 
test is required. For any other nonbiological treatment process, and for 
closed biological treatment processes as defined in Sec. 63.1251, the 
owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation as specified 
in Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(ii) or performance test as specified in 
Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii). For each open biological treatment process as 
defined in Sec. 63.1251, the owner or operator shall conduct a 
performance test as specified in Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F).
    (5) Control device requirements. When gases are vented from the 
treatment process, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
applicable control device requirements specified in paragraph (h) of 
this section and Sec. 63.1257(e)(3), and the applicable leak inspection 
provisions specified in Sec. 63.1258(h). This requirement is in addition 
to the requirements for treatment systems specified in paragraphs (g)(8) 
through (14) of this section. This requirement does not apply to any 
open biological treatment process that meets the mass removal 
requirements.
    (6) Residuals: general. When residuals result from treating affected 
wastewater, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements for 
residuals specified in paragraph (g)(14) of this section.
    (7) Treatment using a series of treatment processes. In all cases 
where the wastewater provisions in this subpart allow or require the use 
of a treatment process or control device to comply with emissions 
limitations, the owner or operator may use multiple treatment processes 
or control devices, respectively. For combinations of treatment 
processes where the wastewater stream is conveyed by hard-piping, the 
owner or operator shall comply with either the requirements of paragraph 
(g)(7)(i) or (ii) of this section. For combinations of treatment 
processes where the wastewater stream is not conveyed by hard-piping, 
the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraph 
(g)(7)(ii) of this section. For combinations of control devices, the 
owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraph 
(g)(7)(i) of this section.
    (i) Compliance across the combination of all treatment units or 
control devices in series. (A) For combinations of treatment processes, 
the wastewater stream shall be conveyed by hard-piping between the 
treatment processes. For combinations of control devices, the vented gas 
stream shall be conveyed by hard-piping between the control devices.
    (B) For combinations of treatment processes, each treatment process 
shall meet the applicable requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of 
this section, except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
    (C) The owner or operator shall identify, and keep a record of, the 
combination of treatment processes or of control devices, including 
identification of the first and last treatment process or control 
device. The owner or operator shall include this information as part of 
the treatment process description reported in the Notification of 
Compliance Status.

[[Page 106]]

    (D) The performance test or design evaluation shall determine 
compliance across the combination of treatment processes or control 
devices. If a performance test is conducted, the ``inlet'' shall be the 
point at which the wastewater stream or residual enters the first 
treatment process, or the vented gas stream enters the first control 
device. The ``outlet'' shall be the point at which the treated 
wastewater stream exits the last treatment process, or the vented gas 
stream exits the last control device.
    (ii) Compliance across individual units. (A) For combinations of 
treatment processes, each treatment process shall meet the applicable 
requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section except as 
provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
    (B) The owner or operator shall identify, and keep a record of, the 
combination of treatment processes, including identification of the 
first and last treatment process. The owner or operator shall include 
this information as part of the treatment process description reported 
in the Notification of Compliance Status report.
    (C) The owner or operator shall determine the mass removed or 
destroyed by each treatment process. The performance test or design 
evaluation shall determine compliance for the combination of treatment 
processes by adding together the mass removed or destroyed by each 
treatment process and determine the overall control efficiency of the 
treatment system.
    (8) Control options: Wastewater containing partially soluble HAP 
compounds. The owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph 
(g)(8)(i) or (ii) of this section for the control of partially soluble

soluble HAP. The owner or operator may elect to treat affected 
wastewater streams containing soluble HAP and less than

[[Page 107]]

50 ppmw partially soluble HAP in an enhanced biological treatment 
system, as defined in Sec. 63.1251. This option shall not be used when 
the wastewater is designated as an affected wastewater as specified in 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. These treatment processes are 
exempt from the design evaluation or performance tests requirements 
specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
    (11) 95-percent mass reduction option, for biological treatment 
processes. The owner or operator of a new or existing source using 
biological treatment for any affected wastewater shall reduce the mass 
of total soluble and partially soluble HAP sent to that biological 
treatment unit by at least 95 percent. All wastewater as defined in 
Sec. 63.1251 entering such a biological treatment unit from PMPU's

destroy at least 95-percent total mass of all soluble and partially 
soluble HAP compounds.
    (ii) For open biological treatment processes, compliance shall be 
determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii)(E). 
For closed aerobic biological treatment processes compliance shall be 
determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii)(E) 
or (G). For closed anaerobic biological treatment processes compliance 
shall be determined using the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii)(G).
    (iii) For each treatment process or waste management unit that 
receives, manages, or treats wastewater subject to this paragraph, from 
the POD to the biological treatment unit, the owner or operator shall 
comply with paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section for control of 
air emissions. When complying with this paragraph, the term affected 
wastewater in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section shall mean all 
wastewater from PMPU's, not just affected wastewater.
    (iv) If wastewater is in compliance with the requirements in 
paragraph (g)(8), (9), or (12) of this section before entering the 
biological treatment unit, the hazardous air pollutants mass of that 
wastewater is not required to be included in the total mass flow rate 
entering the biological treatment unit for the purpose of demonstrating 
compliance.
    (12) Percent mass removal/destruction option for soluble HAP 
compounds at new sources. The owner or operator of a new source shall 
reduce, by removal or destruction, the mass flow rate of total soluble 
HAP from affected wastewater by 99 percent or more. The removal/
destruction efficiency shall be determined by the procedures in 
Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii)(C), for noncombustion, nonbiological treatment 
processes; Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii)(D), for combustion processes; and 
Sec. 63.1257(e)(2)(iii)(F) or (G) for biological treatment processes.
    (13) Treatment in a RCRA unit option. The owner or operator shall 
treat the affected wastewater or residual in a unit identified in, and

TOC concentration of 20 ppmv. The 20 ppmv performance standard is not 
applicable to compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (c) or (d) of 
this section.
    (iii) A flare shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.11(b).
    (iv) A scrubber, alone or in combination with other control devices, 
shall reduce the organic HAP emissions in such a manner that 95 weight-
percent is either removed, or destroyed by chemical reaction with the 
scrubbing liquid, or achieve an outlet TOC concentration of 20 ppmv. The 
20 ppmv performance standard is not applicable to compliance with the 
provisions of paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section.
    (v) Any other control device used shall, alone or in combination 
with other control devices, reduce the organic HAP emissions vented to 
the control device by 95 percent by weight or greater or achieve an 
outlet TOC

concentration of 20 ppmv. The 20 ppmv performance standard is not 
applicable to compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (c) or (d) of 
this section.
    (3) If the control device is a combustion device, the owner or 
operator shall comply with the requirements in Sec. 63.1252(g) to 
control halogenated vent streams.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if gaps, 
cracks, tears, or holes are observed in ductwork, piping, or connections 
to covers and control devices during an inspection, a first effort to 
repair shall be made as soon as practical but no later than 5 calendar 
days after identification. Repair shall be completed no later than 15 
calendar days after identification or discovery of the defect.
    (i) Delay of repair. Delay of repair of equipment for which a 
control equipment failure or a gap, crack, tear, or hole has been 
identified, is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a 
shutdown, as defined in Sec. 63.1251, or if the owner or operator 
determines that emissions of purged material from immediate repair would 
be greater than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. 
Repair of this equipment shall occur by the end of the next shutdown.
    (1) Delay of repair of equipment for which a control equipment 
failure or a gap, crack, tear, or hole has been identified, is allowed 
if the equipment is emptied or is no longer used to treat or manage 
affected wastewater or residuals removed from affected wastewater.
    (2) Delay of repair of equipment for which a control equipment 
failure or a gap, crack, tear, or hole has been identified is also 
allowed if additional time is necessary due to the unavailability of 
parts beyond the control of the owner or operator. Repair shall be 
completed as soon as practical. The owner or operator who uses this 
provision shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.1259(h) to 
document the reasons that the delay of repair was necessary.

Sec. 63.1257   Test methods and compliance procedures.

    (a) General. Except as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section, the procedures specified in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) 
of this section are required to demonstrate initial compliance with 
Secs. 63.1253, 63.1254, 63.1256, and 63.1252(e), respectively. The 
provisions in paragraphs (a) (2) through (3) apply to performance tests 
that are specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section. The 
provisions in paragraph (a)(5) of this section are used to demonstrate 
initial compliance with the alternative standards specified in 
Secs. 63.1253(d) and 63.1254(c). The provisions in paragraph (a)(6) of 
this section are used to comply with the outlet concentration 
requirements specified in Secs. 63.1253(c), 63.1254 (a)(2)(i) and 
(a)(3)(ii)(B), 63.1254(b)(i) and 63.1256(h)(2).
    (1) Design evaluation. To demonstrate that a control device meets 
the required control efficiency, a design evaluation must address the 
composition and organic HAP concentration of the vent stream entering 
the control device. A design evaluation also must address other vent 
stream characteristics and control device operating parameters as 
specified in any one of paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (vi) of this 
section, depending on the type of control device that is used. If the 
vent stream is not the only inlet to the control device, the efficiency 
demonstration also must consider all other vapors, gases, and liquids, 
other than fuels, received by the control device.
    (i) For an enclosed combustion device used to comply with the 
provisions of 63.1253 (b)(2) or (c)(2), or 63.1256(h)(2)(i)(C) with a 
minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum temperature of 
760 deg.C, the design evaluation must document that these conditions 
exist.
    (ii) For a combustion control device that does not satisfy the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the design evaluation 
must document control efficiency and address the following 
characteristics, depending on the type of control device:
    (A) For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must 
consider the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, must consider 
the vent stream flow rate, and must establish the design minimum and 
average temperature in the combustion zone and the combustion zone 
residence time.

[[Page 110]]

    (B) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design evaluation shall 
consider the vent stream flow rate and shall establish the design 
minimum and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and 
outlet.
    (C) For a boiler or process heater, the design evaluation shall 
consider the vent stream flow rate; shall establish the design minimum 
and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time; 
and shall describe the method and location where the vent stream is 
introduced into the flame zone.
    (iii) For a condenser, the design evaluation shall consider the vent 
stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish 
the design outlet organic HAP compound concentration level, design 
average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design 
average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and 
outlet. The temperature of the gas stream exiting the condenser must be 
measured and used to establish the outlet organic HAP concentration.
    (iv) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed 
directly onsite in the control device such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the 
design evaluation shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative 
humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent 
stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, 
number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of 
activated carbon used for carbon beds, design total regeneration stream 
mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed 
regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, 
design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of carbon. 
For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop shall be included.
    (v) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the 
carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a carbon 
canister, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream mass or 
volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall 
establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration 
level, capacity of carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated 
carbon used for carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based 
on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source 
operating schedule.
    (vi) For a scrubber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent 
stream composition; constituent concentrations; liquid-to-vapor ratio; 
scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration; temperature; and the 
reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The 
design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic 
compound concentration level and will include the additional information 
in paragraphs (a)(1)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section for trays and a 
packed column scrubber.
    (A) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays;
    (B) Type and total surface area of packing for entire column, and 
for individual packed sections if column contains more than one packed 
section.
    (2) Calculation of TOC or total organic HAP concentration. The TOC 
concentration or total organic HAP concentration is the sum of the 
concentrations of the individual components. If compliance is being 
determined based on TOC, the owner or operator shall compute TOC for 
each run using Equation 6 of this subpart. If compliance with the 
wastewater provisions is being determined based on total organic HAP, 
the owner or operator shall compute total organic HAP using Equation 6 
of this subpart, except that only the organic HAP compounds shall be 
summed; when determining compliance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this 
section, only the soluble and partially soluble HAP compounds shall be 
summed.

    (3) Percent oxygen correction for combustion control devices. If the 
control device is a combustion device, the TOC or total organic HAP 
concentrations must be corrected to 3 percent oxygen. The integrated 
sampling and analysis procedures of Method 3B of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A shall be used to determine the actual oxygen concentration 
(%0<INF>2d</INF>). The samples shall be taken during the same time that 
the TOC or total organic HAP samples are taken. The concentration 
corrected to 3 percent oxygen (C<INF>d</INF>) shall be computed using 
Equation 7 of this subpart:

where:

C<INF>c</INF> = concentration of TOC or total organic HAP corrected to 3 
percent oxygen, dry basis, ppmv
C<INF>m</INF> = total concentration of TOC in vented gas stream, average 
of samples, dry basis, ppmv
%0<INF>2d</INF> = concentration of oxygen measured in vented gas stream, 
dry basis, percent by volume

    (4) Exemptions from compliance demonstrations. An owner or operator 
using any control device specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) 
of this section is exempt from the initial compliance provisions in 
paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
    (i) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 
44 megawatts or greater.
    (ii) A boiler or process heater into which the emission stream is 
introduced with the primary fuel.
    (iii) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which 
the owner or operator:
    (A) Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and

    (B) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 
40 CFR part 266, subpart H.
    (iv) A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator 
has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with 
the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified 
compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, 
subpart O.
    (5) Initial compliance with alternative standard. Initial compliance 
with the alternative standards in Secs. 63.1253(d) and 63.1254(c) is 
demonstrated when the outlet TOC concentration is 20 ppmv or less, and 
the outlet hydrogen halide and halogen concentration is 20 ppmv or less. 
To demonstrate initial compliance, the owner or operator shall be in 
compliance with the monitoring provisions in Sec. 63.1258(b)(5) on the 
initial compliance date. The owner or operator shall use Method 18 to 
determine the predominant organic HAP in the emission stream if the TOC 
monitor is calibrated on the predominant HAP.
    (6) Initial compliance with the 20 ppmv outlet limit. Initial 
compliance with the 20 ppmv TOC and hydrogen halide and halogen 
concentration is demonstrated when the outlet TOC concentration is 20 
ppmv or less, and the outlet hydrogen halide and halogen concentration 
is 20 ppmv or less. To demonstrate initial compliance, the operator 
shall use test methods described in paragraph (b) of this section. The 
owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring provisions in 
Sec. 63.1258(b)(1) through (5) of this subpart on the initial compliance 
date.
    (b) Test methods. When testing is conducted to measure emissions 
from an affected source, the test methods specified in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (10) of this section shall be used.
    (1) EPA Method 1 or 1A of appendix A of part 60 is used for sample 
and velocity traverses.
    (2) EPA Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of part 60 is used for 
velocity and volumetric flow rates.
    (3) EPA Method 3 of appendix A of part 60 is used for gas analysis.
    (4) EPA Method 4 of appendix A of part 60 is used for stack gas 
moisture.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Concentration measurements shall be adjusted to negate the 
dilution effects of introducing nonaffected gaseous streams into the 
vent streams prior to control or measurement. The following methods are 
specified for concentration measurements:

[[Page 112]]

    (i) Method 18 may be used to determine HAP concentration in any 
control device efficiency determination.
    (ii) Method 25 of appendix A of part 60 may be used to determine 
total gaseous nonmethane organic concentration for control efficiency 
determinations in combustion devices.
    (iii) Method 26 of appendix A of part 60 shall be used to determine 
hydrogen chloride concentrations in control device efficiency 
determinations or in the 20 ppmv outlet hydrogen halide concentration 
standard.
    (iv) Method 25A of appendix A of part 60 may be used to determine 
the HAP or TOC concentration for control device efficiency 
determinations under the conditions specified in Method 25 of appendix A 
for direct measurement of an effluent with a flame ionization detector, 
or in demonstrating compliance with the 20 ppmv TOC outlet standard. If 
Method 25A is used to determine the concentration of TOC for the 20 ppmv 
standard, the instrument shall be calibrated on methane or the 
predominant HAP. If calibrating on the predominant HAP, the use of 
Method 25A shall comply with paragraphs (b)(6)(iv)(A) through (C) of 
this section.
    (A) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be the single organic HAP representing 
the largest percent by volume.
    (B) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is acceptable 
if the response from the high level calibration gas is at least 20 times 
the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas 
when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.
    (C) The span value of the analyzer must be less than 100 ppmv.
    (7) Testing conditions for continuous processes. Testing of 
emissions on equipment operating as part of a continuous process will 
consist of three l-hour runs. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be 
measured every 15 minutes during each 1-hour run. The HAP concentration 
shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over 
the duration of each l-hour test run, or from grab samples collected 
simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an 
integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling 
rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow 
rate. For continuous gas streams, the emission rate used to determine 
compliance shall be the average emission rate of the three test runs.
    (8) Testing and compliance determination conditions for batch 
processes. Testing of emissions on equipment where the flow of gaseous 
emissions is intermittent (batch operations) shall be conducted as 
specified in paragraphs (b)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(9) of this section for 
condensers, testing shall be conducted at absolute worst-case conditions 
or hypothetical worst-case conditions. Gas stream volumetric flow rates 
shall be measured at 15-minute intervals. The HAP or TOC concentration 
shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over 
the duration of the test, or from grab samples collected simultaneously 
with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an integrated 
sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be 
adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. The absolute 
worst-case or hypothetical worst-case conditions shall be characterized 
by the criteria presented in paragraphs (b)(8)(i)(A) and (B)of this 
section. In all cases, a site-specific plan shall be submitted to the 
Administrator for approval prior to testing in accordance with 
Sec. 63.7(c) and Sec. 63.1260(l). The test plan shall include the 
emission profile described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (A) Absolute worst-case conditions are defined by the criteria 
presented in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(A)(1) or (2) of this section if the 
maximum load is the most challenging condition for the control device. 
Otherwise, absolute worst-case conditions are defined by the conditions 
in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(A)(3) of this section.
    (1) The period in which the inlet to the control device will contain 
at least 50 percent of the maximum HAP load (in lb) capable of being 
vented to the control device over any 8 hour period. An emission profile 
as described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(A) of this section

[[Page 113]]

shall be used to identify the 8-hour period that includes the maximum 
projected HAP load.
    (2) A 1-hour period of time in which the inlet to the control device 
will contain the highest HAP mass loading rate, in lb/hr, capable of 
being vented to the control device. An emission profile as described in 
paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(A) of this section shall be used to identify the 1-
hour period of maximum HAP loading.
    (3) The period of time when the HAP loading or stream composition 
(including non-HAP) is most challenging for the control device. These 
conditions include, but are not limited to the following:
    (i) Periods when the stream contains the highest combined VOC and 
HAP load, in lb/hr, described by the emission profiles in (b)(8)(ii);
    (ii) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach 
limits of solubility for scrubbing media;
    (iii) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that 
approach limits of adsorptivity for carbon adsorption systems.
    (B) Hypothetical worst-case conditions are simulated test conditions 
that, at a minimum, contain the highest hourly HAP load of emissions 
that would be predicted to be vented to the control device from the 
emissions profile described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(B) or (C) of this 
section.
    (ii) Emissions profile. The owner or operator may choose to perform 
tests only during those periods of the worst-case conditions that the 
owner or operator selects to control as part of achieving the required 
emission reduction. The owner or operator must develop an emission 
profile for the vent to the control device that describes the 
characteristics of the vent stream at the inlet to the control device 
under worst case conditions. The emission profile shall be developed 
based on any one of the procedures described in (b)(8)(ii)(A) through 
(C) of this section, as required by paragraph (b)(8)(i).
    (A) Emission profile by process. The emission profile must consider 
all emission episodes that could contribute to the vent stack for a 
period of time that is sufficient to include all processes venting to 
the stack and shall consider production scheduling. The profile shall 
describe the HAP load to the device that equals the highest sum of 
emissions from the episodes that can vent to the control device in any 
given hour. Emissions per episode shall be calculated using the 
procedures specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Emissions per 
episode shall be divided by the duration of the episode only if the 
duration of the episode is longer than 1 hour.
    (B) Emission profile by equipment. The emission profile must consist 
of emissions that meet or exceed the highest emissions, in lb/hr, that 
would be expected under actual processing conditions. The profile shall 
describe equipment configurations used to generate the emission events, 
volatility of materials processed in the equipment, and the rationale 
used to identify and characterize the emission events. The emissions may 
be based on using a compound more volatile than compounds actually used 
in the process(es), and the emissions may be generated from all 
equipment in the process(es) or only selected equipment.
    (C) Emission profile by capture and control device limitation. The 
emission profile shall consider the capture and control system 
limitations and the highest emissions, in lb/hr, that can be routed to 
the control device, based on maximum flowrate and concentrations 
possible because of limitations on conveyance and control equipment 
(e.g., fans, LEL alarms and safety bypasses).
    (iii) Three runs, at a minimum of 1 hour each and a maximum of 8 
hours each, are required for performance testing. Each run must occur 
over the same worst-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(i) 
of this section.
    (9) Testing requirements for condensers. For emission streams 
controlled using condensers, continuous direct measurement of condenser 
outlet gas temperature to be used in determining concentrations per the 
design evaluation described in Sec. 63.1257(a)(1)(iii) is required.
    (10) Wastewater testing. Wastewater analysis shall be conducted in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(10)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this 
section.
    (i) Method 305. Use procedures specified in Method 305 of 40 CFR

and comply with requirements in paragraph (b)(10)(v) of this section.
    (iii) Other EPA Methods. Use procedures specified in the method, 
validate the method using the procedures in paragraph (b)(10)(iii)(A) or 
(B) of this section, and comply with the procedures in paragraph 
(b)(10)(v) of this section.
    (A) Validate the method according to section 5.1 or 5.3 of Method 
301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A.
    (B) Follow the procedure as specified in ``Alternative Validation 
Procedure for EPA Waste Methods'' 40 CFR part 63, appendix D.
    (iv) Methods other than an EPA method. Use procedures specified in 
the method, validate the method using the procedures in paragraph 
(b)(10)(iii)(A) of this section, and comply with the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(10)(v) of this section.
    (v) Sampling plan. The owner or operator shall prepare a sampling 
plan. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures 
which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and 
analysis and maintain sample integrity. The sample plan shall include 
procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the relevant partially 
soluble and soluble HAP compounds. An example of an acceptable sampling 
plan would be one that incorporates similar sampling and sample handling 
requirements to those of Method 25D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The 
sampling plan shall be maintained at the facility.
    (c) Initial compliance with storage tank provisions. The owner or 
operator of an affected storage tank shall demonstrate initial 
compliance with Sec. 63.1253(b) or (c), as applicable, by fulfilling the 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1),or (c)(2), or (c)(3) of this section.
    (1) Performance test. If this option is chosen to demonstrate 
initial compliance with the percent reduction requirement of 
Sec. 63.1253(b)(1) or (c)(1)(i), the efficiency of the control device 
shall be calculated using performance test data as specified in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. Initial compliance 
with the outlet concentration requirement of Sec. 63.1253(b)(2) or 
(c)(1)(ii) is demonstrated by fulfilling the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section.
    (i) Equations 8 and 9 of this subpart shall be used to calculate the

    (iii) A performance test is not required to be conducted if the 
control device used to comply with Sec. 63.1253 (storage tank 
provisions) is also used to comply with Sec. 63.1254 (process vent 
provisions), and compliance with Sec. 63.1254 has been demonstrated in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Design evaluation. If this option is chosen to demonstrate 
initial compliance with the percent reduction requirement of 
Sec. 63.1253(b) or (c), a design evaluation shall be prepared in 
accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The 
design evaluation shall include documentation demonstrating that the 
control device being used achieves the required control efficiency 
during reasonably expected maximum filling rate.

    (ii) Large control devices. Except for condensers, controlled 
emissions for each process vent that is controlled using a large control 
device shall be determined by applying the control efficiency of the 
large control device to the estimated uncontrolled emissions. The 
control efficiency shall be determined by conducting a performance test 
on the control device as described in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) through 
(C) of this section, or by using the results of a previous performance 
test as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. If the control 
device is intended to control only hydrogen halides and halogens, the 
owner or operator may assume the control efficiency of organic HAP is 
zero percent. If the control device is intended to control only organic 
HAP, the owner or operator may assume the control efficiency for 
hydrogen halides and halogen is zero percent. Owners and operators are 
not required to conduct performance tests for devices described in 
paragraphs (a)(4) and (d)(4) of this section that are large control 
devices, as defined in Sec. 63.1251.
    (A) The performance test shall be conducted by performing emission 
testing on the inlet and outlet, or, if complying with the provisions of 
Sec. 63.1254(c), on the outlet of the control device, following the test 
methods and procedures of Sec. 63.1257(b). Concentrations shall be 
calculated from the data obtained through emission testing according to 
the procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the control 
device is a combustion device that uses supplemental combustion air, the 
concentrations shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen according to the 
procedures in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (B) Performance testing shall be conducted under absolute, or 
hypothetical worst-case conditions, as defined in paragraphs 
(b)(8)(i)(A) through (B) of this section.
    (C) The owner or operator may elect to conduct more than one 
performance test on the control device for the purpose of establishing 
more than one operating condition at which the control device achieves 
the required control efficiency.
    (4) An owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance 
test for the following:
    (i) Any control device for which a previous performance test was 
conducted, provided the test was conducted using the same procedures 
specified in Sec. 63.1257(b) over conditions typical of the appropriate 
worst-case, as defined in Sec. 63.1257(b)(8)(i). The results of the 
previous performance test shall be used to demonstrate compliance.
    (e) Compliance with wastewater provisions. (1) Determining annual 
average concentration and annual load. To determine the annual average 
concentration and annual load of partially soluble and/or soluble HAP 
compounds in a wastewater stream, as required by Sec. 63.1256(a)(1), an 
owner or operator shall comply with the provisions in paragraphs 
(e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. A wastewater stream is exempt 
from the requirements of Sec. 63.1256(a)(2) if the owner or operator 
determines the annual average concentration and annual load are below 
all of the applicability cutoffs specified in Sec. 63.1256(a)(1)(i)(A) 
through (D). For annual average concentration, only initial rinses are 
included. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 shall be 
adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm 
factor listed in Table 8 of this subpart. Concentration measurements 
based on methods other than Method 305 may not be adjusted by the 
compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 8 of this subpart.
    (i) Annual average concentration definition. (A) When complying with 
Sec. 63.1256(a)(1)(i)(A), the annual average concentration means the 
total mass of partially soluble HAP compounds occurring in the 
wastewater stream during the calendar year divided by the total mass of 
the wastewater stream discharged during the same calendar year.
    (B) When complying with Sec. 63.1256(a)(1)(i) (B) or (C), the annual

[[Page 128]]

average concentration means the total mass of partially soluble and/or 
soluble HAP compounds occurring in the wastewater stream during the 
calendar year divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream 
discharged during the same calendar year.
    (C) When complying with Sec. 63.1256(a)(1)(i)(D), the annual average 
concentration means the total mass of soluble HAP compounds occurring in 
the wastewater stream during the calendar year divided by the total mass 
of the wastewater stream discharged during the same calendar year.
    (ii) Determination of annual average concentration. An owner or 
operator shall determine annual average concentrations of partially 
soluble and/or soluble HAP compounds in accordance with the provisions 
specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section. The 
owner or operator may determine annual average concentrations by process 
simulation. Data and other information supporting the simulation shall 
be reported in the Precompliance Report for approval by the 
Administrator. The annual average concentration shall be determined 
either at the POD or downstream of the POD with adjustment for 
concentration changes made according to paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(D) of this 
section.
    (A) Test methods. The concentration of partially soluble HAP, 
soluble HAP, or total HAP shall be measured using any of the methods 
described in paragraphs (b)(10)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (B) Knowledge of the wastewater stream. The concentration of 
partially soluble HAP, soluble HAP, or total HAP shall be calculated 
based on knowledge of the wastewater stream according to the procedures 
in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)(B)(1) and (2) of this section. The owner or 
operator shall document concentrations in the Notification of Compliance 
Status report described in Sec. 63.1260(f).
    (1) Mass balance. The owner or operator shall calculate the 
concentrations of HAP compounds in wastewater considering the total 
quantity of HAP discharged to the water, the amount of water at the POD, 
and the amounts of water and solvent lost to other mechanisms such as 
reactions, air emissions, or uptake in product or other processing 
materials. The quantities of HAP and water shall be based on batch 
sheets, manufacturing tickets, or FDA bills of materials. In cases where 
a chemical reaction occurs that generates or consumes HAP, the amount of 
HAP remaining after a reaction shall be based on stoichometry assuming 
100 percent theoretical consumption or yield, as applicable.
    (2) Published water solubility data. For single components in water, 
owners and operators may use the water solubilities published in 
standard reference texts at the POD temperature to determine maximum HAP 
concentration.
    (C) Bench scale or pilot-scale test data. The concentration of 
partially soluble HAP, soluble HAP, or total HAP shall be calculated 
based on bench scale or pilot-scale test data. The owner or operator 
shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the bench-scale 
or pilot-scale test concentration data are representative of actual HAP 
concentrations. The owner or operator shall also provide documentation 
describing the testing protocol, and the means by which sample 
variability and analytical variability were accounted for in the 
determination of HAP concentrations. Documentation of the pilot-scale or 
bench scale analysis shall be provided in the precompliance report.
    (D) Adjustment for concentrations determined downstream of the POD. 
The owner or operator shall make corrections to the annual average 
concentration when the concentration is determined downstream of the POD 
at a location where: two or more wastewater streams have been mixed; one 
or more wastewater streams have been treated; or, losses to the 
atmosphere have occurred. The owner or operator shall make the 
adjustments either to the individual data points or to the final annual 
average concentration.
    (iii) Determination of annual load. An owner or operator shall 
calculate the partially soluble and/or soluble HAP load in a wastewater 
stream based on the annual average concentration determined in paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) (A), (B), or (C) of this section and the total volume of the 
wastewater stream, based

[[Page 129]]

on knowledge of the wastewater stream in accordance with paragraphs 
(e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The owner or operator shall maintain 
records of the total liters of wastewater discharged per year as 
specified in Sec. 63.1259(b).
    (2) Compliance with treatment unit control provisions. (i) 
Performance tests and design evaluations-general. To comply with the 
control options in Sec. 63.1256(g) (10) or (13), neither a design 
evaluation nor a performance test is required. For any other 
nonbiological treatment process, the owner or operator shall conduct 
either a design evaluation as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this 
section, or a performance test as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of 
this section to demonstrate that each nonbiological treatment process 
used to comply with Sec. 63.1256(g) (8), (9), and/or (12) achieves the 
conditions specified for compliance. The owner or operator shall 
demonstrate by the procedures in either paragraph (e)(2) (ii) or (iii) 
of this section that each closed biological treatment process used to 
comply with Sec. 63.1256 (g)(8)(ii), (g)(9)(ii), (g)(11), or (g)(12) 
achieves the conditions specified for compliance. If an open biological 
treatment unit is used to comply with Sec. 63.1256 (g)(8)(ii), 
(g)(9)(ii), (g)(11), or (g)(12), the owner or operator shall comply with 
the performance test requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this 
section.
    (ii) Design evaluation. A design evaluation and supporting 
documentation that addresses the operating characteristics of the 
treatment process and that is based on operation at a wastewater stream 
flow rate and a concentration under which it would be most difficult to 
demonstrate compliance. For closed biological treatment processes, the 
percent reduction from removal/destruction in the treatment unit and 
control device shall be determined by a mass balance over the unit. The 
mass flow rate of soluble and/or partially soluble HAP compounds exiting 
the treatment process shall be the sum of the mass flow rate of soluble 
and/or partially soluble HAP compounds in the wastewater stream exiting 
the biological treatment process and the mass flow rate of the vented 
gas stream exiting the control device. The mass flow rate entering the 
treatment process minus the mass flow rate exiting the process 
determines the actual mass removal. Compounds that meet the requirements 
specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(4) of this section are not 
required to be included in the design evaluation; the term ``performance 
test'' in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(4) of this section shall mean 
``design evaluation'' for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (iii) Performance tests. Performance tests shall be conducted using 
test methods and procedures that meet the applicable requirements 
specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(A) through (G) of this section.
    (A) General. This paragraph specifies the general procedures for 
performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a 
treatment process with the control requirements specified in 
Sec. 63.1256(g).
    (1) Representative process unit operating conditions. Compliance 
shall be demonstrated for representative operating conditions. 
Operations during periods of malfunction and periods of nonoperation 
shall not constitute representative conditions. The owner or operator 
shall record the process information that is necessary to document 
operating conditions during the test.
    (2) Representative treatment process operating conditions. 
Performance tests shall be conducted when the treatment process is 
operating at a representative inlet flow rate and concentration. If the 
treatment process will be operating at several different sets of 
representative operating conditions, the owner or operator shall comply 
with paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(A)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The owner 
or operator shall record information that is necessary to document 
treatment process or control device operating conditions during the 
test.
    (i) Range of operating conditions. If the treatment process will be 
operated at several different sets of representative operating 
conditions, performance testing over the entire range is not required. 
In such cases, the performance test results shall be supplemented with 
modeling and/or engineering assessments to demonstrate performance over 
the operating range.

[[Page 130]]

    (ii) Consideration of residence time. If concentration and/or flow 
rate to the treatment process are not relatively constant (i.e., 
comparison of inlet and outlet data will not be representative of 
performance), the owner or operator shall consider residence time, when 
determining concentration and flow rate.
    (3) Testing equipment. All testing equipment shall be prepared and 
installed as specified in the applicable test methods, or as approved by 
the Administrator.
    (4) Compounds not required to be considered in performance tests. 
Compounds that meet the requirements specified in (e)(2)(iii)(A)(4)(i), 
(ii), or (iii) of this section are not required to be included in the 
performance test. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 shall 
be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm 
factor listed in Table 8 of this subpart. Concentration measurements 
based on methods other than Method 305 shall not be adjusted by the 
compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 8 of this subpart.
    (i) Compounds not used or produced by the PMPU; or
    (ii) Compounds with concentrations at the POD that are below 1 ppmw; 
or
    (iii) Compounds with concentrations at the POD that are below the 
lower detection limit where the lower detection limit is greater than 1 
ppmw. The method shall be an analytical method for wastewater which has 
the compound of interest as a target analyte.
    (5) Treatment using a series of treatment processes. In all cases 
where the wastewater provisions in this subpart allow or require the use 
of a treatment process to comply with emissions limitations, the owner 
or operator may use multiple treatment processes. The owner or operator 
complying with the requirements of Sec. 63.1256(g)(7)(i), when 
wastewater is conveyed by hard-piping, shall comply with either 
paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section. The owner or 
operator complying with the requirements of Sec. 63.1256(g)(7)(ii) shall 
comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(5)(ii) of this 
section.
    (i) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test across 
each series of treatment processes. For each series of treatment 
processes, inlet concentration and flow rate shall be measured either 
where the wastewater enters the first treatment process in a series of 
treatment processes, or prior to the first treatment process as 
specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(6) of this section. For each 
series of treatment processes, outlet concentration and flow rate shall 
be measured where the wastewater exits the last treatment process in the 
series of treatment processes, except when the last treatment process is 
an open or a closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating 
compliance by using the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) 
of this section. When the last treatment process is either an open or a 
closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating compliance by 
using the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) of this 
section, inlet and outlet concentrations and flow rates shall be 
measured at the inlet and outlet to the series of treatment processes 
prior to the biological treatment process and at the inlet to the 
biological treatment process, except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii)(A)(6)(ii) of this section. The mass flow rate destroyed in 
the biological treatment process for which compliance is demonstrated 
using paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) of this section shall be added to 
the mass flow rate removed or destroyed in the series of treatment units 
before the biological treatment unit. This sum shall be used to 
calculate the overall control efficiency.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test across 
each treatment process in the series of treatment processes. The mass 
flow rate removed or destroyed by each treatment process shall be added 
together and the overall control efficiency calculated to determine 
whether compliance has been demonstrated using paragraphs 
(e)(2)(iii)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this section, as applicable. If 
a biological treatment process is one of the treatment processes in the 
series of treatment processes, the inlet to the biological treatment 
process shall be the point at which the wastewater enters the biological 
treatment process, or the inlet to the equalization tank if

[[Page 131]]

all the criteria of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(6)(ii) of this section are 
met.
    (6) The owner or operator determining the inlet for purposes of 
demonstrating compliance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E), or (F)of this 
section may elect to comply with paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(6)(i) or (ii) 
of this section.
    (i) When wastewater is conveyed exclusively by hard-piping from the 
point of determination to a treatment process that is either the only 
treatment process or the first in a series of treatment processes (i.e., 
no treatment processes or other waste management units are used upstream 
of this treatment process to store, handle, or convey the wastewater), 
the inlet to the treatment process shall be at any location from the 
point of determination to where the wastewater stream enters the 
treatment process. When samples are taken upstream of the treatment 
process and before wastewater streams have converged, the owner or 
operator shall ensure that the mass flow rate of all affected wastewater 
is accounted for when using Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(ii), (g)(9)(ii) or 
(g)(12) of this subpart to comply and that the mass flow rate of all 
wastewater, not just affected wastewater, is accounted for when using 
Sec. 63.1256(g)(11) to comply, except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii)(A)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The owner or operator may consider the inlet to the 
equalization tank as the inlet to the biological treatment process if 
the wastewater is conveyed by hard-piping from either the last previous 
treatment process or the point of determination to the equalization 
tank; or the wastewater is conveyed from the equalization tank 
exclusively by hard-piping to the biological treatment process and no 
treatment processes or other waste management units are used to store, 
handle, or convey the wastewater between the equalization tank and the 
biological treatment process; or the equalization tank is equipped with 
a fixed roof and a closed-vent system that routes emissions to a control 
device that meets the requirements of Sec. 63.1256(b)(1)(i) through (iv) 
and Sec. 63.1256(b)(2)(i). The outlet from the series of treatment 
processes prior to the biological treatment process is the point at 
which the wastewater exits the last treatment process in the series 
prior to the equalization tank, if the equalization tank and biological 
treatment process are part of a series of treatment processes. The owner 
or operator shall ensure that the mass flow rate of all affected 
wastewater is accounted for when using Sec. 63.1256(g)(9)(ii) or (12) to 
comply and that the mass flow rate of all wastewater, not just affected 
wastewater is accounted for when using Sec. 63.1256(g)(11) to comply, 
except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(4) of this section.
    (B) Noncombustion treatment process--concentration limits. This 
paragraph applies to performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate 
compliance of a noncombustion treatment process with the ppmw wastewater 
stream concentration limits at the outlet of the treatment process. This 
compliance option is specified in Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(i) and (9)(i). 
Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which 
minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis 
and maintain sample integrity per paragraph (b)(10)(iii) of this 
section. Samples shall be collected and analyzed using the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (b)(10)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section. 
Samples may be grab samples or composite samples. Samples shall be taken 
at approximately equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period. 
Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and the performance test shall 
consist of a minimum of three runs. Concentration measurements based on 
methods other than Method 305 may be adjusted by multiplying each 
concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 8 of 
this subpart. (For affected wastewater streams that contains both 
partially soluble and soluble HAP compounds, compliance is demonstrated 
only if the sum of the concentrations of partially soluble HAP compounds 
is less than 50 ppmw, and the sum of the concentrations of soluble HAP 
compounds is less than 520 ppmw.)
    (C) Noncombustion, nonbiological treatment process: percent mass 
removal/destruction option. This paragraph applies to performance tests 
that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a

[[Page 132]]

noncombustion, nonbiological treatment process with the percent mass 
removal limits specified in Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(ii) and (9)(ii) for 
partially soluble and soluble HAP compounds, respectively. The owner or 
operator shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs 
(e)(2)(iii)(C)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) Concentration. The concentration of partially soluble and/or 
soluble HAP compounds entering and exiting the treatment process shall 
be determined as provided in this paragraph. Wastewater samples shall be 
collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic 
compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample 
integrity per paragraph (b)(10)(v) of this section. The method shall be 
an analytical method for wastewater which has the compound of interest 
as a target analyte. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples. 
Samples shall be taken at approximately equally spaced time intervals 
over a 1-hour period. Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and the 
performance test shall consist of a minimum of three runs. Concentration 
measurements based on Method 305 shall be adjusted by dividing each 
concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 8 of 
this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than 
Method 305 shall not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factor 
listed in Table 8 of this subpart.
    (2) Flow rate. The flow rate of the entering and exiting wastewater 
streams shall be determined using inlet and outlet flow meters, 
respectively. Where the outlet flow is not greater than the inlet flow, 
a single flow meter may be used, and may be used at either the inlet or 
outlet. Flow rate measurements shall be taken at the same time as the 
concentration measurements.
    (3) Calculation of mass flow rate--for noncombustion, nonbiological 
treatment processes. The mass flow rates of partially soluble and/or 
soluble HAP compounds entering and exiting the treatment process are 
calculated using Equations 44 and 45 of this subpart.

exiting (QMW<INF>b</INF>) the

[[Page 133]]

treatment process, kg/hr (as calculated using Equations 44 and 45 of 
this subpart)

    (5) Compare mass removal efficiency to required efficiency. Compare 
the mass removal efficiency (calculated in Equation 44 of this subpart) 
to the required efficiency as specified in Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(ii) or 
(9)(ii). If complying with Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(ii), compliance is 
demonstrated if the mass removal efficiency is 99 percent or greater. If 
complying with Sec. 63.1256(g)(9)(ii), compliance is demonstrated if the 
mass removal efficiency is 90 percent or greater.
    (D) Combustion treatment processes: percent mass removal/destruction 
option. This paragraph applies to performance tests that are conducted 
to demonstrate compliance of a combustion treatment process with the 
percent mass destruction limits specified in Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(ii) for 
partially soluble HAP compounds, and/or Sec. 63.1256(g)(9)(ii) for 
soluble HAP compounds. The owner or operator shall comply with the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(D)(1) through (8) of 
this section.
    (1) Concentration in wastewater stream entering the combustion 
treatment process. The concentration of partially soluble and/or soluble

or <plus-minus> 2.5  deg.C, whichever is greater.
    (B) The temperature monitoring devices must be calibrated annually.
    (ix) Process heaters and boilers. (A) Except as specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ix)(B) of this section, for each boiler or process 
heater, the owner or operator shall establish the minimum temperature of 
the gases exiting the combustion chamber as the site-specific operating 
parameter which must be monitored and recorded at least once every 15 
minutes during the period in which the boiler or process heater is 
functioning in achieving the HAP removal required by this subpart.
    (1) The temperature monitoring device must be accurate to within

owner or operator may monitor and record the outlet HAP concentration or 
both the outlet TOC concentration and outlet hydrogen halide and halogen 
concentration every 15 minutes during the period in which the control 
device is functioning in achieving the HAP removal required by this 
subpart. The owner or operator need not monitor the hydrogen halide and 
halogen concentration if, based on process knowledge, the owner or 
operator determines that the emission stream does not contain hydrogen 
halides or halogens. The HAP or TOC monitor must meet the requirements 
of Performance Specification 8 or 9 of appendix B of part 60 and must be 
installed, calibrated, and maintained, according to Sec. 63.8. As part 
of the QA/QC Plan, calibration of the device must include, at a minimum, 
quarterly cylinder gas audits.
    (xi) CVS visual inspections. The owner or operator shall perform 
monthly visual inspections of each closed vent system as specified in 
Sec. 63.1252(b).
    (2) Averaging periods. Averaging periods for parametric monitoring 
levels shall be established according to paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, a 
daily (24-hour) or block average shall be calculated as the average of 
all values for a monitored parameter level set according to the 
procedures in (b)(3)(iii) of this section recorded during the operating 
day or block.

[[Page 144]]

    (ii) The operating day or block shall be defined in the Notification 
of Compliance Status report. The daily average may be from midnight to 
midnight or another continuous 24-hour period. The block average is 
limited to a period of time that is, at a maximum, equal to the time 
from the beginning to end of a batch process.
    (iii) Monitoring values taken during periods in which the control 
devices are not functioning in controlling emissions, as indicated by 
periods of no flow, shall not be considered in the averages. Where flow 
to the device could be intermittent, the owner or operator shall 
install, calibrate and operate a flow indicator at the inlet or outlet 
of the control device to identify periods of no flow.
    (3) Procedures for setting parameter levels for control devices used 
to control emissions from process vents. (i) Small control devices. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, for devices 
controlling less than 10 tons per year of HAP for which a performance 
test is not required, the parametric levels shall be set based on the 
design evaluation required in Sec. 63.1257(d)(3)(i). If a performance 
test is conducted, the monitoring parameter level shall be established 
according to the procedures in (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Large control devices. For devices controlling greater than 10 
tons per year of HAP for which a performance test is required, the 
parameter level must be established as follows:
    (A) If the operating parameter level to be established is a maximum, 
it must be based on the average of the values from each of the three 
test runs.
    (B) If the operating parameter level to be established is a minimum, 
it must be based on the average of the values from each of the three 
test runs.
    (C) The owner or operator may establish the parametric monitoring 
level(s) based on the performance test supplemented by engineering 
assessments and manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is 
not required to be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter 
values. The rationale for the specific level for each parameter, 
including any data and calculations used to develop the level(s) and a 
description of why the level indicates proper operation of the control 
device shall be provided in the Precompliance report. The procedures 
specified in this section have not been approved by the Administrator 
and determination of the parametric monitoring level using these 
procedures is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.
    (iii) Parameters for control devices controlling batch process 
vents. For devices controlling batch process vents alone or in 
combination with other streams, the parameter level(s) shall be 
established in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this 
section.
    (A) If more than one batch emission episode has been selected to be 
controlled, a single level for the batch process(es) shall be determined 
from the initial compliance demonstration.
    (B) Instead of establishing a single level for the batch 
process(es), as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, 
an owner or operator may establish separate levels for each batch 
emission episode, selected to be controlled. If separate monitoring 
levels are established, the owner or operator must provide a record 
indicating at what point in the daily schedule or log of processes 
required to be recorded per the requirements of Sec. 63.1259(b)(9) the 
parameter being monitored changes levels and must record at least one 
reading of the new parameter level, even if the duration of monitoring 
for the new parameter is less than 15-minutes.
    (4) Request approval to monitor alternative parameters. An owner or 
operator may request approval to monitor parameters other than those 
required by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (ix) of this section. The 
request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.8(f) or included in the Precompliance report.
    (5) Monitoring for the alternative standards. For control devices 
that are used to comply with the provisions of Sec. 63.1253(d) or 
63.1254(c), the owner or operator shall monitor and record the outlet 
TOC concentration and the outlet hydrogen halide and halogen 
concentration every 15 minutes during the period in which the device is 
functioning in achieving the HAP removal

[[Page 145]]

required by this subpart. A TOC monitor meeting the requirements of 
Performance Specification 8 or 9 of appendix B of part 60 shall be 
installed, calibrated, and maintained, according to Sec. 63.8. The owner 
or operator need notmonitor the hydrogen halide and halogen 
concentration if, based on process knowledge, the owner or operator 
determines that the emission stream does not contain hydrogen halides or 
halogens.
    (6) Exceedances of operating parameters. An exceedance of an 
operating parameter is defined as one of the following:
    (i) If the parameter, averaged over the operating day or block, is 
below a minimum value established during the initial compliance 
demonstration.
    (ii) If the parameter, averaged over the operating day or block, is 
above the maximum value established during the initial compliance 
demonstration.
    (iii) Each loss of pilot flame for flares.
    (7) Excursions. Excursions are defined by either of the two cases 
listed in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) When the period of control device operation is 4 hours or 
greater in an operating day and monitoring data are insufficient to 
constitute a valid hour of data, as defined in paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of 
this section, for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.
    (ii) When the period of control device operation is less than 4 
hours in an operating day and more than one of the hours during the 
period of operation does not constitute a valid hour of data due to 
insufficient monitoring data.
    (iii) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of 
data, as used in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section, if 
measured values are unavailable for any of the required 15-minute 
periods within the hour.
    (8) Violations. Exceedances of parameters monitored according to the 
provisions of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (iv) through (ix) of this 
section or excursions as defined by paragraphs (b)(7)(i) through (iii) 
of this section constitute violations of the operating limit according 
to paragraphs (b)(8)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section. Exceedances of 
the temperature limit monitored according to the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section or exceedances of the outlet concentrations 
monitored according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(x) of this 
section constitute violations of the emission limit according to 
paragraphs (b)(8)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section. Exceedances of the 
outlet concentrations monitored according to the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section constitute violations of the emission limit 
according to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(8)(iii) and (iv) of this 
section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, for 
episodes occurring more than once per day, exceedances of established 
parameter limits or excursions will result in no more than one violation 
per operating day for each monitored item of equipment utilized in the 
process.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, for 
control devices used for more than one process in the course of an 
operating day, exceedances or excursions will result in no more than one 
violation per operating day, per control device, for each process for 
which the control device is in service.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, 
exceedances of the 20 ppmv TOC outlet emission limit, averaged over the 
operating day, will result in no more than one violation per day per 
control device. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this 
section, exceedances of the 20 ppmv hydrogen halide or halogen outlet 
emission limit, averaged over the operating day, will result in no more 
than one violation per day per control device.
    (iv) Periods of time when monitoring measurements exceed the 
parameter values as well as periods of inadequate monitoring data do not 
constitute a violation if they occur during a startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction, and the facility follows its startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan.
    (c) Monitoring for emission limits. The owner or operator of any 
affected source complying with the provisions of Sec. 63.1254(a)(1) 
shall demonstrate continuous compliance with the 2,000 lb/yr emission 
limits by calculating daily a 365-day rolling summation of emissions. 
For owners and operators opting

[[Page 146]]

to switch compliance strategy from the 93 percent control requirement to 
the 2,000 lb/yr compliance method, as decribed in Sec. 63.1254(a), the 
rolling average must include emissions from the past 365 days. Each day 
that the total emissions per process exceeds 2,000 lb/yr will be 
considered a violation of the emission limit.
    (d) Monitoring for equipment leaks. The owner or operator of any 
affected source complying with the requirements of Sec. 63.1255 of this 
subpart shall meet the monitoring requirements described Sec. 63.1255 of 
this subpart.
    (e) Pollution prevention. The owner or operator of any affected 
source that chooses to comply with the requirements of 
Secs. 63.1252(e)(2) and (3) shall calculate a yearly rolling average of 
kg HAP consumption per kg production and kg VOC consumption per kg 
production every month or every 10 batches. Each rolling average kg/kg 
factor that exceeds the value established in Sec. 63.1257(f)(1)(ii) will 
be considered a violation of the emission limit.
    (f) Emissions averaging. The owner or operator of any affected 
source that chooses to comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.1252(d) 
shall meet all monitoring requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1)

treatment processes. (1) For each wastewater tank, surface impoundment, 
container, individual drain system, and oil-water separator that 
receives, manages, or treats wastewater, a residual removed from 
wastewater, a recycled wastewater, or a recycled residual removed from 
wastewater, the owner or operator shall comply with the inspection 
requirements specified in Table 7 of this subpart.
    (2) For each biological treatment unit used to comply with 
Sec. 63.1256(g), the owner or operator shall monitor TSS, BOD, and the 
biomass concentration at a frequency approved by the permitting 
authority and using methods approved by the permitting authority. The 
owner or operator may request approval to monitor other parameters. The

procedures specified in Sec. 63.1260(e), and shall include a description 
of planned reporting and recordkeeping procedures. The owner or operator 
shall include as part of the submittal the basis for the selected 
monitoring frequencies and the methods that will be used. The 
Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements as part of the review of the permit application or by other 
appropriate means.
    (3) For nonbiological treatment units, the owner or operator shall

instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in 
section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of 
the process fluid not each individual VOC in the stream. For process 
streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts which are not 
organic HAP or VOC, the average stream response factor shall be 
calculated on an inert-free basis.
    (B) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet 
the performance criteria specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the 
average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-
free basis as described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (iii) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on 
each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR

used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument 
does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph 
(h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be 
a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
    (v) An owner or operator may elect to adjust or not adjust 
instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects to 
not adjust readings for background, all such instrument readings shall 
be compared directly to the applicable leak definition to determine 
whether there is a leak. If an owner or operator elects to adjust 
instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall measure 
background concentration using the procedures in Sec. 63.180(b) and (c). 
The owner or operator shall subtract background reading from the maximum 
concentration indicated by the instrument.
    (vi) The background level shall be determined according to the 
procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60 appendix A.
    (vii) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration 
indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared 
with 500 parts per million for determining compliance.
    (4) Leaks, as indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 
parts per million above background or by visual inspections, shall be 
repaired as soon as practicable, except as provided in paragraph (h)(5) 
of this section.
    (i) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar 
days after the leak is detected.

after the leak is detected or at the beginning of

[[Page 148]]

the next transfer loading operation, whichever is later.
    (5) Delay of repair of a vapor collection system, closed-vent 
system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure for which leaks have been 
detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a

 Subpart HHH--National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
          From Natural Gas Transmission and Storage Facilities

    Source: 64 FR 32648, June 17, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1270  Applicability and designation of affected source.

    (a) This subpart applies to owners and operators of natural gas 
transmission and storage facilities that transport or store natural gas 
prior to entering the pipeline to a local distribution company or to a 
final end user (if there is no local distribution company), and that are 
major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions as determined 
using the maximum natural gas throughput calculated in either paragraph 
(a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section and paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of 
this section. A compressor station that transports natural gas prior to 
the point of custody transfer, or to a natural gas processing plant (if 
present) is considered a part of the oil and natural gas production 
source category. A facility that is determined to be an area source, 
based on emission estimates using the maximum natural gas throughput 
calculated as specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, 
but subsequently increases emissions or potential to emit above the 
major source levels (without first obtaining and complying with other 
limitations that keep its potential to emit HAP below major source 
levels, becomes a major source and must comply thereafter with all 
applicable provisions of this subpart starting on the applicable 
compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Nothing in 
this paragraph is intended to preclude a source from limiting its 
potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be 
available through the permitting authority.
    (1) Facilities that store natural gas or facilities that transport 
and store natural gas shall determine major

[[Page 163]]

source status using the maximum annual facility natural gas throughput 
calculated according to paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of this 
section.
    (i) The owner or operator shall determine the number of hours to 
complete the storage cycle for the facility. The storage cycle is the 
number of hours for the injection cycle, calculated according to the 
equation in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section, plus the number of 
hours for the withdrawal cycle, calculated according to the equation in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (A) The hours for the facility injection cycle are determined 
according to the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN99.005

Where:

IC = Facility injection cycle in hours/cycle.
WGC = Working gas capacity in cubic meters. The working gas capacity is 
          defined as the maximum storage capacity minus the FERC cushion 
          (as defined in Sec. 63.1271).
IR<INF>max</INF> = Maximum facility injection rate in cubic meters per 
          hour.

    (B) The hours for the facility withdrawal cycle are determined 
according to the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN99.006

Where:

WC = Facility withdrawal cycle, hours/cycle.
WGC = Working gas capacity, cubic meters. The working gas capacity is 
          defined as the maximum storage capacity minus the FERC cushion 
          (as defined in Sec. 63.1271) and shall be the same value as 
          used in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section.
WR<INF>max</INF> = Maximum facility withdrawal rate in cubic meters per 
          hour.

    (ii) The owner or operator shall calculate the number of storage 
cycles for the facility per year according to the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JN99.007

Where:

Cycle = Number of storage cycles for the facility per year.
IC = Number of hours for a facility injection cycle, hours/cycle, as 
          calculated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section.
WC = Number of hours for a facility withdrawal cycle, hours/cycle, as 
          calculated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall calculate the facilitywide maximum 
annual glycol dehydration unit hours of operation based on the following 
equation:

Operation = Cycles  x  WC

Where:

Operation = Facilitywide maximum annual glycol dehydration unit hours of 
          operation (hr/yr).
Cycles = Number of storage cycles for the facility per year, as 
          calculated in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
WC = Number of hours for a facility withdrawal cycle, hours/cycle, as 
          calculated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

    (iv) The owner or operator shall calculate the maximum facilitywide 
natural gas throughput based on the following equation:

Throughput = Operation  x  WR<INF>max</INF>

Where:

Throughput = Maximum facilitywide natural gas throughput in cubic meters 
          per year.
Operation = Maximum facilitywide annual glycol dehydration unit hours of 
          operation in hours per year, as calculated in paragraph 
          (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
WR<INF>max</INF> = Maximum facility withdrawal rate in cubic meters per 
          hour.

    (2) Facilities that only transport natural gas shall calculate the 
maximum natural gas throughput as the highest annual natural gas 
throughput over the 5 years prior to June 17, 1999, multiplied by a 
factor of 1.2.
    (3) The owner or operator shall maintain records of the annual 
facility natural gas throughput each year and upon request, submit such 
records to the Administrator. If the facility annual natural gas 
throughput increases above the maximum natural gas throughput calculated 
in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the maximum natural gas 
throughput must be recalculated using the higher throughput multiplied 
by a factor of 1.2.
    (4) The owner or operator shall determine the maximum values for 
other parameters used to calculate potential emissions as the maximum 
over the same period for which maximum

[[Page 164]]

throughput is determined as specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of 
this section. These parameters shall be based on an annual average or 
the highest single measured value.
    (b) The affected source is each glycol dehydration unit.
    (c) The owner or operator of a facility that does not contain an 
affected source, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, is not 
subject to the requirements of this subpart.
    (d) The owner or operator of each affected source shall achieve 
compliance with the provisions of this subpart by the following dates:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected source, the construction or 
reconstruction of which commenced before February 6, 1998, shall achieve 
compliance with this provisions of the subpart no later than June 17, 
2002 except as provided for in Sec. 63.6(i). The owner or operator of an 
area source, the construction or reconstruction of which commenced 
before February 6, 1998, that increases its emissions of (or its 
potential to emit) HAP such that the source becomes a major source that 
is subject to this subpart shall comply with this subpart 3 years after 
becoming a major source.
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected source, the construction or 
reconstruction of which commences on or after February 6, 1998, shall 
achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart immediately upon 
initial startup or June 17, 1999, whichever date is later. Area sources, 
the construction or reconstruction of which commences on or after 
February 6, 1998, that become major sources shall comply with the 
provisions of this standard immediately upon becoming a major source.
    (e) An owner or operator of an affected source that is a major 
source or is located at a major source and is subject to the provisions 
of this subpart is also subject to 40 CFR part 70 or part 71 permitting 
requirements.
    (f) Exemptions. A facility with a facilitywide actual annual average 
natural gas throughput less than 28.3 thousand standard cubic meters per 
day, where glycol dehydration units are the only HAP emission source, is 
not subject to the requirements of this subpart. Records shall be 
maintained as required in Sec. 63.10(b)(3).

Sec. 63.1271  Definitions.

    All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them 
in the Clean Air Act, subpart A of this part (General Provisions), and 
in this section. If the same term is defined in subpart A and in this 
section, it shall have the meaning given in this section for purposes of 
this subpart.
    Boiler means an enclosed device using controlled flame combustion 
and having the primary purpose of recovering and exporting thermal 
energy in the form of steam or hot water. Boiler also means any 
industrial furnace as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.
    Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere 
and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and if necessary, flow 
inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to 
one or more control devices. If gas or vapor from regulated equipment is 
routed to a process (e.g., to a fuel gas system), the conveyance system 
shall not be considered a closed-vent system and is not subject to 
closed-vent system standards.
    Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as a 
flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler, used for the combustion 
of organic HAP emissions.
    Compressor station means any permanent combination of compressors 
that move natural gas at increased pressure from fields, in transmission 
pipelines, or into storage.
    Continuous recorder means a data recording device that either 
records an instantaneous data value at least once every hour or records 
hourly or more frequent block average values.
    Control device means any equipment used for recovering or oxidizing 
HAP or volatile organic compounds (VOC) vapors. Such equipment includes, 
but is not limited to, absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, 
incinerators, flares, boilers, and process heaters. For the purposes of 
this subpart, if gas or vapor from regulated equipment is used, reused 
(i.e., injected into the flame zone of a combustion device), returned 
back to the process, or sold,

[[Page 165]]

then the recovery system used, including piping, connections, and flow 
inducing devices, is not considered to be control devices or closed-vent 
systems.
    Custody transfer means the transfer of hydrocarbon liquids or 
natural gas:
    (1) After processing and/or treatment in the producing operations; 
or
    (2) From storage vessels or automatic transfer facilities, or other 
equipment, including product loading racks, to pipelines or any other 
forms of transportation.
    Facility means any grouping of equipment where natural gas is 
processed, compressed, or stored prior to entering a pipeline to a local 
distribution company or (if there is no local distribution company) to a 
final end user. Examples of a facility for this source category are: an 
underground natural gas storage operation; or a natural gas compressor 
station that receives natural gas via pipeline, from an underground 
natural gas storage operation, or from a natural gas processing plant. 
The emission points associated with these phases include, but are not 
limited to, process vents. Processes that may have vents include, but 
are not limited to, dehydration and compressor station engines.
    Facility, for the purpose of a major source determination, means 
natural gas transmission and storage equipment that is located inside 
the boundaries of an individual surface site (as defined in this 
section) and is connected by ancillary equipment, such as gas flow lines 
or power lines. Equipment that is part of a facility will typically be 
located within close proximity to other equipment located at the same 
facility. Natural gas transmission and storage equipment or groupings of

(including, but not limited to, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or 
triethylene glycol) absorbent directly contacts a natural gas stream and 
absorbs water in a contact tower or absorption column (absorber). The 
glycol contacts and absorbs water vapor and other gas stream 
constituents from the natural gas and becomes ``rich'' glycol. This 
glycol is then regenerated in the glycol dehydration unit reboiler. The 
``lean'' glycol is then recycled.
    Glycol dehydration unit baseline operations means operations 
representative of the glycol dehydration unit operations as of June 17, 
1999. For the purposes of this subpart, for determining the percentage 
of overall HAP emission reduction attributable to process modifications, 
glycol dehydration unit baseline operations shall be parameter values 
(including, but not limited to, glycol circulation rate or glycol-HAP 
absorbency) that represent actual long-term conditions (i.e., at least 1 
year). Glycol dehydration units in operation for less than 1 year shall 
document that the parameter values represent expected long-term 
operating conditions had process modifications not been made.

or connections carrying flue gas. The above energy recovery section 
limitation does not apply to an energy recovery section used solely to 
preheat the incoming vent stream or combustion air.
    Initial startup means the first time a new or reconstructed source 
begins production. For the purposes of this subpart, initial startup 
does not include subsequent startups (as defined in this section) of

unplanned event requires that the device open for the purpose of 
preventing physical damage or permanent deformation of the unit or 
equipment on which the device is installed in accordance with good 
engineering and safety practices for handling flammable, combustible, 
explosive, or other hazardous materials. Examples of unplanned events 
which may require a safety device to open include failure of an 
essential equipment component or a sudden power outage.
    Shutdown means for purposes including, but not limited to, periodic

Sec. 63.1272  Startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.

    (a) The provisions set forth in this subpart shall apply at all 
times except during startups or shutdowns, during malfunctions, and 
during periods of non-operation of the affected sources (or specific 
portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this 
subpart applies. However, during the startup, shutdown, malfunction, or 
period of non-operation of one portion of an affected source, all 
emission points which can comply with the specific provisions to which 
they are subject must do so during the startup, shutdown, malfunction, 
or period of non-operation.
    (b) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart during times when emissions are being routed to such items of 
equipment, if the shutdown would contravene requirements of this subpart 
applicable to such items of equipment. This paragraph does not apply if 
the item of equipment is malfunctioning, or if the owner or operator 
must shut down the equipment to avoid damage due to a contemporaneous 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction of the affected source or a portion 
thereof.
    (c) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the 
requirements of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to the 
extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions to the maximum extent practical. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term ``excess emissions'' means emissions in excess of 
those that would have occurred if there were no startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction, and

[[Page 168]]

the owner or operator complied with the relevant provisions of this 
subpart. The measures to be taken shall be identified in the applicable 
startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and may include, but are not 
limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, 
work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the 
manner of operation of the source. Back-up control devices are not 
required, but may be used if available.
    (d) The owner or operator shall prepare a startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction plan as required in Sec. 63.6(e)(3) except that the plan is 
not required to be incorporated by reference into the source's title V 
permit as specified in Sec. 63.6(e)(3)(i). Instead, the owner or 
operator shall keep the plan on record as required by 
Sec. 63.6(e)(3)(v). The failure of the plan to adequately minimize 
emissions during the startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not shield 
an owner or operator from enforcement actions.

compound in the stream.
    (3) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each 
day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    (4) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
    (i) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million by volume hydrocarbon 
in air); and
    (ii) A mixture of methane in air at a methane concentration of less 
than 10,000 parts per million by volume.
    (5) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the 
detection instrument readings to account for the background organic 
concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the 
instrument readings for the background level, the background level value 
must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A.
    (6)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, 
the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 
21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor 
criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average 
composition of the process fluid not each individual volatile organic 
compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, 
or other inerts which are not organic hazardous air pollutants or 
volatile organic compounds, the average stream response factor shall be 
calculated on an inert-free basis.
    (ii) If no instrument is available at the facility that will meet 
the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this 
section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the 
average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-
free basis as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
    (7) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak 
interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable 
procedure specified in

[[Page 173]]

paragraph (b)(7)(i) or (b)(7)(ii) of this section.
    (i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection 
instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then 
the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection 
instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the 
potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this 
section.
    (ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection 
instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the 
value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic 
concentration value measured by the instrument and the background 
organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak 
interface as specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
    (8) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no 
detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value 
determined in paragraph (b)(7) is less than 500 parts per million by 
volume.
    (c) [Reserved]

[[Page 175]]


    (D) If the vent stream entering a boiler or process heater with a 
design capacity less than 44 megawatts is introduced with the combustion 
air or as a secondary fuel, the weight-percentage of reduction of total 
HAP or TOC (minus methane and ethane) across the device shall be 
determined by comparing the TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total HAP 
in all combusted vent streams and primary and secondary fuels with the 
TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total HAP exiting the device, 
respectively.
    (iv) To determine compliance with the enclosed combustion device 
total HAP concentration limit specified in Sec. 63.1281(d)(1)(i)(B), the 
owner or operator shall use either Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix

    (ii) If the owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on 
a demonstration of control device performance using a design analysis, 
then the disagreement shall be resolved using the results of a 
performance test performed by the owner or operator in accordance with 
the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The Administrator 
may choose to have an authorized representative observe the performance 
test.
    (5) As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs (d)(3) and

    (e) Compliance demonstration for control devices performance 
requirements. This paragraph applies to the demonstration of compliance 
with the control device performance requirements specified in 
Sec. 63.1281(d)(1) and (e)(3)(ii). Compliance shall be demonstrated 
using the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this 
section. As an alternative, an owner or operator that installs a 
condenser as the control device to achieve the requirements specified in 
Sec. 63.1281(d)(2)(ii) or Sec. 63.1275(c)(2), may demonstrate compliance 
according to paragraph (f) of this section. An owner or operator may 
switch between compliance with paragraph (e) of this section and 
compliance with paragraph (f) of this section only after at least 1 year 
of operation in compliance with the selected approach. Notification of 
such a change

[[Page 177]]

in the compliance method shall be reported in the next Periodic Report, 
as required in Sec. 63.1285(e), following the change.
    (1) The owner or operator shall establish a site specific maximum or 
minimum monitoring parameter value (as appropriate) according to the 
requirements of Sec. 63.1283(d)(5)(i).
    (2) The owner or operator shall calculate the daily average of the 
applicable monitored parameter in accordance with Sec. 63.1283(d)(4).

either equal to or greater than the minimum or equal to or less than the 
maximum monitoring value established under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.
    (f) Compliance demonstration with percent reduction performance 
requirements--condensers. This paragraph applies to the demonstration of 
compliance with the performance requirements specified in 
Sec. 63.1281(d)(1)(ii) for condensers. Compliance shall be demonstrated 
using the procedures in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this

Sec. 63.1281(d)(1)(ii) or Sec. 63.1275(c)(2) shall be demonstrated by 
the procedures in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(iii) of this 
section.
    (i) The owner or operator must calculate the daily average condenser 
outlet temperature in accordance with Sec. 63.1283(d)(4).

for the current operating day using the daily average condenser outlet 
temperature calculated in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section and the 
condenser performance curve established in paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2)(iii) (A), (B), and (D) 
of this section, at the end of each operating day the owner or operator 
shall calculate the 30-day average HAP emission reduction from the 
condenser efficiencies determined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this 
section for the preceding 30 operating days. If the owner or operator 
uses a combination of process modifications and a condenser in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 63.1275(c)(2), the 30-day 
average HAP emission reduction shall be calculated using the emission 
reduction achieved through process modifications and the condenser 
efficiency determined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, both for 
the preceding 30 operating days.
    (A) After the compliance date specified in Sec. 63.1270(f), an owner 
or operator of a facility that stores natural gas that has less than 30 
days of data for determining the average HAP emission reduction, shall 
calculate the cumulative average at the end of the withdrawal season, 
each season, until 30 days of condenser operating data are accumulated. 
For a facility that does not store natural gas, the owner or operator 
that has less than 30 days of data for determining average HAP emission 
reduction, shall calculate the cumulative average at the end of the 
calendar year, each year, until 30 days of condenser operating data are 
accumulated.
    (B) After the compliance date specified in Sec. 63.1270(f), an owner 
or operator that has less than 30 days of data for determining the 
average HAP emission reduction, compliance is achieved if the average 
HAP emission reduction calculated in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section, is equal to or greater than 95.0 percent.
    (C) For the purposes of this subpart, a withdrawal season begins the 
first time gas is withdrawn from the storage field after July 1 of the 
calendar year and ends on June 30 of the next calendar year.
    (D) Glycol dehydration units that are operated continuously have the 
option of complying with the requirements specified in 40 CFR 63.772(g).
    (3) Compliance is achieved with the emission limitation specified in 
Sec. 63.1281(d)(1)(ii) or Sec. 63.1275(c)(2) if the average HAP emission 
reduction calculated in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section is equal 
to or greater than 95.0 percent.

specified in Sec. 63.1281(d)(1) or (e)(3)(ii), then the minimum 
operating parameter value or the maximum operating parameter value

[[Page 181]]

shall be established based on the control device design analysis and may 
be supplemented by the control device manufacturer's recommendations.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall establish a condenser performance 
curve showing the relationship between condenser outlet temperature and 
condenser control efficiency. The curve shall be established as follows:
    (A) If the owner or operator conducts a performance test in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 63.1282(d)(3) to demonstrate

in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 63.1282(d)(4)(i)(D) to 
demonstrate that the condenser achieves the applicable performance 
requirements specified in Sec. 63.1281(d)(1) or (e)(3)(ii), then the 
condenser performance curve shall be based on the condenser design 
analysis and may be supplemented by the control device manufacturer's 
recommendations.
    (C) As an alternative to paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this 
section, the owner or operator may elect to use the procedures 
documented in the GRI report entitled, ``Atmospheric Rich/Lean Method 
for Determining Glycol Dehydrator Emissions'' (GRI-95/0368.1) as inputs 
for the model GRI-GLYCalc<SUP>TM</SUP>, Version 3.0 or higher, to 
generate a condenser performance curve.
    (6) An excursion for a given control device is determined to have 
occurred when the monitoring data or lack of monitoring data result in 
any one of the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(6)(i) through 
(d)(6)(iv) of this section being met. When multiple operating parameters 
are monitored for the same control device and during the same operating 
day, and more than one of these operating parameters meets an excursion 
criterion specified in paragraphs (d)(6)(i) through (d)(6)(iv) of this 
section, then a single excursion is determined to have occurred for the 
control device for that operating day.
    (i) An excursion occurs when the daily average value of a monitored 
operating parameter is less than the minimum operating parameter limit 
(or, if applicable, greater than the maximum operating parameter limit) 
established for the operating parameter in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.
    (ii) An excursion occurs when average condenser efficiency 
calculated according to the requirements specified in 
Sec. 63.1282(f)(2)(iii) is less than 95.0 percent, as specified in 
Sec. 63.1282(f)(3).
    (iii) An excursion occurs when the monitoring data are not available 
for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.
    (iv) If the closed-vent system contains one or more bypass devices 
that could be used to divert all or a portion of the gases, vapors, or 
fumes from entering the control device, an excursion occurs when:
    (A) For each bypass line subject to Sec. 63.1281(c)(3)(i)(A) the 
flow indicator indicates that flow has been detected and that the stream 
has been diverted away from the control device to the atmosphere.
    (B) For each bypass line subject to Sec. 63.1281(c)(3)(i)(B), if the 
seal or closure mechanism has been broken, the bypass line valve 
position has changed, the key for the lock-and-key type lock has been 
checked out, or the car-seal has broken.
    (7) For each excursion, except as provided for in paragraph (d)(8) 
of this section, the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to 
have applied control in a manner that achieves the required operating 
parameter limits. Failure to achieve the required operating parameter 
limits is a violation of this standard.
    (8) An excursion is not a violation of the operating parameter limit 
as specified in paragraphs (d)(8)(i) and (d)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (i) An excursion does not count toward the number of excused 
excursions allowed under paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of this section when the 
excursion occurs during any one of the following periods:

[[Page 182]]

    (A) During a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction when the 
affected facility is operated during such period in accordance with the 
facility's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan; or
    (B) During periods of non-operation of the unit or the process that 
is vented to the control device (resulting in cessation of HAP emissions 
to which the monitoring applies).
    (ii) For each control device, or combinations of control devices, 
installed on the same HAP emissions unit, one excused excursion is 
allowed per semiannual period for any reason. The initial semiannual 
period is the 6-month reporting period addressed by the first Periodic 
Report submitted by the owner or operator in accordance with 
Sec. 63.1285(e) of this subpart.
    (9) Nothing in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section 
shall be construed to allow or excuse a monitoring parameter excursion 
caused by any activity that violates other applicable provisions of this 
subpart.

process modifications and one or more control devices.
    (e) Periodic Reports. An owner or operator shall prepare Periodic 
Reports in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section and 
submit them to the Administrator.
    (1) An owner or operator shall submit Periodic Reports semiannually, 
beginning 60 operating days after the end of the applicable reporting 
period. The first report shall be submitted no later than 240 days after 
the date the Notification of Compliance Status Report is due and shall 
cover the 6-month period beginning on the date the Notification of 
Compliance Status Report is due.
    (2) The owner or operator shall include the information specified in 
paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (viii) of this section, as applicable.
    (i) The information required under Sec. 63.10(e)(3). For the 
purposes of this subpart and the information required under 
Sec. 63.10(e)(3), excursions (as defined in Sec. 63.1283(d)(6)) shall be 
considered excess emissions.
    (ii) A description of all excursions as defined in 
Sec. 63.1283(d)(6) of this subpart that have occurred during the 6-month 
reporting period.
    (A) For each excursion caused when the daily average value of a 
monitored operating parameter is less than the minimum operating 
parameter limit (or, if applicable, greater than the maximum operating 
parameter limit), as specified in Sec. 63.1283(d)(6)(i), the report must 
include the daily average values of the monitored parameter, the 
applicable operating parameter limit, and the date and duration of the 
period that the excursion occurred.
    (B) For each excursion caused when the 30-day average condenser 
control efficiency is less than 95.0 percent, as specified in 
Sec. 63.1283(d)(6)(ii), the report must include the 30-day average 
values of the condenser control efficiency, and the date and duration of 
the period that the excursion occurred.
    (C) For each excursion caused by lack of monitoring data, as 
specified in Sec. 63.1283(d)(6)(iii), the report must include the date 
and duration of period when the monitoring data were not collected and 
the reason why the data were not collected.
    (iii) For each inspection conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 63.1283(c) during which a leak or defect is detected, the records 
specified in Sec. 63.1284(b)(7) must be included in the next Periodic 
Report.
    (iv) For each closed-vent system with a bypass line subject to 
Sec. 63.1281(c)(3)(i)(A), records required under Sec. 63.1284(b)(4)(iii) 
of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device 
through a bypass line. For each closed-vent system with a bypass line 
subject to Sec. 63.1281(c)(3)(i)(B), records required under 
Sec. 63.1284(b)(4)(iv) of all periods in which the seal or closure 
mechanism is broken, the bypass valve position has changed, or the key 
to unlock the bypass line valve was checked out.
    (v) If an owner or operator elects to comply with 
Sec. 63.1275(b)(1)(ii), the records required under Sec. 63.1284(c)(3).
    (vi) The information in paragraphs (e)(2)(vi)(A) and (B) of this 
section shall

[[Page 187]]

be stated in the Periodic Report, when applicable.
    (A) No excursions.
    (B) No continuous monitoring system has been inoperative, out of 
control, repaired, or adjusted.
    (vii) Any change in compliance methods as specified in 
Sec. 63.1275(b).
    (viii) If the owner or operator elects to comply with 
Sec. 63.1275(c)(2), the records required under Sec. 63.1284(b)(10).
    (f) Notification of process change. Whenever a process change is 
made, or a change in any of the information submitted in the 
Notification of Compliance Status Report, the owner or operator shall 
submit a report within 180 days after the process change is made or as a 
part of the next Periodic Report as required under paragraph (e) of this 
section, whichever is sooner. The report shall include:
    (1) A brief description of the process change;
    (2) A description of any modification to standard procedures or 
quality assurance procedures;
    (3) Revisions to any of the information reported in the original 
Notification of Compliance Status Report under paragraph (d) of this 
section; and
    (4) Information required by the Notification of Compliance Status 
Report under paragraph (d) of this section for changes involving the 
addition of processes or equipment.

Sec. 63.1286  Delegation of authority.

    (a) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority to a 
State under section 112(l) of the Act, the authorities contained in 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be retained by the Administrator and 
not transferred to a State.
    (b) Authorities will not be delegated to States for Secs. 63.1282 
and 63.1287 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1287  Alternative means of emission limitation.

    (a) If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means 
of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in HAP emissions at 
least equivalent to the reduction in HAP emissions from that source 
achieved under the applicable requirements in Secs. 63.1274 through 
63.1281, the Administrator will publish a notice in the Federal Register 
permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance 
with that requirement. The notice may condition the permission on 
requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative 
means.
    (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
published only after public notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
    (c) Any person seeking permission to use an alternative means of 
compliance under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the 
Administrator information showing that this means achieves equivalent 
emission reductions.

<R05>
Sec. 63.1292  Definitions.

    All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given them in 
the Act, in subpart A of this part, and in this section. If a term is 
defined in subpart A and in this section, it shall have the meaning 
given in this section for purposes of this subpart.
    Auxiliary blowing agent, or ABA, means a low-boiling point liquid 
added to assist foaming by generating gas beyond that resulting from the 
isocyanate-water reaction.
    Breakthrough means that point in the adsorption step when the mass 
transfer zone (i.e., the section of the carbon bed where the HAP is 
removed from the carrier gas stream) first reaches the carbon bed outlet 
as the mass transfer zone moves down the bed in the direction of flow. 
The breakthrough point is characterized by the beginning of a sharp 
increase in the outlet HAP or organic compound concentration.
    Calibrate means to verify the accuracy of a measurement device 
against a known standard. For the purpose of this subpart, there are two 
levels of calibration. The initial calibration includes the verification 
of the accuracy of the device over the entire operating range of the 
device. Subsequent calibrations can be conducted for a point or several 
points in a limited range of operation that represents the most common 
operation of the device.
    Canned motor pump means a pump with interconnected cavity housings, 
motor rotors, and pump casing. In a canned motor pump, the motor 
bearings run in the process liquid and all seals are eliminated.
    Carbon adsorption system means a system consisting of a tank or 
container that contains a specific quantity of activated carbon. For the 
purposes of this subaprt, a carbon adsorption system is used as a 
control device for storage vessels. Typically, the spent carbon bed does 
not undergo regeneration, but is replaced.
    Connector means flanged, screwed, or other joined fittings used to 
connect two pipe lines or a pipe line and a piece of equipment. A common 
connector is a flange. Joined fittings welded completely around the 
circumference of the interface are not considered to be connectors for 
the purposes of this subpart.
    Cured foam means flexible polyurethane foam with fully developed 
physical properties. A period of 12 to 24 hours from pour is typically 
required to completely cure foam, although mechanical or other devices 
are sometimes used to accelerate the curing process.
    Curing area means the area in a slabstock foam production facility 
where foam buns are allowed to fully develop physical properties.
    Diaphragm pump means a pump where the driving member is a flexible 
diaphragm made of metal, rubber, or plastic. In a diaphragm pump, there 
is no packing or seals that are exposed to the process liquid.
    Diisocyanate means a compound containing two isocyanate groups per 
molecule. The most common diisocyanate compounds used in the flexible 
polyurethane foam industry are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene 
diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI).
    Flexible polyurethane foam means a flexible cellular polymer 
containing urea and carbamate linkages in the chain backbone produced by 
reacting a diisocyanate, polyol, and water. Flexible polyurethane foams 
are open-celled, permit the passage of air through the foam, and possess 
the strength and flexibility to allow repeated distortion or compression 
under stress with essentially complete recovery upon removal of the 
stress.
    Flexible polyurethane foam process means the equipment used to 
produce a flexible polyurethane foam product. For the purpose of this 
subpart, the flexible polyurethane foam process includes raw material 
storage; production equipment and associated piping, ductwork, etc.; and 
curing and storage areas.
    Foam fabrication process means an operation for cutting or bonding 
flexible polyurethane foam pieces together or to other substrates.
    Grade of foam means foam with a distinct combination of indentation 
force deflection (IFD) and density values.
    HAP ABA means methylene chloride, or any other HAP compound used as 
an auxiliary blowing agent.

[[Page 192]]

    HAP-based means to contain 5 percent (by weight) or more of HAP. 
This applies to equipment cleaners (and mixhead flushes) and mold 
release agents. The concentration of HAP may be determined using EPA 
test method 18, material safety data sheets, or engineering 
calculations.
    High-pressure mixhead means a mixhead where mixing is achieved by 
impingement of the high pressure streams within the mixhead.
    Indentation Force Deflection (IFD) means a measure of the load 
bearing capacity of flexible polyurethane foam. IFD is generally 
measured as the force (in pounds) required to compress a 50 square inch 
circular indentor foot into a four inch thick sample, typically 15 
inches square or larger, to 25 percent of the sample's initial height.
    In diisocyanate service means a piece of equipment that contains or 
contacts a diisocyanate.
    In HAP ABA service means a piece of equipment that contains or 
contacts a HAP ABA.
    Initial startup means the first time a new or reconstructed affected 
source begins production of flexible polyurethane foam.
    Isocyanate means a reactive chemical grouping composed of a nitrogen 
atom bonded to a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom; or a chemical 
compound, usually organic, containing one or more isocyanate groups.
    Magnetic drive pump means a pump where an externally-mounted magnet 
coupled to the pump motor drives the impeller in the pump casing. In a 
magnetic drive pump, no seals contact the process fluid.
    Metering pump means a pump used to deliver reactants, ABA, or 
additives to the mixhead.
    Mixhead means a device that mixes two or more component streams 
before dispensing foam producing mixture to the desired container.
    Molded flexible polyurethane foam means a flexible polyurethane foam 
that is produced by shooting the foam mixture into a mold of the desired 
shape and size.
    Mold release agent means any material which, when applied to the 
mold surface, serves to prevent sticking of the foam part to the mold.
    Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common control, including properties that are separated only by a road 
or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that 
are owned, leased, or otherwise operated by the same entity, parent 
entity, subsidiary, or any combination thereof.
    Polyol, for the purpose of this subpart, means a polyether or 
polyester polymer with more than one reactive hydroxyl group attached to 
the molecule.
    Rebond foam means the foam resulting from a process of adhering 
small particles of foam (usually scrap or recycled foam) together to 
make a usable cushioning product. Various adhesives and bonding 
processes are used. A typical application for rebond foam is for carpet 
underlay.
    Rebond foam process means the equipment used to produce a rebond 
foam product. For the purpose of this subpart, the rebond foam process 
includes raw material storage; production equipment and associated 
piping, ductwork, etc.; and curing and storage areas.
    Reconstructed source means an affected source undergoing 
reconstruction, as defined in subpart A. For the purposes of this 
subpart, process modifications made to reduce HAP ABA emissions to meet 
the existing source requirements of this subpart shall not be counted in 
determining whether or not a change or replacement meets the definition 
of reconstruction.
    Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and 
used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for use, reuse, or sale. 
Recovery devices include, but are not limited to, carbon adsorbers, 
absorbers, and condensers.
    Research and development process means a laboratory or pilot plant 
operation whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development 
into new processes and products, where the operations are under the 
close supervision of technically trained personnel, and which is not 
engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale except in a 
de minimis manner.
    Run of foam means a continuous production of foam, which may consist 
of several grades of foam.

[[Page 193]]

    Sealless pump means a canned-motor pump, diaphragm pump, or magnetic 
drive pump, as defined in this section.
    Slabstock flexible polyurethane foam means flexible polyurethane 
foam that is produced in large continuous buns that are then cut into 
the desired size and shape.
    Slabstock flexible polyurethane foam production line includes all 
portions of the flexible polyurethane foam process from the mixhead to 
the point in the process where the foam is completely cured.
    Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
diisocyanate or HAP ABA for use in the production of flexible 
polyurethane foam. Storage vessels do not include vessels with 
capacities smaller than 38 cubic meters (or 10,000 gallons).
    Transfer pump means all pumps used to transport diisocyanate or HAP 
ABA that are not metering pumps.
    Transfer vehicle means a railcar, tank truck, or other vehicle used 
to transport HAP ABA to the flexible polyurethane foam facility.

Sec. 63.1297  Standards for slabstock flexible polyurethane foam production--HAP ABA emissions from the production line.

    (a) Each owner or operator of a new or existing slabstock affected 
source complying with the emission point specific limitation option 
provided in Sec. 63.1293(a)(1) shall control HAP ABA emissions from the 
slabstock polyurethane foam production line in accordance with the 
provisions in this section. Compliance shall be determined on a rolling 
annual basis as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. As an 
alternative, the owner or operator can determine compliance on a monthly 
basis, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) Rolling annual compliance. In determining compliance on a 
rolling annual basis, actual HAP ABA emissions shall be compared to 
allowable HAP ABA emissions for each consecutive 12-month period. The 
allowable HAP ABA emission level shall be calculated based on the 
production for the 12-month period, resulting in a potentially different 
allowable level for each 12-month period. Compliance shall be determined 
each month for the previous 12-month period. The compliance requirements 
are provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Monthly compliance alternative. As an alternative to determining 
compliance on a rolling annual basis, an owner or operator can determine 
compliance by comparing actual HAP ABA emissions to allowable HAP ABA 
emissions for each month. The allowable HAP ABA emission level shall be 
calculated based on the production for the month, resulting in a 
potentially different allowable level each month. The requirements for 
this monthly compliance alternative are provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (3) Each owner or operator electing to change between the compliance 
methods described under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section 
shall notify the Administrator no later than 180 calendar days prior to 
the change.
    (b) Rolling annual compliance. At each slabstock foam production 
source complying with the rolling annual compliance provisions described 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, actual HAP ABA emissions shall not 
exceed the allowable HAP ABA emission level for a consecutive 12-month 
period. The actual HAP ABA emission level for a consecutive 12-month 
period shall be determined using the procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, and the allowable HAP ABA emission level for the 
corresponding 12-month period shall be calculated in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) The actual HAP ABA emissions for a 12-month period shall be 
calculated as the sum of actual monthly HAP ABA emissions for each of 
the individual 12 months in the period. Actual monthly HAP ABA emissions 
shall be equal to the amount of HAP ABA added to the slabstock foam 
production line at the mixhead, determined in accordance with 
Sec. 63.1303(b), unless a recovery device is used. Slabstock foam 
production sources using recovery devices to reduce HAP ABA emissions 
shall determine actual monthly HAP ABA emissions using the procedures in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) The allowable HAP ABA emissions for a consecutive 12-month 
period shall be calculated as the sum of allowable monthly HAP ABA 
emissions for each of the individual 12 months in the period. Allowable 
HAP ABA emissions for each individual month shall be calculated using 
Equation 2.

source complying with the source-wide emission limitation option 
provided in Sec. 63.1293(b) shall control HAP ABA storage and equipment 
leak emissions, HAP ABA emissions from the production line, and 
equipment cleaning HAP emissions in accordance with the provisions in 
this section. Compliance shall be determined on a rolling annual basis 
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. As an alternative, the 
owner or operator can determine compliance monthly, as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) Rolling annual compliance. Under the rolling annual compliance 
provisions, actual source-wide HAP ABA storage and equipment leak 
emissions, HAP ABA emissions from the production line, and equipment 
cleaning HAP emissions are compared to allowable source-wide emissions 
for each consecutive 12-month period. The allowable source-wide HAP 
emission level is calculated based on the production for the 12-month 
period, resulting in a potentially different allowable level for each 
12-month period. While compliance is on an annual basis, compliance 
shall be determined monthly for the preceding 12-month period. The 
actual source-wide HAP emission level for a consecutive 12-month period 
shall be determined using the procedures in

[[Page 200]]

paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section, unless a recovery device 
is used. Slabstock foam production sources using recovery devices shall 
determine actual source-wide HAP emissions in accordance with paragraph 
(e) of this section. The allowable HAP emission level for a consecutive 
12-month period shall be determined using the procedures in paragraph 
(d) of this section.

compliance on a rolling annual basis, an owner or operator can determine 
compliance by comparing actual HAP emissions to allowable HAP emissions 
for each month. The allowable source-wide emission level is calculated 
based on the production for the month, resulting in a potentially 
different allowable level each month. The actual monthly emission level 
shall be determined using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(3) of this section, unless a recovery device is used. Slabstock foam 
production sources using recovery devices shall determine actual source-
wide HAP emissions in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The 
allowable monthly HAP ABA emission level shall be determined in 
accordance with Equation 6.
    (c) Procedures for determining actual source-wide HAP emissions. The 
actual source-wide HAP ABA storage and equipment leak emissions, HAP ABA 
emissions from the production line, and equipment cleaning HAP emissions 
shall be determined using the procedures in this section. Actual source-
wide HAP emissions for each individual month shall be determined using

Sec. 63.1304  Testing requirements.

    Owners and operators of affected sources shall use the test methods 
listed in this section, as applicable, to demonstrate compliance with 
this subpart.
    (a) Test method and procedures to determine equipment leaks. 
Monitoring, as required under Sec. 63.1296, shall comply with the 
following requirements:
    (1) Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    (2) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of 
Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except that the instrument 
response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for 
the average composition of the source fluid, rather than for each 
individual VOC in the stream. For source streams that contain nitrogen, 
air, or other inerts which are not HAP or VOC, the average stream 
response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis. The response 
factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for 
leaks will be conducted.
    (3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its 
use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A.
    (4) Calibration gases shall be:
    (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); and
    (ii) A mixture of methane and air at a concentration of 
approximately, 1,000 ppm for all transfer pumps; and 500 ppm for all 
other equipment, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this 
section.
    (iii) The instrument may be calibrated at a higher methane 
concentration (up to 2,000 ppm) than the leak definition concentration 
for a specific piece of equipment for monitoring that piece of 
equipment. If the monitoring instrument's design allows for multiple 
calibration gas concentrations, then the lower concentration calibration 
gas shall be no higher than 2,000 ppm methane and the higher 
concentration calibration gas shall be no higher than 10,000 ppm 
methane.
    (5) Monitoring shall be performed when the equipment is in HAP ABA 
service, in use with an acceptable surrogate volatile organic compound 
which is not a HAP ABA, or is in use with any other detectable gas or 
vapor.
    (6) If no instrument is available onsite that will meet the 
performance criteria specified in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 of 40 
CFR Part 60, appendix A, the readings from an available instrument may 
be adjusted by multiplying by the average response factor for the 
stream.
    (b) Test method to determine foam properties. The IFD and density of 
each grade of foam produced during each run of foam shall be determined 
using ASTM D3574-91, Standard Test Methods for Flexible Cellular 
Materials--Slab, Bonded, and Molded (incorporation by reference--see 
Sec. 63.14), using a sample of foam cut from the center of the foam bun. 
The maximum sample size for which the IFD and density is determined 
shall not be larger than 24 inches by 24 inches by 4 inches. For grades 
of foam where the owner or operator has designated the HAP ABA 
formulation limitation as zero, the owner or operator is not required to 
determine the IFD and density in accordance with this paragraph.

means of emission limitation in the precompliance report for existing 
sources, the application for construction or reconstruction for new 
sources, or at any time.
    (b) This request shall include a complete description of the 
alternative means of emission limitation.
    (c) Each owner or operator applying for permission to use an 
alternative means of emission limitation under Sec. 63.6(g) shall be 
responsible for collecting and verifying data to demonstrate the 
emission reduction achieved by the alternative means of emission 
limitation.
    (d) Use of the alternative means of emission limitation shall not 
begin

<R05>
Sec. 63.1310  Applicability and designation of affected sources.

    (a) Definition of affected source. The provisions of this subpart 
apply to each affected source. Affected sources are described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
    (1) An affected source is either an existing affected source or a 
new affected source. Existing affected source is defined in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, and new affected source is defined in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (2) An existing affected source is defined as each group of one or 
more thermoplastic product process units (TPPU) and associated 
equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section that is not 
part of a new affected source, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, that is manufacturing the same primary product, and that is 
located at a plant site that is a major source.
    (3) A new affected source is defined by the criteria in paragraph 
(a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii), or (a)(3)(iii) of this section. The situation 
described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is distinct from those 
situations described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (a)(3)(iii) of this 
section and from any situation described in paragraph (i) of this 
section.
    (i) At a site without HAP emission points before March 29, 1995 
(i.e., a ``greenfield'' site), each group of one or more TPPU and 
associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
that is manufacturing the same primary product and that is part of a 
major source on which construction commenced after March 29, 1995;
    (ii) A group of one or more TPPU meeting the criteria in paragraph 
(i)(1)(i) of this section; or
    (iii) A reconstructed affected source meeting the criteria in 
paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section.
    (4) Emission points and equipment. The affected source also includes 
the emission points and equipment specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) 
through (a)(4)(vi) of this section that are associated with each 
applicable group of one or more TPPU constituting an affected source.
    (i) Each waste management unit.
    (ii) Maintenance wastewater.
    (iii) Each heat exchange system.
    (iv) Each process contact cooling tower used in the manufacture of 
PET that is associated with a new affected source.
    (v) Each process contact cooling tower used in the manufacture of 
PET using a continuous terephthalic acid high viscosity multiple end 
finisher process that is associated with an existing affected source.
    (vi) Equipment required by, or utilized as a method of compliance 
with, this subpart which may include control devices and recovery 
devices.
    (5) TPPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, that are located at plant sites that are not major sources 
are neither affected sources nor part of an affected source.
    (b) TPPUs without organic HAP. The owner or operator of a TPPU that 
is part of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
section, but that

[[Page 220]]

does not use or manufacture any organic HAP shall comply with the 
requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. Such 
a TPPU is not subject to any other provisions of this subpart and is not 
required to comply with the provisions of subpart A of this part.
    (1) Retain information, data, and analyses used to document the 
basis for the determination that the TPPU does not use or manufacture 
any organic HAP. Types of information that could document this 
determination include, but are not limited to, records of chemicals 
purchased for the process, analyses of process stream composition, 
engineering calculations, or process knowledge.
    (2) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the TPPU 
does not use or manufacture any organic HAP.
    (c) Emission points not subject to the provisions of this subpart. 
The affected source includes the emission points listed in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section, but these emission points are not 
subject to the requirements of this subpart or to the provisions of 
subpart A of this part.
    (1) Equipment that does not contain organic HAP and is located 
within a TPPU that is part of an affected source;
    (2) Stormwater from segregated sewers;
    (3) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems in segregated 
sewers;
    (4) Spills;
    (5) Water from safety showers;
    (6) Water from testing of deluge systems;
    (7) Water from testing of firefighting systems;
    (8) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that 
contain no organic HAP and/or organic HAP as impurities only; and
    (9) Equipment that is intended to operate in organic HAP service for 
less than 300 hours during the calendar year.
    (d) Processes exempted from the affected source. The processes 
specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section are 
exempted from the affected source:
    (1) Research and development facilities;
    (2) Polymerization processes occurring in a mold;
    (3) Processes which manufacture binder systems containing a 
thermoplastic product for paints, coatings, or adhesives;
    (4) Finishing processes including equipment such as compounding 
units, spinning units, drawing units, extruding units, and other 
finishing steps; and
    (5) Solid state polymerization processes.
    (e) Applicability determination of nonthermoplastic equipment 
included within the boundaries of a TPPU. If a polymer that is not a 
thermoplastic product is produced within the equipment (i.e., 
collocated) making up a TPPU and at least 50 percent of that polymer is 
used in the production of a thermoplastic product manufactured by the 
same TPPU, then the unit operations involved in the production of that 
polymer are considered part of the TPPU and are subject to this subpart, 
with the following exception. Any emission points from such unit 
operations that are subject to another subpart of this part with an 
effective date prior to September 5, 1996 shall remain subject to that 
other subpart of this part and are not subject to this subpart.
    (f) Primary product determination and applicability. An owner or 
operator of a process unit that produces or plans to produce a 
thermoplastic product shall determine if the process unit is subject to 
this subpart in accordance with this paragraph. The owner or operator 
shall initially determine whether a process unit is designated as a TPPU 
and subject to the provisions of this subpart in accordance with either 
paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section. The owner or operator of a 
flexible operation unit that was not initially designated as a TPPU, but 
in which a thermoplastic product is produced, shall conduct an annual 
re-determination of the applicability of this subpart in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Owners or operators that anticipate 
the production of a thermoplastic product in a process unit that was not 
initially designated as a TPPU, and in which no thermoplastic products 
are

[[Page 221]]

currently produced, shall determine if the process unit is subject to 
this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section. 
Paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(5) through (f)(7) of this section discuss 
compliance only for flexible operation units. Other paragraphs apply to 
all process units, including flexible operation units, unless otherwise 
noted. Paragraph (f)(8) of this section contains reporting requirements 
associated with the applicability determinations. Paragraphs (f)(9) and 
(f)(10) of this section describe criteria for removing the TPPU 
designation from a process unit.
    (1) Initial determination. The owner or operator shall initially 
determine if a process unit is subject to the provisions of this subpart 
based on the primary product of the process unit in accordance with 
paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. If the process unit 
never uses or manufactures any organic HAP, regardless of the outcome of 
the primary product determination, the only requirements of this subpart 
that might apply to the process unit are contained in paragraph (b) of 
this section. If a flexible operation unit does not use or manufacture 
any organic HAP during the manufacture of one or more products, 
paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section applies to that flexible operation 
unit.
    (i) If a process unit only manufactures one product, then that 
product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.
    (ii) If a process unit produces more than one intended product at 
the same time, the primary product shall be determined in accordance 
with paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) The product for which the process unit has the greatest annual 
design capacity on a mass basis shall represent the primary product of 
the process unit, or
    (B) If a process unit has the same maximum annual design capacity on 
a mass basis for two or more products, and if one of those products is a 
thermoplastic product, then the thermoplastic product shall represent 
the primary product of the process unit.
    (iii) If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible 
operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in 
paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section based on the 
anticipated operations for the 5 years following September 12, 1996 at 
existing process units, or for the first year after the process unit 
begins production of any product for new process units. If operations 
cannot be anticipated sufficiently to allow the determination of the 
primary product for the specified period, applicability shall be 
determined (in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (A) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for 
the greatest operating time over the specified 5 year period for 
existing process units, or the specified 1 year period for new process 
units, then that product shall represent the primary product of the 
flexible operation unit.
    (B) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple 
products equally based on operating time, then the product with the 
greatest expected production on a mass basis over the specified 5 year 
period for existing process units, or the specified 1 year period for 
new process units shall represent the primary product of the flexible 
operation unit.
    (iv) If, according to paragraph (f)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section, the primary product of a process unit is a thermoplastic 
product, then that process unit shall be designated as a TPPU. That TPPU 
and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
is either an affected source or part of an affected source comprised of 
other TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at 
the same plant site that is a major source. If the primary product of a 
process unit is determined to be a product that is not a thermoplastic 
product, then that process unit is not a TPPU.
    (2) If the primary product cannot be determined for a flexible 
operation unit in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, 
applicability shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph.
    (i) If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product in 
accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, but can determine 
that a

[[Page 222]]

thermoplastic product is not the primary product, then that flexible 
operation unit is not a TPPU.
    (ii) If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product 
in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, and cannot 
determine that a thermoplastic product is not the primary product as 
specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, applicability shall be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) or (f)(2)(ii)(B) 
of this section.
    (A) If the flexible operation unit is an existing process unit, the 
flexible operation unit shall be designated as a TPPU if a thermoplastic 
product was produced for 5 percent or greater of the total operating 
time of the flexible operating unit since March 9, 1999. That TPPU and 
associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is 
either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of 
other TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at 
the same plant site that is a major source. For a flexible operation 
unit that is designated as an TPPU in accordance with this paragraph, 
the thermoplastic product produced for the greatest amount of time since 
March 9, 1999 shall be designated as the primary product of the TPPU.
    (B) If the flexible operation unit is a new process unit, the 
flexible operation unit shall be designated as a TPPU if the owner or 
operator anticipates that a thermoplastic product will be manufactured 
in the flexible operation unit at any time in the first year after the 
date the unit begins production of any product. That TPPU and associated 
equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an 
affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other TPPU 
and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant 
site that is a major source. For a process unit that is designated as a 
TPPU in accordance with this paragraph, the thermoplastic product that 
will be produced shall be designated as the primary product of the TPPU. 
If more than one thermoplastic product will be produced, the owner or 
operator may select which thermoplastic product is designated as the 
primary product.
    (3) Annual applicability determination for non-TPPUs that have 
produced a thermoplastic product. Once per year beginning September 12, 
2001, the owner or operator of each flexible operation unit that is not 
designated as a TPPU, but that has produced a thermoplastic product at 
any time in the preceding 5-year period or since the date that the unit 
began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall perform the 
evaluation described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this 
section. However, an owner or operator that does not intend to produce 
any thermoplastic product in the future, in accordance with paragraph 
(f)(9) of this section, is not required to perform the evaluation 
described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (i) For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the 
owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time 
over which the product was produced during the preceding 5-year period.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the 
product with the highest percentage of total operating time for the 
preceding 5-year period.
    (iii) If the primary product identified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) is a 
thermoplastic product, the flexible operation unit shall be designated 
as a TPPU. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later 
than 45 days after determining that the flexible operation unit is a 
TPPU, and shall comply with the requirements of this subpart in 
accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section for the flexible 
operation unit.
    (4) Applicability determination for non-TPPUs that have not produced 
a thermoplastic product. The owner or operator that anticipates the 
production of a thermoplastic product in a process unit that is not 
designated as a TPPU, and in which no thermoplastic products have been 
produced in the previous 5-year period or since the date that the 
process unit began production of any

[[Page 223]]

product, whichever is shorter, shall determine if the process unit is 
subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (ii) 
of this section. Also, owners or operators who have notified the 
Administrator that a process unit is not a TPPU in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(9) of this section, that now anticipate the production of 
a thermoplastic product in the process unit, shall determine if the 
process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraphs 
(f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) The owner or operator shall use the procedures in paragraph 
(f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section to determine if the process unit is 
designated as a TPPU, with the following exception: For existing process 
units that are determining the primary product in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, production shall be projected for 
the five years following the date that the owner or operator anticipates 
initiating the production of a thermoplastic product.
    (ii) If the unit is designated as a TPPU in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply 
in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
    (5) Compliance for flexible operation units. Owners or operators of 
TPPUs that are flexible operation units shall comply with the standards 
specified for the primary product, with the exceptions provided in 
paragraphs (f)(5)(i) and (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (i) Whenever a flexible operation unit manufactures a product in 
which no organic HAP is used or manufactured, the owner or operator is 
only required to comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this 
section to demonstrate compliance for activities associated with the 
manufacture of that product. This subpart does not require compliance 
with the provisions of subpart A of this part for activities associated 
with the manufacture of a product that meets the criteria of paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (ii) Whenever a flexible operation unit manufactures a product that 
makes it subject to subpart GGG of this part, the owner or operator is 
not required to comply with the provisions of this subpart during the 
production of that product.
    (6) Owners or operators of TPPUs that are flexible operation units 
have the option of determining the group status of each emission point 
associated with the flexible operation unit, in accordance with either 
paragraph (f)(6)(i) or (f)(6)(ii) of this section, with the exception of 
batch process vents. For batch process vents, the owner or operator 
shall determine the group status in accordance with Sec. 63.1323.
    (i) The owner or operator may determine the group status of each 
emission point based on emission point characteristics when the primary 
product is being manufactured. The criteria that shall be used for this 
group determination are the Group 1 criteria specified for the primary 
product.
    (ii) The owner or operator may determine the group status of each 
emission point separately for each product produced by the flexible 
operation unit. For each product, the group status shall be determined 
using the emission point characteristics when that product is being 
manufactured and using the Group 1 criteria specified for the primary 
product. (Note: Under this scenario, it is possible that the group 
status, and therefore the requirement to achieve emission reductions, 
for an emission point may change depending on the product being 
manufactured.)
    (7) Owners or operators determining the group status of emission 
points in flexible operation units based solely on the primary product 
in accordance with paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section shall establish 
parameter monitoring levels, as required, in accordance with either 
paragraph (f)(7)(i) or (f)(7)(ii) of this section. Owners or operators 
determining the group status of emission points in flexible operation 
units based on each product in accordance with paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of 
this section shall establish parameter monitoring levels, as required, 
in accordance with paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section.
    (i) Establish separate parameter monitoring levels in accordance 
with Sec. 63.1334(a) for each individual product.
    (ii) Establish a single parameter monitoring level (for each 
parameter

[[Page 224]]

required to be monitored at each device subject to monitoring 
requirements) in accordance with Sec. 63.1334(a) that would apply for 
all products.
    (8) Reporting requirements. When it is determined that a process 
unit is a TPPU and subject to the requirements of this subpart, the 
Notification of Compliance Status required by Sec. 63.1335(e)(5) shall 
include the information specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(i) and (f)(8)(ii) 
of this section, as applicable. If it is determined that the process 
unit is not subject to this subpart, the owner or operator shall either 
retain all information, data, and analysis used to document the basis 
for the determination that the primary product is not a thermoplastic 
product, or, when requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the 
process unit is not subject to this subpart.
    (i) If the TPPU manufactures only one thermoplastic product, 
identification of that thermoplastic product.
    (ii) If the TPPU is designed and operated as a flexible operation 
unit, the information specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(ii)(A) through 
(f)(8)(ii)(D) of this section, as appropriate, shall be submitted.
    (A) If a primary product could be determined, identification of the 
primary product.
    (B) Identification of which compliance option, either paragraph 
(f)(6)(i) or (f)(6)(ii) of this section, has been selected by the owner 
or operator.
    (C) If the option to establish separate parameter monitoring levels 
for each product in paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section is selected, the 
identification of each product and the corresponding parameter 
monitoring level.
    (D) If the option to establish a single parameter monitor level in 
paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section is selected, the parameter 
monitoring level for each parameter.
    (9) TPPUs terminating production of all thermoplastic products. If a 
TPPU terminates the production of all thermoplastic products and does 
not anticipate the production of any thermoplastic products in the 
future, the process unit is no longer a TPPU and is not subject to this 
subpart after notification is made to the Administrator. This 
notification shall be accompanied by a rationale for why it is 
anticipated that no thermoplastic products will be produced in the 
process unit in the future.
    (10) Redetermination of applicability to TPPUs that are flexible 
operation units. Whenever changes in production occur that could 
reasonably be expected to change the primary product of a TPPU that is 
operating as a flexible operation unit from a thermoplastic product to a 
product that would make the process unit subject to another subpart of 
this part, the owner or operator shall re-evaluate the status of the 
process unit as a TPPU in accordance with paragraphs (f)(10)(i) through 
(iii) of this section.
    (i) For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the 
owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time 
in which the product was produced for the preceding five-year period, or 
since the date that the process unit began production of any product, 
whichever is shorter.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the 
product with the highest percentage of total operating time for the 
period.
    (iii) If the conditions in (f)(10)(iii)(A) through (C) of this 
section are met, the flexible operation unit shall no longer be 
designated as a TPPU and shall no longer be subject to the provisions of 
this subpart after the date that the process unit is required to be in 
compliance with the provisions of the other subpart of this part to 
which it is subject. If the conditions in paragraphs (f)(10)(iii)(A) 
through (C) of this section are not met, the flexible operation unit 
shall continue to be considered a TPPU and subject to the requirements 
of this subpart.
    (A) The product identified in (f)(10)(ii) of this section is not a 
thermoplastic product; and
    (B) The production of the product identified in (f)(10)(ii) of this 
section is subject to another subpart of this part; and
    (C) The owner or operator submits a notification to the 
Administrator of the pending change in applicability.
    (g) Storage vessel ownership determination. The owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through 
(g)(7) of this section to

[[Page 225]]

determine to which process unit a storage vessel shall be assigned. 
Paragraph (g)(8) of this section specifies when an owner or operator is 
required to redetermine to which process unit a storage vessel is 
assigned.
    (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 40 
CFR part 63 on September 12, 1996, said storage vessel shall be assigned 
to the process unit subject to the other subpart.
    (2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.
    (3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit located on the 
same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into 
or output from the storage vessel (i.e., said process unit has the 
predominant use of the storage vessel).
    (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units and if only one of those process 
units is a TPPU subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be 
assigned to said TPPU.
    (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process 
units are TPPUs that have different primary products and that are 
subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the 
storage vessel to any one of the said TPPUs.
    (6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to 
year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization 
that occurred during the year preceding September 12, 1996 or based on 
the expected utilization for the 5 years following September 12, 1996 
for existing affected sources, whichever is more representative of the 
expected operations for said storage vessel, and based on the expected 
utilization for the first 5 years after initial start-up for new 
affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported 
in the Notification of Compliance Status, as required by 
Sec. 63.1335(e)(5)(vi).
    (7) Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that 
includes one or more process units which place material into, or receive 
materials from the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in 
a tank farm (including a marine tank farm), the applicability of this 
subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs 
(g)(7)(i) through (g)(7)(iv) of this section.
    (i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that 
utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage 
vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate). With respect 
to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage 
vessel connected by hard-piping both to the process unit and to the 
storage vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering 
or leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage 
vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in 
the tank farm.
    (ii) If there is no process unit at the major source that meets the 
criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a 
storage vessel, this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel.
    (iii) If there is only one process unit at the major source that 
meets the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section with respect 
to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that 
process unit.
    (iv) If there are two or more process units at the major source that 
meet the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section with respect to 
a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those 
process units according to the provisions of paragraphs (g)(3) through 
(g)(6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among 
only those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) 
of this section.
    (8) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) a process unit that was not included in the initial 
determination, or ceases to receive material from (or send material to) 
a process unit, the owner or operator shall re-evaluate the 
applicability of this subpart to the storage vessel.
    (h) Recovery operations equipment ownership determination. The owner 
or operator shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (h)(6)

[[Page 226]]

of this section to determine to which process unit recovery operations 
equipment shall be assigned. Paragraph (h)(7) of this section specifies 
when an owner or operator is required to redetermine to which process 
unit the recovery operations equipment is assigned.
    (1) If recovery operations equipment is already subject to another 
subpart of 40 CFR part 63 on September 12, 1996, said recovery 
operations equipment shall be assigned to the process unit subject to 
the other subpart.
    (2) If recovery operations equipment is dedicated to a single 
process unit, the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to 
that process unit.
    (3) If recovery operations equipment is shared among process units, 
then the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to that process 
unit located on the same plant site as the recovery operations equipment 
that has the greatest input into or output from the recovery operations 
equipment (i.e., said process unit has the predominant use of the 
recovery operations equipment).
    (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operations 
equipment that is shared among process units and if one of those process 
units is a TPPU subject to this subpart, the recovery operations 
equipment shall be assigned to said TPPU.
    (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operations 
equipment that is shared among process units and if more than one of the 
process units are TPPUs that have different primary products and that 
are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the 
recovery operations equipment to any one of said TPPUs.
    (6) If the predominant use of recovery operations equipment varies 
from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the 
utilization that occurred during the year preceding September 12, 1996 
or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following September 
12, 1996 for existing affected sources, whichever is the more 
representative of the expected operations for said recovery operations 
equipment, and based on the first 5 years after initial start-up for new 
affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported 
in the Notification of Compliance Status, as required by 
Sec. 63.1335(e)(5)(vii).
    (7) If a piece of recovery operations equipment begins receiving 
material from a process unit that was not included in the initial 
determination, or ceases to receive material from a process unit that 
was included in the initial determination, the owner or operator shall 
reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to that recovery operations 
equipment.
    (i) Changes or additions to plant sites. The provisions of 
paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4) of this section apply to owners or 
operators that change or add to their plant site or affected source. 
Paragraph (i)(5) of this section provides examples of what are and are 
not considered process changes for purposes of this paragraph (i) of 
this section. Paragraph (i)(6) of this section discusses reporting 
requirements.
    (1) Adding a TPPU to a plant site. The provisions of paragraphs 
(i)(1)(i) and (i)(1)(ii) of this section apply to owners or operators 
that add one or more TPPUs to a plant site.
    (i) If a group of one or more TPPUs that produce the same primary 
product is added to a plant site, the added group of one or more TPPUs 
and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements 
for a new affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up or by 
June 19, 2000, whichever is later, as provided in Sec. 63.6(b), except 
that new affected sources whose primary product, as determined using the 
procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section, is poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) (PET) shall be in compliance with Sec. 63.1331 upon 
initial start-up or February 27, 2001, whichever is later, if the added 
group of one or more TPPUs meets the criteria in either paragraph 
(i)(1)(i)(A) or (i)(1)(i)(B) of this section, and the criteria in either 
paragraph (i)(1)(i)(C) or (i)(1)(i)(D) of this section are met.
    (A) The construction of the group of one or more TPPUs commenced 
after March 29, 1995.

[[Page 227]]

    (B) The construction or reconstruction, for process units that have 
become TPPUs, commenced after March 29, 1995.
    (C) The group of one or more TPPUs and associated equipment, as 
listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, has the potential to emit 10 
tons per year or more of any HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any 
combination of HAP, and the primary product of the group of one or more 
TPPUs is currently produced at the plant site as the primary product of 
an affected source; or
    (D) The primary product of the group of one or more TPPUs is not 
currently produced at the plant site as the primary product of an 
affected source and the plant site meets, or after the addition of the 
group of one or more TPPUs and associated equipment, as listed in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, will meet the definition of a major 
source.
    (ii) If a group of one or more TPPUs that produce the same primary 
product is added to a plant site, and the group of one or more TPPUs 
does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this 
section, and the plant site meets, or after the addition will meet, the 
definition of a major source, the group of one or more TPPUs and 
associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
shall comply with the requirements for an existing affected source in 
this subpart upon initial start-up; by June 19, 2001; or by 6 months 
after notifying the Administrator that a process unit has been 
designated as a TPPU (in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this 
section), whichever is later.
    (2) Adding emission points or making process changes to existing 
affected sources. The provisions of paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through 
(i)(2)(ii) of this section apply to owners or operators that add 
emission points or make process changes to an existing affected source.
    (i) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source 
such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through 
(i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are met, the entire affected source shall 
be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a 
new affected source upon initial start-up or by June 19, 2000, whichever 
is later, as provided in Sec. 63.6(b), except that new affected sources 
whose primary product is poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) shall be in 
compliance with Sec. 63.1331 upon initial start-up or by February 27, 
2001, whichever is later.
    (A) The replacement of components meets the definition of 
reconstruction in Sec. 63.1312(b); and
    (B) Such reconstruction commenced after March 29, 1995.
    (ii) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source 
such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through 
(i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are not met, and that replacement of 
components creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either 
newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change 
group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point 
to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, equipment leak components 
subject to Sec. 63.1331, continuous process vents subject to 
Secs. 63.1316 through 63.1320, heat exchange systems subject to 
Sec. 63.1328, and process contact cooling towers subject to 
Sec. 63.1329), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the 
applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting 
emission points shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of 
initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in 
Sec. 63.1311 (i.e., February 27, 1998 for most equipment leak components 
subject to Sec. 63.1331, June 19, 2001 for most emission points other 
than equipment leaks, and February 27, 2001 for process contact cooling 
towers at sources that produce PET as the primary product), whichever is 
later.
    (iii) If an addition or process change (not including a process 
change that solely replaces components) is made to an existing affected 
source that creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either 
newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change 
group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point 
to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, equipment leak components 
subject to Sec. 63.1331, continuous process vents subject to 
Secs. 63.1316 through 63.1320, heat exchange systems subject to 
Sec. 63.1328, and process contact cooling towers subject to 
Sec. 63.1329), the

[[Page 228]]

resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable 
requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission 
point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial 
start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in Sec. 63.1311 
(i.e., February 27, 1998 for most equipment leak components subject to 
Sec. 63.1331, June 19, 2001 for most emission points other than 
equipment leaks, and February 27, 2001 for process contact cooling 
towers at sources that produce PET as their primary product), whichever 
is later.
    (iv) If any process change (not including a process change that 
solely replaces components) is made to an existing affected source that 
results in baseline emissions (i.e., emissions prior to applying 
controls for purposes of complying with this subpart) from continuous 
process vents in the collection of material recovery sections within the 
affected source at an existing affected source producing PET using a 
continuous dimethyl terephthalate process changing from less than or 
equal to 0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product to greater than 0.12 kg 
organic HAP per Mg of product, the continuous process vents shall be 
subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. 
The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after 
the date of initial start-up or by June 19, 2001, whichever is later.
    (3) Existing affected source requirements for surge control vessels 
and bottoms receivers that become subject to subpart H requirements. If 
a process change or addition of an emission point causes a surge control 
vessel or bottoms receiver to become subject to Sec. 63.170 under this 
paragraph (i), the owner or operator shall be in compliance upon initial 
start-up or by June 19, 2001, whichever is later.
    (4) Existing affected source requirements for compressors that 
become subject to the requirements of subpart H of this part. If a 
process change or the addition of an emission point causes a compressor 
to become subject to Sec. 63.164 under this paragraph (i), the owner or 
operator shall be in compliance upon initial start-up or by the 
compliance date for that compressor as specified in Sec. 63.1311(d)(1) 
through (d)(4), whichever is later.
    (5) Determining what are and are not process changes. For purposes 
of paragraph (i) of this section, examples of process changes include, 
but are not limited to, changes in feedstock type, or process catalyst 
type, or the replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment, or 
equipment changes that increase production capacity. For purposes of 
paragraph (i) of this section, process changes do not include: Process 
upsets, unintentional temporary process changes, and changes that do not 
alter the equipment configuration and operating conditions.
    (6) Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or 
add to their plant site or affected source. Owners or operators that 
change or add to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in 
paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section, shall submit a report as 
specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(7)(iv).
    (j) Applicability of this subpart during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation. Paragraphs (j)(1) through 
(j)(4) of this section shall be followed during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation of the affected source or any 
part thereof.
    (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the 
emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all 
times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or 
specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to 
which this subpart applies. The emission limitations of this subpart and 
the emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall not apply 
during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, except as provided 
in paragraphs (j)(3) and (j)(4) of this section. During periods of 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, the owner or operator shall follow 
the applicable provisions of the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction 
plan required by Sec. 63.1335(b)(1). However, if a start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or period of non-operation of one portion of an affected 
source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to 
comply with the emission limitations to which it is subject, then that

[[Page 229]]

emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable 
emission limitations of this subpart during the start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or period of non-operation. For example, if there is an 
overpressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel that is part of the 
affected source would still be required to be controlled in accordance 
with the emission limitations in Sec. 63.1314. Similarly, the degassing 
of a storage vessel would not affect the ability of a batch process vent 
to meet the emission limitations of Secs. 63.1321 through 63.1327.
    (2) The emission limitations set forth in subpart H of this part, as 
referred to in Sec. 63.1331, shall apply at all times except during 
periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion 
thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in 
cessation of the emissions to which Sec. 63.1331 applies, or during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, malfunction, or process unit shutdown (as 
defined in Sec. 63.161).
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during times when 
emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are 
being routed to such items of equipment, if the shutdown would 
contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items of 
equipment. This paragraph (j)(3) does not apply if the item of equipment 
is malfunctioning. This paragraph also does not apply if the owner or 
operator shuts down the compliance equipment (other than monitoring 
systems) to avoid damage due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or 
malfunction of the affected source or portion thereof. If the owner or 
operator has reason to believe that monitoring equipment would be 
damaged due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of 
the affected source or portion thereof, the owner or operator shall 
provide documentation supporting such a claim in the Precompliance 
Report or in a supplement to the Precompliance Report, as provided in 
Sec. 63.1335(e)(3). Once approved by the Administrator in accordance 
with Sec. 63.1335(e)(3)(viii), the provision for ceasing to collect, 
during a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data that would 
otherwise be required by the provisions of this subpart must be 
incorporated into the start-up, shutdown, malfunction plan for that 
affected source, as stated in Sec. 63.1335(b)(1).
    (4) During start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (j)(1) 
through (j)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, 
to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize 
excess emissions to the extent practical. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term ``excess emissions'' means emissions greater than 
those allowed by the emissions limitation which would apply during 
operational periods other than start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. The 
measures to be taken shall be identified in the applicable start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan, and may include, but are not limited to, 
air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work 
practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the 
manner of operation of the affected source. Back-up control devices are 
not required, but may be used if available.

    (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this 
section, existing affected sources whose primary product, as determined 
using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1310(f), is PET shall be in 
compliance with Sec. 63.1331 no later than February 27, 2001.
    (e) Pursuant to Section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, an owner or 
operator may request an extension allowing the existing affected source 
up to 1 additional year to comply with Section 112(d) standards. For 
purposes of this subpart, a request for an extension shall be submitted 
to the permitting authority as part of the operating permit application 
or to the Administrator as a separate submittal or as part of the 
Precompliance Report. Requests for extensions shall be submitted no 
later than 120 days prior to the compliance dates specified in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, or as specified elsewhere in 
this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. 
The dates specified in Sec. 63.6(i) for submittal of requests for 
extensions shall not apply to this subpart.
    (1) A request for an extension of compliance shall include the data 
described in Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i) (A),(B), and (D).
    (2) The requirements in Sec. 63.6(i)(8) through Sec. 63.6(i)(14) 
shall govern the review and approval of requests for extensions of 
compliance with this subpart.
    (3) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request 
after the date specified in paragraph (e) of this section, provided that 
the need for the compliance extension arose after that date, and the 
need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner 
or operator. This request shall include, in addition to the information 
specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a statement of the 
reasons additional time is needed and the date when the owner or 
operator first learned of the circumstances necessitating a request for 
compliance extension under this paragraph (e)(3).
    (f) Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of 
this part that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators 
of affected sources subject to this subpart.
    (g)(1) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an 
affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the 
provisions of subpart I of this part, is required to comply only with 
the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in 
this section, said affected source shall no longer be subject to subpart 
I of this part.
    (2) Said affected sources that elected to comply with subpart I of 
this part through a quality improvement program, as specified in 
Sec. 63.175 or Sec. 63.176 or both, may elect to continue these programs 
without interruption as a means of complying with this subpart. In other 
words, becoming subject to this subpart does not restart or reset the 
``compliance clock'' as it relates to reduced burden earned through a 
quality improvement program.
    (h) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage 
vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart 
and that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart 
Kb, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. 
After the compliance dates specified in this section, said storage 
vessel shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb.
    (i)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this 
section, after the compliance dates specified in this section, affected 
sources producing PET using a continuous terephthalic acid process, 
producing PET using a continuous dimethyl terephthalate process, or 
producing polystyrene resin using a continuous process subject to this 
subpart that are also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, 
subpart DDD, are required to comply only with the provisions of this 
subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said 
sources shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDD.
    (2) Existing affected sources producing PET using a continuous 
terephthalic acid high viscosity multiple end finisher process shall 
continue to be subject to 40 CFR 60.562-1(c)(2)(ii)(C). Once said 
affected source becomes subject to and achieves compliance with 
Sec. 63.1329(c) of this subpart, said affected source is no longer 
subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDD.

[[Page 232]]

    (3) Existing affected sources producing PET using a continuous 
terephthalic acid process, but not using a continuous terephthalic acid 
high viscosity multiple end finisher process, that are subject to and 
complying with 40 CFR 60.562-1(c)(2)(ii)(B) shall continue to comply 
with said section. Existing affected sources producing PET using a 
continuous dimethyl terephthalic process that are subject to and 
complying with 40 CFR 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B) shall continue to comply 
with said section.
    (j) Owners or operators of affected sources subject to this subpart

    (1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in this subpart for 
completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as 
specified in subpart A of this part (e.g., a period could begin on the 
compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the 
standard calendar period). For each time period that is changed by 
agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is 
changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.
    (2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar 
period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the 
period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified 
in paragraphs (o)(2)(i) or (o)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate.

affected source begins production of a thermoplastic product, or, for 
equipment added or changed as described in Sec. 63.1310(i), the first 
time the equipment is put into operation to produce a thermoplastic 
product. Initial start-up does not include operation solely for testing 
equipment. Initial start-up does not include subsequent start-ups of an 
affected source or portion thereof following malfunctions or shutdowns 
or following changes in product for flexible operation units or 
following recharging of equipment in batch operation. Further, for

material recovery section means the equipment that recovers unreacted 
styrene from any process section for use, reuse, or sale, or the 
equipment that separates materials containing unreacted styrene from any 
process section for off-site purification or treatment with the intent 
to recover styrene for reuse. Equipment used to store recovered 
materials (i.e., ethylene glycol, methanol, or styrene) is not included. 
Equipment designed to recover or separate materials from the polymer 
product is to be included in this process section, provided that at the 
time of initial compliance some of the unreacted or by-product material 
is recovered for return to the TPPU, or sale, or provided that some of 
the separated material is sent for off-site purification or treatment 
with the intent to recover the unreacted or by-product material for 
reuse. Otherwise, such equipment is to be assigned to one of the other 
process sections, as appropriate. If equipment is used to recover 
unreacted or by-product material and return it directly to the same 
piece of process equipment from which it was emitted, then that recovery 
equipment is considered part of the process section that contains the 
process equipment. On the other hand, if equipment is used to recover 
unreacted or by-product material and return it to a different piece of 
process equipment in the same process section, that recovery equipment 
is considered part of a material recovery section. Equipment used for 
the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from PET plants, however, is not 
included in the material recovery section; such equipment is to be 
included in the polymerization reaction section. Equipment used for the 
on-site recovery of both ethylene glycol and any other materials from 
PET plants is not included in the material recovery section; this

[[Page 238]]

equipment is to be included in the polymerization reaction section. Such 
equipment includes both contact and non-contact condensers removing 
ethylene glycol from vapor streams coming out of polymerization vessels.

copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-
terephthalate by weight.
    Polymerization reaction section means the equipment designed to 
cause monomer(s) to react to form polymers, including equipment designed 
primarily to cause the formation of short polymer chains (e.g., 
oligomers or low molecular weight polymers), but not including equipment 
designed to prepare raw materials for polymerization (e.g., 
esterification vessels). For the purposes of these standards, the 
polymerization reaction section begins with the equipment used to 
transfer the materials from the raw materials preparation section and 
ends with the last vessel in which polymerization occurs. Equipment used 
for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from PET plants is included 
in this process section, rather than in the material recovery process 
section.

reaction, and material recovery. A process section may be dedicated to a 
single TPPU or common to more than one TPPU.
    Process unit means a collection of equipment assembled and connected 
by hardpiping or duct work, used to process raw materials and to 
manufacture a product.
    Process vent means a gaseous emission stream from a unit operation 
that is discharged to the atmosphere either directly or after passing 
through one or more control, recovery, or recapture devices. Unit 
operations that may have process vents are condensers, distillation 
units, reactors, or other unit operations within the TPPU. Process vents 
exclude pressure releases, gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas 
system(s), and leaks from equipment regulated under Sec. 63.1331. A 
gaseous emission stream is no longer considered to be a process vent 
after the stream has been controlled and monitored in accordance with 
the applicable provisions of this subpart.
    Product means a polymer produced using the same monomers and varying 
in additives (e.g., initiators, terminators, etc.); catalysts; or in the 
relative proportions of monomers, that is manufactured by a process 
unit. With respect to polymers, more than one recipe may be used to 
produce the same product. As an example, styrene acrylonitrile resin and 
methyl methacrylate butadiene styrene resin each represent a different 
product. Product also means a chemical that is not a polymer, that is 
manufactured by a process unit. By-products, isolated intermediates, 
impurities, wastes, and trace contaminants are not considered products.
    Raw materials preparation section means the equipment at a polymer 
manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as monomers 
and solvents, for polymerization. For the purposes of the standards in 
this subpart, this process section includes the equipment used to 
transfer raw materials from storage and/or the equipment used to 
transfer recovered material from the material recovery process sections 
to the raw material preparation section, and ends with the last piece of 
equipment that prepares the material for polymerization. The raw 
materials preparation section may include equipment that is used to 
purify, dry, or otherwise treat raw materials or raw and recovered 
materials together; to activate catalysts; or to promote esterification 
including the formation of some short polymer chains (oligomers). The 
raw materials preparation section does not include equipment that is 
designed primarily to accomplish the formation of oligomers, the 
treatment of recovered materials alone, or the storage of raw or 
recovered materials.
    Recipe means a specific composition, from among the range of 
possible compositions that may occur within a product, as defined in 
this section. A recipe is determined by the proportions of monomers and, 
if present, other reactants and additives that are used to make the 
recipe. For example, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene latex resin (ABS 
latex) without additives; ABS latex with an additive; and ABS latex with 
different proportions of acrylonitrile to butadiene are all different 
recipes of the same product, ABS latex.
    Reconstruction means the addition of new components or the 
replacement of existing components at an affected source or at a 
previously unaffected stationary source that becomes an affected source 
as a result of the change, to such an extent that:
    (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent 
of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a 
comparable affected new source; and
    (2) It is technologically and economically feasible for the 
reconstructed source to meet the provisions of this subpart.
    Recovery device means:

[[Page 240]]

    (1) An individual unit of equipment capable of and normally used for 
the purpose of recovering chemicals for:
    (i) Use;
    (ii) Reuse;
    (iii) Fuel value (i.e., net heating value); or
    (iv) For sale for use, reuse, or fuel value (i.e., net heating 
value).
    (2) Examples of equipment that may be recovery devices include 
absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, oil-water separators or 
organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such as decanters, 
strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. For the purposes of the 
monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements of this subpart, 
recapture devices are considered recovery devices.
    Recovery operations equipment means the equipment used to separate 
the components of process streams. Recovery operations equipment 
includes distillation units, condensers, etc. Equipment used for 
wastewater treatment and recovery or recapture devices used as control 
devices shall not be considered recovery operations equipment.
    Residual is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that when the definition 
in Sec. 63.111 uses the term ``Table 9 compounds,'' the term ``organic 
HAP listed in Table 6 of subpart JJJ'' shall apply for purposes of this 
subpart.
    Shutdown means for purposes including, but not limited to, periodic 
maintenance, replacement of equipment, or repair, the cessation of 
operation of an affected source, a TPPU(s) within an affected source, a 
waste management unit or unit operation within an affected source, or 
equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, or the emptying 
or degassing of a storage vessel. For purposes of the wastewater 
provisions of Sec. 63.1330, shutdown does not include the routine 
rinsing or washing of equipment in batch operation between batches. For 
purposes of the batch process vent provisions in Secs. 63.1321 through 
63.1327, the cessation of equipment in batch operation is not a 
shutdown, unless the equipment undergoes maintenance, is replaced, or is 
repaired.
    Solid state polymerization process means a unit operation which, 
through the application of heat, furthers the polymerization (i.e., 
increases the intrinsic viscosity) of polymer chips.
    Start-up means the setting into operation of an affected source, a 
TPPU(s) within an affected source, a waste management unit or unit 
operation within an affected source, or equipment required or used to 
comply with this subpart, or a storage vessel after emptying and 
degassing. For both continuous and batch processes, start-up includes 
initial start-up and operation solely for testing equipment. For both 
continuous and batch processes, start-up does not include the recharging 
of equipment in batch operation. For continuous processes, start-up 
includes transitional conditions due to changes in product for flexible 
operation units. For batch processes, start-up does not include 
transitional conditions due to changes in product for flexible operation 
units.
    Steady-state conditions means that all variables (temperatures, 
pressures, volumes, flow rates, etc.) in a process do not vary 
significantly with time; minor fluctuations about constant mean values 
may occur.
    Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
liquids that contain one or more organic HAP. Storage vessels do not 
include:
    (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 
kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
    (3) Vessels with capacities smaller than 38 cubic meters;
    (4) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that 
contains no organic HAP and/or organic HAP as impurities only;
    (5) Wastewater storage tanks; and
    (6) Surge control vessels and bottoms receivers.
    Styrene acrylonitrile resin (SAN) means copolymers consisting 
primarily of styrene and acrylonitrile monomer units.
    Supplemental combustion air means the air that is added to a vent 
stream after the vent stream leaves the unit operation. Air that is part 
of the vent stream as a result of the nature of the unit operation is 
not considered supplemental combustion air. Air required to operate 
combustion device burner(s) is

[[Page 241]]

not considered supplemental combustion air. Air required to ensure the 
proper operation of catalytic oxidizers, to include the intermittent 
addition of air upstream of the catalyst bed to maintain a minimum 
threshold flow rate through the catalyst bed or to avoid excessive 
temperatures in the catalyst bed, is not considered to be supplemental 
combustion air.
    Suspension process means a polymerization process where the 
monomer(s) is in a state of suspension, with the help of suspending 
agents, in a medium other than water (typically an organic solvent). The 
resulting polymers are not soluble in the reactor medium.
    Thermoplastic product means one of the following types of products:
    (1) ABS latex;
    (2) ABS using a batch emulsion process;
    (3) ABS using a batch suspension process;

    Thermoplastic product process unit (TPPU) means a collection of 
equipment assembled and connected by hard-piping or ductwork, used to 
process raw materials and to manufacture a thermoplastic product as its 
primary product. This collection of equipment includes unit operations; 
recovery operations equipment, process vents; equipment identified in 
Sec. 63.149; storage vessels, as determined in Sec. 63.1310(g); and the 
equipment that is subject to the equipment leak provisions as specified 
in Sec. 63.1331. Utilities, lines and equipment not containing process 
fluids, and other non-process lines, such as heating and cooling systems 
which do not combine their materials with those in the processes they 
serve, are not part of the thermoplastic product process unit. A 
thermoplastic product process unit consists of more than one unit 
operation.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds excluding 
methane and ethane measured according to the procedures of Method 18 or 
Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    Total resource effectiveness index value or TRE index value means a 
measure of the supplemental total resource requirement per unit 
reduction organic HAP associated with a continuous process vent stream, 
based on vent stream flow rate, emission rate of organic HAP, net 
heating value, and corrosion properties (whether or not the continuous 
process vent stream contains halogenated compounds), as quantified by 
the equations given under Sec. 63.115.
    Vent stream, as used in reference to batch process vents, continuous 
process vents, and aggregate batch vent streams, means the emissions 
from one or more process vents.
    Waste management unit is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that where 
the definition in Sec. 63.111 uses the term ``chemical manufacturing 
process unit,'' the term ``TPPU'' shall apply for purposes of this 
subpart.
    Wastewater means water that:
    (1) Contains either:
    (i) An annual average concentration of organic HAP listed on Table 6 
of this subpart, except for ethylene glycol, of at least 5 parts per 
million by weight and has an annual average flow rate of 0.02 liter per 
minute or greater; or

    (18) When a combustion device is used to comply with the 20 parts 
per million by volume outlet concentration standard specified in 
Sec. 63.113(a)(2), the correction to 3 percent oxygen is only required 
when supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions, for 
the purposes of this subpart. In addition, the correction to 3 percent 
oxygen specified in Sec. 63.116(c)(3) and (c)(3)(iii) is only required 
when supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions, for 
the purposes of this subpart. Finally, when a combustion device is used

4.0'' is used, or related terms indicating a TRE index value of 4.0, 
referred to in Secs. 63.113 through 63.118, are used, the term ``TRE of 
6.7,'' shall apply instead, for the purposes of this subpart. The TRE 
range of 3.7 to 6.7 for continuous process vents at existing affected 
sources producing MBS corresponds to the TRE range of 1.0 to 4.0 for 
other continuous process vents, as it applies to monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting.
    (2) Not allow organic HAP emissions from the collection of 
continuous process vents at the affected source to be greater than

monitoring provisions of Sec. 63.1317, the testing and compliance 
demonstration provisions of Sec. 63.1318, the recordkeeping provisions 
of Sec. 63.1319, and the reporting provisions of Sec. 63.1320. However, 
in some instances, as specified in Sec. 63.1316, select continuous 
process vents present at affected sources producing PET or polystyrene 
using a continuous process are subject to the provisions of this 
section.
    (e) Owners or operators of affected sources producing ASA/AMSAN 
shall reduce organic HAP emissions from each continuous process vent, 
each batch process vent, and each aggregate batch vent stream by 98 
weight-percent and shall comply with either paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), or 
(e)(3), as appropriate. Where batch process vents or aggregate batch 
vent streams are combined with continuous process vents, the provisions 
of paragraph (a)(13) of this section shall apply for the purposes of 
this paragraph (e).
    (1) For each continuous process vent, comply with paragraph (a) of 
this section as specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(ii) of 
this section.
    (i) For purpose of this section, each continuous process vent shall 
be considered to be a Group 1 continuous process vent and the owner or 
operator of that continuous process vent shall comply with the 
requirements for a Group 1 continuous process vent.

required by Sec. 63.1323 shall not apply.
    (3) For each aggregate batch vent stream, comply with Secs. 63.1321 
through 63.1327 as specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(ii) 
of this section.
    (i) For purpose of this section, each aggregate batch vent stream 
shall be considered to be a Group 1 aggregate batch vent stream and the 
owner or operator of that aggregate batch vent stream shall comply with 
the requirements for a Group 1 aggregate batch vent stream contained in 
Secs. 63.1321 through 63.1327, except that each aggregate batch vent 
stream shall be controlled to reduce organic HAP emissions by 98 weight-
percent.

Sec. 63.1323  Batch process vents--methods and procedures for group determination.

    (a) General requirements. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section and in Sec. 63.1321(b)(1), the owner or operator of batch 
process vents at affected sources shall determine the group status of 
each batch process vent in accordance with the provisions of

[[Page 258]]

this section. This determination may be based on either organic HAP or 
TOC emissions.
    (1) The procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this 
section shall be followed to determine the group status of each batch 
process vent. This determination shall be made in accordance with either 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of 
a batch process vent based on the expected mix of products. For each 
product, emission characteristics of the single highest-HAP recipe, as 
defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for that product shall 
be used in the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.
    (ii) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status 
of a batch process vent based on annualized production of the single 
highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, 
considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit 
operation. The annualized production of the highest-HAP recipe shall be 
based exclusively on the production of the single highest-HAP recipe of 
all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation for a 12 
month period. The production level used may be the actual production 
rate. It is not necessary to assume a maximum production rate (i.e., 
8,760 hours per year at maximum design production).
    (iii) The single highest-HAP recipe for a product means the recipe 
of the product with the highest total mass of HAP charged to the reactor 
during the production of a single batch of product.
    (2) The annual uncontrolled organic HAP or TOC emissions and annual 
average batch vent flow rate shall be determined at the exit from the 
batch unit operation. For the purposes of these determinations, the 
primary condenser operating as a reflux condenser on a reactor or 
distillation column, the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction 
products, by-products, or solvent from a stripper operated in batch 
mode, and the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, 
by-products, or solvent from a distillation operation operated in batch 
mode shall be considered part of the batch unit operation. All other 
devices that recover or oxidize organic HAP or TOC vapors shall be 
considered control devices as defined in Sec. 63.1312.
    (3) The owner or operator of a batch process vent complying with the 
flare provisions in Sec. 63.1322(a)(1) or Sec. 63.1322(b)(1) or routing 
the batch process vent to a control device to comply with the 
requirements in Sec. 63.1322(a)(2) or Sec. 63.1322(b)(2) is not required 
to perform the batch process vent group determination described in this 
section, but shall comply with all requirements applicable to Group 1 
batch process vents for said batch process vent.
    (b) Determination of annual emissions. The owner or operator shall 
calculate annual uncontrolled TOC or organic HAP emissions for each 
batch process vent using the methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(8) of this section. To estimate emissions from a batch 
emissions episode, owners or operators may use either the emissions 
estimation equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this 
section, or direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section. Engineering assessment may be used to estimate emissions from a 
batch emission episode only under the conditions described in paragraph 
(b)(6) of this section. In using the emissions estimation equations in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, individual component 
vapor pressure and molecular weight may be obtained from standard 
references. Methods to determine individual HAP partial pressures in 
multicomponent systems are described in paragraph (b)(9) of this 
section. Other variables in the emissions estimation equations may be 
obtained through direct measurement, as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section, through engineering assessment, as defined in paragraph 
(b)(6)(ii) of this section, by process knowledge, or by any other 
appropriate means. Assumptions used in determining these variables must 
be documented. Once emissions for the batch emission episode have been 
determined using either the emissions estimation equations, direct 
measurement, or engineering assessment, emissions from a batch cycle 
shall be calculated in accordance with

[[Page 259]]

if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times 
the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas 
when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.

owners or operators of affected sources shall comply with either 
paragraph (i)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.
    (i) If the group redetermination described in paragraph (i)(2) of 
this section indicates that a Group 2 batch process vent has become a 
Group 1 batch process vent as a result of the process change, the owner 
or operator shall submit a report as specified in

[[Page 268]]

Sec. 63.1327(b) and shall comply with the Group 1 provisions in

section, that is in compliance with Sec. 63.1322(g), now has annual 
emissions greater than or equal to the level specified in paragraph (d) 
of this section but remains a Group 2 batch process vent, the owner or 
operator shall comply with the provisions in paragraphs (i)(3)(ii)(A) 
through (C) of this section.
    (A) Redetermine the batch mass input limitation;
    (B) Submit a report as specified in Sec. 63.1327(c); and
    (C) Comply with Sec. 63.1322(f), beginning with the year following 
the submittal of the report submitted according to paragraph 
(i)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (iii) If the group redetermination described in paragraph (i)(2) of

process. Whenever process changes, as described in paragraph (j)(1) of 
this section, are made to a new affected source producing SAN using a 
batch process that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the 
compliance status (i.e., achievement of 84 percent emission reduction) 
of the affected source, the owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (1) Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, 
changes in production capacity, production rate, feedstock type, or 
catalyst type; replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment 
considered part of a batch unit operation, as specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section; replacement, removal, or addition of control 
equipment associated with a continuous or batch process vent or an

process changes do not include process upsets or unintentional, 
temporary process changes.
    (2) The owner or operator shall redetermine the percent emission 
reduction achieved using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1333(c). If 
engineering assessment, as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this 
section, can demonstrate that the process change did not cause the 
percent emission reduction to decrease, it may be used in lieu of 
redetermining the percent reduction using the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.1333(c).
    (3) Where the redetermined percent reduction is less than 84 
percent, the owner or operator of the affected source shall submit a 
report as specified in Sec. 63.1327(d) and shall comply with 
Sec. 63.1322(a)(3) and all associated provisions in accordance with 
Sec. 63.1310(i).

    (B) If the scrubber is subject to regulations in 40 CFR parts 264 
through 266 that have required a determination of the liquid to gas (L/
G) ratio prior to the applicable compliance date for this subpart, the 
owner or operator may determine gas stream flow by the method that had 
been utilized to comply with those regulations. A determination that was 
conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized 
to comply with this subpart if it is still representative.
    (C) The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas stream 
flow determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will 
be used to determine the gas stream flow. The plan shall require 
determination of gas stream flow by a method which will at least provide 
a value for either a representative or the highest gas stream flow 
anticipated in the scrubber during representative operating conditions 
other than start-ups, shutdowns, or malfunctions. The plan shall include 
a description of the methodology to be followed and an explanation of 
how the selected methodology will reliably determine the gas stream 
flow, and a description of the records that will be maintained to 
document the determination of gas stream flow. The owner or operator 
shall maintain the plan as specified in Sec. 63.1335(a).

Sec. 63.1325  Batch process vents--performance test methods and procedures to determine compliance.

    (a) Use of a flare. When a flare is used to comply with 
Sec. 63.1322(a)(1), Sec. 63.1322(a)(3), Sec. 63.1322(b)(1), or 
Sec. 63.1322(b)(3), the owner or operator of an affected source shall 
comply with Sec. 63.1333(e).
    (b) Exceptions to performance tests. An owner or operator is not 
required to conduct a performance test when a control device specified 
in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section is used to comply 
with Sec. 63.1322(a)(2) or (a)(3).
    (1) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 
44 megawatts or greater.
    (2) A boiler or process heater where the vent stream is introduced 
with the primary fuel or is used as the primary fuel.
    (3) A control device for which a performance test was conducted for 
determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by the EPA and the 
test was conducted using the same Methods specified in this section and 
either no deliberate process changes have been made since the test, or 
the owner or operator can demonstrate that the results of the 
performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate 
compliance despite process changes. Recovery devices used for 
controlling emissions from continuous process vents complying with 
Sec. 63.1322(a)(3) are also eligible for the exemption described in this 
paragraph (b)(3).
    (4) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the 
owner or operator:
    (i) Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and 
complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or
    (ii) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements 
of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.
    (5) A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator 
has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with 
the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified 
compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, 
subpart O.
    (c) Batch process vent testing and procedures for compliance with 
Sec. 63.1322(a)(2). Except as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, an owner or operator using a control device to comply with 
Sec. 63.1322(a)(2) shall conduct a performance test using the procedures 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in order to determine the 
control efficiency of the control device. An owner or operator shall 
determine the percent reduction for the batch cycle using the control 
efficiency of the control device as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) 
through (c)(2)(iii) of this section and the procedures specified in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Compliance may be based on either 
total organic HAP or TOC. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term 
``batch emission episode'' shall have the meaning ``period of the batch 
emission episode selected for control,''

[[Page 272]]

which may be the entire batch emission episode or may only be a portion 
of the batch emission episode.
    (1) Performance tests shall be conducted as specified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(v) of this section.
    (i) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, a 
test shall be performed for the entire period of each batch emission 
episode in the batch cycle that the owner or operator selects to control 
as part of achieving the required 90 percent emission reduction for the 
batch cycle specified in Sec. 63.1322(a)(2). Only one test is required 
for each batch emission episode selected by the owner or operator for 
control. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures listed in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B) through (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (A) Alternatively, an owner or operator may choose to test only 
those periods of the batch emission episode during which the emission 
rate for the entire episode can be determined or during which the 
emissions are greater than the average emission rate of the batch 
emission episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options 
shall develop an emission profile for the entire batch emission episode, 
based on either process knowledge or test data collected, to demonstrate 
that test periods are representative. Examples of information that could 
constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material 
balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used 
provided the results are still relevant to the current batch process 
vent conditions.
    (B) Method 1 or 1A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, 
shall be used for selection of the sampling sites if the flow measuring

if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times 
the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas 
when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.

limitation required by Sec. 63.1322(f)(1) shall be determined by the 
owner or operator such that annual emissions remain at a level that 
ensures that said batch process vent remains a Group 2 batch process 
vent, given the actual annual flow rate for said batch process vent 
determined according to the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1323(e)(3). 
The batch mass input limitation shall be determined using the same 
basis, as described in Sec. 63.1323(a)(1), used to make the group 
determination (i.e., expected mix of products or highest-HAP recipe.) 
The establishment of the batch mass input limitation is not dependent 
upon any past production or activity level.
    (1) If the expected mix of products serves as the basis for the 
batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be 
determined based on any foreseeable combination of products that the 
owner or operator expects to manufacture.
    (2) If the single highest-HAP recipe serves as the basis for the 
batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be 
determined based solely on the production of the single highest-HAP 
recipe, considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit 
operation.

    (iii) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an 
operating day are above the minimum or below the maximum level 
established in accordance with Sec. 63.1324(f), the owner or operator 
may record that all values were above the minimum or below the maximum 
level established rather than calculating and recording a batch cycle 
daily average for that operating day.
    (3) Hourly records of whether the flow indicator for bypass lines 
specified in Sec. 63.1324(e)(1) was operating and whether a diversion 
was detected at any time during the hour. Also, records of the times of

flow indicator specified in Sec. 63.1324(e)(1) is not operating.
    (4) Where a seal or closure mechanism is used to comply with 
Sec. 63.1324(e)(2), hourly records of whether a diversion was detected 
at any time are not required. The owner or operator shall record whether 
the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has 
been done, and shall record the occurrence of all periods when the seal 
mechanism is broken, the bypass line damper or valve position has 
changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type configuration has been

[[Page 280]]

checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken.

    (3) For demonstrating compliance with the monitoring of bypass lines 
as specified in Sec. 63.1324(e), records as specified in paragraphs 
(e)(3) or (e)(4) of this section, as appropriate.
    (g) Documentation supporting the establishment of the batch mass 
input limitation shall include the information specified in paragraphs 
(g)(1) through (g)(5) of this section, as appropriate.
    (1) Identification of whether the purpose of the batch mass input 
limitation is to comply with Sec. 63.1322(f)(1) or (g)(1).
    (2) Identification of whether the batch mass input limitation is 
based on the single highest-HAP recipe (considering all products) or on 
the expected mix of products for the batch process vent as allowed under 
Sec. 63.1323(a)(1).
    (3) Definition of the operating year, for the purposes of 
determining compliance with the batch mass input limitation.
    (4) If the batch mass input limitation is based on the expected mix 
of products, the owner or operator shall provide documentation that 
describes as many scenarios for differing mixes of products (i.e., how 
many of each type of product) as the owner or operator desires the 
flexibility to accomplish. Alternatively, the owner or operator shall 
provide a description of the relationship among the mix of products that 
will allow a determination of compliance with the batch mass input 
limitation under any number of scenarios.
    (5) The mass of HAP or material allowed to be charged to the batch 
unit operation per year under the batch mass input limitation.

an existing affected source subject to this section who manufactures PET 
using a continuous terephthalic acid high viscosity multiple end 
finisher process, and who is subject or becomes subject

[[Page 283]]

to 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDD, shall maintain an ethylene glycol 
concentration in the process contact cooling tower at or below 4.0 
percent by weight averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period 
of operating days. Compliance with this paragraph (c) shall be 
determined as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this 
section. It should be noted that compliance with this paragraph (c) does 
not exempt owners or operators from complying with the provisions of 
Sec. 63.1330 for those process wastewater streams that are sent to the 
process contact cooling tower.
    (1) To determine the ethylene glycol concentration, owners or 
operators shall follow the procedures specified in 40 CFR 60.564(j)(1), 
except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (i) At least one sample per operating day shall be collected using 
the procedures specified in 40 CFR 60.564(j)(1)(i). An average ethylene 
glycol concentration by weight shall be calculated on a daily basis over 
a rolling 14-day period of operating days. Each daily average ethylene 
glycol concentration so calculated constitutes a performance test.
    (ii) The owner or operator may elect to reduce the sampling program 
to any 14 consecutive operating day period once every two calendar 
months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling average 
concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling program are 
each less than 1.2 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the average 
concentration obtained over the 14 operating day sampling during the 
reduced test period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval 
calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day 
average exceeded 1.2 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or 
operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. The 95 percent 
confidence interval shall be calculated as specified in paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii) of this section. A reduced program may be reinstituted if 
the requirements specified in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) are met.
    (iii) The upper 95 percent confidence interval shall be calculated 
using the Equation 27 of this subpart:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19JN00.040

Where:

CI<INF>95</INF> = 95 percent confidence interval
X<INF>i</INF> = daily ethylene glycol concentration for each operating 
          day used to calculate each 14-day rolling average used in test 
          results to justify implementing the reduced testing program.
n = number of ethylene glycol concentrations.

    (2) Measuring an alternative parameter, such as carbon oxygen demand 
or biological oxygen demand, that is demonstrated to be directly 
proportional to the ethylene glycol concentration shall be allowed. Such 
parameter shall be measured during the initial 14-day performance test 
during which the facility is shown to be in compliance with the ethylene 
glycol concentration standard whereby the ethylene glycol concentration 
is determined using the procedures described in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. The alternative parameter shall be measured on a daily basis 
and the average value of the alternative parameter shall be calculated 
on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days. Each 
daily average value of the alternative parameter constitutes a 
performance test.
    (3) During each performance test, daily measurement and daily 
average 14-day rolling averages of the ethylene glycol concentration in 
the cooling tower water shall be recorded. For the initial performance 
test, these records shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance 
Status report.

[[Page 284]]

    (4) All periods when the 14-day rolling average exceeds the standard 
shall be reported in the Periodic Report.

EPS;
    (iii) The wastewater stream originates at equipment that produces 
MABS;
    (iv) The wastewater stream originates at equipment that produces 
MBS; or
    (v) The wastewater stream originates at equipment that produces SAN.
    (19) When the provisions of Sec. 63.139(c)(1)(ii), 
Sec. 63.145(d)(4), or Sec. 63.145(i)(2) specify that Method 18, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A, shall be used,

[[Page 286]]

Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used for the 
purposes of this subpart. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(19)(i) 
and (b)(19)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be the single organic HAP representing 
the largest percent by volume of the emissions.
    (ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is 
acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at 
least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero 
calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive 
scale.
    (20) In Sec. 63.145(j), instead of the reference to Sec. 63.11(b), 
and instead of Sec. 63.145(j)(1) and Sec. 63.145(j)(2), the requirements 
in Sec. 63.1333(e) shall apply.
    (21) The owner or operator of a facility which receives a Group 1

Sec. 63.1331  Equipment leak provisions.

    (a) Except as provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, the owner or operator of each affected source shall comply with 
the requirements of subpart H of this part, with the differences noted 
in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(13) of this section.
    (1) For an affected source producing polystyrene resin, the 
indications of liquids dripping, as defined in subpart H of this part, 
from bleed ports in pumps and agitator seals in light liquid service 
shall not be considered to be a leak. For purposes of this subpart, a 
``bleed port'' is a technologically-required feature of the pump or seal 
whereby polymer fluid used to provide lubrication and/or cooling of the 
pump or agitator shaft exits the pump, thereby resulting in a visible 
dripping of fluid.
    (2) The compliance date for the equipment leak provisions contained 
in this section is provided in Sec. 63.1311. Whenever subpart H of this 
part refers to the compliance dates specified in any paragraph contained 
in Sec. 63.100, the compliance dates listed in Sec. 63.1311(d) shall 
instead apply, for the purposes of this subpart. When Sec. 63.182(c)(4) 
refers to ``sources subject to subpart F,'' the phrase ``sources subject 
to this subpart'' shall apply, for the purposes of this subpart. In 
addition, extensions of compliance dates are addressed by 
Sec. 63.1311(e) instead of Sec. 63.182(a)(6), for the purposes of this 
subpart.
    (3) Owners and operators of an affected source subject to this 
subpart are not required to submit the Initial Notification required by 
Sec. 63.182(a)(1) and Sec. 63.182(b).
    (4) As specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(5), the Notification of 
Compliance Status required by paragraphs Sec. 63.182(a)(2) and 
Sec. 63.182(c) shall be submitted within 150 days (rather than 90 days) 
of the applicable compliance date specified in Sec. 63.1311 for the 
equipment leak provisions.
    (5) The information specified by Sec. 63.182(a)(3) and 
Sec. 63.182(d) (i.e., Periodic Reports) shall be submitted as part of 
the Periodic Reports required by Sec. 63.1335(e)(6).
    (6) For pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators in heavy liquid 
service; pressure relief devices in light liquid or heavy liquid 
service; and instrumentation systems, owners or operators of affected 
sources producing PET shall

[[Page 287]]

comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (a)(6)(ii) of 
this section instead of with the requirements of Sec. 63.169. Owners or 
operators of PET affected sources shall comply with all other provisions 
of subpart H of this part for pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators 
in heavy liquid service; pressure relief devices in light liquid or 
heavy liquid service; and instrumentation systems, except as specified 
in paragraphs (a)(6)(iii) through (a)(6)(iv) of this section.
    (i) A leak is determined to be detected if there is evidence of a 
potential leak found by visual, audible, or olfactory means. Method 21, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A may not be used to determine the presence or 
absence of a leak.
    (ii)(A) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as 
practical, but not later than 15 days after it is detected, except as 
provided in Sec. 63.171.
    (B) The first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 days 
after each leak is detected.
    (C) Repaired shall mean that the visual, audible, olfactory, or 
other indications of a leak have been eliminated; that no bubbles are 
observed at potential leak sites during a leak check using soap 
solution; or that the system will hold a test pressure.
    (iii) An owner or operator is not required to develop an initial 
list of identification numbers as would otherwise be required under 
Sec. 63.181(b)(1)(i) or Sec. 63.181(b)(4).
    (iv) When recording the detection of a leak under Sec. 63.182(d)(1), 
the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with paragraphs 
(a)(6)(iv)(A) through (a)(6)(iv)(B) of this section.
    (A) When complying with Sec. 63.181(d)(1), provide an identification 
number for the leaking equipment at the time of recordkeeping. Further, 
the owner or operator is not required to record the identification 
number of the instrument (i.e., Method 21 instrument) because the use of 
Method 21 is not an acceptable method for determining a leak under this 
paragraph (a)(6).
    (B) An owner or operator is not required to comply with 
Sec. 63.181(d)(4) which requires a record of the maximum instrument 
reading measured by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    (7) When Sec. 63.166(b)(4)(i) refers to Table 9 of subpart G of this 
part, the owner or operator is only required to consider organic HAP 
listed on Table 6 of this subpart for purposes of this subpart, except 
for ethylene glycol which need not be considered.
    (8) When the provisions of subpart H of this part specify that 
Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used, Method 18 or 
Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used for the purposes of 
this subpart. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall 
conform with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (a)(8)(ii) of 
this section.
    (i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be the single organic HAP representing 
the largest percent by volume of the emissions.
    (ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is 
acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at 
least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero 
calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive 
scale.
    (9) [Reserved]
    (10) If specific items of equipment, comprising part of a process 
unit subject to this subpart, are managed by different administrative 
organizations (e.g., different companies, affiliates, departments, 
divisions, etc.), those items of equipment may be aggregated with any 
TPPU within the affected source for all purposes under subpart H of this 
part, providing there is no delay in achieving the applicable compliance 
date.
    (11) When the terms ``equipment'' and ``equipment leak'' are used in 
subpart H of this part, the definitions of these terms in Sec. 63.1312 
shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.
    (12) The phrase ``the provisions of subparts F, I, or JJJ of this 
part'' shall apply instead of the phrase ``the provisions of subpart F 
or I of this part'' throughout Secs. 63.163 and 63.168, for the purposes 
of this subpart. In addition, the phrase ``subparts F, I, and JJJ''

[[Page 288]]

shall apply instead of the phrase ``subparts F and I'' in 
Sec. 63.174(c)(2)(iii), for the purposes of this subpart.
    (13) An owner or operator using a flare to comply with the 
requirements of this section shall conduct a compliance demonstration as 
specified in Sec. 63.1333(e).
    (b) The provisions of this section do not apply to each TPPU 
producing PET using a process other than a continuous terephthalic acid 
(TPA) high viscosity multiple end finisher process that is part of an 
affected source if all of the equipment leak components subject to this 
section Sec. 63.1331 in the TPPU are either in vacuum service or in 
heavy liquid service.
    (1) Owners and operators of a TPPU exempted under paragraph (b) of 
this section shall comply with paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (i) Retain information, data, and analyses used to demonstrate that 
all of the components in the exempted TPPU are either in vacuum service 
or in heavy liquid service. For components in vacuum service, examples 
of information that could document this include, but are not limited to, 
analyses of process stream composition and process conditions, 
engineering calculations, or process knowledge. For components in heavy 
liquid service, such documentation shall include an analysis or 
demonstration that the process fluids do not meet the criteria of ``in 
light liquid service'' or ``in gas or vapor service.''
    (ii) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that all of 
the components in the TPPU are either in vacuum service or in heavy 
liquid service.
    (2) If changes occur at a TPPU exempted under paragraph (b) of this 
section such that all of the components in the TPPU are no longer either 
in vacuum service or in heavy liquid service (e.g., by either process 
changes or the addition of new components), the owner or operator of the 
affected source shall comply with the provisions of this section for all 
of the components at the TPPU. The owner or operator shall submit a 
report within 180 days after the process change is made or the 
information regarding the process change is known to the owner or 
operator. This report may be included in the next Periodic Report, as 
specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. A description of the 
process change shall be submitted with this report.
    (c) The provisions of this section do not apply to each affected 
source producing PET using a continuous TPA high viscosity multiple end 
finisher process.

65 FR 38127, June 19, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 63.1332  Emissions averaging provisions.

    (a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing affected 
sources who seek to comply with Sec. 63.1313(b) by using emissions 
averaging rather than following the provisions of Secs. 63.1314, 
63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 63.1321, and 63.1330.
    (1) The following emission point limitations apply to the use of 
these provisions:
    (i) All emission points included in an emissions average shall be 
from the same affected source. There may be an emissions average for 
each affected source located at a plant site.
    (ii)(A) If a plant site has only one affected source for which 
emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number 
of emission points allowed in the emissions average for said affected 
source is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five 
additional emission points if pollution prevention measures are used to 
control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions 
average.
    (B) If a plant site has two or more affected sources for which 
emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number 
of emission points allowed in the emissions averages for said affected 
sources is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five 
additional emission points if pollution prevention measures are used to 
control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions 
averages.
    (2) Compliance with the provisions of this section may be based on 
either organic HAP or TOC.

[[Page 289]]

    (3) For the purposes of these provisions, whenever Method 18, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A, is specified within the paragraphs of this section 
or is specified by reference through provisions outside this section, 
Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used. The 
use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall conform with the 
requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the 
largest percent by volume of the emissions.
    (ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable 
if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times 
the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas 
when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.
    (b) Unless an operating permit application has been submitted, the 
owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Emissions 
Averaging Plan containing all of the information required in 
Sec. 63.1335(e)(4) for all emission points to be included in an 
emissions average.
    (c) Paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section describe the 
emission points that may be used to generate emissions averaging credits 
if control was applied after November 15, 1990, and if sufficient 
information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits 
for the emission point. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section discusses the 
use of pollution prevention in generating emissions averaging credits.
    (1) Storage vessels, batch process vents, aggregate batch vent 
streams, continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1315, and process 
wastewater streams that are determined to be Group 2 emission points. 
The term ``continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1315'' includes 
continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1316 (b)(1)(iii), 
(b)(2)(iii), and (c)(2), which reference Sec. 63.1315.
    (2) Continuous process vents located in the collection of material 
recovery sections within the affected source at an existing affected 
source producing PET using a continuous dimethyl terephthalate process 
subject to Sec. 63.1316(b)(1)(i) where the uncontrolled organic HAP 
emissions from said continuous process vents are equal to or less than 
0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product. These continuous process vents 
shall be considered Group 2 emission points for the purposes of this 
section.
    (3) Storage vessels, continuous process vents subject to 
Sec. 63.1315, and process wastewater streams that are determined to be 
Group 1 emission points and that are controlled by a technology that the 
Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal 
efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the 
nominal efficiencies for such technologies shall be submitted and 
approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
    (4) Batch process vents and aggregate batch vent streams that are 
determined to be Group 1 emission points and that are controlled to a 
level more stringent than the applicable standard.
    (5) Continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1316 (b)(1)(i), 
(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(1) located in the collection 
of process sections within the affected source, as specified in 
paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(ii) of this section. The continuous 
process vents identified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(ii) of 
this section shall be considered to be Group 1 emission points for the 
purposes of this section.
    (i) Continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1316(b)(1)(i) 
located in the collection of material recovery sections within the 
affected source where the uncontrolled organic HAP emissions for said 
continuous process vents are greater than 0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of 
product and said continuous process vents are controlled to a level more 
stringent than the applicable standard.
    (ii) Continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1316(b)(1)(ii), 
(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(1) located in the collection of process 
sections within the affected source where the uncontrolled organic HAP 
emissions from said continuous process vents are controlled to a level 
more stringent than the applicable standard.

[[Page 290]]

    (6) The percent reduction for any storage vessel, batch process 
vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous process vent, and process 
wastewater stream from which emissions are reduced by pollution 
prevention measures shall be determined using the procedures specified 
in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (i) For a Group 1 storage vessel, batch process vent, aggregate 
batch vent stream, continuous process vent, or process wastewater 
stream, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than 
if the applicable reference control technology or standard had been 
applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention 
measure, except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with 
other controls for a Group 1 storage vessel, batch process vent, 
aggregate batch vent stream, continuous process vent, or process 
wastewater stream, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have 
to reduce emissions more than the applicable reference control 
technology or standard, but the combination of the pollution prevention 
measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than if the 
applicable reference control technology or standard had been applied 
instead of the pollution prevention measure.
    (d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate 
emissions averaging credits:
    (1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 
1990, cannot be used to generate credits unless the level of control is 
increased after November 15, 1990. In this case, credit will be allowed 
only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990.
    (2) Group 1 emission points, identified in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, that are controlled by a reference control technology cannot be 
used to generate credits unless the reference control technology has 
been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal 
efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph 
(i) of this section.
    (3) Emission points for nonoperating TPPU cannot be used to generate 
credits. TPPU that are shutdown cannot be used to generate credits or 
debits.
    (4) Maintenance wastewater cannot be used to generate credits. 
Wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units cannot be used 
to generate credits. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to 
generate credits or debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms 
wastewater and wastewater stream are used to mean process wastewater.
    (5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal 
rule other than this subpart cannot be used to generate credits, unless 
the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990, to a 
level above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only 
the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule 
will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to 
generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, 
and the emission point is subsequently made subject to a State or 
Federal rule other than this subpart, the emission point may continue to 
generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with 
the previously approved emissions average.
    (e) For all emission points included in an emissions average, the 
owner or operator shall perform the following tasks:
    (1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission 
points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference 
control technology or standard for those emission points. Said Group 1 
emission points are identified in paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of 
this section. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used 
to calculate debits.
    (2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 and Group 2 
emission points that are over-controlled to compensate for the debits. 
Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate 
credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of 
paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation, 
whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be 
included.

[[Page 291]]

    (3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to 
paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits 
calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph 
(g) of this section.
    (i) The owner or operator may choose to include more than the 
required number of credit-generating emission points in an emissions 
average in order to increase the likelihood of being in compliance.
    (ii) The initial demonstration in the Emissions Averaging Plan or 
operating permit application that credit-generating emission points will 
be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from 
the debit-generating emission points shall be made under representative 
operating conditions. After the compliance date, actual operating data 
will be used for all debit and credit calculations.
    (4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) 
period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 
times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph 
(h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined 
based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 
percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.
    (5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the 
Periodic Reports as specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(6). Every fourth 
Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the 
emissions averaging provisions as required by 
Sec. 63.1335(e)(6)(x)(C)(2).
    (f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the 
methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this 
section, respectively, and shall not include emissions during the 
following periods:
    (1) Emissions during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction, 
as described in the Start-up, Shutdown, and Malfunction Plan.
    (2) Emissions during periods of monitoring excursions, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1334(d). For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits 
and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) 
through (f)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission 
point.
    (ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating 
emission point.
    (iii) The owner or operator may demonstrate to the Administrator 
that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned using the 
procedures in paragraph (l) of this section.
    (g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual 
emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is 
controlled to a level less stringent than the applicable reference 
control technology or standard and the emissions allowed for the Group 1 
emission point. Said Group 1 emission points are identified in 
paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of this section. Debits shall be 
calculated as follows:
    (1) Source-wide debits shall be calculated using Equation 28 of this 
subpart. Debits and all terms of Equation 28 of this subpart are in 
units of megagrams per month:

where:

ECPV<INF>iu</INF>=Uncontrolled continuous process vent emission rate 
from continuous process vent i, megagrams per month.
Q=Vent stream flow rate, dry standard cubic meters per minute, measured 
using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as 
appropriate.
h=Monthly hours of operation during which positive flow is present in 
the continuous process vent, hours per month.
Cj=Concentration, parts per million by volume, dry basis, of organic HAP 
j as measured by Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
Mj=Molecular weight of organic HAP j, gram per gram-mole.
n=Number of organic HAP in stream.

    (A) The values of Q and Cj shall be determined during a performance 
test conducted under representative operating conditions. The values of 
Q and Cj shall be established in the Notification of Compliance Status 
and shall be updated as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this 
section.
    (B) If there is a change in capacity utilization other than a change 
in monthly operating hours, or if any other change is made to the 
process or product recovery equipment or operation such that the 
previously measured values of Q and Cj are no longer representative, a 
new performance test shall be conducted to determine new representative 
values of Q and Cj. These new values shall be used to calculate debits 
and credits from the time of the change forward, and the new values 
shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.
    (iii) The following procedures and equations shall be used to 
calculate ECPV<INF>iACTUAL</INF>:
    (A) If the continuous process vent is not controlled by a control 
device or pollution prevention measure, 
ECPV<INF>iACTUAL</INF>=ECPV<INF>iu</INF>, where ECPV<INF>iu</INF> is 
calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and 
(g)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (B) If the continuous process vent is controlled using a control 
device or a pollution prevention measure achieving less than 98 percent 
reduction, calculate ECPV<INF>iACTUAL</INF> using Equation 30 of this 
subpart.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12SE96.029

    (1) The percent reduction shall be measured according to the 
procedures in Sec. 63.116 if a combustion control device is used. For a 
flare meeting the criteria in Sec. 63.116(a), or a boiler or process 
heater meeting the criteria in Sec. 63.116(b), the percent reduction 
shall be 98 percent. If a noncombustion control device is used, percent 
reduction shall be demonstrated by a performance test at the inlet and 
outlet of the device, or, if testing is not feasible, by a control 
design evaluation and documented engineering calculations.
    (2) For determining debits from Group 1 continuous process vents, 
product recovery devices shall not be considered control devices and 
cannot be assigned a percent reduction in calculating 
ECPV<INF>iACTUAL</INF>. The sampling site for measurement of 
uncontrolled emissions is after the final product recovery device. 
However, as provided in Sec. 63.113(a)(3), a Group 1 continuous process 
vent may add sufficient product recovery to raise the TRE index value 
above 1.0 or, for Group 1 continuous process vents at an existing 
affected source producing MBS, above 3.7, thereby becoming a Group 2 
continuous process vent. Such a continuous process vent would not be a 
Group 1 continuous process vent and would, therefore, not be included in 
determining debits under this paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B)(2).
    (3) Procedures for calculating the percent reduction of pollution 
prevention measures are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.

determine the organic HAP emissions for each individual continuous 
process vent, except that paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this section 
shall not apply and the sampling site shall be after those recovery 
devices installed as part of normal operation; before any add-on control 
devices (i.e., those required by regulation); and prior to discharge to 
the atmosphere. Then, individual continuous process vent emissions shall 
be summed to determine ECPVS<INF>jACTUAL</INF>.

of process sections j within the affected source shall be determined by 
determining the weight of polymer pulled from the process line(s) during 
a 30-day period. The polymer produced shall be determined by direct 
measurement or by an alternate methodology, such as materials balance. 
If an alternate methodology is used, a description of the methodology, 
including all procedures, data, and assumptions shall be submitted as 
part of the Emissions Averaging Plan required by Sec. 63.1335(e)(4).
    (C) Alternatively, ECPVS<INF>jstd</INF> for continuous process vents 
located in the collection of process sections within the affected source 
subject to Sec. 63.1316(c)(1) may be calculated using the procedures in 
paragraph (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section to determine the 
organic HAP emissions for each individual continuous process vent, 
except that the sampling site shall be after recovery devices installed 
as part of normal operation; before any add-on control devices (i.e.,

    (i) The following procedures shall be followed to establish nominal 
efficiencies for emission controls for storage vessels, continuous 
process vents,

[[Page 302]]

and process wastewater streams. The procedures in paragraphs (i)(1) 
through (i)(6) of this section shall be followed for control 
technologies that are different in use or design from the reference 
control technologies and achieve greater percent reductions than the 
percent efficiencies assigned to the reference control technologies in 
Sec. 63.111.
    (1) In those cases where the owner or operator is seeking permission 
to take credit for use of a control technology that is different in use 
or design from the reference control technology, and the different 
control technology will be used in more than three applications at a 
single plant-site, the owner or operator shall submit the information 
specified in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iv) of this section, as 
specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(7)(ii), to the Director of the EPA Office 
of Air Quality Planning and Standards in writing:
    (i) Emission stream characteristics of each emission point to which 
the control technology is or will be applied including the kind of 
emission point, flow, organic HAP concentration, and all other stream 
characteristics necessary to design the control technology or determine 
its performance.
    (ii) Description of the control technology including design 
specifications.
    (iii) Documentation demonstrating to the Administrator's 
satisfaction the control efficiency of the control technology. This may 
include performance test data collected using an appropriate EPA Method 
or any other method validated according to Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, 
appendix A, of this part. If it is infeasible to obtain test data, 
documentation may include a design evaluation and calculations. The 
engineering basis of the calculation procedures and all inputs and 
assumptions made in the calculations shall be documented.
    (iv) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to 
ensure that the control technology will be operated in conformance with 
its design and an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that 
parameter (or parameters).
    (2) The Administrator shall determine within 120 days whether an 
application presents sufficient information to determine nominal 
efficiency. The Administrator reserves the right to request specific 
data in addition to the items listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) The Administrator shall determine within 120 days of the 
submittal of sufficient data whether a control technology shall have a 
nominal efficiency and the level of that nominal efficiency. If, in the 
Administrator's judgment, the control technology achieves a level of 
emission reduction greater than the reference control technology for a 
particular kind of emission point, the Administrator will publish a 
Federal Register notice establishing a nominal efficiency for the 
control technology.
    (4) The Administrator may grant permission to take emission credits 
for use of the control technology. The Administrator may also impose 
requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance 
to achieve the specified nominal efficiency.
    (5) In those cases where the owner or operator is seeking permission 
to take credit for use of a control technology that is different in use 
or design from the reference control technology and the different 
control technology will be used in no more than three applications at a 
single plant site, the owner or operator shall submit the information 
listed in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iv) of this section, as 
specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(7)(ii), to the Administrator.
    (i) In these instances, use and conditions for use of the control 
technology may be approved by the permitting authority as part of an 
operating permit application or modification. The permitting authority 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (i)(2) through 
(i)(4) of this section except that, in these instances, a Federal 
Register notice is not required to establish the nominal efficiency for 
the different technology.
    (ii) If, in reviewing the application, the permitting authority 
believes the control technology has broad applicability for use by other 
affected sources, the permitting authority shall submit

[[Page 303]]

the information provided in the application to the Director of the EPA 
Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. The Administrator shall 
review the technology for broad applicability and may publish a Federal 
Register notice; however, this review shall not affect the permitting 
authority's approval of the nominal efficiency of the control technology 
for the specific application.
    (6) If, in reviewing an application for a control technology for an 
emission point, the Administrator or permitting authority determines the 
control technology is not different in use or design from the reference 
control technology, the Administrator or permitting authority shall deny 
the application.
    (j) The following procedures shall be used for calculating the 
efficiency (percent reduction) of pollution prevention measures for 
storage vessels, continuous process vents, batch process vents, 
aggregate batch vent streams, and wastewater streams:
    (1) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that meets the 
criteria of paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that results in a 
lesser quantity of organic HAP emissions per unit of product released to 
the atmosphere prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or control 
of emissions, while the same product is produced.
    (ii) Pollution prevention measures may include: substitution of 
feedstocks that reduce organic HAP emissions; alterations to the 
production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the 
environment; equipment modifications; housekeeping measures; and in-
process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as 
raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution 
prevention.
    (2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention 
measures implemented after November 15, 1990, may be used in calculating 
the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit 
equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
    (i) For pollution prevention measures, the percent reduction used in 
the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(7) of this section and 
paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(7) of this section is the percent 
difference between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission 
point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month 
versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the 
pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced 
during the two monthly periods.
    (ii) Equation 46 of this subpart shall be used to calculate the 
percent reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission 
point.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12SE96.045

where:

Percent reduction=Efficiency of pollution prevention measure (percent 
organic HAP reduction).
E<INF>B</INF>=Monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, 
megagrams per month, determined as specified in paragraphs 
(j)(2)(ii)(A), (j)(2)(ii)(B), and (j)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
E<INF>pp</INF>=Monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, 
megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month, determined 
as specified in either paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(D) or (j)(2)(ii)(E) of this 
section.
P<INF>B</INF>=Monthly production before the pollution prevention 
measure, megagrams per month, during the

[[Page 304]]

same period over which E<INF>B</INF> is calculated.
P<INF>pp</INF>=Monthly production after the pollution prevention 
measure, megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month.

    (A) The monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, 
E<INF>B</INF>, shall be determined in a manner consistent with the 
equations and procedures in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section 
for continuous process vents, paragraph (g)(4) of this section for 
storage vessels, paragraph (g)(6) of this section for batch process 
vents, and paragraph (g)(7) of this section for aggregate batch vent 
streams.
    (B) For wastewater, E<INF>B</INF> shall be calculated using Equation 
47 of this subpart:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09MR99.011


Where:
n = Number of wastewater streams.
Q<INF>Bi</INF> = Annual average flow rate for wastewater stream i before 
the pollution prevention measure, defined and determined according to 
Sec. 63.144(c)(3), liters per minute, before implementation of the 
pollution prevention measure.
H<INF>Bi</INF> = Number of hours per month that wastewater stream i was 
discharged before the pollution prevention measure, hours per month.
s = Total number of organic HAP in wastewater stream i.
F<INF>em</INF> = Fraction emitted of organic HAP m in wastewater from 
Table 34 of subpart G of this part, dimensionless.
HAP<INF>Bim</INF> = Annual average concentration of organic HAP m in 
wastewater stream i, defined and determined according to paragraph 
Sec. 63.150(g)(5)(i) of this section, before the pollution prevention 
measure, parts per million by weight, as measured before the 
implementation of the pollution measure.

    (C) If the pollution prevention measure was implemented prior to 
September 12, 1996 records may be used to determine E<INF>B</INF>.
    (D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, 
E<INF>pp</INF>, may be determined during a performance test or by a 
design evaluation and documented engineering calculations. Once an 
emissions-to-production ratio has been established, the ratio can be 
used to estimate monthly emissions from monthly production records.
    (E) For wastewater, E<INF>pp</INF> shall be calculated using 
Equation 48 of this subpart and n, Q<INF>ppi</INF>, H<INF>ppi</INF>, s, 
Fe<INF>m</INF>, and HAP<INF>ppim</INF> are defined and determined as 
described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, except that 
Q<INF>ppi</INF>, H<INF>ppi</INF>, and HAP<INF>ppim</INF> shall be 
determined after the pollution prevention measure has been implemented.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12SE96.047

    (iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, 
and other information used to determine the percent reduction achieved 
by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully 
documented.
    (iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from 
multiple emission points. In such cases, the percent reduction in 
emissions for each emission point shall be calculated.
    (v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through 
(h)(7) of this section used to calculate credits for emission points 
controlled more stringently than the reference control technology or 
standard, the nominal

[[Page 305]]

efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is equivalent to the 
percent reduction of the pollution prevention measure. When a pollution 
prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of an affected source 
is not required to apply to the Administrator for a nominal efficiency 
and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
    (k) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the emissions from 
the emission points proposed to be included in the emissions average 
will not result in greater hazard or, at the option of the 
Administrator, greater risk to human health or the environment than if 
the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in 
Secs. 63.1314, 63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 63.1321, and 63.1330.
    (1) This demonstration of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made 
to the satisfaction of the Administrator.
    (i) The Administrator may require owners and operators to use 
specific methodologies and procedures for making a hazard or risk 
determination.

shall be made according to any guidance that the Administrator makes 
available for use.
    (2) Owners and operators shall provide documentation demonstrating 
the hazard or risk equivalency of their proposed emissions average in 
their operating permit application or in their Emissions Averaging Plan 
if an operating permit application has not yet been submitted.
    (3) An Emissions Averaging Plan that does not demonstrate hazard or 
risk equivalency to the satisfaction of the Administrator shall not be 
approved. The Administrator may require such adjustments to the 
Emissions Averaging Plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the 
emissions average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human 
health or the environment than would result if the emission points were 
controlled according to Secs. 63.1314, 63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 
63.1321, and 63.1330.
    (4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration shall:
    (i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment;
    (ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human 
health or the environment; and
    (iii) Meet any requirements set by the Administrator for such 
demonstrations.
    (l) For periods of parameter monitoring excursions, an owner or 
operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through 
(l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in 
paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of 
monitoring excursions in the Periodic Reports as required in 
Sec. 63.1335(e)(6).
    (2) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that other types of 
monitoring data or engineering calculations are appropriate to establish 
that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a 
fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. This 
demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the 
Administrator may establish procedures of demonstrating compliance that 
are acceptable.
    (3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the 
excursion and the other type of monitoring data or engineering 
calculations to be used to demonstrate that the control device for the 
emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full 
or partial credits and debits.
    (4) The Administrator may assign full or partial credit and debits 
upon review of the information provided.
    (m) For each emission point included in an emissions average, the 
owner or operator shall perform testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting equivalent to that required for Group 1 emission points 
complying with Secs. 63.1314, 63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 63.1321, 
and 63.1330, as applicable. The specific requirements for continuous

    (a) Performance testing shall be conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 63.7(a)(1), (a)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(4), (g), and (h), with 
the exceptions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this 
section and the additions specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of 
this section. Sections 63.1314 through 63.1330 also contain specific 
testing requirements.
    (1) Performance tests shall be conducted according to the provisions 
of Sec. 63.7(e)(1) and (e)(2), except that performance tests shall be 
conducted at maximum representative operating conditions achievable 
during one of the time periods described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section, without causing any of the situations described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section to occur.
    (i) The 6-month period that ends 2 months before the Notification of 
Compliance Status is due, according to Sec. 63.1335(e)(5); or the 6-
month period that begins 3 months before the performance test and ends 3 
months after the performance test.
    (ii) Causing damage to equipment; necessitating that the owner or 
operator make product that does not meet an existing specification for 
sale to a customer; or necessitating that the owner or operator make 
product in excess of demand.
    (2) The requirements in Sec. 63.1335(e)(5) shall apply instead of 
the references in Sec. 63.7(g) to the Notification of Compliance Status 
requirements in Sec. 63.9(h).
    (3) Because the site-specific test plans in Sec. 63.7(c)(3) are not 
required, Sec. 63.7(h)(4)(ii) is not applicable.
    (4) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the 
intention to conduct a performance test at least 30 days before the 
performance test is scheduled to allow the Administrator the opportunity 
to have an observer present during the test. If after 30 days notice for 
an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to 
operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance 
test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the 
Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test 
date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the 
rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled 
date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.
    (5) Performance tests shall be performed no later than 150 days 
after the compliance dates specified in this subpart (i.e., in time for 
the results to be included in the Notification of Compliance Status), 
rather than according to the time periods in Sec. 63.7(a)(2) of subpart 
A of this part.
    (b) Each owner or operator of an existing affected source producing 
MBS complying with Sec. 63.1315(b)(2) shall determine compliance with

<R05>
Sec. 63.1334  Parameter monitoring levels and excursions.

    (a) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. The owner or 
operator of a control or recovery device that has one or more parameter 
monitoring level requirements specified under this subpart shall 
establish a maximum or minimum level for each measured parameter. If a 
performance test is required by this subpart for a control device, the 
owner or operator shall use the procedures in either paragraph (b) or 
(c) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring level(s). If a 
performance test is not required by this subpart for a control device, 
the owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (b), (c) or 
(d) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring level(s). When 
using the procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, 
the owner or operator shall submit the information specified in 
Sec. 63.1335(e)(3)(vii) for review and approval as part of the 
Precompliance Report.
    (1) The owner or operator shall operate control and recovery devices 
such that the daily average of monitored parameters remains above the 
minimum established level or below the maximum established level, except 
as otherwise stated in this subpart.
    (2) As specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(5), all established levels, 
along with their supporting documentation and the definition of an 
operating day, shall be submitted as part of the Notification of 
Compliance Status.
    (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring 
parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable 
provisions of subpart A, F, G, or H of this part.
    (b) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based exclusively 
on performance tests. In cases where a performance test is required by 
this subpart, or the owner or operator of the affected source elects to 
do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, 
and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring 
level for a control, recovery, or recapture device based exclusively on 
parameter values measured during the performance test, the owner or 
operator of the affected source shall comply with the procedures in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, as applicable.
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Continuous process vents. During initial compliance testing, the 
appropriate parameter shall be continuously monitored during the 
required 1-hour runs. The monitoring level(s) shall then be established 
as the average of the maximum (or minimum) point values from the three 
test runs. The average of the maximum values shall be used when 
establishing a maximum level, and the average of the minimum values 
shall be used when establishing a minimum level.
    (3) Batch process vents. The monitoring level(s) shall be 
established using the procedures specified in either paragraph (b)(3)(i) 
or (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The procedures specified in this 
paragraph (b)(3) may only be used if the batch emission episodes, or 
portions thereof, selected to be controlled were tested, and monitoring 
data were collected, during the entire period in which emissions were 
vented to the control device, as specified in Sec. 63.1325(c)(1)(i). If 
the owner or operator chose to test only a portion of the batch emission 
episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled, the procedures 
in paragraph (c) of this section shall be used.
    (i) If more than one batch emission episode or more than one portion 
of a batch emission episode has been selected to be controlled, a single 
level for the batch cycle shall be calculated as follows:
    (A) The average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for 
each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, in the batch cycle 
selected to be controlled. The average shall be based on all values 
measured during the required performance test.
    (B) If the level to be established is a maximum operating parameter, 
the level shall be defined as the minimum of the average parameter 
values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch 
cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or 
portion thereof, which requires the lowest parameter value in

[[Page 310]]

order to assure compliance. The average parameter value that is 
necessary to assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion 
thereof, shall be the level for all emission episodes, or portions 
thereof, in the batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).
    (C) If the level to be established is a minimum operating parameter, 
the level shall be defined as the maximum of the average parameter 
values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch 
cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or 
portion thereof, which requires the highest parameter value in order to 
assure compliance. The average parameter value that is necessary to 
assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion thereof, shall 
be the level for all emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the 
batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).
    (D) Alternatively, an average monitored parameter value shall be 
calculated for the entire batch cycle based on all values measured 
during each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be 
controlled.
    (ii) Instead of establishing a single level for the batch cycle, as 
described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator 
may establish separate levels for each batch emission episode, or 
portion thereof, selected to be controlled. Each level shall be 
determined as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
    (iii) The batch cycle shall be defined in the Notification of 
Compliance Status, as specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(5). Said definition 
shall include an identification of each batch emission episode and the 
information required to determine parameter monitoring compliance for 
partial batch cycles (i.e., when part of a batch cycle is accomplished 
during two different operating days).
    (4) Aggregate batch vent streams. For aggregate batch vent streams, 
the monitoring level shall be established in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on 
performance tests, supplemented by engineering assessments and/or 
manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where a performance test is 
required by this subpart, or the owner or operator elects to do a 
performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, and 
an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level 
for a control, recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (c), 
the owner or operator shall supplement the parameter values measured 
during the performance test with engineering assessments and/or 
manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required to 
be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter values.
    (d) Establishment of parameter monitoring based on engineering 
assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where a 
performance test is not required by this subpart and an owner or 
operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, 
recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (d), the 
determination of the parameter monitoring level shall be based 
exclusively on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's 
recommendations.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Parameter monitoring excursion definitions. (1) With respect to 
storage vessels (where the applicable monitoring plan specifies 
continuous monitoring), continuous process vents, aggregate batch vent 
streams, and process wastewater streams, an excursion means any of the 
three cases listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iii) of this 
section. For a control or recovery device where multiple parameters are 
monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria 
in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iii) of this section, this is 
considered a single excursion for the control or recovery device. For 
each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance 
with the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (g) 
of this section.
    (i) When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters 
is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for 
the given parameters.
    (ii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with 
the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, is 4 hours 
or greater in an operating day, and monitoring data are

[[Page 311]]

insufficient, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, to 
constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating 
hours.
    (iii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with 
the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, is less than 
4 hours in an operating day and more than two of the hours during the 
period of operation do not constitute a valid hour of data due to 
insufficient monitoring data, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this 
section.
    (iv) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of 
data, as used in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section, 
if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods 
within the hour. For data compression systems approved under 
Sec. 63.1335(g)(3), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a 
valid hour of data if there are less than four data measurements made 
during the hour.
    (v) The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(v)(A) through 
(f)(1)(v)(E) of this section are not considered to be part of the period 
of control or recovery device operation, for the purposes of paragraphs 
(f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (A) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (B) Start-ups;
    (C) Shutdowns;
    (D) Malfunctions; or
    (E) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (2) With respect to batch process vents, an excursion means one of 
the two cases listed in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this 
section. For a control device where multiple parameters are monitored, 
if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in either 
paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section, this is considered a 
single excursion for the control device. For each excursion, the owner 
or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of 
this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (i) When the batch cycle daily average value of one or more 
monitored parameters is above the maximum or below the minimum 
established level for the given parameters.
    (ii) When monitoring data are insufficient for an operating day. 
Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values 
are not available for at least 75 percent of the 15-minute periods when 
batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to 
the control device during the operating day, using the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(A) through (f)(2)(ii)(D) of this 
section.
    (A) Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when 
batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to 
the control device.
    (B) Subtract the time during the periods listed in paragraphs 
(f)(2)(ii)(B)(1) through (f)(2)(ii)(B)(4) of this section from the total 
amount of time determined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, to 
obtain the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are 
insufficient.
    (1) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (2) Start-ups;
    (3) Shutdowns; or
    (4) Malfunctions.
    (C) Determine the total number of 15-minute periods in the operating 
time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient, as was 
determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (D) If measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of 
the total number of 15-minute periods determined in paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the monitoring data are insufficient for 
the operating day.
    (3) For storage vessels where the applicable monitoring plan does 
not specify continuous monitoring, an excursion is defined in paragraph 
(f)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. For a control or 
recovery device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more 
of the parameters meets the excursion criteria, this is considered a 
single excursion for the control or recovery device. For each excursion,

[[Page 312]]

the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the 
provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (i) If the monitoring plan specifies monitoring a parameter and 
recording its value at specific intervals (such as every 15 minutes or 
every hour), either of the cases listed in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A) or 
(f)(3)(i)(B) of this section is considered a single excursion for the 
control device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be 
deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as 
provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (A) When the average value of one or more parameters, averaged over 
the duration of the filling period for the storage vessel, is above the 
maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given 
parameters.
    (B) When monitoring data are insufficient. Monitoring data shall be 
considered insufficient when measured values are not available for at 
least 75 percent of the specific intervals at which parameters are to be 
monitored and recorded, according to the storage vessel's monitoring 
plan, during the filling period for the storage vessel.
    (ii) If the monitoring plan does not specify monitoring a parameter 
and recording its value at specific intervals (for example, if the 
relevant operating requirement is to exchange a disposable carbon 
canister before expiration of its rated service life), the monitoring 
plan shall define an excursion in terms of the relevant operating 
requirement.
    (4) With respect to continuous process vents complying with the mass 
emissions per mass product requirements specified in 
Sec. 63.1316(b)(1)(i)(A), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or 
(c)(1)(i), an excursion has occurred when the mass emission rate 
calculated as specified in Sec. 63.1318(c) exceeds the appropriate mass 
emissions per mass product requirement. For each excursion, the owner or 
operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (5) With respect to continuous process vents complying with the 
temperature limits for final condensers specified in 
Sec. 63.1316(b)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(1)(ii), an excursion has occurred when 
the daily average exit temperature exceeds the appropriate condenser 
temperature limit. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be 
deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as 
provided in paragraph (g) of this section. The periods listed in 
paragraphs (f)(5)(i) through (f)(5)(v) of this section are not 
considered to be part of the period of operation for the condenser for 
purposes of determining the daily average exit temperature.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; or
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (6) With respect to new affected sources producing SAN using a batch 
process, an excursion has occurred when the percent reduction calculated 
using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1333(c) is less than 84 
percent. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out 
of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section. The periods listed in paragraphs 
(f)(6)(i) through (f)(6)(v) of this section are not considered to be 
part of the period of control or recovery device operation for purposes 
of determining the percent reduction.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; or
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (7) With respect to continuous process vents complying with the mass 
emissions per mass product requirement specified in Sec. 63.1315(b)(2), 
an excursion has occurred when the mass emission rate calculated as 
specified in Sec. 63.1333(b) exceeds the mass emissions per mass product 
requirement specified in Sec. 63.1315(b)(2). For each excursion, the 
owner or operator shall be deemed

[[Page 313]]

out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as 
provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) Excused excursions. A number of excused excursions shall be 
allowed for each control or recovery device for each semiannual period. 
The number of excused excursions for each semiannual period is specified 
in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(6) of this section. This paragraph (g) 
applies to affected sources required to submit Periodic Reports 
semiannually or quarterly. The first semiannual period is the 6-month 
period starting the date the Notification of Compliance Status is due.
    (1) For the first semiannual period--six excused excursions.
    (2) For the second semiannual period--five excused excursions.
    (3) For the third semiannual period--four excused excursions.
    (4) For the fourth semiannual period--three excused excursions.
    (5) For the fifth semiannual period--two excused excursions.
    (6) For the sixth and all subsequent semiannual periods--one excused 
excursion.

<R05>
Sec. 63.1335  General recordkeeping and reporting provisions.

    (a) Data retention. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the 
owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all 
applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 
years, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with the 
exception listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that 
they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall 
be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by 
computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained 
offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable 
form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, 
floppy disk, magnetic tape, or microfiche.
    (2) If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the 
appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required 
to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the 
requirement of Sec. 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, 
the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of those 
reports.
    (b) Requirements of subpart A of this part. The owner or operator of 
an affected source shall comply with the applicable recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements in subpart A of this part as specified in Table 1 
of this subpart. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) Start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan. The owner or operator 
of an affected source shall develop and implement a written start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan as specified in Sec. 63.6(e)(3). This 
plan shall describe, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining 
the affected source during periods of start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction and a program for corrective action for malfunctioning 
process and air pollution control equipment used to comply with this 
subpart. Inclusion of Group 2 emission points is not required, unless 
these points are included in an emissions average. For equipment leaks 
(subject to Sec. 63.1331), the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan 
requirement is limited to control devices and is optional for other 
equipment. For equipment leaks, the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction 
plan may include written procedures that identify conditions that 
justify a delay of repair. A provision for ceasing to collect, during a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data that would otherwise 
be required by the provisions of this subpart may be included in the 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan only if the owner or operator 
has demonstrated to the Administrator, through the Precompliance Report 
or a supplement to the Precompliance Report, that the monitoring system 
would be damaged or destroyed if it were not shut down during the start-
up, shutdown, or malfunction. The affected source shall keep the

[[Page 314]]

start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan on-site. Records associated 
with the plan shall be kept as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) 
through (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section. Reports related to the plan shall 
be submitted as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) Records of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. The owner or 
operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) 
through (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section.
    (A) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment or control 
devices or recovery devices or continuous monitoring systems used to 
comply with this subpart during which excess emissions (as defined in 
Sec. 63.1310(j)(4)) occur.
    (B) For each start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during which excess 
emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.1310(j)(4)) occur, records reflecting 
whether the procedures specified in the affected source's start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of 
actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing 
a control device to a backup control device, records shall be kept of 
whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a 
``checklist,'' or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance 
with the start-up shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.
    (C) Records specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through 
(b)(1)(i)(B) of this section are not required if they pertain solely to 
Group 2 emission points that are not included in an emissions average.
    (ii) Reports of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. For the 
purposes of this subpart, the semiannual start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction reports shall be submitted on the same schedule as the 
Periodic Reports required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section instead 
of being submitted on the schedule specified in Sec. 63.10(d)(5)(i). The 
reports shall include the information specified in Sec. 63.10(d)(5)(i).
    (2) Application for approval of construction or reconstruction. For 
new affected sources, each owner or operator shall comply with the 
provisions in Sec. 63.5 regarding construction and reconstruction, 
excluding the provisions specified in Sec. 63.5(d)(1)(ii)(H), 
(d)(1)(iii), (d)(2), and (d)(3)(ii).
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Recordkeeping and documentation. Owners or operators required to 
keep continuous records shall keep records as specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (d)(7) of this section, unless an alternative 
recordkeeping system has been requested and approved as specified in 
paragraph (g) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (h) 
of this section. If a monitoring plan for storage vessels pursuant to 
Sec. 63.1314(a)(9) requires continuous records, the monitoring plan 
shall specify which provisions, if any, of paragraphs (d)(1) through 
(d)(7) of this section apply. As described in Sec. 63.1314(a)(9), 
certain storage vessels are not required to keep continuous records as 
specified in this paragraph. Owners and operators of such storage 
vessels shall keep records as specified in the monitoring plan required 
by Sec. 63.1314(a)(9). Paragraphs (d)(8) and (d)(9) of this section 
specify documentation requirements.
    (1) The monitoring system shall measure data values at least once 
every 15 minutes.
    (2) The owner or operator shall record either each measured data 
value or block average values for 1 hour or shorter periods calculated 
from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured 
more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may 
be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) block average 
instead of all measured values. Owners or operators of batch process 
vents shall record each measured data value.
    (3) Daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values of each 
continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated for each operating 
day as specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section, except as specified in paragraphs (d)(6) and (d)(7) of this 
section.
    (i) The daily average value or batch cycle daily average shall be 
calculated as the average of all parameter values

[[Page 315]]

recorded during the operating day, except as specified in paragraph 
(d)(7) of this section. For batch process vents, as specified in 
Sec. 63.1326(e)(2)(i), only parameter values measured during those batch 
emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle that the 
owner or operator has chosen to control shall be used to calculate the 
average. The calculated average shall cover a 24-hour period if 
operation is continuous, or the number of hours of operation per 
operating day if operation is not continuous.
    (ii) The operating day shall be the period the owner or operator 
specifies in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance 
Status for purposes of determining daily average values or batch cycle 
daily average values of monitored parameters.
    (4)-(5) [Reserved]
    (6) Records required when all recorded values are within the 
established limits. If all recorded values for a monitored parameter 
during an operating day are above the minimum level or below the maximum 
level established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating 
permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the 
minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and 
recording a daily average (or batch cycle daily average) for that 
operating day.
    (7) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs 
(d)(7)(i) through (d)(7)(v) of this section shall not be included in any 
average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times 
and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process 
or control device or recovery device operation when monitors are not 
operating.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions;
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (8) For continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this 
subpart, records documenting the completion of calibration checks, and 
records documenting the maintenance of continuous monitoring systems 
that are specified in the manufacturer's instructions or that are 
specified in other written procedures that provide adequate assurance 
that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
    (9) The owner or operator of an affected source granted a waiver 
under Sec. 63.10(f) shall maintain the information, if any, specified by 
the Administrator as a condition of the waiver of recordkeeping or 
reporting requirements.
    (e) Reporting and notification. In addition to the reports and 
notifications required by subpart A of this part as specified in Table 1 
of this subpart, the owner or operator of an affected source shall 
prepare and submit the reports listed in paragraphs (e)(3) through 
(e)(8) of this section, as applicable. All reports required by this 
subpart, and the schedule for their submittal, are listed in Table 9 of 
this subpart.

values at least once every 15 minutes and that does not generate 
continuous records may request approval to use a nonautomated system 
with less frequent monitoring, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2)(i) 
and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The requested system shall include manual reading and recording 
of the value of the relevant operating parameter no less frequently than 
once per hour. Daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values shall 
be calculated from these hourly values and recorded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the planned monitoring and recordkeeping 
system;
    (B) Documentation that the affected source does not have an 
automated monitoring and recording system;

recordkeeping system; and

[[Page 328]]

    (D) Demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction that the 
proposed monitoring frequency is sufficient to represent control or 
recovery device operating conditions, considering typical variability of 
the specific process and control or recovery device operating parameter 
being monitored.
    (3) An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated 
data compression recording system that does not record monitored 
operating parameter values at a set frequency, but records all values 
that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded values, in 
accordance with paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The requested system shall be designed to:
    (A) Measure the operating parameter value at least once during every 
15 minute period;
    (B) Except for the monitoring of batch process vents, calculate 
hourly average values each hour during periods of operation;
    (C) Record the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;
    (D) Recognize unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not 
functioning properly, alert the operator, and record the incident;
    (E) Calculate daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values of 
the monitored operating parameter based on all measured data; and
    (F) If the daily average is not an excursion, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1334(f), the data for that operating day may be converted to 
hourly average values and the four or more individual records for each 
hour in the operating day may be discarded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the monitoring system and data compression 
recording system, including the criteria used to determine which 
monitored values are recorded and retained;
    (B) The method for calculating daily averages and batch cycle daily 
averages; and
    (C) A demonstration that the system meets all criteria in paragraph 
(g)(3)(i) of this section.

alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.8(f)(4).
    (h) Reduced recordkeeping program. For any parameter with respect to 
any item of equipment, the owner or operator may implement the 
recordkeeping requirements specified in paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of 
this section as alternatives to the continuous operating parameter 
monitoring and recordkeeping provisions that would otherwise apply under 
this subpart. The owner or operator shall retain for a period of 5 years 
each record required by paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section, 
except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average (or 
batch cycle daily average) value, and is not required to retain more 
frequent monitored operating parameter values, for a monitored parameter 
with respect to an item of equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(vi) of this section are met. An owner or 
operator electing to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of 
Compliance Status as specified in paragraph (e)(5)(xi) of this section 
or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, 
in the Periodic Report immediately preceding implementation of the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section as specified in 
paragraph (e)(6)(ix) of this section.
    (i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or 
impossible data during periods of operation other than start-ups, 
shutdowns, or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of -200  deg.C 
on a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The 
owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the 
alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
    (ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly 
throughout each operating day, a running average of the monitoring 
values that have been obtained during that operating day, and the 
capability to observe this running average is readily available to the 
Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator 
shall record the occurrence of

[[Page 329]]

any period meeting the criteria in paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) through 
(h)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. All instances in an operating day 
constitute a single occurrence.
    (A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum 
established limits;
    (B) The running average is based on at least six 1-hour average 
values; and
    (C) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data 
during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns, or 
malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging 
data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., 
pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other 
means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances 
of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single 
occurrence.
    (iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an 
alarm or other means, if the running average parameter value calculated 
under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is 
appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is 
being monitored.
    (v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the 
monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements 
of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, at the times specified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(v)(A) through (h)(1)(v)(C). The owner or operator 
shall document that the required verifications occurred.
    (A) Upon initial installation.
    (B) Annually after initial installation.
    (C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting 
the monitoring system, which might reasonably be expected to alter the 
monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this 
section.
    (vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(vi)(A) through (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
    (A) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, 
for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and of how 
compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(v) of this section. The description shall 
identify the location and format (e.g., on-line storage, log entries) 
for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or 
operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded 
description, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, except as 
provided in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
    (C) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring 
system that would reasonably be expected to impair its ability to comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (D) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(B) of this 
section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as 
long as the description is current. The current description shall, at 
all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location 
by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. The owner or operator shall retain all superseded descriptions 
for at least 5 years after the date of their creation. Superseded 
descriptions shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central 
location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours 
after a request) for at least 6 months after their creation. Thereafter, 
superseded descriptions may be stored off-site.
    (2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a monitored 
parameter with respect to an item of equipment and a period of 6 
consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in 
paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer 
required to record the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) 
value for any operating day when the daily average (or batch cycle daily 
average) value is less than the maximum or greater than the minimum 
established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data

[[Page 330]]

generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited 
toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and 
the monitoring accomplished during the period prior to the compliance 
date was required and/or approved by the Administrator.
    (i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average 
(or batch cycle daily average) values, the owner or operator shall 
notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report as specified in 
paragraph (e)(6)(x) of this section. The notification shall identify the 
parameter and unit of equipment.
    (ii) If, on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased 
recording daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values as 
provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, there is an excursion as 
defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator 
shall immediately resume retaining the daily average (or batch cycle 
daily average) value for each operating day and shall notify the 
Administrator in the next Periodic Report. The owner or operator shall 
continue to retain each daily average (or batch cycle daily average) 
value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an 
excursion as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(iii) of this section, for the 
duration specified in paragraph (h) of this section. For any calendar 
week, if compliance with paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(iv) of this 
section does not result in retention of a record of at least one 
occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall 
record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of 
operation other than a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iv) For purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, an excursion 
means that the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value of 
monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less 
than the minimum established value, except as provided in paragraphs 
(h)(2)(iv)(A) and (h)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.
    (A) The daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value during 
any start-up, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered an 
excursion for purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if the owner 
or operator follows the applicable provisions of the start-up, shutdown, 
and malfunction plan required by Sec. 63.6(e)(3).
    (B) An excused excursion, as described in Sec. 63.1334(g), shall not 
be considered an excursion for purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section.

 Subpart LLL--National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
             From the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry

    Source: 64 FR 31925, June 14, 1999, unless otherwise noted.

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 63.1340  Applicability and designation of affected sources.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
the provisions of this subpart apply to each new and existing portland 
cement plant which is a major source or an area source as defined in 
Sec. 63.2.
    (b) The affected sources subject to this subpart are:
    (1) Each kiln and each in-line kiln/raw mill at any major or area 
source, including alkali bypasses, except for kilns and in-line kiln/raw 
mills that burn hazardous waste and are subject to and regulated under 
subpart EEE of this part;
    (2) Each clinker cooler at any portland cement plant which is a 
major source;
    (3) Each raw mill at any portland cement plant which is a major 
source;
    (4) Each finish mill at any portland cement plant which is a major 
source;
    (5) Each raw material dryer at any portland cement plant which is a 
major source and each greenfield raw material dryer at any portland 
cement plant which is a major or area source;
    (6) Each raw material, clinker, or finished product storage bin at 
any portland cement plant which is a major source;
    (7) Each conveying system transfer point at any portland cement 
plant which is a major source;
    (8) Each bagging system at any portland cement plant which is a 
major source; and
    (9) Each bulk loading or unloading system at any portland cement 
plant which is a major source.
    (c) For portland cement plants with on-site nonmetallic mineral 
processing facilities, the first affected source in the sequence of 
materials handling operations subject to this subpart is the raw 
material storage, which is just prior to the raw mill. The primary and 
secondary crushers and any other equipment of the on-site nonmetallic 
mineral processing plant which precedes the raw material storage are not 
subject to this subpart. Furthermore, the first conveyor transfer point 
subject to this subpart is the transfer point associated with the 
conveyor transferring material from the raw material storage to the raw 
mill.
    (d) The owner or operator of any affected source subject to the 
provisions of this subpart is subject to title V permitting 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1341  Definitions.

    All terms used in this subpart that are not defined in this section 
have the meaning given to them in the CAA and in subpart A of this part.
    Alkali bypass means a duct between the feed end of the kiln and the 
preheater tower through which a portion of the kiln exit gas stream is 
withdrawn and quickly cooled by air or water to avoid excessive buildup 
of alkali, chloride and/or sulfur on the raw feed. This may also be 
referred to as the ``kiln exhaust gas bypass''.
    Bagging system means the equipment which fills bags with portland 
cement.
    Clinker cooler means equipment into which clinker product leaving 
the kiln is placed to be cooled by air supplied by a forced draft or 
natural draft supply system.
    Continuous monitor means a device which continuously samples the 
regulated parameter specified in Sec. 63.1350 of this subpart without 
interruption, evaluates the detector response at least once every 15 
seconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60 
seconds, except during allowable periods of calibration and except as 
defined otherwise by the continuous emission monitoring system 
performance specifications in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.
    Conveying system means a device for transporting materials from one 
piece of equipment or location to another location within a facility. 
Conveying systems include but are not limited to the following: feeders, 
belt conveyors,

[[Page 342]]

bucket elevators and pneumatic systems.
    Conveying system transfer point means a point where any material 
including but not limited to feed material, fuel, clinker or product, is 
transferred to or from a conveying system, or between separate parts of 
a conveying system.
    Dioxins  and  furans  (D/F)  means tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, 
and octa-chlorinated dibenzo dioxins and furans.
    Facility means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common ownership or control, including properties that are separated 
only by a road or other public right-of-way.
    Feed means the prepared and mixed materials, which include but are 
not limited to materials such as limestone, clay, shale, sand, iron ore, 
mill scale, cement kiln dust and flyash, that are fed to the kiln. Feed 
does not include the fuels used in the kiln to produce heat to form the 
clinker product.
    Finish mill means a roll crusher, ball and tube mill or other size 
reduction equipment used to grind clinker to a fine powder. Gypsum and 
other materials may be added to and blended with clinker in a finish 
mill. The finish mill also includes the air separator associated with 
the finish mill.
    Greenfield kiln, in-line kiln/raw mill, or raw material dryer means 
a kiln, in-line kiln/raw mill, or raw material dryer for which 
construction is commenced at a plant site (where no kilns and no in-line 
kiln/raw mills were in operation at any time prior to March 24, 1998) 
after March 24, 1998.
    Hazardous waste is defined in Sec. 261.3 of this chapter.
    In-line kiln/raw mill means a system in a portland cement production 
process where a dry kiln system is integrated with the raw mill so that 
all or a portion of the kiln exhaust gases are used to perform the 
drying operation of the raw mill, with no auxiliary heat source used. In 
this system the kiln is capable of operating without the raw mill 
operating, but the raw mill cannot operate without the kiln gases, and 
consequently, the raw mill does not generate a separate exhaust gas 
stream.
    Kiln means a device, including any associated preheater or 
precalciner devices, that produces clinker by heating limestone and 
other materials for subsequent production of portland cement.
    Kiln exhaust gas bypass means alkali bypass.
    Monovent means an exhaust configuration of a building or emission 
control device (e. g. positive pressure fabric filter) that extends the 
length of the structure and has a width very small in relation to its 
length (i. e., length to width ratio is typically greater than 5:1). The 
exhaust may be an open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a 
combination of such features.
    New brownfield kiln, in-line kiln raw mill, or raw material dryer 
means a kiln, in-line kiln/raw mill or raw material dryer for which 
construction is commenced at a plant site (where kilns and/or in-line 
kiln/raw mills were in operation prior to March 24, 1998) after March 
24, 1998.
    One-minute average means the average of thermocouple or other sensor 
responses calculated at least every 60 seconds from responses obtained 
at least once during each consecutive 15 second period.
    Portland cement plant means any facility manufacturing portland 
cement.
    Raw material dryer means an impact dryer, drum dryer, paddle-
equipped rapid dryer, air separator, or other equipment used to reduce 
the moisture content of feed materials.
    Raw mill means a ball and tube mill, vertical roller mill or other 
size reduction equipment, that is not part of an in-line kiln/raw mill, 
used to grind feed to the appropriate size. Moisture may be added or 
removed from the feed during the grinding operation. If the raw mill is 
used to remove moisture from feed materials, it is also, by definition, 
a raw material dryer. The raw mill also includes the air separator 
associated with the raw mill.
    Rolling average means the average of all one-minute averages over 
the averaging period.
    Run average means the average of the one-minute parameter values for 
a run.
    TEQ means the international method of expressing toxicity 
equivalents for dioxins and furans as defined in U.S. EPA, Interim 
Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures to Mixtures of 
Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and -dibenzofurans

Sec. 63.1343  Standards for kilns and in-line kiln/raw mills.

    (a) General. The provisions in this section apply to each kiln, each 
in-line kiln/raw mill, and any alkali bypass associated with that kiln 
or in-line kiln/raw mill.
    (b) Existing, reconstructed, or new brownfield/major sources. No 
owner or operator of an existing, reconstructed or new brownfield kiln 
or an existing, reconstructed or new brownfield in-line kiln/raw mill at 
a facility that is a major source subject to the provisions of this 
subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from these 
affected sources, any gases which:
    (1) Contain particulate matter (PM) in excess of 0.15 kg per Mg 
(0.30 lb per ton) of feed (dry basis) to the kiln. When there is an 
alkali bypass associated with a kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill, the 
combined particulate matter emissions from the kiln or in-line kiln/raw 
mill and the alkali bypass are subject to this emission limit.

                  Monitoring and Compliance Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 63.1349  Performance testing requirements.

    (a) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to this 
subpart shall demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits of 
Sec. 63.1343 and Secs. 63.1345 through 63.1348 using the test methods 
and procedures in paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 63.7. 
Performance test results shall be documented in complete test reports 
that contain the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(10) of this section, as well as all other relevant information. The 
plan to be followed during testing shall be made available to the 
Administrator prior to testing, if requested.
    (1) A brief description of the process and the air pollution control 
system;
    (2) Sampling location description(s);
    (3) A description of sampling and analytical procedures and any 
modifications to standard procedures;
    (4) Test results;
    (5) Quality assurance procedures and results;
    (6) Records of operating conditions during the test, preparation of 
standards, and calibration procedures;
    (7) Raw data sheets for field sampling and field and laboratory 
analyses;
    (8) Documentation of calculations;
    (9) All data recorded and used to establish parameters for 
compliance monitoring; and
    (10) Any other information required by the test method.
    (b) Performance tests to demonstrate initial compliance with this 
subpart shall be conducted as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(4) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator of a kiln subject to limitations on 
particulate matter emissions shall demonstrate initial compliance by 
conducting a performance test as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
through (b)(1)(iv) of this section. The owner or operator of an in-line 
kiln/raw mill subject to limitations on particulate matter emissions 
shall demonstrate initial compliance by conducting separate performance 
tests as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this 
section while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is under normal 
operating conditions and while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill 
is not operating. The owner or operator of a clinker cooler subject to 
limitations on particulate matter emissions shall demonstrate initial 
compliance by conducting a performance test as specified in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this section. The opacity exhibited 
during the period of the Method 5 of Appendix A to part 60 of this 
chapter performance tests required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section shall be determined as required in paragraphs (b)(1)(v) through 
(vi) of this section.
    (i) EPA Method 5 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be 
used to determine PM emissions. Each performance test shall consist of 
three

[[Page 347]]

separate runs under the conditions that exist when the affected source 
is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected 
to occur. Each run shall be conducted for at least one hour, and the 
minimum sample volume shall be 0.85 dscm (30 dscf). The average of the 
three runs shall be used to determine compliance. A determination of the 
particulate matter collected in the impingers (``back half'') of the 
Method 5 particulate sampling train is not required to demonstrate 
initial compliance with the PM standards of this subpart. However this 
shall not preclude the permitting authority from requiring a 
determination of the ``back half'' for other purposes.
    (ii) Suitable methods shall be used to determine the kiln or inline 
kiln/raw mill feed rate, except for fuels, for each run.
    (iii) The emission rate, E, of PM shall be computed for each run 
using equation 1:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.001

Where:

E = emission rate of particulate matter, kg/Mg of kiln feed.
c<INF>s</INF> = concentration of PM, kg/dscm.
Q<INF>sd</INF> = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr.
P = total kiln feed (dry basis), Mg/hr.

    (iv) When there is an alkali bypass associated with a kiln or in-
line kiln/raw mill, the main exhaust and alkali bypass of the kiln or 
in-line kiln/raw mill shall be tested simultaneously and the combined 
emission rate of particulate matter from the kiln or in-line kiln/raw 
mill and alkali bypass shall be computed for each run using equation 2,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.002

Where:

E<INF>c</INF> = the combined emission rate of particulate matter from 
          the kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill and bypass stack, kg/Mg of 
          kiln feed.
c<INF>sk</INF> = concentration of particulate matter in the kiln or in-
          line kiln/raw mill effluent, kg/dscm.
    Q<INF>sdk</INF> = volumetric flow rate of kiln or in-line kiln/raw 
mill effluent, dscm/hr.
c<INF>sb</INF> = concentration of particulate matter in the alkali 
          bypass gas, kg/dscm.
Q<INF>sdb</INF> = volumetric flow rate of alkali bypass gas, dscm/hr.
P=total kiln feed (dry basis), Mg/hr.

    (v) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section the 
opacity exhibited during the period of the Method 5 performance tests 
required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be determined 
through the use of a continuous opacity monitor (COM). The maximum six-
minute average opacity during the three Method 5 test runs shall be 
determined during each Method 5 test run, and used to demonstrate 
initial compliance with the applicable opacity limits of 
Sec. 63.1343(b)(2), Sec. 63.1343(c)(2), or Sec. 63.1345(a)(2).
    (vi) Each owner or operator of a kiln, in-line kiln/raw mill, or 
clinker cooler subject to the provisions of this subpart using a fabric 
filter with multiple stacks or an electrostatic precipitator with 
multiple stacks may, in lieu of installing the continuous opacity 
monitoring system required by paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, 
conduct an opacity test in accordance with Method 9 of appendix A to 
part 60 of this chapter during each Method 5 performance test required 
by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. If the control device exhausts 
through a monovent, or if the use of a COM in accordance with the 
installation specifications of Performance Specification 1 (PS-1) of 
appendix B to part 60 of this chapter is not feasible, a test shall be 
conducted in accordance with Method 9 of appendix A to part 60 of this 
chapter during each Method 5 performance test required by paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section. The maximum six-minute average opacity shall 
be determined during the three Method 5 test runs, and used to 
demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable opacity limits of 
Sec. 63.1343(b)(2), Sec. 63.1343(c)(2), or Sec. 63.1345(a)(2).
    (2) The owner or operator of any affected source subject to 
limitations on opacity under this subpart that is not subject to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall demonstrate initial compliance 
with the affected source opacity limit by conducting a test in 
accordance with Method 9 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter. The 
performance test shall be conducted under the conditions that exist when 
the affected

[[Page 348]]

source is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably 
expected to occur. The maximum six-minute average opacity exhibited 
during the test period shall be used to determine whether the affected 
source is in initial compliance with the standard. The duration of the 
Method 9 performance test shall be 3-hours (30 6-minute averages), 
except that the duration of the Method 9 performance test may be reduced 
to 1-hour if the conditions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (ii) of the 
section apply:
    (i) There are no individual readings greater than 10 percent 
opacity;
    (ii) There are no more than three readings of 10 percent for the 
first 1-hour period.
    (3) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to 
limitations on D/F emissions shall demonstrate initial compliance with 
the D/F emission limit by conducting a performance test using Method 23 
of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter. The owner or operator of an 
in-line kiln/raw mill shall demonstrate initial compliance by conducting 
separate performance tests while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw 
mill is under normal operating conditions and while the raw mill of the 
in-line kiln/raw mill is not operating. The owner or operator of a kiln 
or in-line kiln/raw mill equipped with an alkali bypass shall conduct 
simultaneous performance tests of the kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill 
exhaust and the alkali bypass, however the owner or operator of an in-
line kiln/raw mill is not required to conduct a performance test of the 
alkali bypass exhaust when the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is 
not operating.
    (i) Each performance test shall consist of three separate runs; each 
run shall be conducted under the conditions that exist when the affected 
source is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably 
expected to occur. The duration of each run shall be at least three 
hours and the sample volume for each run shall be at least 2.5 dscm (90 
dscf). The concentration shall be determined for each run and the 
arithmetic average of the concentrations measured for the three runs 
shall be calculated and used to determine compliance.
    (ii) The temperature at the inlet to the kiln or in-line kiln/raw 
mill PMCD, and where applicable, the temperature at the inlet to the 
alkali bypass PMCD, must be continuously recorded during the period of 
the Method 23 test, and the continuous temperature record(s) must be 
included in the performance test report.
    (iii) One-minute average temperatures must be calculated for each 
minute of each run of the test.
    (iv) The run average temperature must be calculated for each run, 
and the average of the run average temperatures must be determined and 
included in the performance test report and will determine the 
applicable temperature limit in accordance with Sec. 63.1344(b).
    (v) If activated carbon injection is used for D/F control, the rate 
of activated carbon injection to the kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill 
exhaust, and where applicable, the rate of activated carbon injection to 
the alkali bypass exhaust, must be continuously recorded during the 
period of the Method 23 test, and the continuous injection rate 
record(s) must be included in the performance test report. In addition, 
the performance test report must include the brand and type of activated 
carbon used during the performance test and a continuous record of 
either the carrier gas flow rate or the carrier gas pressure drop for 
the duration of the test. Activated carbon injection rate parameters 
must be determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3)(vi) of this 
section.
    (vi) The run average injection rate must be calculated for each run, 
and the average of the run average injection rates must be determined 
and included in the performance test report and will determine the 
applicable injection rate limit in accordance with Sec. 63.1344(c)(1).
    (4) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to 
limitations on emissions of THC shall demonstrate initial compliance 
with the THC limit by operating a continuous emission monitor in 
accordance with Performance Specification 8A of appendix B to part 60 of 
this chapter. The duration of the performance test shall be three

[[Page 349]]

hours, and the average THC concentration (as calculated from the one-
minute averages) during the three hour performance test shall be 
calculated. The owner or operator of an in-line kiln/raw mill shall 
demonstrate initial compliance by conducting separate performance tests 
while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is under normal 
operating conditions and while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill 
is not operating.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, performance 
tests required under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall 
be repeated every five years, except that the owner or operator of a 
kiln, in-line kiln/raw mill or clinker cooler is not required to repeat 
the initial performance test of opacity for the kiln, in-line kiln/raw 
mill or clinker cooler.
    (d) Performance tests required under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section shall be repeated every 30 months.
    (e) The owner or operator is required to repeat the performance 
tests for kilns or in-line kiln/raw mills as specified in paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section within 90 days of initiating any 
significant change in the feed or fuel from that used in the previous 
performance test.

to the provisions of this subpart using a fabric filter with multiple 
stacks or an electrostatic precipitator with multiple stacks may, in 
lieu of installing the continuous opacity monitoring system required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, monitor opacity in accordance with 
paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section. If the control device 
exhausts through a monovent, or if the use of a COM in accordance with 
the installation specifications of PS-1 of appendix B to part 60 of this 
chapter is not feasible, the owner or operator must monitor opacity in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section.
    (i) Perform daily visual opacity observations of each stack in 
accordance with the procedures of Method 9 of appendix A of part 60 of 
this chapter. The Method 9 test shall be conducted while the affected 
source is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably 
expected to occur within the day. The duration of the Method 9 test 
shall be at least 30 minutes each day.
    (ii) Use the Method 9 procedures to monitor and record the average 
opacity for each six-minute period during the test.
    (3) To remain in compliance, the opacity must be maintained such 
that the 6-minute average opacity for any 6-minute block period does not 
exceed 20 percent. If the average opacity for any 6-minute block period 
exceeds 20 percent, this shall constitute a violation of the standard.
    (d) The owner or operator of a clinker cooler shall monitor opacity 
at each point where emissions are vented from the clinker cooler in 
accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.

provisions of this subpart using a fabric filter with multiple stacks or 
an electrostatic precipitator with multiple stacks may, in lieu of 
installing the continuous opacity monitoring system required by 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, monitor opacity in accordance with 
paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section. If the control device 
exhausts through a monovent, or if the use of a COM in accordance with 
the installation specifications of PS-1 of appendix B to part 60 of this 
chapter is not feasible, the owner or operator must monitor opacity in 
accordance with paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section.
    (i) Perform daily visual opacity observations of each stack in 
accordance with the procedures of Method 9 of appendix A of part 60 of 
this chapter. The Method 9 test shall be conducted while the affected 
source is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably 
expected to occur within the day. The duration of the Method 9 test 
shall be at least 30 minutes each day.
    (ii) Use the Method 9 procedures to monitor and record the average 
opacity for each six-minute period during the test.
    (3) To remain in compliance, the opacity must be maintained such 
that the 6-minute average opacity for any 6-minute block period does not 
exceed 10 percent. If the average opacity for any 6-minute block period 
exceeds 10 percent, this shall constitute a violation of the standard.
    (e) The owner or operator of a raw mill or finish mill shall monitor 
opacity by conducting daily visual emissions observations of the mill 
sweep and air separator PMCDs of these affected sources, in accordance 
with the procedures of Method 22 of appendix A of part 60 of this 
chapter. The Method 22 test shall be conducted while the affected source 
is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected 
to occur within the day. The duration of the Method 22 test shall be six 
minutes. If visible emissions are observed during any Method 22 visible 
emissions test, the owner or operator must:
    (1) Initiate, within one-hour, the corrective actions specified in 
the site specific operating and maintenance plan developed in accordance 
with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section; and
    (2) Within 24 hours of the end of the Method 22 test in which 
visible emissions were observed, conduct a visual opacity test of each 
stack from which visible emissions were observed in accordance with 
Method 9 of appendix A of part 60 of this chapter. The duration of the 
Method 9 test shall be thirty minutes.
    (f) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to a

and alkali bypass, if applicable, at the inlet to the kiln, in-line 
kiln/raw mill and/or alkali bypass PMCD.
    (3) The three-hour rolling average temperature shall be calculated 
as the average of 180 successive one-minute average temperatures.

[[Page 352]]

    (4) Periods of time when one-minute averages are not available shall 
be ignored when calculating three-hour rolling averages. When one-minute 
averages become available, the first one-minute average is added to the 
previous 179 values to calculate the three-hour rolling average.
    (5) When the operating status of the raw mill of the in-line kiln/
raw mill is changed from off to on, or from on to off the calculation of 
the three-hour rolling average temperature must begin anew, without 
considering previous recordings.
    (6) The calibration of all thermocouples and other temperature 
sensors shall be verified at least once every three months.
    (g) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to a 
limitation on D/F emissions that employs carbon injection as an emission 
control technique shall comply with the monitoring requirements of 
paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(6) and (g)(1) through (g)(6) of this

months.
    (3) The three-hour rolling average activated carbon injection rate 
shall be calculated as the average of 180 successive one-minute average 
activated carbon injection rates.
    (4) Periods of time when one-minute averages are not available shall 
be ignored when calculating three-hour rolling averages. When one-minute 
averages become available, the first one-minute average is added to the 
previous 179 values to calculate the three-hour rolling average.
    (5) When the operating status of the raw mill of the in-line kiln/
raw mill is changed from off to on, or from on to off the calculation of 
the three-hour rolling average activated carbon injection rate must 
begin anew, without considering previous recordings.
    (6) The owner or operator must install, operate, calibrate and 
maintain a continuous monitor to record the activated carbon injection 
system carrier gas parameter (either the carrier gas flow rate or the 
carrier gas pressure drop) established during the D/F performance test 
in accordance with paragraphs (g)(6)(i) through (g)(6)(iii) of this 
section.
    (i) The owner or operator shall install, calibrate, operate and 
maintain a device to continuously monitor and record the parameter 
value.
    (ii) The owner or operator must calculate and record three-hour 
rolling averages of the parameter value.

added to the previous 179 values to calculate the three-hour rolling 
average.
    (h) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to a 
limitation on THC emissions under this subpart shall comply with the 
monitoring requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(3) of this 
section to demonstrate continuous compliance with the THC emission 
standard:
    (1) The owner or operator shall install, operate and maintain a THC 
continuous emission monitoring system in accordance with Performance 
Specification 8A, of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter and comply 
with all of the requirements for continuous monitoring systems found in 
the general provisions, subpart A of this part.
    (2) The owner or operator is not required to calculate hourly 
rolling averages in accordance with section 4.9 of Performance 
Specification 8A.
    (3) Any thirty-day block average THC concentration in any gas 
discharged from a greenfield raw material dryer, the main exhaust of a 
greenfield kiln, or the main exhaust of a greenfield in-line kiln/raw 
mill, exceeding 50 ppmvd, reported as propane, corrected to seven 
percent oxygen, is a violation of the standard.
    (i) The owner or operator of any kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill 
subject to a     D/F emission limit under this subpart shall conduct an 
inspection of the components of the combustion system of

[[Page 353]]

each kiln or in-line kiln raw mill at least once per year.
    (j) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to a 
limitation on opacity under Sec. 63.1346 or Sec. 63.1348 shall monitor 
opacity in accordance with the operation and maintenance plan developed 
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (k) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to a 
particulate matter standard under Sec. 63.1343 shall install, calibrate, 
maintain, and operate a particulate matter continuous emission 
monitoring system (PM CEMS) to measure the particulate matter discharged 
to the atmosphere. All requirements relating to installation, 
calibration, maintenance, operation or performance of the PM CEMS and 
implementation of the PM CEMS requirement are deferred pending further 
rulemaking.
    (l) An owner or operator may submit an application to the 
Administrator for approval of alternate monitoring requirements to 
demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this subpart, 
except for emission standards for THC, subject to the provisions of 
paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(6) of this section.
    (1) The Administrator will not approve averaging periods other than 
those specified in this section, unless the owner or operator documents, 
using data or information, that the longer averaging period will ensure 
that emissions do not exceed levels achieved during the performance test 
over any increment of time equivalent to the time required to conduct 
three runs of the performance test.
    (2) If the application to use an alternate monitoring requirement is 
approved, the owner or operator must continue to use the original 
monitoring requirement until approval is received to use another 
monitoring requirement.
    (3) The owner or operator shall submit the application for approval 
of alternate monitoring requirements no later than the notification of 
performance test. The application must contain the information specified 
in paragraphs (l)(3)(i) through (l)(3)(iii) of this section:
    (i) Data or information justifying the request, such as the 
technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality of using the 
required approach;
    (ii) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring 
requirement, including the operating parameter to be monitored, the 
monitoring approach and technique, the averaging period for the limit, 
and how the limit is to be calculated; and
    (iii) Data or information documenting that the alternative 
monitoring requirement would provide equivalent or better assurance of 
compliance with the relevant emission standard.
    (4) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of the 
approval or denial of the application within 90 calendar days after 
receipt of the original request, or within 60 calendar days of the 
receipt of any supplementary information, whichever is later. The 
Administrator will not approve an alternate monitoring application 
unless it would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance 
with the relevant emission standard. Before disapproving any alternate 
monitoring application, the Administrator will provide:
    (i) Notice of the information and findings upon which the intended 
disapproval is based; and
    (ii) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present 
additional supporting information before final action is taken on the 
application. This notice will specify how much additional time is 
allowed for the owner or operator to provide additional supporting 
information.
    (5) The owner or operator is responsible for submitting any 
supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to 
consider the application prior to the performance test. Neither 
submittal of an application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve 
or disapprove the application relieves the owner or operator of the 
responsibility to comply with any provision of this subpart.
    (6) The Administrator may decide at any time, on a case-by-case 
basis that additional or alternative operating

[[Page 354]]

limits, or alternative approaches to establishing operating limits, are 
necessary to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this 
subpart.

 Subpart MMM--National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
               for Pesticide Active Ingredient Production

    Source: 64 FR 33589, June 23, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1360  Applicability.

    (a) Definition of affected source. The affected source subject to 
this subpart is the facility-wide collection of pesticide active 
ingredient manufacturing process units (PAI process units) that process, 
use, or produce HAP, and are located at a plant site that is a major 
source, as defined in section 112(a) of the CAA. An affected source also 
includes waste management units, heat exchange systems, and cooling 
towers that are associated with the PAI process units. Exemptions from 
an affected source are specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) New source applicability. A new affected source subject to this 
subpart and to which the requirements for new sources apply is defined 
according to the criteria in either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this 
section.
    (1) An affected source for which construction or reconstruction 
commenced after November 10, 1997.
    (2) Any single PAI process unit that:
    (i) Is not part of a process unit group; and
    (ii) For which construction, as defined in Sec. 63.1361, commenced 
after November 10, 1997; and
    (iii) Has the potential to emit 10 tons/yr of any one HAP or 25 
tons/yr of combined HAP.
    (c) General provisions. Table 1 of this subpart specifies the 
provisions of subpart A of this part that apply to an owner or operator 
of an affected source subject to this subpart, and clarifies specific 
provisions in subpart A of this part as necessary for this subpart.
    (d) Exemptions from the requirements of this subpart. The provisions 
of this subpart do not apply to:
    (1) Research and development facilities;
    (2) PAI process units that are subject to subpart F of this part;
    (3) Production of ethylene; and
    (4) The following emission points listed:
    (i) Storm water from segregated sewers;
    (ii) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems, including testing 
of such systems;
    (iii) Spills;
    (iv) Water from safety showers;
    (v) Noncontact steam boiler blowdown and condensate;
    (vi) Laundry water;
    (vii) Vessels storing material that contains no organic HAP or 
contains organic HAP as impurities only; and
    (viii) Equipment, as defined in Sec. 63.1363, that is intended to 
operate in

[[Page 361]]

organic HAP service for less than 300 hours during the calendar year.
    (e) Applicability of this subpart except during periods of startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction. (1) Each provision set forth in this subpart 
shall apply at all times except that emission limitations shall not 
apply during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as defined 
in Sec. 63.1361, if:
    (i) The startup, shutdown, or malfunction precludes the ability of 
the owner or operator of an affected source to comply with one or more 
specific emission limitations to which a particular emission point is 
subject; and
    (ii) The owner or operator follows the provisions for periods of 
startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as specified in Secs. 63.1367(a)(3) 
and 63.1368(i).
    (2) The provisions set forth in Sec. 63.1363 shall apply at all 
times except during periods of nonoperation of the PAI process unit (or 
specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and 
depressurized resulting in the cessation of the emissions to which 
Sec. 63.1363 applies.
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with the emissions 
limitations of this subpart during times when emissions (or, where 
applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such 
items of equipment, if the shutdown would contravene emissions 
limitations of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment. This 
paragraph does not apply if the item of equipment is malfunctioning, or 
if the owner or operator must shut down the equipment to avoid damage 
due to a malfunction of the PAI process unit or portion thereof.
    (4) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emissions 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1) 
through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to 
the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions. For purposes of this paragraph, ``excess emissions'' means 
emissions in excess of those that would have occurred if there were no 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction and the owner or operator complied 
with the relevant provisions of this subpart. The measures to be taken 
shall be identified in the applicable startup, shutdown, and malfunction 
plan, and may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control 
technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or 
changes in the manner of operation of the source. Back-up control 
devices are not required, but may be used if available.
    (f) Storage vessel applicability determination. An owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) 
of this section to determine whether a storage vessel is part of the 
affected source to which this subpart applies.
    (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 40 
CFR part 63 on June 23, 1999, the storage vessel shall belong to the 
process unit subject to the other subpart.
    (2) Unless otherwise excluded under paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section, the storage vessel is part of a PAI process unit if either the 
input to the vessel from the PAI process unit is greater than or equal 
to the input from any other PAI or non-PAI process unit, or the output 
from the vessel to the PAI process unit is greater than or equal to the 
output to any other PAI or non-PAI process unit. If the greatest input 
to and/or output from a shared storage vessel is the same for two or 
more process units, including at least one PAI process unit, the owner 
or operator may assign the storage vessel to any one of the PAI process 
units that meet this condition. If the use varies from year to year, 
then the use for purposes of this subpart for existing sources shall be 
based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding June 
23, 1999 or, if the storage vessel was not in operation during that 
year, the use shall be based on the expected use in the 5 years after 
startup. This determination shall be reported as part of an operating 
permit application or as otherwise specified by the permitting 
authority.
    (3) Unless otherwise excluded under paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section, where a storage vessel is located in a tank farm (including a 
marine tank farm), the applicability of this subpart shall be determined 
according to the provisions in

[[Page 362]]

paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that 
utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage 
vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate). With respect 
to a process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage vessel 
connected by hard-piping to the process unit and to the storage vessel 
in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering or leaving the 
process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage vessel and 
does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in the tank 
farm.
    (ii) If no PAI process unit meets the criteria of paragraph 
(f)(3)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, this subpart 
does not apply to the storage vessel.
    (iii) If only one PAI process unit, and no non-PAI process unit, 
meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section with respect 
to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that PAI 
process unit.
    (iv) If two or more process units, including at least one PAI 
process unit, meet the criteria of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section 
with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned 
to one of those process units according to the provisions of paragraph 
(f)(2) of this section. The input and output shall be determined among 
only those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (f)(3)(i) 
of this section. If the storage vessel is not assigned to a PAI process 
unit according to the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, 
this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel.
    (4) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) another process unit, or ceasing to receive material from 
(or send material to) a PAI process unit, or if the applicability of 
this subpart has been determined according to the provisions of 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, and there is a significant change in 
the use of the storage vessel, the owner or operator shall reevaluate 
the ownership determination for the storage vessel.
    (g) Designating production of an intermediate as a PAI process unit. 
Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, an owner or 
operator may elect to designate production of any intermediate that does 
not meet the definition of integral intermediate as a PAI process unit 
subject to this subpart. Any storage vessel containing the intermediate 
is assigned to a PAI process unit according to the procedures in 
paragraph (f) of this section. Any process tank containing the 
intermediate is part of the process unit used to produce the 
intermediate.
    (h) Applicability of process units included in a process unit group. 
(1) If any of the products produced in the process unit group are 
subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG (Pharmaceuticals MACT), the owner 
or operator may elect to comply with the requirements of subpart GGG for 
the PAI process unit(s) within the process unit group, except for the 
following:
    (i) The emission limit standard for process vents in 
Sec. 63.1362(b)(2)(i) shall apply in place of Sec. 63.1254(a)(1) of 
subpart GGG of this part;
    (ii) When the date of April 2, 1997 is provided in 
Sec. 63.1254(a)(iii) of subpart GGG of this part, the date of June 23, 
1999 shall apply for purposes of this subpart; and
    (iii) Requirements in Sec. 63.1367(a)(5) regarding application for 
approval of construction or reconstruction shall apply in place of the 
provisions in Sec. 63.1259(a)(5) of subpart GGG of this part.
    (2) If the primary product of a process unit group is determined to 
be a material that is subject to another subpart of 40 CFR part 63 on 
June 23, 1999 or startup of the process unit group, whichever is later, 
the owner or operator may elect to comply with the other subpart for any 
PAI process unit within the process unit group.
    (3) The primary product of the process unit group shall be 
determined according to paragraphs (h)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) The primary product is the product that is produced for the 
greatest operating time over a 5 year period, based on expected 
utilization for the 5 years following the compliance date or following 
initial startup of the process unit group, whichever is later; or

[[Page 363]]

    (ii) If the process unit group produces multiple products equally 
based on operating time, then the product with the greatest production 
on a mass basis over 5 years shall represent the primary product of the 
process unit, based on expected utilization for the 5 years following 
the compliance date or following initial startup of the unit or unit 
group, whichever is later.
    (i) Overlap with other regulations. (1) Overlap with other MACT 
standards. After the compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.1364, an 
affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart that is also 
subject to the provisions of any other subpart of 40 CFR part 63 may 
elect, to the extent the subparts are consistent, under which subpart to 
maintain records and report to EPA. The affected source shall identify 
in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by 
Sec. 63.1368(f) under which authority such records will be maintained.
    (2) Overlap with RCRA subparts AA, BB, and/or CC. After the 
compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.1364, if any affected source 
subject to this subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, 
and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 264, subpart AA, BB, or CC, or 
is subject to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 
265, subpart AA, BB, or CC, and the owner or operator complies with the 
periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 264, subpart AA, BB, 
or CC that would apply to the device if the facility had final-permitted 
status, the owner or operator may elect to comply either with the 
monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this subpart, 
or with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 
CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in this paragraph, which shall 
constitute compliance with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements of this subpart. If the owner or operator elects to comply 
with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR 
parts 264 and/or 265, the owner or operator shall report all excursions 
as required by Sec. 63.1368(g). The owner or operator shall identify in 
the Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec. 63.1368(f) 
the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting authority under which the 
owner or operator will comply.
    (3) Overlap with NSPS subpart Kb. After the compliance dates 
specified in Sec. 63.1364, a Group 1 or Group 2 storage vessel that is 
also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, is 
required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart MMM.
    (4) Overlap with subpart I. After the compliance dates specified in 
Sec. 63.1364, for all equipment within a process unit that contains 
equipment subject to subpart I of this part, an owner or operator may 
elect to comply with either the provisions of this subpart MMM or the 
provisions of subpart H of this part. The owner or operator shall 
identify in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by 
Sec. 63.1368(f) the provisions with which the owner or operator elects 
to comply.
    (5) Overlap with RCRA regulations for wastewater. After the 
compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.1364, the owner or operator of an 
affected wastewater stream that is also subject to provisions in 40 CFR 
parts 260 through 272 shall comply with the more stringent control 
requirements (e.g., waste management units, numerical treatment 
standards, etc.) and the more stringent testing, monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements that overlap between the 
provisions of this subpart and the provisions of 40 CFR parts 260 
through 272. The owner or operator shall keep a record of the 
information used to determine which requirements were the most stringent 
and shall submit this information if requested by the Administrator.
    (6) Overlap with NSPS subparts III, NNN, and RRR. After the 
compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.1364, if an owner or operator of a 
process vent subject to this subpart MMM that is also subject to the 
provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart III, or subpart NNN, or subpart 
RRR, elects to reduce organic HAP emissions from the process vent by 98 
percent as specified in Sec. 63.1362(b)(2)(iii)(A), then the owner or 
operator is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart 
MMM. Otherwise, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions

[[Page 364]]

in both this subpart MMM and the provisions in 40 CFR part 60, subparts 
III, NNN, and RRR, as applicable.
    (j) Meaning of periods of time. All terms in this subpart MMM that 
define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, 
monthly, quarterly, annual), unless specified otherwise in the section 
or subsection that imposes the requirement, refer to the standard 
calendar periods.
    (1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in the subpart MMM for 
completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner and operator and the Administrator, as 
specified in subpart A of this part (e.g., a period could begin on the 
compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the 
standard period). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the 
revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request 
is not necessary for each recurring period.
    (2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar 
period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the 
period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified 
in paragraph (j)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.
    (i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard 
calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there 
remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 
2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for 
tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for 
tasks that must be performed annually; or
    (ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end 
of the first full standard calendar period within which the initial 
compliance deadline occurs.
    (3) In all instances where a provision of this subpart MMM requires 
completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an 
owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the 
specified period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable 
interval after completion of the task in the previous period.

Sec. 63.1361  Definitions.

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in subpart A of 
this part, or in this section. If the same term is defined in subpart A 
of this part and in this section, it shall have the meaning given in 
this section for the purposes of this subpart MMM.
    Air pollution control device or control device means equipment 
installed on a process vent, storage vessel, wastewater treatment 
exhaust stack, or combination thereof that reduces the mass of HAP 
emitted to the air. The equipment may consist of an individual device or 
a series of devices. Examples include incinerators, carbon adsorption 
units, condensers, flares, boilers, process heaters, and gas absorbers. 
Process condensers are not considered air pollution control devices or 
control devices.
    Bag dump means equipment into which bags or other containers 
containing a powdered, granular, or other solid feedstock material are 
emptied. A bag dump is part of the process.
    Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode that is 
associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more 
than one batch emission episode. For example, a batch distillation unit 
operation may consist of batch emission episodes associated with 
charging and heating. Charging the vessel with HAP will result in one 
discrete batch emission episode that will last through the duration of 
the charge and will have an average flowrate equal to the rate of the 
charge. Another discrete batch emission episode will result from the 
expulsion of expanded vapor as the contents of the vessel are heated.
    Batch operation means a noncontinuous operation involving 
intermittent or discontinuous feed into PAI or integral intermediate 
manufacturing equipment, and, in general, involves the emptying of the 
equipment after the batch operation ceases and prior to beginning a new 
operation. Addition of raw material and withdrawal of product do not 
occur simultaneously in a batch operation. A batch process consists of a 
series of batch operations.
    Bench-scale batch process means a batch process (other than a 
research

[[Page 365]]

and development facility) that is capable of being located on a

single batch.
    Car seal means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to 
change the position of a valve (e.g., from opened to closed) in such a 
way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking 
the seal.
    Cleaning operation means routine rinsing, washing, or boil-off of 
equipment in batch operations between batches.
    Closed-loop system means an enclosed system that returns process 
fluid to the process and is not vented to the atmosphere except through 
a closed-vent system.

flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler, used for the combustion 
of organic HAP vapors.
    Connector means flanged, screwed, or other joined fittings used to 
connect two pipe lines or a pipe line and a piece of equipment. A common 
connector is a flange. Joined fittings welded completely around the 
circumference of the interface are not considered connectors for the 
purpose of this regulation. For the purpose of reporting and record 
keeping, connector means joined fittings that are not inaccessible, 
ceramic, or ceramic-lined as described in Sec. 63.1255(b)(1)(vii) and 
63.1255(f)(3).
    Construction means the onsite fabrication, erection, or installation 
of an affected source or PAI process unit. Addition of new equipment to 
an existing PAI process unit does not constitute construction.
    Consumption means the makeup quantity of HAP entering a process that 
is not used as reactant. The quantity of material used as reactant is 
the theoretical amount needed assuming a 100 percent stoichiometric 
conversion. Makeup is the net amount of material that must be added to 
the process to replenish losses.
    Container, as used in the wastewater provisions, means any portable 
waste management unit that has a capacity greater than or equal to 0.1 
m<SUP>3</SUP> in which a material is stored, transported, treated, or 
otherwise handled. Examples of containers are drums, barrels, tank 
trucks, barges, dumpsters, tank cars, dump trucks, and ships.
    Continuous process means a process where the inputs and outputs flow 
continuously throughout the duration of the process. Continuous 
processes typically approach steady state.
    Continuous seal means a seal that forms a continuous closure that 
completely covers the space between the wall of the storage vessel and 
the edge of the floating roof. A continuous seal may be a vapor-mounted, 
liquid-mounted, or metallic shoe seal.
    Controlled HAP emissions means the quantity of HAP components 
discharged to the atmosphere from an air pollution control device.
    Cover, as used in the wastewater provisions, means a device or 
system which is placed on or over a waste management unit containing 
wastewater or residuals so that the entire surface area is enclosed to 
minimize air emissions. A cover may have openings necessary for 
operation, inspection, and maintenance of the waste management unit such 
as access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells provided that each 
opening is closed when not in use. Examples of covers include a fixed 
roof installed on a wastewater tank, a lid installed on a container, and 
an air-supported enclosure installed over a waste management unit.

stopping or reducing leakage of organic material to the atmosphere.
    Fixed roof means a cover that is mounted on a waste management unit 
or storage tank in a stationary manner and that does not move with 
fluctuations in liquid level.

change in conductivity of a standard flame (usually hydrogen) due to the 
insertion of another gas or vapor is used to detect the gas or vapor.
    Floating roof means a cover consisting of a double deck, pontoon 
single deck, internal floating cover or covered floating roof, which 
rests upon and is supported by the liquid being contained, and is 
equipped with a continuous seal or seals to close the space between the 
roof edge and waste management unit or storage vessel wall.
    Flow indicator means a device that indicates whether gas flow is, or 
whether the valve position would allow gas flow to be, present in a 
line.
    Group 1 process vent means any process vent from a process at an 
existing or new affected source for which the uncontrolled organic HAP 
emissions from the sum of all process vents are greater than or equal to

capacity equal to or greater than 40 m<SUP>3</SUP> and storing material 
with a maximum true vapor pressure greater than or equal to 16.5 kPa and 
with a capacity greater than or equal to 75 m<SUP>3</SUP> and storing 
material with a maximum true vapor pressure greater than or equal to 
3.45 kPa.
    Group 2 storage vessel means a storage vessel that does not meet the 
definition of a Group 1 storage vessel.
    Group 1 wastewater stream means process wastewater at an existing or 
new source that meets the criteria for Group 1 status in Sec. 63.132(c) 
of subpart G of this part for compounds in Table 9 of subpart G of this 
part or a maintenance wastewater stream that contains 5.3 Mg of HAP per 
discharge event.
    Group 2 wastewater stream means any wastewater stream that does not 
meet the definition of a Group 1 wastewater stream.
    Group of processes means all of the equipment associated with 
processes in a building, processing area, or facility-wide. A group of 
processes may consist of a single process.
    Halogenated compounds means organic compounds that contain chlorine 
atoms.
    Halogenated vent stream means a process, storage vessel, or waste 
management unit vent stream determined to have a concentration of 
halogenated compounds of greater than 20 ppmv, as determined through 
process knowledge, test results using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, or test results

[[Page 367]]

using any other test method that has been validated according to the 
procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part.
    Hard-piping means piping or tubing that is manufactured and properly 
installed using good engineering judgment and standards, such as ANSI 
B31-3.
    Impurity means a substance that is produced coincidentally with the 
product(s), or is present in a raw material. An impurity does not serve 
a useful purpose in the production or use of the product(s) and is not 
isolated.
    In gas/vapor service means that a piece of equipment in organic HAP 
service contains a gas or vapor at operating conditions.
    In heavy liquid service means that a piece of equipment in organic 
HAP service is not in gas/vapor service or in light liquid service.
    In light liquid service means that a piece of equipment in organic 
HAP service contains a liquid that meets the following conditions:
    (1) The vapor pressure of one or more of the organic compounds is 
greater than 0.3 kPa at 20 deg. C;
    (2) The total concentration of the pure organic compounds 
constituents having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kPa at 20 deg. C 
is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight of the total process 
stream; and
    (3) The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.

    Note: To definition of ``In light liquid service: Vapor pressures 
may be determined by the methods described in 40 CFR 60.485(e)(1).

    In liquid service means that a piece of equipment in organic HAP 
service is not in gas/vapor service.
    In organic hazardous air pollutant or in organic HAP service means 
that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or 
gas) that is at least 5 percent by weight of total organic HAP as 
determined according to the provisions of Sec. 63.180(d) of subpart H of 
this part. The provisions of Sec. 63.180(d) of subpart H of this part 
also specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in 
organic HAP service.
    In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal 
pressure which is at least 5 kPa below ambient pressure.
    In-situ sampling systems means nonextractive samplers or in-line 
samplers.
    Individual drain system means the stationary system used to convey 
wastewater streams or residuals to a waste management unit or to 
discharge or disposal. The term includes: hard piping; all process 
drains and junction boxes; and associated sewer lines, other junction 
boxes, manholes, sumps, and lift stations conveying wastewater streams 
or residuals. A segregated stormwater sewer system, which is a drain and 
collection system designed and operated for the sole purpose of 
collecting rainfall-runoff at a facility, and which is segregated from 
all other individual drain systems, is excluded from this definition.
    Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to 
condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and 
instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions 
(e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the 
predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, 
other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only 
valves nominally 0.5 inches and smaller and connectors nominally 0.75 
inches and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems 
for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 0.5 
inches and connectors greater than nominally 0.75 inches associated with 
instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation 
systems and must be monitored individually.
    Integral intermediate means an intermediate for which 50 percent or 
more of the annual production is used in on-site production of any 
PAI(s) and that is not stored before being used in the production of 
another integral intermediate or the PAI(s). For the purposes of this 
definition, an intermediate is stored if it is discharged to a storage 
vessel and at least one of the following conditions is met: the 
processing equipment that discharges to the storage vessel is shutdown 
before the processing equipment that withdraws from the storage vessel 
is started up; during an annual period, the material must be

[[Page 368]]

stored in the vessel for at least 30 days before being used to make a 
PAI; or the processing equipment that discharges to the storage vessel 
is located in a separate building (or processing area) of the plant than 
the processing equipment that uses material from the storage vessel as a 
feedstock, and control equipment is not shared by the two processing 
areas. Any process unit that produces an intermediate and is subject to 
subpart F of this part is not an integral intermediate.
    Intermediate means an organic compound that is produced by chemical 
reaction and that is further processed or modified in one or more 
additional chemical reaction steps to produce another intermediate or a 
PAI.
    Internal floating roof means a cover that rests or floats on the 
liquid surface (but not necessarily in complete contact with it) inside 
a storage tank or waste management unit that has a permanently affixed 
roof.
    Junction box means a manhole or access point to a wastewater sewer 
system line or a lift station.
    Large control device means a control device that controls process 
vents, and the total HAP emissions into the control device from all 
sources are greater than or equal to 10 tons/yr.
    Liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in 
contact with the liquid between the wall of the storage vessel or waste 
management unit and the floating roof. The seal is mounted continuously 
around the tank or unit.
    Liquids dripping means any visible leakage from the seal including 
dripping, spraying, misting, clouding, and ice formation. Indications of 
liquid dripping include puddling or new stains that are indicative of an 
existing evaporated drip.
    Maintenance wastewater means wastewater generated by the draining of 
process fluid from components in the PAI process unit into an individual 
drain system prior to or during maintenance activities. Maintenance 
wastewater can be generated through planned or unplanned shutdowns and 
during periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities 
that can generate maintenance wastewaters include descaling of heat 
exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, 
draining of low legs and high point bleeds, draining of pumps into an 
individual drain system, and draining of portions of the PAI process 
unit for repair.
    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, emissions 
monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a 
normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused all or in part by poor 
maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
    Maximum true vapor pressure means the equilibrium partial pressure 
exerted by the total organic HAP in the stored or transferred liquid at 
the temperature equal to the highest calendar-month average of the 
liquid storage or transferred temperature for liquids stored or 
transferred above or below the ambient temperature or at the local 
maximum monthly average temperature as reported by the National Weather 
Service for liquids stored or transferred at the ambient temperature, as 
determined:
    (1) In accordance with methods described in Chapter 19.2 of the 
American Petroleum Institute's Manual of Petroleum Measurement 
Standards, Evaporative Loss From Floating-Roof Tanks (incorporated by 
reference as specified in Sec. 63.14 in subpart A of this part); or
    (2) As obtained from standard reference texts; or
    (3) As determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials 
Method D2879-97, Test Method for Vapor Pressure-Temperature Relationship 
and Initial Decomposition Temperature of Liquids by Isoteniscope 
(incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 63.14 of subpart A of 
this part); or
    (4) Any other method approved by the Administrator.
    Metallic shoe seal or mechanical shoe seal means metal sheets that 
are held vertically against the wall of the storage tank by springs, 
weighted levers, or other mechanisms and connected to the floating roof 
by braces or other means. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the 
annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof.
    Nonrepairable means that it is technically infeasible to repair a 
piece of

[[Page 369]]

equipment from which a leak has been detected without a process 
shutdown.
    Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except pressure relief 
valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid 
and one side open to atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.
    Operating scenario, for the purposes of reporting and recordkeeping, 
means a description of a PAI process unit, including: identification of 
each wastewater point of determination (POD) and process vent, their 
associated emissions episodes and durations, and their associated level 
of control and control devices, as applicable; calculations and 
engineering analyses required to demonstrate compliance; and a 
description of operating and/or testing conditions for any associated 
control device.
    Organic compound, as used in the definitions of intermediate and 
PAI, means any compound that contains both carbon and hydrogen with or 
without other elements.
    Organic HAP means those HAP listed in section 112(b) of the CAA that 
are measured according to the procedures of Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A.
    Pesticide active ingredient or PAI means any material that is an 
active ingredient within the meaning of FIFRA section 2(a); that is used 
to produce an insecticide, herbicide, or fungicide end use pesticide 
product; that consists of one or more organic compounds; and that must 
be labeled in accordance with 40 CFR part 156 for transfer, sale, or 
distribution. These materials are typically described by North American 
Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Codes 325199 and 32532 (i.e., 
previously known as Standard Industrial Classification System Codes 2869 
and 2879). These materials are identified by product classification 
codes 01, 21, 02, 04, 44, 07, 08, and 16 in block 19 on EPA form 3540-
16, the Pesticides Report for Pesticide-Producing Establishments.
    Pesticide active ingredient manufacturing process unit (PAI process 
unit) means a process unit that is used to produce a material that is 
primarily used as a PAI or integral intermediate. A PAI process unit 
consists of: the process, as defined in this subpart; associated storage 
vessels, as determined by the procedures in Sec. 63.1360(f); equipment 
identified in Sec. 63.1362(l); connected piping and ducts; and 
components such as pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief 
devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, 
valves, connectors, and instrumentation systems. A material is primarily 
used as a PAI or integral intermediate if more than 50 percent of the 
projected annual production from a process unit in the 3 years after 
June 23, 1999 or startup, whichever is later, is used as a PAI or 
integral intermediate; recordkeeping is required if the material is used 
as a PAI or integral intermediate, but not as the primary use. If the 
primary use changes to a PAI or integral intermediate, the process unit 
becomes a PAI process unit unless it is already subject to the HON. If 
the primary use changes from a PAI or integral intermediate to another 
use, the process unit remains a PAI process unit. Any process tank 
containing an integral intermediate is part of the PAI process unit used 
to produce the integral intermediate. A process unit that produces an 
intermediate that is not an integral intermediate may be designated as a 
PAI process unit according to the procedures of Sec. 63.1360(g). 
Formulation of pesticide products is not considered part of a PAI 
process unit. Quality assurance and quality control laboratories are not 
considered part of a PAI process unit.
    Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common control, including properties that are separated only by a road 
or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that 
are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, 
subsidiary, or any combination thereof.
    Point of determination (POD) means each point where a wastewater 
stream exits the PAI process unit.

    Note to definition of ``point of determination'': The regulation 
allows determination of the characteristics of a wastewater stream: at 
the point of determination; or downstream of the point of determination 
if corrections are made for changes in flow rate and

[[Page 370]]

annual average concentration of Table 9 compounds as determined in 
Sec. 63.144 of subpart G of this part. Such changes include: losses by 
air emissions, reduction of annual average concentration or changes in 
flow rate by mixing with other water or wastewater streams, and 
reduction in flow rate or annual average concentration by treating or 
otherwise handling the wastewater stream to remove or destroy HAP.

    Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the 
system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure 
relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases 
over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
    Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to 
prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working 
pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a 
spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by 
a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or 
by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
    Process means a logical grouping of processing equipment which 
collectively function to produce a product. For the purpose of this 
subpart, a PAI process includes all, or a combination of, reaction, 
recovery, separation, purification, treatment, cleaning, and other 
activities or unit operations, which are used to produce a PAI or 
integral intermediate. A PAI process and all integral intermediate 
processes for which 100 percent of the annual production is used in the 
production of the PAI may be linked together and defined as a single PAI 
process unit.
    Process condenser means a condenser whose primary purpose is to 
recover material as an integral part of a unit operation. The condenser 
must cause a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods during which the 
temperature of liquid in the process equipment is at or above its 
boiling or bubble point. Examples of process condensers include 
distillation condensers, reflux condensers, and condensers used in 
stripping or flashing operation. In a series of condensers, all 
condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas 
temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the liquid in the 
process equipment are considered to be process condensers. All 
condensers in line prior to the vacuum source are included in this 
definition.
    Process shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that 
stops production from a process or part of a process during which it is 
technically feasible to clear process material from a process or part of 
a process consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs 
can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure 
that stops production from a process or part of a process for less than 
24 hours is not a process shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or 
operational procedure that would stop production from a process or part 
of a process for a shorter period of time than would be required to 
clear the process or part of the process of materials and start up the 
process, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of 
leaking components until the next scheduled process shutdown, is not a 
process shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible 
bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process 
shutdowns.
    Process tank means a tank that is used to collect material 
discharged from a feedstock storage vessel or equipment within the 
process and transfer of this material to other equipment within the 
process or a product storage vessel. Processing steps occur both 
upstream and downstream of the tank within a given process unit. Surge 
control vessels and bottoms receivers that fit these conditions are 
considered process tanks.
    Process unit means the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or 
ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product.
    Process unit group means a group of process units that manufacture 
PAI's and products other than PAI's by alternating raw materials or 
operating conditions, or by reconfiguring process equipment. Only 
process equipment that has been or could be part of a PAI process unit, 
because of its function or capacity, is included in a process unit 
group.

[[Page 371]]

    Process vent means a point of emission from processing equipment to 
the atmosphere or a control device. The vent may be the release point 
for an emission stream associated with an individual unit operation, or 
it may be the release point for emission streams from multiple unit 
operations that have been manifolded together into a common header. 
Examples of process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on 
condensers used for product recovery, bottom receivers, surge control 
vessels, reactors, filters, centrifuges, process tanks, and product 
dryers. A vent is not considered to be a process vent for a given 
emission episode if the undiluted and uncontrolled emission stream that 
is released through the vent contains less than 20 ppmv HAP, as 
determined through process knowledge that no HAP are present in the 
emission stream; using an engineering assessment as discussed in 
Sec. 63.1365(b)(2)(ii); from test data collected using Method 1818 of 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A; or from test data collected using any other 
test method that has been validated according to the procedures in 
Method 301 of appendix A of this part. Process vents do not include 
vents on storage vessels regulated under Sec. 63.1362(c), vents on 
wastewater emission sources regulated under Sec. 63.1362(d), or pieces 
of equipment regulated under Sec. 63.1363.
    Process wastewater means wastewater which, during manufacturing or 
processing, comes into direct contact with, or results from, the 
production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished 
product, by-product, or waste product. Examples include: product tank 
drawdown or feed tank drawdown; water formed during a chemical reaction 
or used as a reactant; water used to wash impurities from organic 
products or reactants; water used to clean process equipment; water used 
to cool or quench organic vapor streams through direct contact; and 
condensed steam from jet ejector systems pulling vacuum on vessels 
containing organics.
    Product means the compound(s) or chemical(s) that are produced or 
manufactured as the intended output of a process unit. Impurities and 
wastes are not considered products.
    Product dryer means equipment that is used to remove moisture or 
other liquid from granular, powdered, or other solid PAI or integral 
intermediate products prior to storage, formulation, shipment, or other 
uses. The product dryer is part of the process.
    Product dryer vent means a process vent from a product dryer through 
which a gas stream containing gaseous pollutants (i.e., organic HAP, 
HCl, or chlorine), particulate matter, or both are released to the 
atmosphere or are routed to a control device.
    Production-indexed HAP consumption factor (HAP factor) is the result 
of dividing the annual consumption of total HAP by the annual production 
rate, per process.
    Production-indexed VOC consumption factor (VOC factor) is the result 
of dividing the annual consumption of total VOC by the annual production 
rate, per process.

reactants, other than air, are combined or decomposed in such a way that 
their molecular structures are altered and one or more new organic 
compounds are formed.
    Recovery device, as used in the wastewater provisions, means an 
individual unit of equipment capable of, and normally used for the 
purpose of, recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive 
heating value), use, reuse, or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse. 
Examples of equipment that may be recovery devices include organic 
removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation 
units. To be a recovery device, a decanter and any other equipment based 
on the operating principle of gravity separation must receive only two-
phase liquid streams.
    Repaired means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to 
eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable paragraphs of 
Sec. 63.1363.
    Research and development facility means any stationary source whose 
primary purpose is to conduct research and development, where the 
operations

[[Page 372]]

are under the close supervision of technically trained personnel, and is 
not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale, except 
in a de minimis manner.
    Residual means any liquid or solid material containing Table 9 
compounds (as defined in Sec. 63.111 of subpart G of this part) that is 
removed from a wastewater stream by a waste management unit or treatment 
process that does not destroy organics (nondestructive unit). Examples 
of residuals from nondestructive wastewater management units include the 
organic layer and bottom residue removed by a decanter or organic-water 
separator and the overheads from a steam stripper or air stripper. 
Examples of materials which are not residuals include: silt; mud; 
leaves; bottoms from a steam stripper or air stripper; and sludges, ash, 
or other materials removed from wastewater being treated by destructive 
devices such as biological treatment units and incinerators.
    Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief 
valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which 
functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent 
deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting 
gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions 
resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the 
purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine 
venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover 
such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this 
vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature 
fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position 
during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or 
another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting 
applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the 
owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable 
regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering 
codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of 
flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
    Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a 
process unit used during periods of representative operation to take 
samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab 
samples is not considered a sampling connection system.

conduit including, but not limited to, grates, trenches, etc., used to 
convey wastewater streams or residuals to a downstream waste management 
unit.
    Shutdown means the cessation of operation of a continuous PAI 
process unit for any purpose. Shutdown also means the cessation of a 
batch PAI process unit or any related individual piece of equipment 
required or used to comply with this part or for emptying and degassing 
storage vessels for periodic maintenance, replacement of equipment, 
repair, or any other purpose not excluded from this definition. Shutdown 
does not apply to cessation of a batch PAI process unit at the end of a 
campaign or between batches (e.g., for rinsing or washing equipment), 
for routine maintenance, or for other routine operations.
    Small control device means a control device that controls process 
vents, and the total HAP emissions into the control device from all 
sources are less than 10 tons of HAP per year.
    Startup means the setting in operation of a continuous PAI process 
unit for any purpose, the first time a new or reconstructed batch PAI 
process unit begins production, or, for new equipment added, including 
equipment used to comply with this subpart, the first time the equipment 
is put into operation. For batch process units, startup does not apply 
to the first time the equipment is put into operation at the start of a 
campaign to produce a product that has been produced in the past,

[[Page 373]]

after a shutdown for maintenance, or when the equipment is put into 
operation as part of a batch within a campaign. As used in Sec. 63.1363, 
startup means the setting in operation of a piece of equipment or a 
control device that is subject to this subpart.
    Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
organic liquids that contain one or more HAP and that has been assigned, 
according to the procedures in Sec. 63.1360(f) or (g), to a PAI process 
unit that is subject to this subpart MMM. The following are not 
considered storage vessels for the purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 
kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
    (3) Vessels storing material that contains no organic HAP or 
contains organic HAP only as impurities;
    (4) Wastewater storage tanks;
    (5) Process tanks; and
    (6) Nonwastewater waste tanks.
    Supplemental gases means any nonaffected gaseous streams (streams 
that are not from process vents, storage vessels, equipment or waste 
management units) that contain less than 20 ppmv TOC and less than 20 
ppmv total HCl and chlorine, as determined through process knowledge, 
and are combined with an affected vent stream. Supplemental gases are 
often used to maintain pressures in manifolds or for fire and explosion 
protection and prevention. Air required to operate combustion device 
burner(s) is not considered a supplemental gas.
    Surface impoundment means a waste management unit which is a natural 
topographic depression, manmade excavation, or diked area formed 
primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with manmade 
materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquid wastes 
or waste containing free liquids. A surface impoundment is used for the 
purpose of treating, storing, or disposing of wastewater or residuals, 
and is not an injection well. Examples of surface impoundments are 
equalization, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures of Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    Treatment process means a specific technique that removes or 
destroys the organics in a wastewater or residual stream such as a steam 
stripping unit, thin-film evaporation unit, waste incinerator, 
biological treatment unit, or any other process applied to wastewater 
streams or residuals to comply with Sec. 63.138 of subpart G of this 
part. Most treatment processes are conducted in tanks. Treatment 
processes are a subset of waste management units.
    Uncontrolled HAP emissions means a gas stream containing HAP which 
has exited the process (or process condenser, if any), but which has not 
yet been introduced into an air pollution control device to reduce the 
mass of HAP in the stream. If the process vent is not routed to an air 
pollution control device, uncontrolled emissions are those HAP emissions 
released to the atmosphere.
    Unit operation means those processing steps that occur within 
distinct equipment that are used, among other things, to prepare 
reactants, facilitate reactions, separate and purify products, and 
recycle materials. Equipment used for these purposes includes, but is 
not limited to, reactors, distillation units, extraction columns, 
absorbers, decanters, dryers, condensers, and filtration equipment.
    Vapor-mounted seal means a continuous seal that completely covers 
the annular space between the wall of the storage tank or waste 
management unit and the edge of the floating roof, and is mounted such 
that there is a vapor space between the stored liquid and the bottom of 
the seal.
    Volatile organic compounds are defined in 40 CFR 51.100.
    Waste management unit means the equipment, structure(s), and/or 
device(s) used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of wastewater streams 
or residuals. Examples of waste management units include wastewater 
tanks, surface impoundments, individual drain systems, and biological 
wastewater treatment units. Examples of

[[Page 374]]

equipment that may be waste management units include containers, air 
flotation units, oil-water separators or organic-water separators, or 
organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film 
evaporation units. If such equipment is a recovery device, then it is 
part of a PAI process unit and is not a waste management unit.
    Wastewater means water that meets either of the conditions described 
in paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition and is discarded from a PAI 
process unit that is at an affected source:
    (1) Is generated from a PAI process and contains either:
    (i) An annual average concentration of compounds in Table 9 of 
subpart G of this part of at least 5 ppmw and has an average flow rate 
of 0.02 L/min or greater; or
    (ii) An annual average concentration of compounds in Table 9 of 
subpart G of this part of at least 10,000 ppmw at any flow rate;
    (2) Is generated from a PAI process unit as a result of maintenance 
activities and contains at least 5.3 Mg of HAP per individual discharge 
event.
    Wastewater tank means a stationary waste management unit that is 
designed to contain an accumulation of wastewater or residuals and is 
constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, 
steel, plastic) which provide structural support. Wastewater tanks used 
for flow equalization are included in this definition.
    Water seal controls means a seal pot, p-leg trap, or other type of 
trap filled with water (e.g., flooded sewers that maintain water levels 
adequate to prevent air flow through the system) that creates a water 
barrier between the sewer line and the atmosphere. The water level of 
the seal must be maintained in the vertical leg of a drain in order to 
be considered a water seal.

    (10) When the total load of Table 9 compounds in the sum of all 
process wastewater from PAI process units at a new affected source is 
2,100 Mg/yr (2,300 tons/yr) or more, the owner or operator shall reduce, 
by removal or destruction, the mass flow rate of all compounds in Table 
9 of subpart G of this part in all wastewater (process and maintenance 
wastewater) by 99 percent or more. Alternatively, the owner or operator 
may treat the wastewater in a unit identified in and complying with 
Sec. 63.138(h) of subpart G of this part. The removal/destruction 
efficiency shall be determined by the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.145(c) of subpart G of this part, for noncombustion processes, 
or Sec. 63.145(d) of subpart G of this part, for combustion processes.
    (11) The compliance date for the affected source subject to the 
provisions of this section is specified in Sec. 63.1364.
    (12) The option in Sec. 63.139 of subpart G of this part to reduce 
emissions from a control device to an outlet HAP concentration of 20 
ppmv shall not apply for the purposes of this subpart.
    (13) The requirement to correct outlet concentrations from 
combustion devices to 3 percent oxygen in Sec. 63.139(c)(1)(ii) of 
subpart H of this part shall apply only if supplemental gases are 
combined with affected vent streams. If emissions are controlled with a 
vapor recovery system as specified in Sec. 63.139(c)(2) of subpart H of 
this part, the owner or operator must correct for supplemental gases as 
specified in Sec. 63.1365(a)(7)(ii).
    (14) If wastewater is sent offsite for biological treatment, the 
waste management units up to the activated sludge unit must be covered, 
or the owner or operator must demonstrate that less than 5 percent of 
the total HAP on list 1 in Sec. 63.145(h) of subpart H

[[Page 378]]

of this part is emitted from these units.
    (e) Bag dumps and product dryers. (1) The owner or operator shall 
reduce particulate matter emissions to a concentration not to exceed 
0.01 gr/dscf from product dryers that dry a PAI or integral intermediate 
that is a HAP.
    (2) The owner or operator shall reduce particulate matter emissions 
to a concentration not to exceed 0.01 gr/dscf from bag dumps that 
introduce to a PAI process unit a feedstock that is a solid material and 
a HAP, excluding bag dumps where the feedstock contains HAP only as 
impurities.
    (3) Gaseous HAP emissions from product dryers and bag dumps shall be 
controlled in accordance with the provisions for process vent emissions 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) Heat exchange systems. Unless one or more of the conditions 
specified in Sec. 63.104(a)(1) through (6) of subpart F of this part are 
met, an owner or operator shall monitor each heat exchange system that 
is used to cool process equipment in PAI process units that are part of 
an affected source as defined in Sec. 63.1360(a) according to the 
provisions in either Sec. 63.104(b) or (c) of subpart F of this part. 
When the term ``chemical manufacturing process unit'' is used in 
Sec. 63.104(c) of subpart F of this part, the term ``PAI process unit'' 
shall apply for the purposes of this subpart. Whenever a leak is 
detected, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in 
Sec. 63.104(d) of subpart F of this part. Delay of repair of heat 
exchange systems for which leaks have been detected is allowed in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 63.104(e) of subpart F of this 
part.
    (g) Pollution prevention alternative. Except as provided in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for a process that has an initial 
startup before November 10, 1997, an owner or operator may choose to 
meet the pollution prevention alternative requirement specified in 
either paragraph (g)(2) or (3) of this section for any PAI process unit, 
in lieu of the requirements specified in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and 
(e) of this section and in Sec. 63.1363. Compliance with the 
requirements of paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section shall be 
demonstrated through the procedures in Secs. 63.1365(g) and 63.1366(f).
    (1) A HAP must be controlled according to the requirements of 
paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section and Sec. 63.1363 if it 
is generated in the PAI process unit or an associated control device and 
it is not part of the production-indexed HAP consumption factor (HAP 
factor).
    (2) The HAP factor shall be reduced by at least 85 percent from a 3-
year average baseline beginning no earlier than the 1987 through 1989 
calendar years. Alternatively, for a process that has been operating for 
less than 3 years but more than 1 year, the baseline factor may be 
calculated for the time period from startup of the process until the 
present. For any reduction in the HAP factor achieved by reducing a HAP 
that is also a VOC, an equivalent reduction in the production-indexed 
VOC consumption factor (VOC factor) is also required (the equivalence is 
determined on a mass basis, not a percentage basis). For any reduction 
in the HAP factor that is achieved by reducing a HAP that is not a VOC, 
the VOC factor may not be increased.
    (3) As an alternative to the provisions in paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section, the owner or operator may combine pollution prevention with 
emissions control as specified in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) The HAP factor shall be reduced as specified in paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section except that a reduction of at least 50 percent shall 
apply for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (ii) The total annual HAP emissions from the PAI process unit shall 
be reduced by an amount that, when divided by the annual production rate 
and added to the reduction of the HAP factor yields a value of at least 
85 percent of the baseline HAP factor. The total annual VOC emissions 
from the process unit must be reduced by an amount equivalent to the 
reduction in HAP emissions for each HAP that is a VOC (the equivalence 
is determined on a mass basis). For HAP emissions reductions that are 
achieved by reducing a HAP that is not a VOC, the total annual VOC 
emissions may not be increased. The reduction in HAP air

[[Page 379]]

emissions must be achieved using one of the following control devices:
    (A) Combustion control devices such as incinerators, flares, or 
process heaters.
    (B) Control devices such as condensers and carbon adsorbers whose 
recovered product is destroyed or shipped offsite for destruction.
    (C) Any control device that does not ultimately allow for recycling 
of material back to the PAI process unit.
    (D) Any control device for which the owner or operator can 
demonstrate that the use of the device in controlling HAP emissions will 
have no effect on the HAP factor for the PAI process unit.
    (h) Emissions averaging provisions. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(h)(1) through (7) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing 
affected facility may choose to comply with the emission standards in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section by using emissions 
averaging procedures specified in Sec. 63.1365(h) for organic HAP 
emissions from any storage vessel, process, or waste management unit 
that is part of an affected source subject to this subpart.
    (1) A State may restrict the owner or operator of an existing source 
to use only the procedures in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section to comply with the emission standards where State authorities 
prohibit averaging of HAP emissions.
    (2) Emission points that are controlled as specified in paragraphs 
(h)(2)(i) through (iii) may not be used to calculate emissions averaging 
credits, unless a nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the 
procedures in Sec. 63.150(i) of subpart G of this part. The nominal 
efficiency must exceed the percent reduction required by paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section for process vents and storage vessels, 
respectively, and exceed the percent reduction required in 
Sec. 63.138(e) or (f) of subpart G of this part for wastewater streams.
    (i) Group 1 storage vessels controlled with an internal floating 
roof meeting the specifications of Sec. 63.119(b) of subpart G of this 
part, an external floating roof meeting the specifications of 
Sec. 63.119(c) of subpart G of this part, or an external floating roof 
converted to an internal floating meeting the specifications of 
Sec. 63.119(d) of subpart G of this part.
    (ii) Emission points controlled with a flare.
    (iii) Wastewater controlled as specified in paragraphs 
(h)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) With controls specified in Sec. 63.133 through Sec. 63.137 of 
subpart G of this part;
    (B) With a steam stripper meeting the specifications of 
Sec. 63.138(d) of subpart G of this part.
    (3) Process vents and storage vessels controlled with a control 
device to an outlet concentration of 20 ppmv and wastewater streams 
controlled in a treatment unit to an outlet concentration of 50 ppmw may 
not be used in any averaging group.
    (4) Maintenance wastewater streams and wastewater streams treated in 
biological treatment units may not be included in any averaging group.
    (5) Processes which have been permanently shut down and storage 
vessels permanently taken out of HAP service may not be included in any 
averaging group.
    (6) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 
1990 may not be used to generate emissions averaging credits, unless the 
level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990. In these 
cases, credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after 
November 15, 1990.
    (7) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal 
rule other than this subpart may not be included in an emissions 
averaging group, unless the level of control has been increased after 
November 15, 1990, above what is required by the other State or Federal 
rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or 
Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been 
used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions 
average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or 
Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate 
emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the 
previously approved average.

minutes. Records shall be maintained as specified in Sec. 63.1367(f)(1). 
The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line 
that could divert the vent stream away from the control device to the 
atmosphere; or
    (2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car 
seal or lock and key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal 
or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to 
ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent 
stream is not diverted through the bypass line. Records shall be 
maintained as specified in Sec. 63.1367(f)(2).
    (k) Control requirements for certain liquid streams in open systems 
within a PAI process unit. (1) The owner or operator shall comply with 
the provisions of Table 4 of this subpart, for each item of equipment 
meeting all the criteria specified in paragraphs (k)(2) through (4) of 
this section and either paragraph (k)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section.

in Table 9 of subpart G of this part at any flowrate; or a total annual 
average concentration greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm by weight of 
compounds in Table 9 of subpart G of this part at an annual average flow 
rate greater than or equal to 10 liters per minute; or
    (ii) Is a tank that receives one or more streams that contain water 
with a total annual average concentration greater than or equal to 1,000 
ppm by weight of compounds in Table 9 of subpart G of this part at an 
annual average flowrate greater than or equal to 10 liters per minute. 
The owner or operator of the source shall determine the characteristics 
of the stream as specified in paragraphs (k)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this 
section.
    (A) The characteristics of the stream being received shall be 
determined at the inlet to the tank.
    (B) The characteristics shall be determined according to the 
procedures in Sec. 63.144(b) and (c) of subpart G of this part.
    (l) Exemption for RCRA treatment units. An owner or operator shall 
be exempt from the initial compliance demonstrations and monitoring 
provisions in Secs. 63.1365 and 63.1366 and the associated recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements in Secs. 63.1367 and 63.1368 for emissions

Sec. 63.1363  Standards for equipment leaks.

    (a) General equipment leak requirements. (1) The provisions of this 
section apply to ``equipment'' as defined in Sec. 63.1361 and any 
closed-vent systems and control devices required by this subpart.
    (2) Consistency with other regulations. After the compliance date 
for a process, equipment subject to both this section and either of the 
following will be required to comply only with the provisions of this 
subpart:
    (i) 40 CFR part 60.
    (ii) 40 CFR part 61.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) The provisions in Sec. 63.1(a)(3) of subpart A of this part do 
not alter the provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (5) Lines and equipment not containing process fluids are not 
subject to the provisions of this section. Utilities, and other 
nonprocess lines, such as heating and cooling systems which do not 
combine their materials with those in the processes they serve, are not 
considered to be part of a process.
    (6) The provisions of this section do not apply to bench-scale 
processes, regardless of whether the processes are located at the same 
plant site as a process subject to the provisions of this subpart MMM.
    (7) Each piece of equipment to which this section applies shall be 
identified such that it can be distinguished readily from equipment that 
is not subject to this section. Identification of the equipment does not 
require physical tagging of the equipment. For example, the equipment 
may be identified on a plant site plan, in log entries, or by 
designation of process boundaries by some form of weatherproof 
identification. If changes are made to the affected source subject to 
the leak detection requirements, equipment identification for each type 
of component shall be updated, if needed, within 15 calendar days of the 
end of each monitoring period for that component.
    (8) Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the 
requirements of this section.
    (9) Equipment that is in organic HAP service, but is in such service 
less than 300 hours per calendar year, is excluded from the requirements 
of this section if it is identified as required in paragraph (g)(9) of 
this section.
    (10) When each leak is detected by visual, audible, or olfactory 
means, or by monitoring as described in Sec. 63.180(b) or (c) of subpart 
H of this part, the following requirements apply:
    (i) A weatherproof and readily visible identification, marked with 
the equipment identification number, shall be attached to the leaking 
equipment.
    (ii) The identification on a valve or connector in light liquid or 
gas/vapor service may be removed after it has been monitored as 
specified in paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section and Sec. 63.174(e) of 
subpart H of this part, and no leak has been detected during the follow-
up monitoring.
    (iii) The identification on equipment, except on a valve or 
connector in light liquid or gas/vapor service, may be removed after it 
has been repaired.
    (b) References. The owner or operator shall comply with the 
provisions of subpart H of this part as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (3) of this section. When the term ``process unit'' is used in 
subpart H of this part, it shall mean any group of processes for the 
purposes of this subpart. Groups of processes as used in this subpart 
may be any individual process or combination of processes.

section.
    (i) Section 63.171, Delay of repair, shall apply except 
Sec. 63.171(a) shall not apply. Delay of repair of equipment for which 
leaks have been detected is allowed if one of the following conditions 
exist:
    (A) The repair is technically infeasible without a process shutdown. 
Repair of this equipment shall occur by the end of the next scheduled 
process shutdown.
    (B) The owner or operator determines that repair personnel would be 
exposed to an immediate danger if attempting to repair without a process 
shutdown. Repair of this equipment shall occur by the end of the next 
scheduled process shutdown.
    (ii) Section 63.172, Closed-vent systems and control devices, shall 
apply for closed-vent systems used to comply with this section, and for 
control devices used to comply with this section only, except:
    (A) Section 63.172(k) and (l) shall not apply. The owner or operator 
shall instead comply with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (B) Owners or operators may, instead of complying with the 
provisions of Sec. 63.172(f), design a closed-vent system to operate at 
a pressure below atmospheric pressure. The system shall be equipped with 
at least one pressure gauge or other pressure measurement device that 
can be read from a readily accessible location to verify that negative 
pressure is being maintained in the closed-vent system when the 
associated control device is operating.
    (iii) Section 63.174, Connectors, shall apply except:
    (A) Section 63.174(f) and (g) shall not apply. Instead of 
Sec. 63.174(f) and (g), the owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (B) Days that the connectors are not in organic HAP service shall 
not be considered part of the 3-month period in Sec. 63.174(e).
    (C) Section 63.174(b)(3)(ii) of subpart H of this part shall not 
apply. Instead, if the percent leaking connectors in the group of 
process units was less than 0.5 percent, but equal to or greater than 
0.25 percent, during the last required monitoring period, monitoring 
shall be performed once every 4 years. An owner or operator may comply 
with the requirements of this paragraph by monitoring at least 40 
percent of the connectors in the first 2 years and the

[[Page 383]]

remainder of the connectors within the next 2 years. The percent leaking 
connectors will be calculated for the total of all monitoring performed 
during the 4-year period.
    (D) Section 63.174(b)(3)(iv) of subpart H of this part shall not 
apply. Instead, the owner or operator shall increase the monitoring 
frequency to once every 2 years for the next monitoring period if 
leaking connectors comprise at least 0.5 percent but less than 1.0 
percent of the connectors monitored within the 4 years specified in 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, or the first 4 years specified 
in Sec. 63.174(b)(3)(iii) of subpart H of this part. At the end of that 
2-year monitoring period, the owner or operator shall monitor once per 
year while the percent leaking connectors is greater than or equal to 
0.5 percent; if the percent leaking connectors is less than 0.5 percent, 
the owner or operator may return to monitoring once every 4 years or may 
monitor in accordance with Sec. 63.174(b)(3)(iii) of subpart H of this 
part, if appropriate.
    (E) Section 63.174(b)(3)(v) of subpart H of this part shall not 
apply. Instead, if an owner or operator complying with the requirements 
of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) and (D) of this section or 
Sec. 63.174(b)(3)(iii) of subpart H of this part for a group of process 
units determines that 1 percent or greater of the connectors are 
leaking, the owner or operator shall increase the monitoring frequency 
to one time per year. The owner or operator may again elect to use the 
provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(C) or (D) of this section after a 
monitoring period in which less than 0.5 percent of the connectors are 
determined to be leaking.
    (F) Section 63.174(b)(3)(iii) of subpart H of this part shall not 
apply. Instead, monitoring shall be required once every 8 years, if the 
percent leaking connectors in the group of process units was less than 
0.25 percent during the last required monitoring period. An owner or 
operator shall monitor at least 50 percent of the connectors in the 
first 4 years and the remainder of the connectors within the next 4 
years. If the percent leaking connectors in the first 4 years is equal 
to or greater than 0.35 percent, the monitoring program shall revert at 
that time to the appropriate monitoring frequency specified in 
paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(C), (D), or (E) of this section.
    (iv) Section 63.178 of subpart H of this part, Alternative means of 
emission limitation: Batch processes, shall apply except that 
Sec. 63.178(b) of subpart H of this part, requirements for pressure 
testing, shall apply to all processes, not just batch processes;
    (v) Section 63.180 of subpart H of this part, Test methods and 
procedures, shall apply except Sec. 63.180(b)(4)(ii)(A) through (C) of 
subpart H of this part shall not apply. Calibration gases shall be a 
mixture of methane and air at a concentration of approximately, but less 
than, 10,000 parts per million methane for agitators, 2,000 parts per 
million for pumps, and 500 parts per million for all other equipment, 
except as provided in Sec. 63.180(b)(4)(iii) of subpart H of this part.
    (c) standards for pumps in light liquid service and agitators in 
gas/vapor service and in light liquid service. (1) The provisions of 
this section apply to each pump that is in light liquid service, and to 
each agitator in gas/vapor service or in light liquid service.
    (2)(i) Monitoring. Each pump and agitator subject to this section 
shall be monitored quarterly to detect leaks by the method specified in 
Sec. 63.180(b) of subpart H of this part, except as provided in 
Sec. 63.177 of subpart H of this part, paragraph (f) of this section, 
and paragraphs (c)(5) through (c)(9) of this section.
    (ii) Leak definition. The instrument reading, as determined by the 
method as specified in Sec. 63.180(b) of subpart H of this part, that 
defines a leak is:
    (A) For agitators, an instrument reading of 10,000 parts per million 
or greater.
    (B) For pumps, an instrument reading of 2,000 parts per million or 
greater.
    (iii) Visual inspections. Each pump and agitator shall be checked by 
visual inspection each calendar week for indications of liquids dripping 
from the pump or agitator seal. If there are indications of liquids

either 10 percent or three of the pumps in a group of processes leak, 
the owner or operator shall monitor each pump once per month.
    (iii) The number of pumps in a group of processes shall be the sum 
of all the pumps in organic HAP service, except that pumps found leaking 
in a continuous process within 1 quarter after startup of the pump shall 
not count in the percent leaking pumps calculation for that one 
monitoring period only.
    (iv) Percent leaking pumps shall be determined using Equation 3 of 
this subpart:

[[Page 386]]

    (3) Monitoring. The owner or operator of a source subject to this 
section shall monitor all valves, except as provided in paragraph (f) of 
this section and in Sec. 63.177 of subpart H of this part, at the 
intervals specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section and shall comply 
with all other provisions of this section, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and Secs. 63.178 and 63.179 of 
subpart H of this part.
    (i) The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method 
specified in Sec. 63.180(b) of subpart H of this part.
    (ii) An instrument reading of 500 parts per million or greater 
defines a leak.
    (4) Subsequent monitoring frequencies. After conducting the initial 
survey required in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the owner or 
operator shall monitor valves for leaks at the intervals specified 
below:
    (i) For a group of processes with 2 percent or greater leaking 
valves, calculated according to paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the 
owner or operator shall monitor each valve once per month, except as 
specified in paragraph (e)(9) of this section.
    (ii) For a group of processes with less than 2 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve once each 
quarter, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(4)(iii) through (v) of 
this section.
    (iii) For a group of processes with less than 1 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
2 quarters.
    (iv) For a group of processes with less than 0.5 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
4 quarters.
    (v) For a group of processes with less than 0.25 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
2 years.
    (5) Calculation of percent leakers. For a group of processes to 
which this subpart applies, the owner or operator may choose to 
subdivide the valves in the applicable group of processes and apply the 
provisions of paragraph (e)(4) of this section to each subgroup. If the 
owner or operator elects to subdivide the valves in the applicable group 
of processes, then the provisions of paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (viii) 
of this section apply.
    (i) The overall performance of total valves in the applicable group 
of processes must be less than 2 percent leaking valves, as detected 
according to paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section and as 
calculated according to paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (ii) The initial assignment or subsequent reassignment of valves to 
subgroups shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) 
(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) The owner or operator shall determine which valves are assigned 
to each subgroup. Valves with less than 1 year of monitoring data or 
valves not monitored within the last 12 months must be placed initially 
into the most frequently monitored subgroup until at least 1 year of 
monitoring data have been obtained.
    (B) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a less 
frequently monitored subgroup to a more frequently monitored subgroup 
provided that the valves to be reassigned were monitored during the most 
recent monitoring period for the less frequently monitored subgroup. The 
monitoring results must be included with the less frequently monitored 
subgroup's monitoring event and associated next percent leaking valves 
calculation for that group.
    (C) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a more 
frequently monitored subgroup to a less frequently monitored subgroup 
provided that the valves to be reassigned have not leaked for the period 
of the less frequently monitored subgroup (e.g., for the last 12 months, 
if the valve or group of valves is to be reassigned to a subgroup being 
monitored annually). Nonrepairable valves may not be reassigned to a 
less frequently monitored subgroup.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall determine every 6 months if the 
overall performance of total valves in the applicable group of processes 
is less than 2 percent leaking valves and so indicate the performance in 
the next Periodic report. If the overall performance of total valves in 
the applicable group of processes is 2 percent leaking valves

[[Page 387]]

or greater, the owner or operator shall revert to the program required 
in paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of this section. The overall 
performance of total valves in the applicable group of processes shall 
be calculated as a weighted average of the percent leaking valves of 
each subgroup according to Equation 4 of this subpart:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JN99.003

where:

%V<INF>LO</INF> = overall performance of total valves in the applicable 
          group of processes
%V<INF>Li</INF> = percent leaking valves in subgroup i, most recent 
          value calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs 
          (e)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section
V<INF>i</INF> = number of valves in subgroup i
n = number of subgroups

    (iv) Records. In addition to records required by paragraph (g) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall maintain records specified in 
paragraphs (e)(5)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Which valves are assigned to each subgroup,
    (B) Monitoring results and calculations made for each subgroup for 
each monitoring period,
    (C) Which valves are reassigned and when they were reassigned, and
    (D) The results of the semiannual overall performance calculation 
required in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (v) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later 
than 30 days prior to the beginning of the next monitoring period of the 
decision to subgroup valves. The notification shall identify the 
participating processes and the valves assigned to each subgroup.
    (vi) Semiannual reports. In addition to the information required by 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit in 
the Periodic reports the information specified in paragraphs 
(e)(5)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) Valve reassignments occurring during the reporting period, and
    (B) Results of the semiannual overall performance calculation 
required by paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (vii) To determine the monitoring frequency for each subgroup, the 
calculation procedures of paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section shall be 
used.
    (viii) Except for the overall performance calculations required by 
paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (iii) of this section, each subgroup shall be 
treated as if it were a process for the purposes of applying the 
provisions of this section.
    (6)(i) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the 
implementation date of this subpart or upon revision of an operating 
permit how to group the processes. Once the owner or operator has 
decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the 
same basis.
    (ii) Percent leaking valves for each group of processes or subgroup 
shall be determined using Equation 5 of this subpart:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JN99.004

Where:

%V<INF>L</INF> = percent leaking valves
V<INF>L</INF> = number of valves found leaking excluding nonrepairables 
          as provided in paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(A) of this section
V<INF>T</INF> = total valves monitored, in a monitoring period excluding 
          valves monitored as required by paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this 
          section

    (iii) When determining monitoring frequency for each group of 
processes or subgroup subject to monthly, quarterly, or semiannual 
monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the 
arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last two 
monitoring periods. When determining monitoring frequency for each group 
of processes or subgroup subject to annual or biennial (once every 2 
years) monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the 
arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last three 
monitoring periods.
    (iv)(A) Nonrepairable valves shall be included in the calculation of 
percent leaking valves the first time the valve is identified as leaking 
and nonrepairable and as required to comply with paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(B) 
of this section.

[[Page 388]]

Otherwise, a number of nonrepairable valves (identified and included in 
the percent leaking calculation in a previous period) up to a maximum of 
1 percent of the total number of valves in organic HAP service at a 
process may be excluded from calculation of percent leaking valves for 
subsequent monitoring periods.
    (B) If the number of nonrepairable valves exceeds 1 percent of the 
total number of valves in organic HAP service at a process, the number 
of nonrepairable valves exceeding 1 percent of the total number of 
valves in organic HAP service shall be included in the calculation of 
percent leaking valves.
    (7) Repair provisions. (i) When a leak is detected, it shall be 
repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days 
after the leak is detected, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section.
    (ii) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 
calendar days after each leak is detected.
    (iii) When a leak is repaired, the valve shall be monitored at least 
once within the first 3 months after its repair. Days that the valve is 
not in organic HAP service shall not be considered part of this 3-month 
period.
    (8) First attempts at repair include, but are not limited to, the 
following practices where practicable:
    (i) Tightening of bonnet bolts,
    (ii) Replacement of bonnet bolts,
    (iii) Tightening of packing gland nuts, and
    (iv) Injection of lubricant into lubricated packing.
    (9) Any equipment located at a plant site with fewer than 250 valves 
in organic HAP service in the affected source is exempt from the 
requirements for monthly monitoring specified in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of 
this section. Instead, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve in 
organic HAP service for leaks once each quarter, or comply with 
paragraphs (e)(4)(iii) or (iv) of this section.
    (f) Unsafe to monitor, difficult to monitor, and inaccessible 
equipment. (1) Equipment that is designated as unsafe to monitor, 
difficult to monitor, or inaccessible is exempt from the requirements as 
specified in paragraphs (f)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section provided 
the owner or operator meets the requirements specified in paragraph (f) 
(2), (3), or (4) of this section, as applicable. Ceramic or ceramic-
lined connectors are subject to the same requirements as inaccessible 
connectors.
    (i) For pumps and agitators, paragraphs (c) (2), (3), and (4) of 
this section do not apply.
    (ii) For valves, paragraphs (e)(2) through (7) of this section do 
not apply.
    (iii) For closed-vent systems, Sec. 63.172(f)(1), (f)(2), and (g) of 
subpart H of this part do not apply.
    (iv) For connectors, Sec. 63.174(b) through (e) of subpart H of this 
part do not apply.
    (2) Equipment that is unsafe to monitor. (i) Equipment may be 
designated as unsafe to monitor if the owner or operator determines that 
monitoring personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a 
consequence of complying with the monitoring requirements identified in 
paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (ii) The owner or operator of equipment that is designated as 
unsafe-to-monitor must have a written plan that requires monitoring of 
the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-monitor times, 
but not more frequently than the periodic monitoring schedule otherwise 
applicable.
    (3) Equipment that is difficult to monitor. (i) Equipment may be 
designated as difficult to monitor if the owner or operator determines 
that the equipment cannot be monitored without elevating the monitoring 
personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface or the equipment is 
not accessible at anytime in a safe manner;
    (ii) At an existing source, any equipment within a group of 
processes that meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section 
may be designated as difficult to monitor. At a new affected source, an 
owner or operator may designate no more than 3 percent of each type of 
equipment as difficult to monitor.
    (iii) The owner or operator of equipment designated as difficult to 
monitor must follow a written plan that requires monitoring of the 
equipment at least once per calendar year.

[[Page 389]]

    (4) Inaccessible equipment and ceramic or ceramic-lined connectors. 
(i) A connector, agitator, or valve may be designated as inaccessible if 
it is:
    (A) Buried;
    (B) Insulated in a manner that prevents access to the equipment by a 
monitor probe;
    (C) Obstructed by equipment or piping that prevents access to the 
equipment by a monitor probe;

type scaffold which would allow access to equipment up to 7.6 meters 
above the ground; or
    (E) Not able to be accessed at any time in a safe manner to perform 
monitoring. Unsafe access includes, but is not limited to, the use of a 
wheeled scissor-lift on unstable or uneven terrain, the use of a 
motorized man-lift basket in areas where an ignition potential exists, 
or access would require near proximity to hazards such as electrical 
lines, or would risk damage to equipment.
    (ii) At an existing source, any connector, agitator, or valve that 
meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section may be 
designated as inaccessible. At a new affected source, an owner or 
operator may designate no more than 3 percent of each type of equipment 
as inaccessible.
    (iii) If any inaccessible equipment or ceramic or ceramic-lined 
connector is observed by visual, audible, olfactory, or other means to 
be leaking, the leak shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but no 
later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected, except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
    (g) Recordkeeping requirements. (1) An owner or operator of more 
than one group of processes subject to the provisions of this section 
may comply with the recordkeeping requirements for the groups of 
processes in one recordkeeping system if the system identifies with each 
record the program being implemented (e.g., quarterly monitoring) for 
each type of equipment. All records and information required by this

Sec. 63.1365  Test methods and initial compliance procedures.

    (a) General. Except as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, the procedures specified in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), and 
(g) of this section are required to demonstrate initial compliance with 
Sec. 63.1362(b), (c), (d), (f), and (g), respectively. The provisions in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to design evaluations that are 
used to demonstrate compliance with the standards for process vents and 
storage vessels. The provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
apply to performance tests that are specified in paragraphs (c), (d), 
and (e) of this section. The provisions in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section describe initial compliance procedures for flares. The 
provisions in paragraph (a)(5) of this section are used to demonstrate 
initial compliance with the alternative standards specified in 
Sec. 63.1362(b)(6) and (c)(4). The provisions in paragraph (a)(6) of 
this section are used to comply with the outlet concentration 
requirements specified in Sec. 63.1362(b)(2)(iv)(A), (b)(3)(ii), 
(b)(4)(ii)(A), (b)(5)(ii), and (b)(5)(iii).
    (1) Design evaluation. To demonstrate that a control device meets 
the required control efficiency, a design evaluation must address the 
composition and HAP concentration of the vent stream entering the 
control device. A design evaluation also must address other vent stream 
characteristics and control device operating parameters as specified in 
any one of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section, depending 
on the type of control device that is used. If the vent stream is not 
the only inlet to the control device, the efficiency demonstration also 
must consider all other vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, 
received by the control device.
    (i) For an enclosed combustion device used to comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 63.1362(b)(2)(iv), (b)(4)(ii), (c)(2)(iv)(B), or 
(c)(3) with a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum

[[Page 395]]

temperature of 760  deg.C, the design evaluation must document that 
these conditions exist.
    (ii) For a combustion control device that does not satisfy the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the design evaluation 
must document control efficiency and address the following 
characteristics, depending on the type of control device:
    (A) For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must 
consider the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, must consider 
the vent stream flow rate, and must establish the design minimum and 
average temperature in the combustion zone and the combustion zone 
residence time.
    (B) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must 
consider the vent stream flow rate and must establish the design minimum 
and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and outlet.
    (C) For a boiler or process heater, the design evaluation must 
consider the vent stream flow rate, must establish the design minimum 
and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time, 
and must describe the method and location where the vent stream is 
introduced into the flame zone.
    (iii) For a condenser, the design evaluation must consider the vent 
stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and must establish 
the design outlet organic HAP compound concentration level, design 
average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design 
average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and 
outlet. The temperature of the gas stream exiting the condenser must be 
measured and used to establish the outlet organic HAP concentration.
    (iv) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed 
directly onsite in the control device such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the 
design evaluation must consider the vent stream flow rate, relative 
humidity, and temperature, and must establish the design exhaust vent 
stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, 
number of carbon beds and their capacities, type and working capacity of 
activated carbon used for the carbon beds, design total regeneration 
stream mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon 
bed regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after 
regeneration, design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service 
life of carbon. For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop must be 
included.
    (v) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the 
carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a carbon 
canister, the design evaluation must consider the vent stream mass or 
volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and must 
establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration 
level, capacity of the carbon bed, type and working capacity of 
activated carbon used for the carbon bed, and design carbon replacement 
interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control 
device and source operating schedule.
    (vi) For a scrubber, the design evaluation must consider the vent 
stream composition, constituent concentrations, liquid-to-vapor ratio, 
scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration, temperature, and the 
reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The 
design evaluation must establish the design exhaust vent stream organic 
compound concentration level and must include the additional information 
in paragraphs (a)(1)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section for trays and a 
packed column scrubber.
    (A) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays;
    (B) Type and total surface area of packing for entire column, and 
for individual packed sections if column contains more than one packed 
section.
    (vii) For fabric filters, the design evaluation must include the 
pressure drop through the device and the net gas-to-cloth ratio (i.e., 
cubic feet of gas per square feet of cloth).
    (2) Calculation of TOC or total organic HAP concentration. The TOC 
concentration or total organic HAP concentration is the sum of the 
concentrations of the individual components. If compliance is being 
determined based on TOC, the owner or operator shall compute TOC for 
each run using Equation 6 of this subpart. If compliance with the

[[Page 396]]

percent reduction format of the standard is being determined based on 
total organic HAP, the owner or operator shall compute total organic HAP 
using Equation 6 of this subpart, except that only organic HAP compounds 
shall be summed; when determining compliance with the wastewater 
provisions of Sec. 63.1363(d), the organic HAP compounds shall consist 
of the organic HAP compounds in Table 9 of subpart G of this part.

with the standards, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
provisions in Sec. 63.11(b) of subpart A of this part.
    (i) The initial compliance determination shall consist of a visible 
emissions determination using Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, 
as described in Sec. 63.11(b)(4) of subpart A of this part, and a 
determination of net heating value of gas being combusted and exit 
velocity to comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.11(b)(6) through (8) 
of subpart A of this part. The net heating value and exit velocity shall 
be based on the results of performance testing under the conditions 
described in paragraphs (b)(10) and (11) of this section.
    (ii) An owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance 
test to determine percent emission reduction or outlet organic HAP or 
TOC concentration when a flare is used.
    (4) Exemptions from compliance demonstrations. An owner or operator 
using any control device specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (ii) 
of this section is exempt from the initial compliance provisions in 
paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
    (i) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 
44 megawatts or greater.
    (ii) A boiler or process heater into which the emission stream is 
introduced with the primary fuel.
    (5) Initial compliance with alternative standard. Initial compliance 
with the alternative standards in Sec. 63.1362(b)(6) and (c)(4) is 
demonstrated when the outlet TOC concentration is 20 ppmv or less, and 
the outlet HCl and chlorine concentration is 20 ppmv or less. To 
demonstrate initial compliance, the owner or operator shall be in 
compliance with the monitoring provisions in Sec. 63.1366(b)(5) on the 
initial compliance date. The owner or operator shall use Method 18 of 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A to determine the predominant organic HAP in the 
emission stream if the TOC monitor is calibrated on the predominant HAP.
    (6) Initial compliance with the 20 ppmv outlet limit. Initial 
compliance with the 20 ppmv TOC and HCl and chlorine concentration is 
demonstrated when the outlet TOC concentration is 20 ppmv or less, and 
the outlet HCl and chlorine concentration is 20 ppmv or less. To 
demonstrate initial compliance, the operator shall use applicable test 
methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section, and 
test under conditions described in paragraphs (b)(10) or (11) of this 
section, as applicable. The owner or operator shall comply with the 
monitoring provisions in Sec. 63.1366(b)(1) through (5) on the initial 
compliance date.
    (7) Outlet concentration correction for supplemental gases. If 
supplemental gases are added to a vent stream for which compliance with 
an outlet concentration standard in Sec. 63.1362 or 63.1363 will be

[[Page 397]]

subpart H of this part, the actual TOC outlet concentration must be 
corrected to 3 percent oxygen.
    (B) If the inlet stream to the combustion device contains any HCl, 
chlorine, or halogenated compounds, and the owner or operator elects to 
comply with a total HCl and chlorine outlet concentration standard in 
Sec. 63.1362(b)(3)(ii), (b)(5)(ii), (b)(5)(iii), (b)(6), or (c)(4), the 
actual total HCl and chlorine outlet concentration must be corrected to 
3 percent oxygen.
    (C) The integrated sampling and analysis procedures of Method 3B of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used to determine the actual oxygen 
concentration (%O<INF>2d</INF>). The samples shall be taken during the 
same time that the TOC and HCl and chlorine samples are taken. The 
concentration corrected to 3 percent oxygen (C<INF>d</INF>) shall be 
computed using Equation 7 of this subpart:

grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements 
(every 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory

variations in flow rate. For continuous gas streams, the emission rate 
used to determine compliance shall be the average emission rate of the 
three test runs.
    (11) Testing conditions for batch processes. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(12) of this section for condensers, testing of emissions 
on equipment where the flow of gaseous emissions is intermittent (batch 
operations) shall be conducted at absolute peak-case conditions or 
hypothetical peak-case conditions, as specified in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) 
and (ii) of this section, respectively. Gas stream volumetric flow rates 
shall be measured at 15-minute intervals. Organic HAP, TOC, or HCl and 
chlorine concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an 
integrated sample over the duration of the test, or from grab samples 
collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 
minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, 
the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations 
in flow rate. In all cases, a site-specific test plan shall be submitted 
to the Administrator for approval prior to testing in accordance with 
Sec. 63.7(c) of subpart A of this part. The test plan shall include the 
emissions profile described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section. 
The term ``HAP mass loading'' as used in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) through 
(iii) of this section refers to the class of HAP, either organic or HCl 
and chlorine, that the control device is intended to control.
    (i) Absolute peak-case. If the most challenging conditions for the 
control device occur under maximum HAP load, the absolute peak-case 
conditions shall be characterized by the criteria presented in paragraph 
(b)(11)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Otherwise, absolute peak-case 
conditions are defined by the conditions in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(C) of 
this section.
    (A) The period in which the inlet to the control device will contain 
at least 50 percent of the maximum HAP mass load that may be vented to 
the control device over any 8-hour period. An emission profile as 
described in paragraph

[[Page 399]]

(b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section shall be used to identify the 8-hour 
period that includes the maximum projected HAP load.
    (B) A 1-hour period of time in which the inlet to the control device 
will contain the highest hourly HAP mass loading rate that may be vented 
to the control device. An emission profile as described in paragraph 
(b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section shall be used to identify the 1-hour 
period of maximum HAP loading.
    (C) The period of time when a condition other than the maximum HAP 
load is most challenging for the control device. These conditions 
include, but are not limited to the following:
    (1) Periods when the streams contain the highest combined VOC and 
HAP hourly load, as described by the emission profiles in paragraph 
(b)(11)(iii) of this section; or
    (2) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach 
the limits of solubility for scrubbing media; or
    (3) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach 
the limits of adsorptivity for carbon adsorption systems.
    (ii) Hypothetical peak-case. Hypothetical peak-case conditions are 
simulated test conditions that, at a minimum, contain the highest total 
average hourly HAP load of emissions that would be predicted to be 
vented to the control device from the emissions profile described in 
either paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section.
    (iii) Emissions profile. The owner or operator may choose to perform 
tests only during those periods of the peak-case episode(s) that the 
owner or operator selects to control as part of achieving the required 
emission reduction. The owner or operator shall develop an emission 
profile for the vent to the control device that describes the 
characteristics of the vent stream at the inlet to the control device 
under either absolute or hypothetical peak-case conditions. The 
emissions profile shall be developed based on the applicable procedures 
described in paragraphs (b)(11)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section, as 
required by paragraphs (b)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (A) Emissions profile by process. The emissions profile must 
consider all emission episodes that could contribute to the vent stack 
for a period of time that is sufficient to include all processes venting 
to the stack and shall consider production scheduling. The profile shall 
describe the HAP load to the device that equals the highest sum of 
emissions from the episodes that can vent to the control device during 
the period of absolute peak-case conditions specified in paragraph 
(b)(11)(i)(A), (B), or (C) as appropriate. Emissions per episode shall 
be calculated using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. When complying with paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section, 
emissions per episode shall be divided by the duration of the episode if 
the duration of the episode is longer than 1 hour.
    (B) Emission profile by equipment. The emission profile must consist 
of emissions that meet or exceed the highest hourly HAP load that would 
be expected under actual processing conditions. The profile shall 
describe equipment configurations used to generate the emission events, 
volatility of materials processed in the equipment, and the rationale 
used to identify and characterize the emission events. The emissions may 
be based on using a compound more volatile than compounds actually used 
in the process(es), and the emissions may be generated from all 
equipment in the process(es) or only selected equipment.
    (C) Emission profile by capture and control device limitation. The 
emission profile shall consider the capture and control system 
limitations and the highest hourly emissions that can be routed to the 
control device, based on maximum flow rate and concentrations possible 
because of limitations on conveyance and control equipment (e.g., fans, 
LEL alarms and safety bypasses).
    (iv) Test duration. Three runs, at a minimum of 1 hour each, are 
required for performance testing. Each run must occur over the same 
absolute or hypothetical peak-case conditions, as defined in paragraph 
(b)(11)(i) or (ii) of this section.

for each process vent that is controlled using a large control device, 
except for a condenser, shall be determined by applying the control 
efficiency of the large control device to the estimated uncontrolled 
emissions. The control efficiency shall be determined by conducting a 
performance test on the control device as described in paragraphs 
(c)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, or by using the results of a 
previous performance test as described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of 
this section. If the control device is intended to control only HCl and 
chlorine, the owner or operator may assume the control efficiency of 
organic HAP is 0 percent. If the control device is intended to control 
only organic HAP, the owner or operator may assume the control 
efficiency for HCl and chlorine is 0 percent.

concentrations of 20 ppmv, the performance testing shall be conducted by 
performing emission testing on the outlet of the control device 
following the test methods and procedures of paragraph (b) of this 
section. Concentrations shall be calculated from the data obtained 
through emission testing according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (B) Performance testing shall be conducted under absolute or 
hypothetical peak-case conditions, as defined in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) 
and (ii) of this section.
    (C) The owner or operator may elect to conduct more than one 
performance test on the control device for the purpose of establishing 
more than one operating condition at which the control device achieves 
the required control efficiency.
    (D) The owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance 
test for any control device for which a previous performance test was 
conducted, provided the test was conducted using the same procedures 
specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (11) of this section over 
conditions typical of the absolute or hypothetical peak-case, as defined 
in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section. The results of the 
previous performance test shall be used to demonstrate compliance.

included in the credit calculation.
    (iii) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to 
paragraph (h)(6) of this section are greater than or equal to debits 
calculated according to paragraph (h)(5) of this section for the same 
annual compliance period. The initial demonstration in the Emissions 
Averaging Plan or operating permit application that credit-generating 
emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to 
offset the debit-generating emission points shall be made under 
representative operating conditions. After the compliance date, actual 
operating data shall be used for all debit and credit calculations.
    (iv) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) 
period according to paragraph (h)(5) of this section are not more than 
1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to 
paragraph (h)(6) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be 
determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, 
with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.
    (v) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits as 
required in Secs. 63.1367(d) and 63.1368(d).
    (3) Credits and debits shall not include emissions during periods of 
malfunction. Credits and debits shall not include periods of startup and 
shutdown for continuous processes.
    (4) During periods of monitoring excursions, credits and debits 
shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) through (iii) of 
this section.
    (i) No credits shall be assigned to the credit-generating emission 
point.
    (ii) Maximum debits shall be assigned to the debit-generating 
emission point.
    (iii) The owner or operator may demonstrate to the Administrator 
that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned using the 
procedures in Sec. 63.150(l) of subpart G of this part.
    (5) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual 
emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or 
controlled to a level less stringent than the applicable standard and 
the emissions allowed for the Group 1 emission point. Debits shall be 
calculated in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs 
(h)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) Source-wide debits shall be calculated using Equation 40 of this 
subpart.
    Debits and all terms of Equation 40 of this subpart are in units of 
Mg/month

measured and recorded at least once every 15 minutes during the period 
in which the scrubber is controlling HAP from an emission stream as 
required by the standards in Sec. 63.1362. If the scrubber uses a 
caustic solution to remove acid emissions, the pH of the effluent 
scrubber liquid shall also be monitored once a day. The minimum scrubber 
liquid flow rate or pressure drop shall be based on the conditions under 
which the initial compliance demonstration was conducted.
    (A) The monitoring device used to determine the pressure drop shall 
be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within a gage 
pressure of <plus-minus>10 percent of the maximum pressure drop 
measured.

day or block.
    (ii) The operating day or block shall be defined in the Notification 
of Compliance Status report. The operating day may be from midnight to 
midnight or another continuous 24-hour period. The operating block may 
be used as an averaging period only for vents from batch operations, and 
is limited to a period of time that is, at a maximum, equal to the time 
from the beginning to end of a series of consecutive batch operations.
    (iii) Monitoring values taken during periods in which the control 
devices are not controlling HAP from an emission stream subject to the 
standards in Sec. 63.1362, as indicated by periods of no flow or periods 
when only streams that are not subject to the standards in Sec. 63.1362 
are controlled, shall not be considered in the averages. Where flow to 
the device could be intermittent, the owner or operator shall install, 
calibrate and operate a flow indicator at the inlet or outlet of the 
control device to identify periods of no flow.
    (3) Procedures for setting parameter levels for control devices used 
to control emissions from process vents. (i) Small control devices. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, for devices 
controlling less than 10 tons/yr of HAP for which a performance test is 
not required, the parameteric levels shall be set based on the design 
evaluation required in Sec. 63.1365(c)(3)(i)(A). If a performance test

[[Page 420]]

monitoring parameter level shall be established according to the 
procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Large control devices. For devices controlling greater than or 
equal to 10 tons/yr of HAP for which a performance test is required, the 
parameter level must be established as follows:
    (A) If the operating parameter level to be established is a maximum 
or minimum, it must be based on the average of the average values from 
each of the three test runs.
    (B) The owner or operator may establish the parametric monitoring 
level(s) based on the performance test supplemented by engineering 
assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing 
is not required to be conducted over the entire range of expected 
parameter values. The rationale for the specific level for each 
parameter, including any data and calculations used to develop the 
level(s) and a description of why the level indicates proper operation 
of the control device shall be provided in the Precompliance plan. 
Determination of the parametric monitoring level using these procedures 
is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.
    (iii) Parameter levels for control devices controlling batch process 
vents. For devices controlling batch process vents alone or in 
combination with other streams, the level(s) shall be established in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) A single level for the batch process(es) shall be calculated 
from the initial compliance demonstration.
    (B) The owner or operator may establish separate levels for each 
batch emission episode or combination of emission episodes selected to 
be controlled. If separate monitoring levels are established, the owner 
or operator must provide a record indicating at what point in the daily 
schedule or log of processes required to be recorded per the 
requirements of Sec. 63.1367(b)(7), the parameter being monitored 
changes levels and must record at least one reading of the new parameter 
level, even if the duration of monitoring for the new parameter level is 
less than 15 minutes.
    (4) Requesting approval to monitor alternative parameters. The owner 
or operator may request approval to monitor parameters other than those 
required by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (xiii) of this section. The 
request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.8(f) of subpart A of this part or in the Precompliance report

    (5) Monitoring for the alternative standards. For control devices 
that are used to comply with the provisions of Sec. 63.1362(b)(6) and 
(c)(4), the owner or operator shall monitor and record the outlet TOC 
concentration and the outlet total HCl and chlorine concentration at 
least once every 15 minutes during the period in which the device is 
controlling HAP from emission streams subject to the standards in 
Sec. 63.1362. A TOC monitor meeting the requirements of Performance 
Specification 8 or 9 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60 shall be installed, 
calibrated, and maintained, according to Sec. 63.8 of subpart A of this 
part. The owner or operator need not monitor the total HCl and chlorine 
concentration if the owner or operator determines that the emission 
stream does not contain HCl or chlorine. The owner or operator need not 
monitor for TOC concentration if the owner or operator determines that 
the emission stream does not contain organic compounds. If supplemental 
gases are introduced before the control device, the monitored 
concentration shall be corrected as specified in Sec. 63.1365(a)(7).
    (6) Exceedances of operating parameters. An exceedance of an 
operating parameter is defined as one of the following:
    (i) If the parameter level, averaged over the operating day or 
block, is below a minimum value established during the initial 
compliance demonstration.
    (ii) If the parameter level, averaged over the operating day or 
block, is above the maximum value established during the initial 
compliance demonstration.
    (iii) A loss of all pilot flames for a flare during an operating day 
or block. Multiple losses of all pilot flames during an operating day 
constitutes one exceedance.

[[Page 421]]

greater in an operating day or block and monitoring data are 
insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as defined in paragraph 
(b)(7)(iii) of this section, for at least 75 percent of the operating 
hours.
    (ii) When the period of control device operation is less than 4 
hours in an operating day or block and more than 1 of the hours during 
the period of operation does not constitute a valid hour of data due to 
insufficient monitoring data.
    (iii) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of

episodes occurring more than once per day, exceedances of established 
parameter limits or excursions will result in no more than one violation 
per operating day for each monitored item of equipment utilized in the 
process.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, for 
control devices used for more than one process in the course of an 
operating day, exceedances or excursions will result in no more than one 
violation per operating day, per control device, for each process for 
which the control device is in service.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, 
exceedances of the 20 ppmv TOC outlet emission limit, averaged over the 
operating day, will result in no more than one violation per day per 
control device. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this

parameter values as well as periods of inadequate monitoring data do not 
constitute a violation if they occur during a startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction, and the facility follows its startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan.
    (c) Monitoring for uncontrolled emission rates. The owner or 
operator shall demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limit 
in Sec. 63.1362 (b)(2)(i) or (b)(4)(i) by calculating daily a 365-day 
rolling summation of uncontrolled emissions based on the uncontrolled 
emissions per emission episode, as calculated using the procedures in 
Sec. 63.1365(c)(2), and records of the number of batches produced. Each 
day that the summation for a process exceeds 0.15 Mg/yr is considered a 
violation of the emission limit.

(annual rolling average calculated every 30 days). A process with both 
batch and continuous operations is considered a continuous process for 
the purposes of this section.
    (iii) For batch processes, the annual factors shall be calculated 
every 10 batches for the 12-month period preceding the 10th batch 
(annual rolling average calculated every 10 batches). Additional annual 
factors shall be calculated every 12 months during the period before the 
10th batch if more than 12 months elapse before the 10th batch is 
produced.
    (2) Violations. Each rolling average that exceeds the target value 
established in Sec. 63.1365(g)(3) is considered a violation of the 
emission limit.

<R05>
Sec. 63.1381  Definitions.

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 
Sec. 63.2, or in this section as follows:
    Bag leak detection system means systems that include, but are not 
limited to, devices using triboelectric, light scattering, and other 
effects to monitor relative or absolute particulate matter (PM) 
emissions.

has been applied.
    Building insulation means bonded wool fiberglass insulation, having 
a loss on ignition of less than 8 percent and a density of less than 32 
kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m<SUP>3</SUP>) (2 pounds per cubic foot 
[lb/ft<SUP>3</SUP>]).
    Cold top electric furnace means an all-electric glass-melting 
furnace that operates with a temperature of 120  deg.C (250  deg.F) or 
less as measured at a location 46 to 61 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) 
above the molten glass surface.
    Flame attenuation means a process used to produce wool fiberglass 
where molten glass flows by gravity from melting furnaces, or pots, to 
form filaments that are drawn down and attenuated by passing in front of 
a high-velocity gas burner flame.
    Glass-melting furnace means a unit comprising a refractory vessel in 
which raw materials are charged, melted at high temperature, refined, 
and conditioned to produce molten glass. The

[[Page 434]]

unit includes foundations, superstructure and retaining walls, raw 
material charger systems, heat exchangers, melter cooling system, 
exhaust system, refractory brick work, fuel supply and electrical 
boosting equipment, integral control systems and instrumentation, and 
appendages for conditioning and distributing molten glass to forming 
processes. The forming apparatus, including flow channels, is not 
considered part of the glass-melting furnace.
    Glass pull rate means the mass of molten glass that is produced by a 
single glass-melting furnace or that is used in the manufacture of wool 
fiberglass at a single manufacturing line in a specified time period.
    Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) means any air pollutant listed in or 
pursuant to section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act.
    Heavy-density product means bonded wool fiberglass insulation 
manufactured on a flame attenuation manufacturing line and having a loss 
on ignition of 11 to 25 percent and a density of 8 to 48 kg/m\3\ (0.5 to

production of wool fiberglass that consists of a forming section where 
molten glass is fiberized and a fiberglass mat is formed and which may 
include a curing section where binder resin in the mat is thermally set 
and a cooling section where the mat is cooled.
    New source means any affected source the construction or 
reconstruction of which is commenced after March 31, 1997.
    Pipe product means bonded wool fiberglass insulation manufactured on 
a flame attenuation manufacturing line and having a loss on ignition of

    Rotary spin means a process used to produce wool fiberglass building 
insulation by forcing molten glass through numerous small orifices in 
the side wall of a spinner to form continuous glass fibers that are then 
broken into discrete lengths by high-velocity air flow. Any process used 
to produce bonded wool fiberglass building insulation by a process other 
than flame attenuation is considered rotary spin.
    Wool fiberglass means insulation materials composed of glass fibers 
made from glass produced or melted at the same facility where the 
manufacturing line is located.

 Appendix A to Subpart NNN of Part 63--Method for the Determination of 
                                   LOI

                               1. Purpose

    The purpose of this test is to determine the LOI of cured blanket 
insulation. The method is applicable to all cured board and blanket 
products.

                              2. Equipment

    2.1  Scale sensitive to 0.1 gram.
    2.2  Furnace designed to heat to at least 540  deg.C (1,000  deg.F) 
and controllable to <plus-minus>10  deg.C (50  deg.F).
    2.3  Wire tray for holding specimen while in furnace.

                              3. Procedure

    3.1  Cut a strip along the entire width of the product that will 
weigh at least 10.0 grams. Sample should be free of dirt or foreign 
matter.

    Note: Remove all facing from sample.

    3.2  Cut the sample into pieces approximately 12 inches long, weigh 
to the nearest 0.1 gram and record. Place in wire tray. Sample should 
not be compressed or overhang on tray edges.

    Note: On air duct products, remove shiplaps and overspray.

    3.3  Place specimen in furnace at 540  deg.C (1,000  deg.F), 
<plus-minus>10  deg.C (50  deg.F) for 15 to 20 minutes to insure 
complete oxidation. After ignition, fibers should be white and should 
not be fused together.
    3.4  Remove specimen from the furnace and cool to room temperature.
    3.5  Weigh cooled specimen and wire tray to the nearest 0.1 gram. 
Deduct the weight of the wire tray and then calculate the loss in weight 
as a percent of the original specimen weight.

  Appendix B to Subpart NNN of Part 63--Free Formaldehyde Analysis of 
            Insulation Resins by Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride

                                1. Scope

    This method was specifically developed for water-soluble phenolic 
resins that have a relatively high free-formaldehyde (FF) content such 
as insulation resins. It may also be suitable for other phenolic resins, 
especially those with a high FF content.

                              2. Principle

    2.1  a. The basis for this method is the titration of the 
hydrochloric acid that is liberated when hydroxylamine hydrochloride 
reacts with formaldehyde to form formaldoxine:

HCHO + NH2OH:HCl <r-arrow> CH2:NOH + H2O + HCl

    b. Free formaldehyde in phenolic resins is present as monomeric 
formaldehyde, hemiformals, polyoxymethylene hemiformals, and 
polyoxymethylene glycols. Monomeric formaldehyde and hemiformals react 
rapidly with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, but the polymeric forms of 
formaldehyde must hydrolyze to the monomeric state before they can 
react. The greater the concentration of free formaldehyde in a resin, 
the more of that formaldehyde will be in the polymeric form. The 
hydrolysis of these polymers is catalyzed by hydrogen ions.
    2.2  The resin sample being analyzed must contain enough free 
formaldehyde so that the initial reaction with hydroxylamine 
hydrochloride will produce sufficient hydrogen ions to catalyze the 
depolymerization of the polymeric formaldehyde within the time limits of 
the test method. The sample should contain approximately 0.3 grams free 
formaldehyde to ensure complete reaction within 5 minutes.

                              3. Apparatus

    3.1  Balance, readable to 0.01 g or better.
    3.2  pH meter, standardized to pH 4.0 with pH 4.0 buffer and pH 7 
with pH 7.0 buffer.
    3.3  50-mL burette for 1.0 N sodium hydroxide.
    3.4  Magnetic stirrer and stir bars.
    3.5  250-mL beaker.
    3.6  50-mL graduated cylinder.
    3.7  100-mL graduated cylinder.
    3.8  Timer.

                               4. Reagents

    4.1  Standardized 1.0 N sodium hydroxide solution.
    4.2  Hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution, 100 grams per liter, pH 
adjusted to 4.00.
    4.3  Hydrochloric acid solution, 1.0 N and 0.1 N.
    4.4  Sodium hydroxide solution, 0.1 N.
    4.5  50/50 v/v mixture of distilled water and methyl alcohol.

                              5. Procedure

    5.1  Determine the sample size as follows:
    a. If the expected FF is greater than 2 percent, go to Part A to 
determine sample size.
    b. If the expected FF is less than 2 percent, go to Part B to 
determine sample size.
    c. Part A: Expected FF <gr-thn-eq> 2 percent.

Grams resin = 60/expected percent FF

    i. The following table shows example levels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Sample
                Expected % free formaldehyde                 size, grams
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2..........................................................         30.0
5..........................................................         12.0
8..........................................................          7.5

[[Page 449]]

 
15.........................................................          4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ii. It is very important to the accuracy of the results that the 
sample size be chosen correctly. If the milliliters of titrant are less 
than 15 mL or greater than 30 mL, reestimate the needed sample size and 
repeat the tests.
    d. Part B: Expected FF  2 percent

Grams resin = 30/expected percent FF

    i. The following table shows example levels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Sample
                Expected % free formaldehyde                 size, grams

1..........................................................           30
0.5........................................................           60
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ii. If the milliliters of titrant are less than 5 mL or greater than 
30 mL, reestimate the needed sample size and repeat the tests.
    5.2  Weigh the resin sample to the nearest 0.01 grams into a 250-mL 
beaker. Record sample weight.
    5.3  Add 100 mL of the methanol/water mixture and stir on a magnetic 
stirrer. Confirm that the resin has dissolved.
    5.4  Adjust the resin/solvent solution to pH 4.0, using the 
prestandardized pH meter, 1.0 N hydrochloric acid, 0.1 N hydrochloric 
acid, and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide.
    5.5  Add 50 mL of the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution, measured 
with a graduated cylinder. Start the timer.
    5.6  Stir for 5 minutes. Titrate to pH 4.0 with standardized 1.0 N 
sodium hydroxide. Record the milliliters of titrant and the normality.

    (5) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that 
contain no organic HAP and/or organic HAP as impurities only;
    (6) Equipment that is intended to operate in organic HAP service for 
less than 300 hours during the calendar year;
    (7) Each waste management unit; and
    (8) Maintenance wastewater.
    (c) Existing affected source. The affected source to which the 
existing source provisions of this subpart apply is defined in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (d) New affected source. The affected source to which the new source 
provisions of this subpart apply is:
    (1) Each affected source defined in paragraph (b) of this section 
that commences construction or reconstruction after December 14, 1998;
    (2) Each additional group of one or more APPU and associated heat 
exchange systems that has the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more 
of any organic HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of 
organic HAP that commences construction after December 14, 1998; or
    (3) Each group of one or more process units and associated heat 
exchange systems that are converted to APPUs after December 14, 1998, 
that has the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more of any organic 
HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of organic HAP.
    (e) APPUs without organic HAP. An APPU that is part of an affected 
source, as defined in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, but that 
does not use or manufacture any organic HAP, is not subject to any other 
provisions of this subpart and is not required to comply with the 
provisions of subpart A of this part. When requested by the 
Administrator, the owner or operator shall demonstrate that the APPU 
does not use or manufacture any organic HAP. Types of information that 
could document this determination include, but are not limited to, 
records of chemicals purchased for the process, analyses of process 
stream composition, engineering calculations, or process knowledge.
    (f) Exemption from equipment leak provisions. Affected sources with 
actual annual production of amino/phenolic resin equal to or less than 
800 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) for the 12-month period preceding 
December 14, 1998 are exempt from the equipment leak provisions 
specified in Sec. 63.1410. The owner or operator utilizing this 
exemption shall recheck the actual annual production of amino/phenolic 
resins for each 12-month period following December 14, 1998. The 
beginning of each 12-month period shall be the anniversary of December 
14, 1998. If the actual annual production of amino/phenolic resins is 
greater than 800 Mg/yr for any 12-month period, the owner or operator 
shall comply with Sec. 63.1410 for the life of the affected source or 
until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this 
subpart.
    (g) Primary product determination and applicability. For purposes of 
this paragraph, amino resins and phenolic resins shall be considered to 
be the same product and production time or production mass of amino and 
phenolic resins shall be combined for purposes of determining the 
primary product under this paragraph (g). If the owner or operator 
determines that a process unit is not an APPU under paragraphs (g)(1) 
through (4) of this section, the owner or operator shall, when requested 
by the Administrator, demonstrate that the process unit is not an APPU.
    (1) Applicability determinations for process units producing 
multiple products. A process unit that produces more than one intended 
product at the same time is an APPU if amino/phenolic resin production 
accounts for the greatest percent of the annual design capacity on a 
mass basis. If a process unit has the same annual design capacity on a 
mass basis for two or more products, the

[[Page 451]]

process unit shall be an APPU if amino/phenolic resins are one of those 
products.
    (2) Flexible operations process unit determination based on 
operating time. A flexible operations process unit is an APPU if amino/
phenolic resins will be produced for the greatest operating time over 
the 5 years following December 14, 1998 at existing process units, or 
for the first year after the process unit begins production of any 
product for new process units.
    (3) Flexible operations process unit determination based on mass 
production basis. A flexible operations process unit that will 
manufacture multiple products equally based on operating time is an APPU 
if amino/phenolic resins account for the greatest percentage of the 
expected production on a mass basis over the 5 years following December 
14, 1998 at existing process units, or for the first year after the 
process unit begins production of any product for new process units.
    (4) Flexible operations process unit default determination. If the 
owner or operator cannot determine whether or not amino/phenolic resins 
are the primary product of a flexible operations process unit in 
accordance with paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section, the flexible 
operations process unit shall be designated as an APPU if amino/phenolic 
resins were produced for 5 percent or greater of the total operating 
time since December 14, 1998 for existing process units. The flexible 
operations process unit shall be designated as an APPU if the owner or 
operator anticipates that amino/phenolic resins will be manufactured in 
the flexible operations process unit at any time in the first year after 
the date the unit begins production of any product for new process 
units.
    (5) Annual applicability determination for non-APPUs that have 
produced amino/phenolic resins. Once per year beginning December 14, 
2003, the owner or operator of each flexible operations process unit 
that is not designated as an APPU, but that has produced amino/phenolic 
resins at any time in the preceding 5-year period or since the date that 
the unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall 
perform an evaluation to determine whether the process unit has become 
an APPU. A flexible operations process unit has become an APPU if amino/
phenolic resins were produced for the greatest operating time over the 
preceding 5-year period or since the date that the process unit began 
production of any product, whichever is shorter.
    (6) Applicability determination for non-APPUs that have not produced 
amino/phenolic resins. The owner or operator that anticipates the 
production of amino/phenolic resins in a process unit that is not 
designated as an APPU, and in which no amino/phenolic resins have been 
produced in the previous 5-year period or since the date that the 
process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, 
shall determine if the process unit will become an APPU. The owner or 
operator shall use the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of 
this section to determine if the process unit is designated as an APPU, 
with the following exception: for existing process units, production 
shall be projected for the 5 years following the date that the owner or 
operator anticipates initiating the production of amino/phenolic resins, 
instead of the 5 years following December 14, 1998.
    (7) Redetermination of applicability to APPU that are flexible 
operations process units. Whenever changes in production occur that 
could reasonably be expected to cause a flexible operations process unit 
to no longer be an APPU (i.e., amino/phenolic resins will no longer be 
the primary product according to the determination procedures in 
paragraphs (g)(2) through (4) of this section), the owner or operator 
shall reevaluate the status of the process unit as an APPU. A flexible 
operations process unit has ceased to be an APPU subject to this subpart 
if the following criteria are met:
    (i) If amino/phenolic resins were not produced for the greatest 
operating time over the preceding 5-year period or since the date that 
the process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter;
    (ii) If the new primary product, which is not amino/phenolic resins, 
is subject to another subpart of this part; and

[[Page 452]]

    (iii) If the owner or operator has notified the Administrator of the 
pending change in status for the flexible operations process unit, as 
specified in Sec. 63.1417(h)(4).
    (8) APPU terminating production of all amino/phenolic resins. If an 
APPU terminates the production of all amino/phenolic resins and does not 
anticipate the production of any amino/phenolic resins in the future, 
the process unit is no longer an APPU and is not subject to this subpart 
after notification is made to the Administrator, as specified in 
Sec. 63.1417(h)(4).
    (h) Storage vessel applicability determination. The owner or 
operator of a storage vessel at a new affected source shall determine 
assignment to a process unit as follows:
    (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 
part 63 on January 20, 2000, said storage vessel shall continue to be 
assigned to the process unit subject to the other subpart.
    (2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.
    (3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit located on the 
same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into 
or output from the storage vessel (i.e., said process unit has the 
predominant use of the storage vessel).
    (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units, and if one or more of those process 
units is an APPU subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be 
assigned to any of the APPUs.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to 
year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the use as 
follows:
    (i) For existing affected sources, use shall be determined based on 
the following:
    (A) The year preceding January 20, 2000; or
    (B) The expected use for the 5 years following January 20, 2000.
    (ii) For new affected sources, use shall be determined based on the 
first 5 years after initial start-up.
    (7) Where the storage vessel is located in a tank farm (including a 
marine tank farm), the assignment of the storage vessel shall be 
determined according to paragraphs (h)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section. 
Only those storage vessels where a portion or all of the input into or 
output from the storage vessel is hardpiped directly to one or more 
process units are covered by this paragraph.
    (i) The storage vessel is assigned to a process unit if the product 
or raw material entering or leaving the process unit flows directly into 
(or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm without passing through 
any intervening storage vessel. An intervening storage vessel means a 
storage vessel connected by hardpiping both to the process unit and to 
the storage vessel in the tank farm.
    (ii) If there are two or more process units that meet the criteria 
of paragraph (h)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, 
the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those process units 
according to the provisions of paragraphs (h)(3) through (6) of this 
section.
    (8) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) a process unit that was not included in the initial 
determination, or ceases to receive material from (or send material to) 
a process unit, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability 
of this subpart to the storage vessel according to the procedures in 
paragraphs (h)(3) through (7) of this section.
    (i) Applicability of other subparts to this subpart. Paragraphs 
(i)(1) through (5) describe the applicability of other subparts to this 
subpart.
    (1) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage 
vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart 
that is also subject to and complying with the provisions of 40 CFR part 
60, subpart Kb, shall continue to comply with 40 CFR part 60, subpart 
Kb. After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage 
vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart 
that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, 
but the

[[Page 453]]

owner or operator has not been required to apply controls as part of 
complying with 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, is required to comply only 
with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates 
specified in this section, said storage vessel shall no longer be 
subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb.
    (2) Affected sources subject to this subpart that are also subject 
to the provisions of subpart Q of this part shall comply with both 
subparts.
    (3) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an 
affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the 
provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, or the provisions of subpart H 
of this part, is required to comply only with the provisions of this 
subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said 
source shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, or 
subpart H of this part, as appropriate.
    (4) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, 
if a heat exchange system subject to this subpart is also subject to a 
standard identified in paragraph (i)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, 
compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in 
paragraph (i)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance 
with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that heat 
exchange system.
    (i) Subpart F of this part.
    (ii) A subpart of this part that requires compliance with 
Sec. 63.104 (e.g., subpart U of this part).
    (5) After the compliance dates specified in this subpart, if any 
combustion device, recovery device or recapture device subject to this 
subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements in 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, or CC, or is subject 
to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 265, 
subparts AA, BB, or CC, and the owner or operator complies with the 
periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, 
or CC, that would apply to the device if the facility had final-
permitted status, the owner or operator may elect to comply either with 
the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this 
subpart, or with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in this 
paragraph, which shall constitute compliance with the monitoring, 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart. If the owner 
or operator elects to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, the owner or 
operator shall report all information required by Sec. 63.1417(f), 
Periodic Reports, as part of complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 
parts 264 and/or 265.
    (j) Applicability of General Provisions. Table 1 of this subpart 
specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply and do not 
apply to owners and operators of affected sources subject to this 
subpart.
    (k) Applicability of this subpart during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation. Paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) 
of this section shall be followed during periods of start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or non-operation of the affected source or any part 
thereof.
    (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the 
emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all 
times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or 
specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to 
which this subpart applies. The emission limitations of this subpart and 
the emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall not apply 
during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction. During periods of 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, the owner or operator shall follow 
the applicable provisions of the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction 
plan required by Sec. 63.6(e)(3). However, if a start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or period of non-operation of one portion of an affected 
source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to 
comply with the emission limitations to which it is subject, then that 
emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable 
emission limitations of this subpart during the start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or period of non-operation. For example, if there is an 
overpressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel that is part of the 
affected

[[Page 454]]

source would still be required to be controlled in accordance with 
Sec. 63.1404.
    (2) The emission limitations set forth in 40 CFR part 63, subpart 
UU, as referred to in Sec. 63.1410, shall apply at all times except 
during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific 
portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized 
resulting in cessation of the emissions to which Sec. 63.1410 applies, 
or during periods of start-up, shutdown, malfuncton, or process unit 
shutdown. During periods of start-up, shutdown, malfunction, or process 
unit shutdown, the owner or operator shall follow the applicable 
provisions of the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by 
Sec. 63.6(e)(3).
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction; or during times when 
emissions are being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown 
would contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items 
of equipment. This paragraph does not apply if the item of equipment is 
malfunctioning. This paragraph also does not apply if the owner or 
operator shuts down the compliance equipment (other than monitoring 
systems) to avoid damage due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or 
malfunction of the affected source or portion thereof. If the owner or 
operator has reason to believe that monitoring equipment would be 
damaged due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of 
the affected source or portion thereof, the owner or operator shall 
provide documentation supporting such a claim in the Precompliance 
Report as provided in Sec. 63.1417(d)(9) or in a supplement to the 
Precompliance Report. Once approved by the Administrator in accordance 
with Sec. 63.1417(d)(9), the provision for ceasing to collect, during a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data that would otherwise 
be required by the provisions of this subpart shall be incorporated into 
the start-up, shutdown, malfunction plan for the affected source, as 
stated in paragraph (k) of this section.
    (4) During start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (k)(1) 
through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to 
the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions to the extent practical. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``excess emissions'' means emissions in excess of those that would 
have occurred if there were no start-up, shutdown, or malfunction and 
the owner or operator complied with the relevant provisions of this 
subpart. The measures to be taken shall be identified in the applicable 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and may include, but are not 
limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, 
work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the 
manner of operation of the affected source. Back-up control devices are 
not required, but may be used if available.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1401  Compliance schedule.

    (a) New affected sources that commence construction or 
reconstruction after December 14, 1998, shall be in compliance with this 
subpart upon initial start-up or January 20, 2000, whichever is later.
    (b) Existing affected sources shall be in compliance with this 
subpart no later than 3 years after January 20, 2000.
    (c) If an affected source using the exemption provided in 
Sec. 63.1400(f) has an actual annual production of amino/phenolic resins 
exceeding 800 Mg/yr for any 12-month period, the owner or operator shall 
comply with the provisions of Sec. 63.1410 for the affected source 
within 3 years. The starting point for the 3-year compliance time period 
shall be the end of the 12-month period in which actual annual 
production for amino/phenolic resins exceeds 800 Mg/yr.
    (d) Pursuant to section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act, an owner 
or operator may request an extension allowing the existing affected 
source up to 1 additional year to comply with section 112(d) standards. 
For purposes of this subpart, a request for an extension shall be 
submitted to the permitting

[[Page 455]]

authority as part of the operating permit application or to the 
Administrator as a separate submittal or as part of the Precompliance 
Report.
    (1) Requests for extensions shall be submitted no later than 120 
days prior to the compliance dates specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section and shall include the data described in 
Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D). The dates specified in Sec. 63.6(i) 
for submittal of requests for extensions shall not apply to this 
subpart.
    (2) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request 
less than 120 days prior to the compliance dates specified in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section provided that the need for the compliance 
extension arose after that date, and the need arose due to circumstances 
beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This request shall 
include, in addition to the information specified in 
Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D), a statement of the reasons 
additional time is needed and the date when the owner or operator first 
learned of the circumstances necessitating a request for compliance 
extension.
    (e) All terms in this subpart that define a period of time for 
completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual), 
unless specified otherwise, refer to the standard calendar periods.
    (1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in this subpart for 
completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as 
specified in subpart A of this part (e.g., a period could begin on the 
compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the 
standard calendar period). For each time period that is changed by 
agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is 
changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.
    (2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar 
period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the 
period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified 
in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate:
    (i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard 
calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there 
remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 
2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for 
tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for 
tasks that must be performed annually; or
    (ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end 
of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which 
the initial compliance deadline occurs.
    (3) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires 
completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an 
owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the 
specified period, provided that the task is conducted at a reasonable 
interval after completion of the task during the previous period.

and in this section, it shall have the meaning given in this section for 
purposes of this subpart.
    Aggregate batch vent stream means a process vent containing 
emissions from at least one reactor batch process vent and at least one 
additional reactor or non-reactor batch process vent where the emissions 
are ducted, hardpiped, or otherwise connected together for a continuous 
flow.
    Amino resin means a thermoset resin produced through the reaction of 
formaldehyde, or a formaldehyde containing solution (e.g., aqueous 
formaldehyde), with compound(s) that contain the amino group; these 
compounds include melamine, urea, and urea derivatives. Formaldehyde 
substitutes are exclusively aldehydes.
    Amino/phenolic resin means one or both of the following:
    (1) Amino resin; or
    (2) Phenolic resin.
    Amino/phenolic resin. Process unit (APPU) means a collection of 
equipment assembled and connected by hardpiping or ductwork used to 
process raw materials and to manufacture an amino/phenolic resin as its 
primary product. This collection of equipment includes unit operations; 
process vents; storage vessels, as determined in Sec. 63.1400(h); and 
the equipment that is subject to the equipment leak provisions as 
specified in Sec. 63.1410. Utilities, lines and equipment not containing 
process fluids, and other non-process lines, such as heating and cooling 
systems which do not combine their materials with those in the processes 
they serve, are not part of the amino/phenolic resin process unit. An 
amino/phenolic resin process unit consists of more than one unit 
operation.
    Batch cycle means the operational step or steps, from start to 
finish, that occur as part of a batch unit operation.
    Batch emission episode means a discrete emission venting episode 
associated with a single batch unit operation. Multiple batch emission 
episodes may occur from a single batch unit operation.
    Batch mode means the discontinuous bulk movement of material through 
a unit operation. Mass, temperature, concentration, and other properties 
may vary with time. For a unit operation operated in a batch mode (i.e., 
batch unit operation), the addition of material and withdrawal of 
material do not typically occur simultaneously.
    Batch process vent means a process vent from a batch unit operation 
within an affected source. Batch process vents are either reactor batch 
process vents or non-reactor batch process vents.
    Batch unit operation means a unit operation operated in a batch 
mode.
    Block means the time period that comprises a single batch cycle.
    Combustion device burner means a device designed to mix and ignite 
fuel and air to provide a flame to heat and

[[Page 457]]

oxidize waste organic vapors in a combustion device.
    Continuous mode means the continuous movement of material through a 
unit operation. Mass, temperature, concentration, and other properties 
typically approach steady-state conditions. For a unit operation 
operated in a continuous mode (i.e., continuous unit operation), the 
simultaneous addition of raw material and withdrawal of product is 
typical.
    Continuous process vent means a process vent from a continuous unit 
operation within an affected source. Process vents that are serving as 
control devices are not subject to additional control requirements.
    Continuous record means documentation, either in hard copy or 
computer readable form, of data values measured at least once every 15 
minutes and recorded at the frequency specified in Sec. 63.1416(c) or 
(h).
    Continuous recorder means a data recording device that either 
records an instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes or 
records 1 hour or more frequent block average values.
    Continuous unit operation means a unit operation operated in a 
continuous mode.
    Control device means any combustion device, recovery device, or 
recapture device. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, 
absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, incinerators, flares, boilers, 
and process heaters. For continuous process vents, recapture devices are 
considered control devices but recovery devices are not considered 
control devices. Condensers operating as process condensers are not 
considered control devices. For a condenser that sometimes operates as a 
process condenser to be considered a control device, it shall not be 
operating as a process condenser for a given batch emission episode, and 
it shall recycle of the recovered material within the process.
    Control technology means any process modification or use of 
equipment that reduces organic HAP emissions. Examples include, but are 
not limited to, product reformulation to reduce solvent content and/or 
use, batch cycle time reduction to reduce the duration of emissions, 
reduction of nitrogen purge rate, and the lowering of process condenser 
coolant temperatures.
    Controlled organic HAP emissions means the quantity of organic HAP 
discharged to the atmosphere from a control device.
    Emission point means an individual continuous process vent, batch 
process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, storage vessel, equipment 
leak, or heat exchange system.
    Equipment means , for the purposes of the provisions in 
Sec. 63.1410, each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, 
sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, 
and instrumentation system in organic HAP service; and any control 
devices or systems required by Sec. 63.1410. For purposes of this 
subpart, surge control vessels and bottom receivers are not equipment 
for purposes of regulating equipment leak emissions. Surge control 
vessels and bottoms receivers are regulated as non-reactor batch process 
vents for the purposes of this subpart.
    Equipment leak means emissions of organic HAP from a pump, 
compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection 
system, open-ended valve or line, valve, or instrumentation system that 
either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) that is at least 5 
percent by weight of total organic HAP.
    Existing process unit means any process unit that is not a new 
process unit.
    Flexible operations process unit means a process unit that 
periodically manufactures different chemical products, polymers, or 
resins by alternating raw materials or operating conditions. These units 
are also referred to as campaign plants or blocked operations.
    Heat exchange system means any cooling tower system or once-through 
cooling water system (e.g., river or pond water) designed and intended 
to operate to not allow contact between the cooling medium and process 
fluid or gases (i.e., a noncontact system). A heat exchange system may 
include more than one heat exchanger and may include recirculating or 
once-through cooling systems.
    Highest-HAP recipe for a product means the recipe of the product 
with the highest total mass of organic HAP

[[Page 458]]

charged to the reactor during the production of a single batch of 
product.
    Initial start-up means the first time a new or reconstructed 
affected source begins production, or, for equipment added or changed, 
the first time the equipment is put into operation. Initial start-up 
does not include operation solely for testing equipment. Initial start-
up does not include subsequent start-ups of an affected source or 
portion thereof following malfunctions or shutdowns, or following 
changes in product for flexible operation process units, or following 
recharging of equipment in batch operation. Further, for purposes of 
Secs. 63.1401 and 63.1410, initial start-up does not include subsequent 
start-ups of affected sources or portions thereof following malfunctions 
or process unit shutdowns.
    Inprocess recycling means a recycling operation in which recovered 
material is used by a unit operation within the same affected source. It 
is not necessary for recovered material to be used by the unit operation 
from which they were recovered.
    Maintenance wastewater means wastewater generated by the draining of 
process fluid from components in the APPU into an individual drain 
system prior to or during maintenance activities. Maintenance wastewater 
can be generated during planned and unplanned shutdowns and during 
periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities that can 
generate maintenance wastewaters include descaling of heat exchanger 
tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, draining of low 
legs and high point bleeds, draining of pumps into an individual drain 
system, and draining of portions of the APPU for repair. The generation 
of wastewater from the routine rinsing or washing of equipment in batch 
operation between batches is not maintenance wastewater for the purposes 
of this subpart.
    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment or process 
equipment, or failure of a process to operate in a normal or usual 
manner, or opening of a safety device. Failures that are caused in part 
by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
    Maximum representative operating conditions means, for purposes of 
testing or measurements required by Sec. 63.1413, those conditions which 
reflect the highest organic HAP emissions reasonably expected to be 
vented to the control device or emitted to the atmosphere. For affected 
sources that produce the same product(s) using multiple recipes, the 
production of the highest-HAP recipe is reflective of maximum 
representative operating conditions.
    Maximum true vapor pressure means the equilibrium partial pressure 
exerted by the total organic HAP in the stored liquid at the temperature 
equal to the highest calendar-month average of the liquid storage 
temperature for liquids stored above or below the ambient temperature, 
or at the local maximum monthly average temperature as reported by the 
National Weather Service for liquids stored at the ambient temperature, 
as determined:
    (1) In accordance with methods described in American Petroleum 
Institute Publication 2517, Evaporative Loss From External Floating-Roof 
Tanks (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 63.14); or
    (2) As obtained from standard reference texts; or
    (3) As determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials 
Method D2879-83 (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 63.14); 
or
    (4) Any other method approved by the Administrator.
    Multicomponent system means, as used in conjunction with batch 
process vents, a stream whose liquid and/or vapor contains more than one 
compound.
    Net heating value means the difference between the heat value of the 
recovered chemical stream and the minimum heat value required to ensure 
a stable flame in the combustion device. This difference must have a 
positive value when used in the context of ``recovering chemicals for 
fuel value'' (e.g., in the definition of ``recovery device'' in this 
section).
    New process unit means a process unit for which the construction or 
reconstruction commenced after December 14, 1998.

[[Page 459]]

    Non-reactor batch process vent means a batch process vent 
originating from a unit operation other than a reactor. Non-reactor 
batch process vents include, but are not limited to, batch process vents 
from filter presses, surge control vessels, bottoms receivers, weigh 
tanks, and distillation systems.
    Non-solvent-based resin means an amino/phenolic resin manufactured 
without the use of a solvent as described in the definition of solvent-
based resin.
    On-site or On site means, with respect to records required to be 
maintained by this subpart or required by another subpart referenced by 
this subpart, records are stored at a location within a major source 
which encompasses the affected source. On-site includes, but is not 
limited to, storage at the affected source or APPU to which the records 
pertain, or storage in central files elsewhere at the major source.
    Operating day means the period defined by the owner or operator in 
the Notification of Compliance Status required by Sec. 63.1417(e). The 
operating day is the period for which daily average monitoring values 
and batch cycle daily average monitoring values are determined.
    Organic hazardous air pollutant(s) (organic HAP) means one or more 
of the chemicals listed in Table 2 of this subpart or any other chemical 
which is:
    (1) Knowingly produced or introduced into the manufacturing process 
other than as an impurity; and
    (2) Listed in Table 2 of subpart F of this part.
    Phenolic resin means a thermoset resin that is a condensation 
product of formaldehyde and phenol, or a formaldehyde substitute and/or 
a phenol substitute. Substitutes for formaldehyde are exclusively 
aldehydes and include acetaldehyde or furfuraldehyde. Substitutes for 
phenol include other phenolic starting compounds such as cresols, 
xylenols, p-tert-butylphenol, p-phenylphenol, nonylphenol, and 
resorcinols.
    Process condenser means a condenser functioning so as to recover 
material as an integral part of a unit operation(s). A process condenser 
shall support a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods of equipment 
operation that are at or above the boiling or bubble point of 
substance(s) at the liquid surface. Examples of process condensers 
include distillation condensers, reflux condensers, and condensers used 
in stripping or flashing operations. In a series of condensers, all 
condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas 
temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the substance(s) at the 
liquid surface are considered to be process condensers. All condensers 
in line prior to a vacuum source are considered process condensers when 
the vacuum source is being operated. A condenser may be a process 
condenser for some batch emission episodes and, when meeting certain 
conditions, may be a control device for other batch emission episodes.
    Process unit means a collection of equipment assembled and connected 
by hardpiping or ductwork used to process raw materials and to 
manufacture a product.
    Process vent means a gaseous emission stream from a unit operation 
where the gaseous emission stream is discharged to the atmosphere either 
directly or after passing through one or more control, recovery, or 
recapture devices. Unit operations that may have process vents are 
condensers, distillation units, reactors, or other unit operations 
within the APPU. Emission streams that are undiluted and uncontrolled 
containing less than 50 parts per million volume (ppmv) organic HAP, as 
determined through process knowledge that no organic HAP are present in 
the emission stream or using an engineering assessment as discussed in 
Sec. 63.1414(d)(6); test data using the test methods specified in 
Sec. 63.1414(a); or any other test method that has been validated 
according to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part are 
not considered process vents. Process vents exclude relief valve 
discharges, gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system(s), and leaks 
from equipment regulated under Sec. 63.1410. Process vents that are 
serving as control devices are not subject to additional control 
requirements.
    Product means a resin, produced using the same monomers and varying

[[Page 460]]

in additives (e.g., initiators, terminators, etc.), catalysts, or in the 
relative proportions of monomers, that is manufactured by a process 
unit. With respect to resins, more than one recipe may be used to 
produce the same product. Product also means a chemical that is not a 
resin that is manufactured by a process unit. By-products, isolated 
intermediates, impurities, wastes, and trace contaminants are not 
considered products.
    Reactor batch process vent means a batch process vent originating 
from a reactor.
    Recapture device means an individual unit of equipment capable of 
and used for the purpose of recovering chemicals, but not normally for 
use, reuse, or sale. For example, a recapture device may recover 
chemicals primarily for disposal. Recapture devices include, but are not 
limited to, absorbers, carbon adsorbers, and condensers.
    Recipe means a specific composition from among the range of possible 
compositions that may occur within a product, as defined in this 
section. A recipe is determined by the proportions of monomers and, if 
present, other reactants and additives that are used to make the recipe. 
For example, a methylated amino resin and a non-methylated amino resin 
are both different recipes of the same product, amino resin.
    Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and 
normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for use, reuse, 
fuel value (i.e., net heating value); or for sale for use, reuse, or 
fuel value (i.e., net heating value). Examples of equipment that may be 
recovery devices include absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, oil-
water separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices 
such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. For the 
purposes of the monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements of 
this subpart, recapture devices are considered recovery devices.
    Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief 
valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which 
functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent 
deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting 
gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions 
resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the 
purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine 
venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover 
such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this 
vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature 
fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position 
during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or 
another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting 
applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the 
owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable 
regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering 
codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of 
flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
    Shutdown means for purposes including, but not limited to, periodic 
maintenance, replacement of equipment, or repair, the cessation of 
operation of an affected source, an APPU(s) within an affected source, 
or equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, or the 
emptying or degassing of a storage vessel. For purposes of the batch 
process vent provisions in Secs. 63.1406 through 63.1408, the cessation 
of equipment in batch operations is not a shutdown, unless the equipment 
undergoes maintenance, is replaced, or is repaired.
    Solvent-based resin means an amino/phenolic resin that consumes a 
solvent (i.e., methanol, xylene) as a reactant in the resin producing 
reaction. The use of a solvent as a carrier (i.e., adding methanol to 
the product/water solution after the reaction is complete) does not meet 
this definition.
    Start-up means the setting into operation of an affected source, an 
APPU(s) within an affected source, a unit operation within an affected 
source, or equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, or a 
storage vessel after emptying and degassing. For both continuous and 
batch unit operations, start-up includes initial start-up and operation 
solely for testing equipment.

[[Page 461]]

For both continuous and batch unit operations, start-up does not include 
the recharging of equipment in batch operation. For continuous unit 
operations, start-up includes transitional conditions due to changes in 
product for flexible operation process units. For batch unit operations, 
start-up does not include transitional conditions due to changes in 
product for flexible operation process units.
    Steady-state conditions means that all variables (temperatures, 
pressures, volumes, flow rates, etc.) in a process do not vary 
significantly with time; minor fluctuations about constant mean values 
may occur.
    Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
liquids that contain one or more organic HAP. Storage vessels do not 
include:
    (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 
kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
    (3) Vessels with capacities smaller than 38 cubic meters;
    (4) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that 
contains no organic HAP and/or organic HAP as impurities only;
    (5) Wastewater storage tanks;
    (6) Surge control vessels or bottoms receivers; and
    (7) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling amino/phenolic 
resin.
    Supplemental combustion air means the air that is added to a vent 
stream after the vent stream leaves the unit operation. Air that is part 
of the vent stream as a result of the nature of the unit operation is 
not considered supplemental combustion air. Air required to operate 
combustion device burner(s) is not considered supplemental combustion 
air.
    Uncontrolled organic HAP emissions means the organic HAP emitted 
from a unit operation prior to introduction of the emission stream into 
a control device. Uncontrolled HAP emissions are determined after any 
condenser that is operating as a process condenser. If an emission 
stream is not routed to a control device, uncontrolled organic HAP 
emissions are those organic HAP emissions released to the atmosphere.
    Vent stream, as used in reference to batch process vents, aggregate 
batch vent streams, continuous process vents, and storage vessels, means 
the emissions from that emission point.
    Waste management unit means the equipment, structure(s), and/or 
device(s) used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of wastewater streams 
or residuals. Examples of waste management units include: wastewater 
tanks, surface impoundments, individual drain systems, and biological 
wastewater treatment units. Examples of equipment that may be waste 
management units include containers, air flotation units, oil-water 
separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such 
as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. If such 
equipment is used for recovery, then it is part of an APPU and is not a 
waste management unit.
    Wastewater is either a process wastewater or maintenance wastewater 
and means water that:
    (1) Contains either:
    (i) An annual average concentration of organic HAP, as indicated on 
Table 2 of this subpart, of at least 5 parts per million by weight and 
has an annual average flow rate of 0.02 liter per minute or greater; or
    (ii) An annual average concentration of organic HAP, as indicated on 
Table 2 of this subpart, of at least 10,000 parts per million by weight 
at any flow rate.
    (2) Is discarded from an APPU that is part of an affected source.
    (3) Does not include:
    (i) Stormwater from segregated sewers;
    (ii) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems in segregated 
sewers;
    (iii) Spills;
    (iv) Water from safety showers;
    (v) Water from testing of deluge systems; and
    (vi) Water from testing of firefighting systems.
    Wastewater stream means a stream that contains wastewater as defined 
in this section.

(e.g., emissions from continuous process vents, storage vessels, etc.) 
are combined at a new affected source, and at least one of the emission 
streams would be required by this subpart to apply controls in the 
absence of combination with other emission streams, the owner or 
operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) 
of this section, as appropriate.
    (1) For any combined vent stream that includes one or more aggregate 
batch vent streams, comply with the provisions for aggregate batch vent

exceptions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, 
owners or operators of APPUs that are flexible operations process units 
shall comply with the provisions of this subpart at all times, 
regardless of the product being manufactured. Once it has been 
determined that an emission point requires control during manufacture of 
amino/phenolic resins, that emission point shall be controlled at all 
times regardless of the product being manufactured.
    (1) When a flexible operations process unit is manufacturing a 
product in which no organic HAP are used or manufactured, the owner or 
operator is not required to comply with the provisions of this subpart 
or with the provisions of subpart A of this part during manufacture of 
that product. When requested by the Administrator, the owner or operator 
shall demonstrate that no organic HAP are used or manufactured.
    (2) When a flexible operations process unit is manufacturing a 
product subject to subpart GGG of this part, the owner or operator is

owner or operator shall identify which set of requirements are being 
followed and which set of requirements are being disregarded in the 
appropriate report.
    (2) Comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW 
(national emission standards for storage vessels (control level 2)). 
When complying with the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW, the

    (b) Alternative standard. Vent all organic HAP emissions from a 
storage vessel meeting either of the capacity and vapor pressure 
criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section to a combustion 
control device achieving an outlet organic HAP concentration of 20 ppmv 
or less or to a non-combustion control device achieving an outlet 
organic HAP concentration of 50 ppmv or less. Any storage vessels that 
are not vented to a control device meeting these conditions shall be 
controlled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) or (2) 
of this section.

Sec. 63.1409  Heat exchange system provisions.

    (a) Unless one or more of the conditions specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (6) of this section are met, owners and operators of 
sources subject to this subpart shall monitor each heat exchange system 
used to cool process equipment in an affected source, according to the

leak is detected, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (1) The heat exchange system is operated with the minimum pressure 
on the cooling water side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the 
maximum pressure on the process side.
    (2) There is an intervening cooling fluid, containing less than 5 
percent by weight of total HAP listed in column A of Table 2 of this 
subpart, between the process and the cooling water. This intervening 
fluid serves to isolate the cooling water from the process fluid, and 
the intervening fluid is not sent through a cooling tower or discharged.

[[Page 467]]

For purposes of this section, discharge does not include emptying for 
maintenance purposes.
    (3) The once-through heat exchange system is subject to a National 
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with an allowable 
discharge limit of 1 part per million or less above influent 
concentration or 10 percent or less above influent concentration, 
whichever is greater.
    (4) The once-through heat exchange system is subject to an NPDES 
permit that:
    (i) Requires monitoring of a parameter(s) or condition(s) to detect 
a leak of process fluids into cooling water;
    (ii) Specifies or includes the normal range of the parameter or 
condition;
    (iii) Requires monitoring for the parameters selected as leak 
indicators no less frequently than monthly for the first 6 months and 
quarterly thereafter; and
    (iv) Requires the owner or operator to report and correct leaks to 
the cooling water when the parameter or condition exceeds the normal 
range.

fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total HAP listed in 
column A of Table 2 of this subpart.
    (6) The once-through heat exchange system is used to cool process 
fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total HAP listed in 
column B of Table 2 of this subpart.
    (b) The owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirements 
of paragraph (a) of this section by monitoring the cooling water for the 
presence of one or more organic HAP or other representative substances 
whose presence in cooling water indicate a leak shall comply with the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section. 
The cooling water shall be monitored for total HAP, total volatile 
organic compounds, total organic carbon, one or more speciated HAP 
compounds, or other representative substances that would indicate the 
presence of a leak in the heat exchange system.
    (1) The cooling water shall be monitored monthly for the first 6 
months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.
    (2)(i) For recirculating heat exchange systems (cooling tower 
systems), the monitoring of speciated HAP or total HAP refers to the HAP 
listed in column A of Table 2 of this subpart.
    (ii) For once-through heat exchange systems, the monitoring of 
speciated HAP or total HAP refers to the HAP listed in column B of Table 
2 of this subpart.
    (3) The concentration of the monitored substance(s) in the cooling 
water shall be determined using any EPA-approved method listed in part 
136 of this chapter, as long as the method is sensitive to 
concentrations as low as 10 parts per million and the same method is 
used for both entrance and exit samples. Alternative methods may be used 
upon approval by the Administrator.
    (4) The samples shall be collected either at the entrance and exit 
of each heat exchange system or at locations where the cooling water 
enters and exits each heat exchanger or any combination of heat 
exchangers.
    (i) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of recirculating heat 
exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water 
leaves the cooling tower prior to being returned to the process 
equipment, and the exit is the point at which the cooling water is 
introduced to the cooling tower after being used to cool the process 
fluid.
    (ii) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of once-through heat 
exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water 
enters, and the exit is the point at which the cooling water exits the 
plant site or chemical manufacturing process units.
    (iii) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of each heat 
exchanger or any combination of heat exchangers, the entrance is the 
point at which the cooling water enters the individual heat exchanger or 
group of heat exchangers, and the exit is the point at which the cooling 
water exits the heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers.
    (5) A minimum of three sets of samples shall be taken at each 
entrance and exit as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The 
average entrance and exit concentrations shall then be calculated. The 
concentration shall be

[[Page 468]]

corrected for the addition of any makeup water or for any evaporative 
losses, as applicable.
    (6) A leak is detected if the exit mean concentration is found to be 
greater than the entrance mean concentration using a one-sided 
statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance, and the amount 
by which it is greater is at least 1 part per million or 10 percent of 
the entrance mean, whichever is greater.
    (c) The owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirement 
of paragraph (a) of this section by monitoring using a surrogate 
indicator of heat exchange system leaks shall comply with the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. 
Surrogate indicators that could be used to develop an acceptable 
monitoring program are ion specific electrode monitoring, pH, 
conductivity or other representative indicators.
    (1) The owner or operator shall prepare and implement a monitoring 
plan that documents the procedures that will be used to detect leaks of 
process fluids into cooling water. The plan shall require monitoring of 
one or more surrogate indicators or monitoring of one or more process 
parameters or other conditions that indicate a leak. Monitoring that is 
already being conducted for other purposes may be used to satisfy the 
requirements of this section. The plan shall include the information 
specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) A description of the parameter or condition to be monitored and 
an explanation of how the selected parameter or condition will reliably 
indicate the presence of a leak.
    (ii) The parameter level(s) or conditions(s) that constitute a leak. 
This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the 
selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The 
monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of 
parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the 
selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, a leak is 
indicated.
    (iii) The monitoring frequency which shall be no less frequent than 
monthly for the first 6 months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.
    (iv) The records that will be maintained to document compliance with 
the requirements of this section.
    (2) If a substantial leak is identified by methods other than those 
described in the monitoring plan and the method(s) specified in the plan 
could not detect the leak, the owner or operator shall revise the plan 
and document the basis for the changes. The owner or operator shall 
complete the revisions to the plan no later than 180 days after 
discovery of the leak.
    (3) The owner or operator shall maintain, at all times, the 
monitoring plan that is currently in use. The current plan shall be 
maintained on-site, or shall be accessible from a central location by 
computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. If the monitoring plan is superseded, the owner or operator 
shall retain the most recent superseded plan at least until 5 years from 
the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be retained on-site 
(or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that 
provides access within 2 hours after a request) for at least 6 months 
after its creation.
    (d) If a leak is detected according to the criteria of paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, except as 
provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (1) The leak shall be repaired as soon as practical but not later 
than 45 calendar days after the owner or operator receives results of 
monitoring tests indicating a leak. The leak shall be repaired unless 
the owner or operator demonstrates that the results are due to a 
condition other than a leak.
    (2) Once the leak has been repaired, the owner or operator shall 
confirm that the heat exchange system has been repaired within 7 
calendar days of the repair or startup, whichever is later.
    (e) Delay of repair of heat exchange systems for which leaks have 
been detected is allowed if the equipment is isolated from the process. 
Delay of repair is also allowed if repair is technically infeasible 
without a shutdown

[[Page 469]]

and any one of the conditions in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section 
are met. All time periods in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section 
shall be determined from the date when the owner or operator determines 
that delay of repair is necessary.
    (1) If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months, a special 
shutdown before that planned shutdown is not required.
    (2) If a shutdown is not expected within the next 2 months, the 
owner or operator may delay repair as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or 
(ii) of this section. Documentation of a decision to delay repair shall 
state the reasons repair was delayed and shall specify a schedule for 
completing the repair as soon as practical.
    (i) If a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the 
potential emissions from delaying repair, the owner or operator may 
delay repair until the next shutdown of the process equipment associated 
with the leaking heat exchanger. The owner or operator shall document 
the basis for the determination that a shutdown for repair would cause 
greater emissions than the emissions likely to result from delaying 
repair as specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) The owner or operator shall calculate the potential emissions 
from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of 
total HAP listed in column A of Table 2 of this subpart in the cooling 
water from the leaking heat exchanger by the flowrate of the cooling 
water from the leaking heat exchanger by the expected duration of the 
delay. The owner or operator may calculate potential emissions using 
total organic carbon concentration instead of total HAP listed in column 
A of Table 2 of this subpart.
    (B) The owner or operator shall determine emissions from purging and 
depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled 
shutdown for the repair.
    (ii) If repair is delayed for reasons other than those specified in 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may delay 
repair up to a maximum of 120 calendar days. The owner shall demonstrate 
that the necessary parts or personnel were not available.

greater and operates 300 hours per year or more. The weight-percent HAP 
is determined for equipment using the organic HAP concentration 
measurement methods specified in Sec. 63.1414(a). When complying with 
the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, as referred to by 40 CFR 
part 63, subpart UU, the following apply for purposes of this subpart:
    (a) Design evaluations are allowed for control devices that control 
emission points with total emissions less than 10 tons of organic HAP 
per year before control (i.e., small control devices).
    (b) When 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS refers to specific test methods 
for the measurement of organic HAP concentration, the test methods 
presented in Sec. 63.1414(a) shall be used.
    (c) The option to measure TOC instead of organic HAP, as a basis for 
demonstrating compliance, is not allowed.
    (d) Excused excursions are not allowed.
    (e) The provisions in Sec. 63.1403(b), rather than the provisions in 
Sec. 63.982(f), are to be followed for combined vent streams.

operator shall follow the guidance provided in this subpart for design 
evaluations or performance tests, as appropriate, and for monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting.
    (g) When there are conflicts between the due dates for reports 
presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and this subpart, reports shall 
be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.
    (h) When there are conflicts between the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and this subpart, 
the owner or operator shall either follow both sets of requirements 
(i.e., follow the requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS for 
emission points covered

[[Page 470]]

by 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and follow the requirements of this 
subpart for emission points covered by this subpart) or shall follow the 
set of requirements they prefer. If an owner or operator chooses to 
follow just one set of requirements, the owner or operator shall 
identify which set of requirements are being followed and which set of 
requirements are being disregarded in the appropriate report.

Sec. 63.1413  Compliance demonstration procedures.

    (a) General. For each emission point, the owner or operator shall 
meet three stages of compliance, with exceptions specified in this 
subpart. First, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test 
or design evaluation to demonstrate the performance of the control 
device or control technology being used. Second, the owner or operator 
shall meet the requirements for demonstrating initial compliance (e.g., 
a demonstration that the required percent reduction is achieved). Third, 
the owner or operator shall meet the requirements for demonstrating 
continuous compliance through some form of monitoring (e.g., continuous 
monitoring of operating parameters).
    (1) Large control devices and small control devices. A large control 
device is a control device that controls emission points with total 
emissions of 10 tons of organic HAP per year or more before control. A 
small control device is a control device that controls emission points 
with total emissions less than 10 tons of organic HAP per year before 
control.
    (i) Large control devices. Owners or operators are required to 
conduct a performance test for a large control device. The establishment 
of parameter monitoring levels shall be based on data obtained during 
the required performance test.
    (ii) Small control devices. Owners or operators are required to 
conduct a design evaluation for a small control device. An owner or 
operator may choose to conduct a performance test for a small control 
device and such a performance test shall follow the procedures specified 
in this section, as appropriate. Whenever a small control device becomes 
a large control device, the owner or operator shall conduct a 
performance test following the procedures specified in this section, as 
appropriate. Notification that such a performance test is required, the 
site-specific test plan, and the results of the performance test shall 
be provided to the Administrator as specified in Sec. 63.1417. Except as 
provided in Sec. 63.1415(a)(2), the parameter monitoring levels for 
small control devices shall be set based on the design evaluation 
required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Further, when setting the 
parameter monitoring level(s) based on the design evaluation, the owner 
or operator shall submit the information specified in Sec. 63.1417(d)(7) 
for review and approval as part of the Precompliance Report.
    (2) Performance tests. Performance testing shall be conducted in 
accordance with the General Provisions at Sec. 63.7(a)(1), (a)(3), (d), 
(e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(4), (g), and (h), with the exceptions specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Data shall be reduced in accordance 
with the EPA approved methods specified in this subpart or, if other 
test

[[Page 473]]

methods are used, the data and methods shall be validated according to 
the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of this part.
    (i) Additional control devices not requiring performance tests. An 
owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test when 
using one of the following control devices:
    (A) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 
44 megawatts or greater.
    (B) A boiler or process heater into which the vent stream is 
introduced with the primary fuel or is used as the primary fuel.
    (C) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the 
owner or operator:
    (1) Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and 
complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or
    (2) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 
40 CFR part 266, subpart H.
    (D) A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator 
has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with 
the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified 
compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, 
subpart O.
    (E) A control device for which a performance test was already 
conducted for determining compliance with another regulation promulgated 
by the EPA, provided the test was conducted using the same Methods 
specified in this section, and either no deliberate process changes have 
been made since the test, or the owner or operator can demonstrate that 
the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, 
reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. Parameter 
monitoring levels established based on such a performance test may be 
used for purposes of demonstrating continuous compliance with this 
subpart.
    (ii) Exceptions to performance test requirements in the General 
Provisions. (A) Performance tests shall be conducted at maximum 
representative operating conditions achievable during either the 6-month 
period ending 2 months before the Notification of Compliance Status 
required by Sec. 63.1417(e) is due, or during the 6-month period 
surrounding the date of the performance test (i.e., the period beginning 
3 months prior to the performance test and ending 3 months after the 
performance test). In achieving maximum representative operating 
conditions, an owner or operator is not required to cause damage to 
equipment, make a product that does not meet an existing specification 
for sale to a customer, or make a product in excess of demand.
    (B) When Sec. 63.7(g) references the Notification of Compliance 
Status requirements in Sec. 63.9(h), the requirements in Sec. 63.1417(e) 
shall apply for purposes of this subpart.
    (C) Performance tests shall be performed no later than 150 days 
after the compliance dates specified in this subpart (i.e., in time for 
the results to be included in the Notification of Compliance Status), 
rather than according to the time periods in Sec. 63.7(a)(2).
    (3) Design evaluations. To demonstrate the organic HAP removal 
efficiency for a control device or control technology, a design 
evaluation shall address the composition and organic HAP concentration 
of the vent stream(s) entering the control device or control technology, 
the operating parameters of the control device or control technology, 
and other conditions or parameters that reflect the performance of the 
control device or control technology. A design evaluation also shall 
address other vent stream characteristics and control device operating 
parameters as specified in any one of paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (vi) 
of this section, depending on the type of control device that is used. 
If the vent stream(s) is not the only inlet to the control device, the 
efficiency demonstration also shall consider all other vapors, gases, 
and liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device.
    (i) For a scrubber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent 
stream composition, constituent concentrations, liquid-to-vapor ratio, 
scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration, temperature, and the 
reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The 
design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream

[[Page 474]]

organic compound concentration level and include the additional 
information in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section for trays 
and a packed column scrubber:
    (A) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays; and
    (B) Type and total surface area of packing for entire column, and 
for individual packed sections if column contains more than one packed 
section.
    (ii) For a condenser, the design evaluation shall consider the vent 
stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish 
the design outlet organic HAP compound concentration level, design 
average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design 
average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and 
outlet. The temperature of the gas stream exiting the condenser shall be 
measured and used to establish the outlet organic HAP concentration.
    (iii) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed 
directly onsite in the control device, such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the 
design evaluation shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative 
humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent 
stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, 
number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of 
activated carbon used for carbon beds, design total regeneration stream 
mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed 
regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, 
design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of carbon. 
For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop shall be included.
    (iv) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the 
carbon bed directly onsite in the control device, such as a carbon 
canister, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream mass or 
volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall 
establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration 
level, capacity of carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated 
carbon used for carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based 
on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source 
operating schedule.
    (v) For an enclosed combustion device with a minimum residence time 
of 0.5 seconds and a minimum temperature of 760 C, the design evaluation 
shall document that these conditions exist.
    (vi) For a combustion control device that does not satisfy the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section, the design evaluation 
shall address the following characteristics, depending on the type of 
control device:
    (A) For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design evaluation shall 
consider the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, shall consider 
the vent stream flow rate, and shall establish the design minimum and 
average temperature in the combustion zone and the combustion zone 
residence time.
    (B) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design evaluation shall 
consider the vent stream flow rate and shall establish the design 
minimum and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and 
outlet.
    (C) For a boiler or process heater, the design evaluation shall 
consider the vent stream flow rate, shall establish the design minimum 
and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time, 
and shall describe the method and location where the vent stream is 
introduced into the flame zone.
    (4) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. The owner or 
operator of a control device that has one or more parameter monitoring 
level requirements specified under this subpart, or specified under 
subparts referenced by this subpart, shall establish a maximum or 
minimum level, as denoted on Table 4 of this subpart, for each measured 
parameter using the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) or (ii) 
of this section. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the owner 
or operator shall operate control devices such that the daily average, 
batch cycle daily average, or block average of monitored parameters, 
established as specified in this paragraph, remains above the minimum 
level or below the maximum level, as appropriate.

[[Page 475]]

    (i) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on 
performance tests. (A) Emission points other than batch process vents. 
During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be 
continuously monitored during the required 1-hour test runs. The 
monitoring level(s) shall then be established as the average of the 
maximum (or minimum) point values from the three test runs. The average 
of the maximum values shall be used when establishing a maximum level, 
and the average of the minimum values shall be used when establishing a 
minimum level.
    (B) Aggregate batch vent streams. For aggregate batch vent streams 
the monitoring level shall be established in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
    (C) Batch process vents. The monitoring level(s) shall be 
established using the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(C)(1) 
or (2) of this section. For batch process vents complying with the 
percent reduction standards specified in Sec. 63.1406 or Sec. 63.1407, 
parameter monitoring levels shall be established by the design 
evaluation, or during the performance test so that the specified percent 
reduction from Sec. 63.1406 or Sec. 63.1407, as appropriate, is met.
    (1) If more than one batch emission episode or more than one portion 
of a batch emission episode has been selected to be controlled, a single 
level for the batch cycle shall be calculated as follows:
    (i) During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter 
shall be monitored continuously and recorded once every 15 minutes at 
all times when batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, selected to 
be controlled are vented to the control device. A minimum of three 
recorded values shall be obtained for each batch emission episode, or 
portion thereof, regardless of the length of time emissions are 
occurring.
    (ii) The average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for 
each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, in the batch cycle 
selected to be controlled. The average shall be based on all values 
measured during the required performance test.
    (iii) If the level to be established is a maximum operating 
parameter, the level shall be defined as the minimum of the average 
parameter values from each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, 
in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the batch 
emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the lowest 
parameter value in order to assure compliance; the average parameter 
value that is necessary to assure compliance for that batch emission 
episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all batch emission 
episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle that are selected to 
be controlled).
    (iv) If the level to be established is a minimum operating 
parameter, the level shall be defined as the maximum of the average 
parameter values from each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, 
in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the batch 
emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the highest 
parameter value in order to assure compliance; the average parameter 
value that is necessary to assure compliance for that batch emission 
episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all batch emission 
episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle that are selected to 
be controlled).
    (v) Alternatively, an average monitored parameter value shall be 
calculated for the entire batch cycle based on all values recorded 
during each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be 
controlled.
    (2) Instead of establishing a single level for the batch cycle, as 
described in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C)(1) of this section, an owner or 
operator may establish separate levels for each batch emission episode, 
or portion thereof, selected to be controlled. Each level shall be 
determined as specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(C)(1)(i) through (v) of 
this section.
    (3) The batch cycle shall be defined in the Notification of 
Compliance Status, as specified in Sec. 63.1417(e)(2). Said definition 
shall include an identification of each batch emission episode. The 
definition of batch cycle shall also include the information required to 
determine parameter monitoring compliance for partial batch cycles 
(i.e., when part of

[[Page 476]]

a batch cycle is accomplished during 2 different operating days) for 
those parameters averaged on a batch cycle daily average basis.
    (ii) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on 
performance tests, engineering assessments, and/or manufacturer's 
recommendations. Parameter monitoring levels may be established based on 
the parameter values measured during the performance test supplemented 
by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. 
Performance testing is not required to be conducted over the entire 
range of expected parameter values. When setting the parameter 
monitoring level(s) using the procedures specified in this paragraph, 
the owner or operator shall submit the information specified in 
Sec. 63.1417(d)(7) for review and approval as part of the Precompliance 
Report.

Sec. 63.1406(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) or

[[Page 477]]

Sec. 63.1407(a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3)(ii) shall select portions of the batch 
process vent emissions (i.e., select batch emission episodes or portions 
of batch emission episodes) to be controlled such that the specified 
percent reduction is achieved for the batch cycle. Paragraphs (e)(1)(i) 
and (ii) of this section specify how the performance of a control device 
or control technology is to be determined. Paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this 
section specifies how to demonstrate that the required percent emission 
reduction is achieved for the batch cycle.
    (i) Design evaluation. The design evaluation shall comply with the 
provisions in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The design evaluation 
shall include the value(s) and basis for the parameter monitoring 
level(s) required by Sec. 63.1415. The design evaluation shall determine 
either of the following:
    (A) Each batch emission episode. The control device efficiency for 
each batch emission episode that the owner or operator selects to 
control.
    (B) One or more representative batch emission episodes. The control 
device efficiency for one or more batch emission episodes provided that 
the owner or operator demonstrates that the control device achieves the 
same or higher efficiency for all other batch emission episodes that the 
owner or operator selects to control.
    (ii) Performance test. An owner or operator shall conduct 
performance tests following the procedures in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section, the procedures in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, 
or a combination of the two procedures. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section, a performance test is conducted for each batch emission 
episode selected for control. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section, an owner or operator groups together several batch emission 
episodes and conducts a single performance test for the batch emission 
episode that is the most challenging, in terms of achieving emission 
reductions, for the control device or control technology; thereby 
demonstrating that the achieved emission reduction for the tested batch 
emission episode is the minimum control device or control technology 
performance expected for each batch emission episode in the group. An 
owner or operator may use the concept provided by paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for several different groups of batch 
emission episodes.
    (A) Testing each batch emission episode. A performance test shall be 
performed for each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, that the 
owner or operator selects to control. Performance tests shall be 
conducted using the testing procedures specified in Sec. 63.1414(a) and 
(b) and the following procedures:
    (1) Only one test (i.e., only one run) is required for each batch 
emission episode selected by the owner or operator for control.
    (2) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A)(3) of this 
section, the performance test shall be conducted over the entire period 
of emissions selected by the owner or operator for control.
    (3) An owner or operator may choose to test only those periods of 
the batch emission episode during which the emission rate for the entire 
batch emission episode can be determined or during which the organic HAP 
emissions are greater than the average emission rate of the batch 
emission episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options 
shall develop an emission profile illustrating the emission rate 
(kilogram per unit time) over the entire batch emission episode, based 
on either process knowledge or test data, to demonstrate that test 
periods are representative. Examples of information that could 
constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material 
balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used to 
develop the emission profile provided the results are still relevant to 
the current batch process vent conditions. The emission profile shall be 
included in the site-specific test plan required by Sec. 63.1417(h)(2).
    (4) When choosing sampling sites using the methods specified in 
Sec. 63.1414(a)(1), inlet sampling sites shall be located as specified 
in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)(A)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. Outlet 
sampling sites shall be located at the outlet of the control device 
prior to release to the atmosphere.
    (i) The control device inlet sampling site shall be located at the 
exit from

[[Page 478]]

the batch unit operation after any condensers operating as process 
condensers and before any control device.
    (ii) If a batch process vent is introduced with the combustion air 
or as a secondary fuel into a boiler or process heater with a design 
capacity less than 44 megawatts, selection of the location of the inlet 
sampling sites shall ensure the measurement of total organic HAP 
concentrations in all batch process vents and primary and secondary 
fuels introduced into the boiler or process heater.
    (B) Testing only the most challenging batch emission episode. Under 
this paragraph, an owner or operator groups together several batch 
emission episodes and conducts a single performance test for the batch 
emission episode that is the most challenging, in terms of achieving 
emission reductions, for the control device or control technology; 
thereby demonstrating that the achieved emission reduction for the 
tested batch emission episode is the minimum control device or control 
technology performance expected for each batch emission episode in the 
group. The owner or operator shall use the control device efficiency 
determined from the performance test for all the other batch emission 
episodes in that group for purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this 
section. Performance tests shall be conducted using the testing 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.1414(a) and (b) and the following 
procedures:
    (1) The procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A)(2) through 
(4) of this section.
    (2) Develop an emission profile illustrating the emission rate 
(kilogram/unit time) for each period of emissions to be addressed by the 
performance test. The emission profile shall be based on either process 
knowledge or test data. Examples of information that could constitute 
process knowledge include calculations based on material balances and 
process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used to develop the 
emission profile provided the results are still relevant to the current 
batch process vent conditions. The emission profile shall be included in 
the site-specific test plan required by Sec. 63.1417(h)(2).
    (3) Provide rationale for why the control device efficiency for all 
the other batch emission episodes in the group will be greater than or 
equal to the control device efficiency achieved during the tested period 
of the most challenging batch emission episode in the group, as 
specified in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by 
Sec. 63.1417(e).
    (iii) Batch cycle percent reduction. The percent reduction for the 
batch cycle for an individual reactor batch process vent and the overall 
percent reduction for the collection of non-reactor batch process vents 
within the affected source shall be determined using Equation 1 of this 
section and the control device efficiencies specified in paragraphs 
(e)(1)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section. All information used to 
calculate the batch cycle percent reduction for an individual reactor 
batch process vent, including a definition of the batch cycle

compliance with the percent reduction standards specified in 
Sec. 63.1406(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) and Sec. 63.1407(a)(2)(ii) and 
(3)(ii) is achieved when the owner or operator demonstrates, following 
the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, 
that the required percent reduction is achieved.

according to the following procedures, as appropriate:
    (i) If production at an affected source is exclusively non-solvent-
based amino/phenolic resin or is exclusively solvent-based amino/
phenolic resin, or an owner or operator chooses to meet the non-solvent-
based emission limit, the owner or operator shall demonstrate initial 
and continuous compliance as follows:
    (A) Initial compliance. Initial compliance shall be based on the 
average of the first 6 monthly average emission rate data points. The 6-
month average shall be compared to the mass emission limit specified in 
Sec. 63.1406 (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii), as appropriate.
    (B) Continuous compliance. For the first year of compliance, 
continuous compliance shall be based on a cumulative average monthly 
emission rate calculated each month based on the available monthly 
emission rate data points (e.g., 7 data points after 7 months of 
operation, 8 data points after 8 months of operation) beginning the 
first month after initial compliance is demonstrated. The first 
continuous compliance cumulative average monthly emission rate shall be 
calculated using the first 7 monthly average emission rate data points. 
After the first year of compliance, a 12-month rolling average monthly 
emission rate shall be calculated each month based on the previous 12 
monthly emission rate data points. Continuous compliance shall be 
determined by comparing the cumulative average monthly emission rate or 
the 12-month rolling average monthly emission rate to the mass emission 
limit specified in Sec. 63.1406 (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii), as 
appropriate.
    (C) Procedures to determine the monthly emission rate. The monthly 
emission rate, kilograms of organic HAP per

    (1) The monthly emission rate of organic HAP, in kilograms per 
month, from an individual batch process vent (E<INF>i</INF>) shall be 
determined using Equation 3 of this section. Once organic HAP emissions 
for a batch cycle (E<INF>cyclei</INF>) have been estimated, as specified 
in either paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C)(2) or (3) of this section, the owner or 
operator may use the estimated organic HAP emissions 
(E<INF>cyclei</INF>) to determine E<INF>i</INF> using Equation 3 of this 
section until the estimated organic HAP emissions (E<INF>cyclei</INF>) 
are no longer representative due to a process change or other reasons 
known to the owner or operator. If organic HAP emissions for a batch 
cycle (E<INF>cyclei</INF>) are determined to no longer be 
representative, the owner or operator shall redetermine organic HAP 
emissions for the batch cycle (E<INF>cyclei</INF>) following the 
procedures in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C)(2) or (3) of this section, as 
appropriate.

tons per year of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, the owner or 
operator may use the emissions determined using engineering assessment 
in Equation 3 of this section or may determine organic HAP emissions 
using any of the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1414(d). For reactor 
batch process vents estimated through engineering assessment, as 
described in Sec. 63.1414(d)(6), to emit 10 tons per year or greater of 
uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, uncontrolled organic HAP emissions 
from the batch emission episodes making up the batch cycle shall be 
estimated following the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1414(d).

this section.
    (4) The rate of resin produced, RP<INF>M</INF> (Mg/month), shall be 
determined based on production records certified by the owner or 
operator to represent actual production for the month. A sample of the 
records selected by the owner or operator for this purpose shall be 
provided to the Administrator in the Precompliance Report as required by 
Sec. 63.1417(d).

[[Page 481]]

    (ii) If production at an affected source reflects a mix of solvent-
based and non-solvent-based resin and the owner or operator does not 
choose to meet the non-solvent-based emission limit specified in 
Sec. 63.1406 (a)(1)(iii) or (a)(2)(iii), as applicable, the owner or 
operator shall demonstrate initial and continuous compliance as follows:
    (A) Procedures for determining a site-specific emission limit. A 
site-specific emission limit shall be determined using Equation 4 of

production for the first 6 months beginning January 20, 2000 or the 
first 6 months after initial start-up, whichever is later. Using the 
site-specific emission limit, initial compliance shall be demonstrated 
using the procedures in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, as 
appropriate.
    (C) Continuous compliance. For purposes of determining continuous 
compliance for the period of operation starting at the beginning of the 
7th month and ending after the 12th month, the site-specific emission 
limit shall be determined each month based on production for the 
cumulative period. For purposes of determining continuous compliance 
after the first year of production, the site-specific emission limit 
shall be determined each month based on production for a 12-month 
rolling period. Using the site-specific emission limit, continuous 
compliance shall be demonstrated using the procedures in paragraph 
(e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, as appropriate.
    (3) Compliance by venting to a flare. Initial compliance with the 
standards specified in Sec. 63.1406(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i) and 
Sec. 63.1407(a)(2)(i) and (a)(3)(i) shall be demonstrated following the 
procedures specified in paragraph (g) of this section. Continuous

demonstrated when the daily average outlet organic HAP concentration is 
20 ppmv or less when using a combustion control device or 50 ppmv or 
less when using a non-combustion control device. To demonstrate initial 
and continuous compliance, the owner or operator shall follow the test 
method specified in Sec. 63.1414(a)(6) and shall be in compliance with 
the monitoring provisions in Sec. 63.1415(e) no later than the initial 
compliance date and on each day thereafter.
    (g) Flare compliance demonstrations. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this subpart, if an owner or operator of an affected source 
uses a flare to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart, the 
owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of 
this section. When using a flare to comply, the owner or operator is not 
required to conduct a performance test to determine percent emission 
reduction or outlet organic HAP concentration. If a compliance

[[Page 482]]

demonstration has been conducted previously for a flare, using the 
techniques specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section, 
that compliance demonstration may be used to satisfy the requirements of 
this paragraph if either no deliberate process changes have been made

    (h) Deviations. Paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section 
describe deviations from the emission limits, the operating limits, the 
work practice standards, and the emission standard, respectively. 
Paragraph (h)(5) of this section describes situations that are not 
deviations. Paragraph (h)(6) of this section describes periods that are 
excluded from compliance determinations.
    (1) Deviations from the emission limit. The following are deviations 
from the emission limit:
    (i) Exceedance of the condenser outlet gas temperature limit (i.e., 
having an average value higher than the established maximum level) 
monitored according to the provisions of Sec. 63.1415(b)(3);
    (ii) Exceedance of the outlet concentration (i.e., having an average 
value higher than the established maximum level) monitored according to 
the provisions of Sec. 63.1415(b)(8);
    (iii) Exceedance of the mass emission limit (i.e., having an average 
value higher than the specified limit) monitored according to the 
provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and
    (iv) Exceedance of the organic HAP outlet concentration limit (i.e., 
having an average value higher than the specified limit) monitored 
according to the provisions of Sec. 63.1415(e).
    (2) Deviations from the operating limit. Exceedance of the 
parameters monitored according to Sec. 63.1415(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(4) 
through (7) are considered deviations from the operating limit. An 
exceedance of the monitored parameter has occurred if:
    (i) The parameter, averaged over the operating day or block, is 
below a minimum value established during the initial compliance 
demonstration; or (ii) The parameter, averaged over the operating day or 
block, is above the maximum value established during the initial 
compliance demonstration.
    (3) Deviations from the work practice standard. If all flames at the 
pilot light of a flare are absent, there has been a deviation from the 
work practice standard.
    (4) Deviation from the emission standard. If an affected source is 
not operated during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction in 
accordance with the affected source's Start-up, Shutdown, and 
Malfunction Plan, there has been a deviation from the emission standard. 
If monitoring data are insufficient, as described in paragraphs 
(h)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, there has been a deviation from 
the emission standard.
    (i) The period of control device or control technology operation is 
4 hours or greater in an operating day, and monitoring data are 
insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as defined in paragraph 
(h)(4)(iii) of this section, for at least 75 percent of the operating 
hours;
    (ii) The period of control device or control technology operation is 
less than 4 hours in an operating day, and more than one of the hours 
during the period of operation does not constitute a valid hour of data 
due to insufficient monitoring data; and
    (iii) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of 
data, as used in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, if 
measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within 
the hour. For data compression systems approved under 
Sec. 63.1417(k)(3), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a 
valid hour of data if there are less than four data measurements made 
during the hour.

[[Page 483]]

    (5) Situations that are not deviations. If an affected source is 
operated during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction in 
accordance with the affected source's Start-up, Shutdown, and 
Malfunction Plan, and any of the situations listed in paragraphs 
(h)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section occur, such situations shall not 
be considered to be deviations.
    (i) The daily average value of a monitored parameter is above the 
maximum level or below the minimum level established;
    (ii) Monitoring data cannot be collected during monitoring device 
calibration check or monitoring device malfunction;
    (iii) Monitoring data are not collected during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction; and
    (iv) Monitoring data are not collected during periods of 
nonoperation of the affected source or portion thereof (resulting in 
cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies).
    (6) Periods not considered to be part of the period of control or 
recovery device operation. The periods listed in paragraphs (h)(6)(i) 
through (v) of this section are not considered to be part of the period 
of control or recovery device operation for purposes of determining 
averages or periods of control device or control technology operation.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; or
    (v) Periods of nonoperation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.

are described in paragraph (d)(9) of this section. Other variables in 
the emissions estimation equations may be obtained through direct 
measurement, as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section; through 
engineering assessment, as defined in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this 
section; by process knowledge; or by any other appropriate means. 
Assumptions used in determining these variables shall be documented as 
specified in Sec. 63.1417. Once organic HAP emissions for the batch

operator may estimate annual organic HAP emissions for a batch emission 
episode by direct measurement. The test methods and procedures specified 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be used for direct 
measurement. If direct measurement is used, the owner or operator shall 
perform a test for the duration of a representative batch emission 
episode. Alternatively, the owner or operator may perform a test during 
only those periods of the batch emission episode for which the emission 
rate for the entire episode can be determined or for which the emissions 
are greater than the average emission rate of the batch emission 
episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options shall 
develop an emission profile illustrating the emission rate (kilogram per 
unit time) over the entire batch emission episode, based on either 
process knowledge or test data, to demonstrate that test periods are 
representative. Examples of information that could constitute process 
knowledge include calculations based on material balances and process 
stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used to develop the emission 
profile provided the results are still relevant to the current batch 
process vent conditions. The emission profile shall be included in the 
site-specific test plan required by Sec. 63.1417(h)(2).

emissions was an outcome of the test, that show a greater than 20 
percent discrepancy between the test value and the value estimated using

test data that will be acceptable under this paragraph.
    (1) Test data for the batch emission episode obtained during 
production of the product for which the demonstration is being made.
    (2) Test data obtained for a batch emission episode from another 
process train where the test data were obtained during production of the 
product for which the demonstration is being made. Test data from 
another process train may be used only if the owner or operator can 
demonstrate that the data are representative of the batch emission 
episode for which the demonstration is being made, taking into account 
the nature, size, operating conditions, production rate, and sequence of 
process steps (e.g., reaction, distillation, etc.) of the equipment in 
the other process train.

use engineering assessment to estimate organic HAP emissions from a 
batch emissions episode. The request to use engineering assessment to 
estimate organic HAP emissions from a batch emissions episode shall 
contain sufficient information and data to demonstrate to the 
Administrator that engineering assessment is an accurate means of 
estimating organic HAP emissions for that particular batch emissions 
episode. The request to use engineering assessment to estimate organic 
HAP emissions for a batch emissions episode shall be submitted in the 
Precompliance Report, as required by Sec. 63.1417(d).
    (ii) Engineering assessment includes, but is not limited to, the 
following:

Sec. 63.1415  Monitoring requirements.

    (a) General requirements. Each owner or operator of an emission 
point located at an affected source that uses a control device to comply 
with the requirements of this subpart and has one or more parameter 
monitoring level requirement specified under this subpart, shall install 
the monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (b) of this section in 
order to demonstrate continued compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart. All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated, 
maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications or 
other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the 
equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
    (1) This monitoring equipment shall be in operation at all times 
when organic HAP emissions that are required to be controlled as part of 
complying with the emission limits specified in Secs. 63.1404, 63.1405, 
63.1406, 63.1407, and 63.1408 are vented to the control device.
    (2) For control devices controlling less than 1 ton per year of 
uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, monitoring shall consist of a daily 
verification that the control device is operating properly. If the 
control device is used to control batch process vents alone or in 
combination with other emission points, the verification may be on a per 
batch cycle basis. This verification shall include, but not be limited 
to, a daily or per batch demonstration that the control device is 
working as designed. The procedure for this demonstration shall be 
submitted for review and approval as part of the Precompliance Report, 
as required by Sec. 63.1417(d)(10).
    (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring

    (B) If the scrubber is subject to regulations in 40 CFR parts 264 
through 266 that required a determination of the liquid to gas (L/G) 
ratio prior to the applicable compliance date for this subpart, the 
owner or operator may determine gas stream flow by the method that had 
been utilized to comply with those regulations. A determination that was 
conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized 
to comply with this subpart if it is still representative.
    (C) The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas stream 
flow determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will 
be used to determine the gas stream flow. The plan shall require 
determination of gas stream flow by a method which will at least provide 
a value for either a representative or the highest gas stream flow 
anticipated in the scrubber during representative operating conditions 
other than start-ups, shutdowns, or malfunctions. The plan shall include 
a description of the methodology to be followed and an explanation of 
how the selected methodology will reliably determine the gas stream

<R05>
Sec. 63.1416  Recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) Data retention. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, each 
owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all 
applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 
years, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with the 
exception listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that 
they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall 
be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by 
computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained 
offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable 
form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, 
floppy disk, CD-ROM, optical disc, magnetic tape, or microfiche.
    (2) If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the 
appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required 
to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the 
requirement of Sec. 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, 
the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of those 
reports.
    (b) Start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan and records. The owner 
or operator of an affected source shall develop and implement a start-
up, shutdown, and malfunction plan as specified in Sec. 63.6(e)(3) and 
shall keep the plan on-site. Records shall be kept as specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. Records are not required for 
emission points that do not require control under this subpart.
    (1) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment, or control 
devices, or recovery devices, or continuous monitoring systems, or 
control technologies used to comply with this subpart during which 
excess emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.1400(k)(4)) occur.
    (2) For each start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during which excess 
emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.1400(k)(4)) occur, records reflecting 
whether the procedures specified in the affected source's start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed and documentation of 
actions taken that are

[[Page 493]]

not consistent with the plan. For example, if a start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan includes procedures for routing a control device to a 
backup control device (e.g., a halogenated stream could be routed to a 
flare during periods when the primary control device is out of service), 
records shall be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records 
may take the form of a ``checklist'' or other form of recordkeeping that 
confirms conformance with the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan 
for the event.
    (c) Monitoring records. Owners or operators required to comply with 
Sec. 63.1415 and, therefore, required to keep continuous records shall 
keep records as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this 
section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall record either each measured data 
value or average values for 1 hour or shorter periods calculated from 
all measured data values during each period. If values are measured more 
frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be 
used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) average instead of all 
measured values. Owners or operators of batch process vents shall record 
each measured data value; if values are measured more frequently than 
once per minute, a single value for each minute may be recorded instead 
of all measured values.
    (2) Daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average 
values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated for 
each operating day as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this 
section, except as specified in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this 
section. The option of conducting parameter monitoring for batch process 
vents on a batch cycle daily average basis or a block average basis is 
described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (i) The daily average value, batch cycle daily average, or block 
average shall be calculated as the average of all parameter values 
recorded during the operating day, or batch cycle, as appropriate, 
except as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. For batch 
process vents, only parameter values recorded during those batch 
emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle that the 
owner or operator has selected to control in order to comply shall be 
used to calculate the average. The calculated average shall cover a 24-
hour period if operation is continuous, or the number of hours of 
operation per operating day if operation is not continuous for daily 
average values or batch cycle daily average values. The calculated 
average shall cover the entire period of the batch cycle for block 
average values. As specified in Sec. 63.1413(a)(4)(i)(C)(3), the owner 
or operator shall provide the information needed to calculate batch 
cycle daily averages for operating days that include partial batch 
cycles.
    (ii) The operating day shall be the period the owner or operator 
specifies in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance 
Status for purposes of determining daily average values or batch cycle 
daily average values of monitored parameters. The block shall be the 
entire period of the batch cycle, as specified by the owner or operator 
in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status for 
purposes of determining block average values of monitored parameters.
    (3) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an 
operating day or block are above the minimum level or below the maximum 
level established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating 
permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the 
minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and 
recording a daily average, or block average, for that operating day. For 
these operating days or blocks, the records required in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section shall also be retained for 5 years.
    (4) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs 
(c)(4)(i) through (v) of this section shall not be included in any 
average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times 
and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process 
or control device or recovery device or control technology operation 
when monitors are not operating:
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;

[[Page 494]]

    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; and
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring 
applies.
    (5) The owner or operator who has received approval to monitor 
different parameters, under Sec. 63.1417(j) as allowed under 
Sec. 63.1415(e), than those specified for storage vessels, continuous 
process vents, or batch process vents shall retain for a period of 5 
years each record specified in their approved Alternative Monitoring 
Parameters request.
    (6) The owner or operator who has received approval to use 
alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping provisions as 
specified in Sec. 63.1417(k) shall retain for a period of 5 years each 
record specified in their approved Alternative Continuous Monitoring 
request.
    (d) Batch process vent records. (1) Compliance demonstration 
records. Each owner or operator of a batch process vent complying with 
Sec. 63.1406 or Sec. 63.1407 shall keep the following records, as 
applicable, readily accessible.

    (i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or 
impossible data during periods of operation other than start-ups, 
shutdowns, or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of -200  deg.C 
on a boiler) and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The 
owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the 
alarm or other alert in an operating day or block constitute a single 
occurrence.
    (ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly 
throughout each operating day, a running average of the parameter values 
that have been obtained during that operating day or block, and the 
capability to observe this running average is readily available on-site 
to the Administrator during the operating day. The owner or operator 
shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A)

[[Page 499]]

through (C) of this section. All instances in an operating day or block 
constitute a single occurrence:
    (A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum 
established limits;
    (B) The running average is based on at least six 1-hour average 
values; and
    (C) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data 
during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns, or 
malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging 
data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., 
pH in some scrubbers) and will alert the operator by alarm or other 
means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances 
of the alarm or other alert in an operating day or block constitute a 
single occurrence.
    (iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an 
alarm or other means if the running average parameter value calculated 
under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is 
appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is 
being monitored.
    (v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the 
monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements 
of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, at the times 
specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(v)(A) through (C). The owner or operator 
shall document that the required verifications occurred.
    (A) Upon initial installation.
    (B) Annually after initial installation.
    (C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting 
the monitoring system which might reasonably be expected to alter the 
monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this 
section.
    (vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section.

which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements 
of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s) and how 
compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. The description shall identify 
the location and format (e.g., on-line storage, log entries) for each 
required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall 
retain, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided 
in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section, both the current and the 
most recent superseded description.
    (C) A description and the date of any change to the monitoring 
system that would reasonably be expected to impair its ability to comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (D) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(B) of this 
section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as 
long as the description is current. The current description shall, at 
all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location 
by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. The owner or operator shall retain all superseded descriptions 
for at least 5 years after the date of their creation. Superseded 
descriptions shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central 
location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours 
after a request) for at least 6 months after their creation. Thereafter, 
superseded descriptions may be stored off-site.
    (2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a parameter with 
respect to an item of equipment and a period of 6 consecutive months has 
passed without any deviation as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this 
section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily 
average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value for any 
operating day when the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or 
block average value is less than the maximum or greater than the minimum 
established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data 
generated prior to the compliance date of

[[Page 500]]

this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months 
if the parameter limit and the monitoring accomplished during the period 
prior to the compliance date were required and/or approved by the 
Administrator.
    (i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average, 
batch cycle daily average, or block average values, the owner or 
operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report as 
specified in Sec. 63.1417(f)(11). The notification shall identify the 
parameter and unit of equipment.

section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the 
daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value for 
each operating day and shall notify the Administrator in the next 
Periodic Report. The owner or operator shall continue to retain each 
daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value until 
another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without a deviation as 
defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section for the duration 
specified in paragraph (h) of this section. For any calendar week, if 
compliance with paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section does 
not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or 
measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain 
at least one value during a period of operation other than a start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iv) For purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section, a deviation 
means that the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block 
average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the 
maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except that the 
daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value during 
any start-up, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered a 
deviation for purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if the owner 
or operator follows the applicable provisions of the start-up, shutdown, 
and malfunction plan required by Sec. 63.6(e)(3).

The report may be submitted as part of the next Periodic Report required 
by paragraph (f) of this section.
    (i) The report shall include the following information:

[[Page 507]]

    (A) A description of the process change;
    (B) The results of the recalculation of the organic HAP 
concentration, volumetric flow rate, and or TRE index value required 
under Sec. 63.1412 and recorded under Sec. 63.1416(f).
    (C) A statement that the owner or operator will comply with the 
requirements specified in Sec. 63.1405.
    (ii) If a performance test is required as a result of a process 
change, the owner or operator shall specify that the performance test 
has become necessary due to a process change. This specification shall 
be made in the performance test notification to the Administrator, as 
specified in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
    (iii) If a process change does not result in additional applicable 
requirements, then the owner or operator shall include a statement 
documenting this in the next Periodic Report required by paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (i) Operating permit application. An owner or operator who submits 
an operating permit application instead of a Precompliance Report shall 
submit the information specified in paragraph (d) of this section, 
Precompliance Report, as applicable.
    (j) Alternative monitoring parameters. The owner or operator who has 
been directed by any section of this subpart or any section of another 
subpart referenced by this subpart that expressly referenced this 
paragraph (j) to set unique monitoring parameters, or who requests 
approval to monitor a different parameter than those specified in 
Sec. 63.1415(b), shall submit the information specified in paragraphs 
(j)(1) through (3) of this section in the Precompliance Report, as 
required by paragraph (d) of this section.
    (1) The required information shall include a description of the 
parameter(s) to be monitored to ensure the recovery device, control 
device, or control technology is operated in conformance with its design 
and achieves the specified emission limit or percent reduction and an 
explanation of the criteria used to select the parameter(s).
    (2) The required information shall include a description of the 
methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the 
parameter indicates proper operation, the schedule for this 
demonstration, and a statement that the owner or operator will establish 
a level for the monitored parameter as part of the Notification of 
Compliance Status report required in paragraph (e) of this section, 
unless this information has already been included in the operating 
permit application.
    (3) The required information shall include a description of the 
proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting system to include the 
frequency and content of monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. 
Further, the rationale for the proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting system shall be included if either condition in paragraph 
(j)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section is met:
    (i) If monitoring and recordkeeping is not continuous; or
    (ii) If reports of daily average values will not be included in 
Periodic Reports when the monitored parameter value is above the maximum 
level or below the minimum level as established in the operating permit 
or the Notification of Compliance Status.
    (k) Alternative continuous monitoring. An owner or operator choosing 
not to implement the monitoring provisions specified in Sec. 63.1415 for 
storage vessels, continuous process vents, batch process vents, or 
aggregate batch vent streams may instead request approval to use 
alternative continuous monitoring provisions according to the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) of this section. Requests 
shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report as specified in paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section if not already included in the operating permit 
application and shall contain the information specified in paragraphs 
(k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.
    (1) The provisions in Sec. 63.8(f)(5)(i) shall govern the review and 
approval of requests.
    (2) An owner or operator of an affected source that does not have an 
automated monitoring and recording system capable of measuring parameter 
values at least once every 15 minutes and that does not generate 
continuous records may request approval to use a nonautomated system 
with less

[[Page 508]]

frequent monitoring in accordance with paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section.
    (i) The requested system shall include manual reading and recording 
of the value of the relevant operating parameter no less frequently than 
once per hour. Daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values shall 
be calculated from these hourly values and recorded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the planned monitoring and recordkeeping 
system;
    (B) Documentation that the affected source does not have an 
automated monitoring and recording system;
    (C) Justification for requesting an alternative monitoring and 
recordkeeping system; and
    (D) Demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction that the 
proposed monitoring frequency is sufficient to represent control or 
recovery device operating conditions, considering typical variability of 
the specific process and control or recovery device operating parameter 
being monitored.
    (3) An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated 
data compression recording system that does not record monitored 
operating parameter values at a set frequency (for example, once every 
15 minutes) but records all values that meet set criteria for variation 
from previously recorded values, in accordance with paragraphs (k)(3)(i) 
and (ii) of this section.
    (i) The requested system shall be designed to:
    (A) Measure the operating parameter value at least once every 15 
minutes;
    (B) Except for the monitoring of batch process vents, calculate 
hourly average values each hour during periods of operation;
    (C) Record the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;
    (D) Recognize unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not 
functioning properly, alert the operator, and record the incident;
    (E) Calculate daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block 
average values of the monitored operating parameter based on all 
measured data; and
    (F) If the daily average is not a deviation, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1413(h), from the operating parameter, the data for that 
operating day may be converted to hourly average values, and the four or 
more individual records for each hour in the operating day may be 
discarded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the monitoring system and data compression 
recording system, including the criteria used to determine which 
monitored values are recorded and retained;
    (B) The method for calculating daily averages and batch cycle daily 
averages; and
    (C) A demonstration that the system meets all criteria in paragraph 
(k)(3)(i) of this section.
    (4) An owner or operator may request approval to use other 
alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.8(f)(4).

Sec. 63.1420  Applicability and designation of affected sources.

    (a) Definition of affected source. The provisions of this subpart 
apply to each affected source. Affected sources are described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) An affected source is either an existing affected source or a 
new affected source. Existing affected source is defined in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, and new affected source is defined in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (2) An existing affected source is defined as the group of one or 
more polyether polyol manufacturing process units (PMPUs) and associated 
equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, that is not 
part of a new affected source, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, and that is located at a plant site that is a major source.
    (3) A new affected source is defined as a source that meets the 
criteria of paragraph (a)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. The 
situation described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is distinct 
from those situations described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (iii) of 
this section.
    (i) At a site without organic HAP emission points before September 
4, 1997 (i.e., a ``greenfield'' site), the group of one or more PMPUs 
and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
that is part of a major source, and on which construction for the 
PMPU(s) commenced after September 4, 1997;
    (ii) The group of one or more PMPUs meeting the criteria in 
paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section; or
    (iii) A reconstructed affected source meeting the criteria in 
paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.

[[Page 516]]

    (4) The affected source also includes the emission points and 
equipment specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (vi) of this section 
that are associated with a PMPU (or a group of PMPUs) making up an 
affected source, as defined in Sec. 63.1423.
    (i) Each waste management unit.
    (ii) Maintenance wastewater.
    (iii) Each heat exchange system.
    (iv) Equipment required by or utilized as a method of compliance 
with this subpart which may include control techniques and recovery 
devices.
    (v) Product finishing operation.
    (vi) Each feed or catalyst operation.
    (b) PMPUs without organic HAP. The owner or operator of a PMPU that 
is part of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
section, but that does not use or manufacture any organic HAP during the 
production of one or more products is only subject to the provisions of 
this subpart as specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as 
applicable. Products or raw material(s) containing organic HAP as 
impurities only are not considered organic HAP for the purposes of this 
paragraph.
    (1) If an organic HAP is not used or manufactured in the production 
of polyether polyols, the PMPU is not subject to any provisions of this 
subpart, except that the owner or operator shall comply with either 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. The owner or operator is 
not required to comply with the provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A 
(the General Provisions) for that PMPU.
    (i) Retain information, data, and analyses used to document the 
basis for the determination that the PMPU does not use or manufacture 
any organic HAP. Types of information that could document this 
determination include, but are not limited to, records of chemicals 
purchased for the process, analyses of process stream composition, 
engineering calculations, or process knowledge.
    (ii) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the PMPU 
does not use or manufacture any organic HAP.
    (2) If an organic HAP is used or manufactured in the production of 
polyether polyols, but an organic HAP is not used in the production of 
one or more products that are not polyether polyols, the PMPU is not 
subject to any provision of this subpart other than paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
or (ii) of this section during the production of the non-polyether 
polyol products that do not use or manufacture any organic HAP.
    (c) Emission points included in the affected source but not subject 
to the provisions of this subpart. The affected source includes the 
emission points listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (12) of this 
section, but these emission points are not subject to the requirements 
of this subpart or the provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.
    (1) Equipment that does not contain organic HAP or that contains 
organic HAP as impurities only and is located at a PMPU that is part of 
an affected source.
    (2) Stormwater managed in segregated sewers.
    (3) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems in segregated 
sewers.
    (4) Spills.
    (5) Water from safety showers.
    (6) Water from testing of deluge systems.
    (7) Water from testing of firefighting systems.
    (8) Vessels that store and/or handle material that contains no 
organic HAP or organic HAP as impurities only.
    (9) Equipment that operates in organic HAP service for less than 300 
hours during the calendar year.
    (10) Loading racks, loading arms, or loading hoses that only 
transfer liquids containing HAP as impurities.
    (11) Loading racks, loading arms, or loading hoses that vapor 
balance during all loading operations.
    (12) Utility fluids, such as heat transfer fluids.
    (d) Processes exempted from the affected source. The processes 
specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section are not part 
of the affected source and are exempted from the requirements of both 
this subpart and subpart A of this part.
    (1) Research and development facilities.
    (2) Solvent reclamation, recovery, or recycling operations at 
hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal

[[Page 517]]

facilities (TSDF) requiring a permit under 40 CFR part 270 that are not 
part of a PMPU to which this subpart applies.
    (3) Reactions or processing that occur after the epoxide 
polymerization is complete and after all catalyst removal steps, if any, 
are complete.
    (e) Primary product determination and applicability. An owner or 
operator of a process unit that produces or plans to produce a polyether 
polyol shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in 
accordance with this paragraph.
    (1) Initial primary product determination. The owner or operator 
shall initially determine the primary product of each process unit in 
accordance with paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) If a process unit manufactures only one product, then that 
product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.
    (ii) If a process unit produces more than one intended product at 
the same time, the primary product shall be determined in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) The product for which the process unit has the greatest annual 
design capacity on a mass basis shall represent the primary product of 
the process unit, or
    (B) If a process unit has the same maximum annual design capacity on 
a mass basis for two or more products and if one of those products is a 
polyether polyol, then the polyether polyol shall represent the primary 
product of the process unit.
    (iii) If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible 
operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in 
paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section based on the anticipated 
operations for the 5 years following September 4, 1997 for existing 
process units, or for the first year after the process unit begins 
production of any product for the new process units. If operations 
cannot be anticipated sufficiently to allow the determination of the 
primary product for the specified period, applicability shall be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (A) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for 
the greatest operating time over the specified 5-year period for 
existing process units, or the specified 1-year period for new process 
units, then that product shall represent the primary product of the 
flexible operation unit.
    (B) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple 
products equally based on operating time, then the product with the 
greatest expected production on a mass basis over the specified 5-year 
period for existing process units, or the specified 1-year period for 
new process units shall represent the primary product of the flexible 
operation unit.
    (iv) If, according to paragraph (e)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section, the primary product of a process unit is a polyether polyol, 
then that process unit shall be designated as a PMPU. If the plant site 
is a major source, that PMPU and associated equipment, as listed in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source or part 
of an affected source comprised of one or more other PMPUs and 
associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and 
subject to this subpart. If the primary product of a process unit is not 
a polyether polyol, then that process unit is not a PMPU.
    (2) Provisions if primary product cannot be determined. If the 
primary product cannot be determined for a flexible operation unit in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, applicability 
shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph.
    (i) If the owner or operator can determine that a polyether polyol 
is not the primary product, then that flexible operation unit is not a 
PMPU.
    (ii) If the owner or operator cannot determine that a polyether 
polyol is not the primary product as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of 
this section, applicability shall be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) If the flexible operation unit is an existing process unit, the 
flexible operation unit shall be designated as a PMPU if a polyether 
polyol was produced for 5 percent or greater of the

[[Page 518]]

total operating time of the flexible operation unit since September 4, 
1997.
    (B) If the flexible operation unit is a new process unit, the 
flexible operation unit shall be designated as a PMPU if the owner or 
operator anticipates that a polyether polyol will be manufactured in the 
flexible operation unit at any time in the first year after the date the 
unit begins production of any product.
    (3) Annual applicability determination for non-PMPUs that have 
produced a polyether polyol. Once per year beginning June 1, 2004, the 
owner or operator of each flexible operation unit that is not designated 
as a PMPU, but that has produced a polyether polyol at any time in the 
preceding 5-year period or since the date that the unit began production 
of any product, whichever is shorter, shall perform the evaluation 
described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section. 
However, an owner or operator that does not intend to produce any 
elastomer product in the future, in accordance with paragraph (e)(9) of 
this section, is not required to perform the evaluation described in 
paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the 
owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time 
over which the product was produced during the preceding 5-year period.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the 
product with the highest percentage of total operating time for the 
preceding 5-year period.
    (iii) If the primary product identified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) is a 
polyether polyol, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as a 
PMPU. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later than 
45 days after determining that the flexible operation unit is a PMPU, 
and shall comply with the requirements of this subpart in accordance 
with paragraph (g)(1) of this section for the flexible operation unit.
    (4) Applicability determination for non-PMPUs that have not produced 
a polyether polyol. The owner or operator that anticipates the 
production of a polyether polyol in a process unit that is not 
designated as a PMPU, and in which no polyether polyol products have 
been produced in the previous 5-year period or since the date that the 
process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, 
shall use the procedures in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section to 
determine if the process unit is designated as a PMPU, with the 
exception that for existing process units, owners or operators shall 
project production for the 5 years following the date that the owner or 
operator anticipates initiating the production of a polyether polyol, 
instead of the 5 years following September 4, 1997. If the unit is 
designated as a PMPU, the owner or operator shall comply in accordance 
with paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (5) Applicability of requirements for PMPUs that are flexible 
operation units. The owner or operator of PMPUs that are flexible 
operation units shall comply with the provisions of this subpart in 
accordance with paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Control requirements. The owner or operator shall comply with 
the control requirements of this subpart in accordance with paragraphs 
(e)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) During periods when the PMPU produces polyether polyols, the 
owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of this subpart.
    (B) During periods when the PMPU produces products other than 
polyether polyols, the owner or operator is not required to install 
additional combustion, recovery, or recapture devices (to otherwise 
demonstrate compliance). However, the owner or operator shall continue 
to operate any existing combustion, recovery, or recapture devices that 
are required for compliance during the production of polyether polyols, 
with the exceptions provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section. If 
extended cookout (ECO) is the control technique chosen for epoxide 
emission reduction, then ECO or a control technique providing an 
equivalent reduction in epoxide emissions should continue to be used for 
epoxide emission reduction, if the non-polyether polyol being produced 
uses epoxide monomers.
    (ii) Monitoring requirements. The owner or operator shall comply 
with the monitoring requirements of this subpart in accordance with 
paragraphs

[[Page 519]]

(e)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, and paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(C) of 
this section if applicable.
    (A) The owner or operator shall establish a single parameter 
monitoring level (for each parameter required to be monitored at each 
device subject to monitoring requirements) in accordance with 
Sec. 63.1438(a) based on emission point and control technique 
characteristics when polyether polyol is being produced.
    (B) The owner or operator shall monitor each parameter at each 
device subject to monitoring requirements at all times (during periods 
when the PMPU produces polyether polyols, and during periods when the 
PMPU produces products other than polyether polyols), with the 
exceptions provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section.
    (C) If ECO is used to reduce epoxide emissions, a parameter 
monitoring level shall be established for the production of non-
polyether polyol products as the average of the established parameter 
levels for all product classes produced. During periods when products 
other than polyether polyols are produced, the ECO shall be performed so 
that the parameter monitoring level established for the production of 
non-polyether polyol products is maintained when the ECO is used as a 
control technique.
    (iii) Group determinations. For emission points where the owner or 
operator is required to determine if the emission point is Group 1 
according the definitions in Sec. 63.1423 (storage vessels, process 
vents for nonepoxide organic HAP emissions used to make or modify the 
product, and wastewater), the owner or operator shall determine the 
group status based on emission point characteristics when polyether 
polyol is being manufactured. Group 1 emission points shall be 
controlled in accordance with paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.
    (iv) Exceptions. During periods when products described in 
paragraphs (e)(5)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section are produced, the owner 
or operator is not required to comply with the provisions of this 
subpart.
    (A) Products in which no organic HAP is used or manufactured, 
provided that the owner or operator comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (B) Products that make the PMPU subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart 
GGG (Pharmaceuticals Production NESHAP).
    (6)-(7) [Reserved]
    (8) Requirements for process units that are not PMPUs. If it is 
determined that a process unit is not subject to this subpart, the owner 
or operator shall either retain all information, data, and analysis used 
to document the basis for the determination that the process unit is not 
a PMPU, or, when requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the 
process unit is not a PMPU.
    (9) PMPUs terminating production of all polyether polyols. If a PMPU 
terminates the production of all polyether polyols, and the owner or 
operator does not anticipate the production of any polyether polyols in 
the future in that PMPU, the process unit is no longer a PMPU and is not 
subject to this subpart after notification is made to the Administrator. 
This notification shall be accompanied by a rationale for why it is 
anticipated that no polyether polyols will be produced in the process 
unit in the future.
    (10) Redetermination of applicability to PMPUs that are flexible 
operation units. Whenever changes in production occur that could 
reasonably be expected to change the primary product of a PMPU that is 
operating as a flexible operation unit from a polyether polyol to a 
product that would make the process unit subject to another subpart of 
this part, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the primary product, 
in accordance with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. If the 
conditions in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (iii) of this section are 
met, the flexible operation unit shall no longer be designated as a PMPU 
after the compliance date of the other subpart, and shall no longer be 
subject to the provisions of this subpart after the date that the 
process unit is required to be in compliance with the provisions of the 
other subpart. If the conditions in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (iii) 
of this section are not met, the flexible operation unit shall continue 
to be considered a PMPU and subject to the requirements of this subpart.

[[Page 520]]

    (i) The product identified as the primary product is not polyether 
polyol;
    (ii) The production of the product identified as the primary product 
is subject to another subpart of this part; and
    (iii) The owner or operator submits a notification to the 
Administrator of the pending change in applicability.
    (f) Storage vessel ownership determination. The owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) 
of this section to determine to which process unit a storage vessel 
shall be assigned.
    (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 40 
CFR part 63 (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
for Source Categories) on June 1, 1999, that storage vessel shall be 
assigned to the process unit subject to the other subpart, and none of 
the other provisions in this subpart shall apply to that storage vessel.
    (2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.
    (3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit located on the 
same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into 
or output from the storage vessel (i.e., the process unit that has the 
predominant use of the storage vessel.)
    (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units and if only one of those process 
units is a PMPU subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be 
assigned to that PMPU.
    (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process 
units are PMPUs that have different primary products and that are 
subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the 
storage vessel to any one of the PMPUs sharing the storage vessel.
    (6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to 
year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization 
that occurred during the year preceding June 1, 1999 or based on the 
expected utilization for the 5 years following June 1, 1999 for existing 
affected sources, whichever is more representative of the expected 
operations for that storage vessel, and based on the expected 
utilization for the 5 years after initial start-up for new affected 
sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the 
Notification of Compliance Status, as required by Sec. 63.1439(e)(5)(v).
    (7) Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that 
includes one or more process units which place material into or receive 
material from the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in a 
tank farm (including a marine tank farm), the applicability of this 
subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs 
(f)(7)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that 
utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage 
vessel for that product (or raw materials, as appropriate). With respect 
to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage 
vessel connected by hard-piping to both the process unit and the storage 
vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering or 
leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage 
vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in 
the tank farm.
    (ii) If there is no process unit at the major source that meets the 
criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a 
storage vessel, this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel.
    (iii) If there is only one process unit at the major source that 
meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section with respect 
to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that 
process unit.
    (iv) If there are two or more process units at the major source that 
meet the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section with respect to 
a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those 
process units according to the provisions of paragraphs (f)(3) through 
(6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among only 
those process units that

[[Page 521]]

meet the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section.
    (8) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) a process unit that was not included in the initial 
determination, or ceases to receive material from (or send material to) 
a process unit that was included in the initial determination, the owner 
or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to that 
storage vessel.
    (g) Changes or additions to plant sites. The provisions of this 
paragraph apply to the owner or operator that changes or adds to their 
plant site or affected source.
    (1) Adding a PMPU to a plant site. The provisions of paragraphs 
(g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to the owner or operator that 
adds one or more PMPUs to a plant site. A PMPU may be added to a plant 
site by constructing or reconstructing a process unit to produce 
polyether polyols. A PMPU may also be added to a plant site due to 
changes in production (anticipated production or actual past production) 
such that a polyether polyol becomes the primary product of a process 
unit that was not previously a PMPU.
    (i) If a group of one or more PMPUs is added to a plant site, the 
added group of one or more PMPUs and their associated equipment, as 
listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, shall be a new affected 
source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source 
in this subpart upon initial start-up or by June 1, 1999, whichever is 
later, if the added group of one or more PMPUs meets the criteria 
specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section and either meets the 
criteria in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this section.
    (A) The process units are new process units, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1423.
    (B) The added group of one or more PMPUs and associated equipment, 
as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, has the potential to emit 
10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year) or more of any organic HAP or 
25 tons per year (22.7 megagrams per year) or more of any combination of 
organic HAP, and polyether polyols are currently produced at the plant 
site as the primary product of an affected source.
    (C) A polyether polyol is not currently produced at the plant site 
as the primary product of an affected source, and the plant site meets, 
or after the addition is constructed will meet, the General Provisions' 
definition of a major source in Sec. 63.2.
    (ii) If a group of one or more PMPUs is added to a plant site, and 
the added group of one or more PMPUs does not meet the criteria 
specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section and one of the 
criteria specified in either paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this 
section, and the plant site meets, or after the addition will meet, the 
definition of a major source, the owner or operator of the added group 
of one or more PMPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section, shall comply with the requirements for an 
existing affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up; by June 
1, 2002; or by 6 months after notifying the Administrator that a process 
unit has been designated as a PMPU (in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) 
of this section), whichever is later.
    (2) Adding emission points or making process changes to existing 
affected sources. The provisions of paragraphs (g)(2)(i), (ii), and 
(iii) of this section apply to the owner or operator that adds emission 
points or makes process changes to an existing affected source.
    (i) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source 
such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of 
this section are met, the entire affected source shall be a new affected 
source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source 
upon initial start-up or by June 1, 1999, whichever is later.
    (A) The replacement of components meets the definition of 
reconstruction in Sec. 63.1423(b). For purposes of determining whether 
the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the 
fixed capital cost that would be required to construct an entire 
affected source, the equivalent capital cost shall be the entire 
potentially affected source; and
    (B) Such reconstruction commenced after September 4, 1997.

[[Page 522]]

    (ii) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source 
such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of 
this section are not met and that replacement of components creates one 
or more emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission 
points or emission points that change from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes 
any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, 
heat exchange systems subject to Sec. 63.1435, or equipment leak 
components subject Sec. 63.1434), the resulting emission point(s) shall 
be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected 
source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance upon 
initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in 
Sec. 63.1422 (i.e., December 1, 1999 for most equipment leak components 
subject to Sec. 63.1434, and June 1, 2002 for emission points other than 
equipment leaks), whichever is later.
    (iii) If an addition or process change (not including a process 
change that solely replaces components) is made that creates one or more 
Group 1 emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission 
points or emission points that change group status from Group 2 to Group 
1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 
emission points, heat exchange systems subject to Sec. 63.1435, or 
equipment leak components subject to Sec. 63.1434), the resulting 
emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an 
existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in 
compliance by initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date 
specified in Sec. 63.1422 (i.e., December 1, 1999 for most equipment 
leak components subject to Sec. 63.1434, and June 1, 2002 for emission 
points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.
    (3) Determining what are and are not process changes. For purposes 
of paragraph (g) of this section, examples of process changes include, 
but are not limited to, additions in process equipment resulting in 
changes in production capacity; production of a product outside the 
scope of the compliance demonstration; or whenever there is a 
replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of 
paragraph (g) of this section, process changes do not include: process 
upsets, unintentional temporary process changes, and changes that do not 
alter the equipment configuration and operating conditions.
    (4) Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or 
add to their plant site or affected source. An owner or operator that 
changes or adds to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in 
paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, shall submit a report as 
specified in Sec. 63.1439(e)(7)(iii).
    (h) Applicability of this subpart during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation. Paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) 
of this section shall be followed during periods of start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, and non-operation of the affected source or any part 
thereof.
    (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the 
emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all 
times except during periods of nonoperation of the affected source (or 
specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to 
which this subpart applies. These emission limitations shall not apply 
during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, except as provided 
in paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) of this section. During periods of start-
up, shutdown, or malfunction, the owner or operator shall follow the 
applicable provisions of the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan 
required by Sec. 63.6(e)(3). However, if a start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or period of nonoperation of one portion of an affected 
source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to 
comply with the emission limitations to which it is subject, then that 
emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable 
emission limitations of this subpart during the start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or period of nonoperation. For example, if there is an 
overpressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel that is part of the 
affected source would still be required to be controlled in accordance 
with the storage tank provisions in Sec. 63.1432. Similarly, the 
degassing of a storage vessel

[[Page 523]]

would not affect the ability of a process vent to meet the emission 
limitations for process vents in Secs. 63.1425 through 63.1430.
    (2) The emission limitations set forth in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H, 
as referred to in the equipment leak provisions in Sec. 63.1434, shall 
apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the 
affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are 
drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to 
which Sec. 63.1434 applies, or during periods of start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or process unit shutdown (as defined in Sec. 63.161).
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during times when 
emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are 
being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown would contravene 
requirements applicable to such items of equipment. This paragraph does 
not apply if the item of equipment is malfunctioning. This paragraph 
also does not apply if the owner or operator shuts down the compliance 
equipment (other than monitoring systems) to avoid damage due to a 
contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of the affected 
source or portion thereof. If the owner or operator has reason to 
believe that monitoring equipment would be damaged due to a 
contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of the affected 
source or portion thereof, the owner or operator shall provide 
documentation supporting such a claim in the Precompliance Report or in 
a supplement to the Precompliance Report, as provided for in 
Sec. 63.1439(e)(4). Once approved by the Administrator in accordance 
with Sec. 63.1439(e)(4)(vii), the provision for ceasing to collect, 
during a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data that would 
otherwise be required by the provisions of this subpart shall be 
incorporated into the start-up, shutdown, malfunction plan for that 
affected source, as stated in Sec. 63.1439(b)(1).
    (4) During start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to 
the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions to the extent practical. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``excess emissions'' means emissions greater than those allowed by 
the emissions limitation which would apply during operational periods 
other than start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. The measures to be taken 
shall be identified in the applicable start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan, and may include, but are not limited to, air pollution 
control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution 
prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the 
affected source. Use of back-up control techniques is not required, but 
is allowed, if available.

[64 FR 29439, June 1, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 26498, May 8, 2000]

    Effective Date Note: At 65 FR 26498, May 8, 2000, Sec. 63.1420 was 
amended by revising paragraphs (e)(3) introductory text, (e)(9), 
(g)(1)(i) introductory text, (g)(2) introductory text, (g)(2)(i) 
introductory text, (g)(2)(i)(A), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(3), (g)(4), (h)(1) and 
(h)(4), and adding paragraph (g)(2)(iii), effective July 7, 2000. For 
the convenience of the user, the superseded text is set forth as 
follows:

Sec. 63.1420  Applicability and designation of affected sources.

                                * * * * *

    (e) * * *
    (3) Annual applicability determination for non-PMPUs that have 
produced a polyether polyol. Once per year beginning June 1, 2004 the 
owner or operator of each flexible operation unit that is not designated 
as a PMPU, but that has produced a polyether polyol at any time in the 
preceding 5-year period or since the date that the unit began production 
of any product, whichever is shorter, shall perform the evaluation 
described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.

                                * * * * *

    (9) PMPUs terminating production of polyether polyols products. If a 
PMPU terminates the production of polyether polyol and does not 
anticipate the production of a polyether polyol in the future, the 
process

[[Page 524]]

unit is no longer a PMPU and is not subject to this subpart after 
notification is made to the Administrator. This notification shall be 
accompanied by a rationale for why it is anticipated that no polyether 
polyol will be produced in the process unit in the future.

                                * * * * *

    (i) If a group of one or more PMPUs is added to a plant site, the 
added group of one or more PMPUs and their associated equipment, as 
listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, shall be a new affected 
source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source 
in this subpart upon initial start-up or by June 1, 1999, whichever is 
later, if the criteria specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) is met and 
either the criteria in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this section are 
met.

                                * * * * *

    (2) Adding emission points or making process changes to existing 
affected sources. The provisions of paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section apply to the owner or operator that adds emission points or 
makes process changes to an existing affected source.
    (i) If any process change or addition is made to an existing 
affected source that meets the criteria specified in paragraphs 
(g)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, the entire affected source shall 
be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a 
new affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up or by June 1, 
1999.
    (A) It is a process change or addition that meets the definition of 
reconstruction in Sec. 63.1423(b). For purposes of determining whether 
the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the 
fixed capital cost that would be required to construct an entire 
affected source, the equivalent capital cost shall be the entire 
potentially affected source; and

                                * * * * *

    (ii) If any process change is made or emission point is added to an 
existing affected source, and the process change or addition does not 
meet the criteria specified in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section, 
the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the requirements for 
an existing affected source in this subpart. The resulting emission 
point(s) shall be in compliance upon initial start-up or by the 
appropriate compliance date specified in Sec. 63.1422 (i.e., December 1, 
1999 for most equipment leak components, and June 1, 2002 for emission 
points other than equipment leaks).
    (3) Determining what are and are not process changes. For purposes 
of paragraph (g) of this section, examples of process changes include, 
but are not limited to, additions in process equipment resulting in 
changes in production capacity; production of a product outside the 
scope of the compliance demonstration; or whenever there is a 
replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of 
paragraph (g) of this section, process changes do not include: Process 
upsets, unintentional temporary process changes, and changes that are 
within the equipment configuration and operating conditions documented 
in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by 
Sec. 63.1439(e)(5).
    (4) Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or 
add to their plant site or affected source. An owner or operator that 
changes or adds to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in 
paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, shall submit a report as 
specified in Sec. 63.1439(e)(7)(ii).
    (h) * * *
    (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the 
emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all 
times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or 
specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to 
which this subpart applies. These emission limitations shall not apply 
during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, during which the 
owner or operator shall follow the applicable provisions of the start-
up, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by Sec. 63.6(e)(3). However, 
if a start-up, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation of one 
portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of a 
particular emission point to comply with the emission limitations to 
which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to 
comply with the applicable emission limitations of this subpart during 
the start-up, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation. For 
example, if there is an overpressure in the reactor area, a storage 
vessel that is part of the affected source would still be required to be 
controlled in accordance with the storage tank provisions in 
Sec. 63.1432. Similarly, the degassing of a storage vessel would not 
affect the ability of a process vent to meet the emission limitations 
for process vents in Secs. 63.1425 through 63.1430.

                                * * * * *

    (4) During start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to 
the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions to the

[[Page 525]]

extent practical. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``excess 
emissions'' means emissions in excess of those that would have occurred 
if there were no start-up, shutdown, or malfunction and the owner or 
operator complied with the relevant provisions of this subpart. The 
measures to be taken shall be identified in the applicable start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan, and may include, but are not limited to, 
air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work 
practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the 
manner of operation of the affected source. Use of back-up control 
techniques is not required, but is allowed, if available.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1421  Delegation of authority.

    (a) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority to a 
State under section 112(l) of the Act, the authorities contained in 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be retained by the Administrator and 
not transferred to a State.
    (b) Authorities which will not be delegated to the States: the 
permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation, from 
Sec. 63.6(g), and the authority of Sec. 63.177.

extension to the appropriate U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
Regional Office at the addresses listed in Sec. 63.13 no later than 45 
days before December 1, 1999. The request for a compliance extension 
shall contain the information specified in Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), 
and (D). Unless the EPA Regional Office objects to the request for a 
compliance extension within 30 days after receipt of the request, the 
request shall be deemed approved.
    (3) If compliance with the compressor provisions of Sec. 63.164 
cannot reasonably be achieved without a process unit shutdown, as 
defined in Sec. 63.161, the owner or operator shall achieve compliance 
no later than June 1, 2001. The owner or operator who elects to use this 
provision shall submit a request for an extension of compliance in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this 
section.
    (4) Compliance with the compressor provisions of Sec. 63.164 shall 
occur not later than June 1, 2002 for any compressor meeting one or more

    (e) Pursuant to section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, an owner or 
operator may request an extension allowing the existing affected source 
up to 1 additional year to comply with section 112(d) standards. For 
purposes of this subpart, a request for an extension shall be submitted 
to the permitting authority as part of the operating permit application, 
or to the Administrator as a separate submittal, or as part of the 
Precompliance Report. Requests for extensions shall be submitted no 
later than 120 days prior to the compliance dates specified in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, or as specified elsewhere in 
this subpart. The dates specified in Sec. 63.6(i) for submittal of 
requests for extensions shall not apply to this subpart.
    (1) A request for an extension of compliance shall include the data 
described in Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D).
    (2) The requirements in Sec. 63.6(i)(8) through (14) shall govern 
the review and approval of requests for extensions of compliance with 
this subpart.
    (3) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request 
after the date specified in paragraph (e) of this section, provided that 
the need for the compliance extension arose after that date, and the 
need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner 
or operator. This request shall include, in addition to the information 
specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a statement of the 
reasons additional time is needed and the date when the owner or 
operator first learned of the problem.
    (f) Table 1 of this subpart specifies the requirements in 40 CFR 
part 63, subpart A (the General Provisions) that apply and those that do 
not apply to owners and operators of affected sources subject to this 
subpart. For the purposes of this subpart, Table 3 of 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart F is not applicable.
    (g) Table 2 of this subpart summarizes the provisions of 40 CFR part 
63, subparts F, G, and H (collectively known as the ``HON'') that apply 
and those that do not apply to owners and operators of affected sources 
subject to this subpart.
    (h)(1) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an 
affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the 
provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart I, is required to comply only with 
the provisions of this subpart.
    (2) Sources subject to the provisions in 40 CFR part 63, subpart I, 
that have elected to comply through a quality improvement program, as 
specified in Sec. 63.175 or Sec. 63.176 or both, may elect to continue 
these programs without interruption as a means of complying with this 
subpart. In other words, becoming subject to this subpart does not 
restart or reset the ``compliance clock'' as it relates to reduced 
burden earned through a quality improvement program.
    (i) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage 
vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart 
that is also subject to the 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb (Standards of 
Performance for Volatile Organic Liquid Storage Vessels (Including 
Petroleum Liquid Storage Vessels) for Which Construction, 
Reconstruction, or Modification Commenced after July 23, 1984) is 
required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the 
compliance dates specified in this section, that storage vessel shall no 
longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb.
    (j) After the compliance dates specified in this subpart, if any 
combustion device, recovery device or recapture device subject to this 
subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements for hazardous

[[Page 527]]

waste, disposal, and treatment facilities in 40 CFR part 264, subpart AA 
(Air Emission Standards for Process Vents) or subpart CC (Air Emission 
Standards for Tanks, Surface Impoundment, and Containers), the owner or 
operator may comply with either paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section. 
If, after the compliance dates specified in this subpart, any combustion 
device, recovery device, or recapture device subject to this subpart is 
subject to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements hazardous waste 
treatment, storage, and disposal facilities in 40 CFR part 265, subpart 
AA (Air Emission Standards for Process Vents) or subpart CC (Air 
Emission Standards for Tanks, Surface Impoundments, and Containers), the 
owner or operator may comply with either paragraph (j)(1) or (3) of this 
section. If the owner or operator elects to comply with either paragraph 
(j)(2) or (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall notify the 
Administrator of this choice in the Notification of Compliance Status 
required by Sec. 63.1439(e)(5).
    (1) The owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring, 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart.
    (2) The owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring, 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 264, with the 
following exception. All excursions, as defined in Sec. 63.1438(f), 
shall be reported in the periodic report. Compliance with this paragraph 
shall constitute compliance with the monitoring, recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements of this subpart.
    (3) The owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring and 
recordkeeping requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart AA or subpart CC, 
and the periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 264, subpart 
AA or subpart CC, that would apply to the device if the facility had 
final-permitted status, with the following exception. All excursions, as 
defined in Sec. 63.1438(f), shall be reported in the periodic report. 
Compliance with this paragraph shall constitute compliance with the 
monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart.
    (k) Paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section address instances in 
which requirements from other regulations overlap for the same heat 
exchange system(s) or waste management unit(s) that are subject to this 
subpart.
    (1) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, 
if a heat exchange system subject to this subpart is also subject to a 
standard identified in paragraph (k)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, 
compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in 
paragraph (k)(1)(i) or (ii) shall constitute compliance with the 
applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that heat exchange 
system.
    (i) 40 CFR part 63, subpart F.
    (ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with the HON 
heat exchange system requirements in Sec. 63.104 (e.g., 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart JJJ or U).
    (2) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, 
if any waste management unit subject to this subpart is also subject to 
a standard identified in paragraph (k)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, 
compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in 
paragraph (k)(2)(i) or (ii) shall constitute compliance with the 
applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that waste 
management unit.
    (i) 40 CFR part 63, subpart G.
    (ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with the HON 
process wastewater provisions in Secs. 63.132 through 63.147 (e.g., 
subpart JJJ or U).
    (l) All terms in this subpart that define a period of time for 
completion of required tasks (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annual), unless 
specified otherwise in the section or subsection that imposes the 
requirement, refer to the standard calendar periods, unless altered by 
mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator in 
accordance with paragraph (l)(1) of this section.
    (1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in this subpart for 
completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as 
specified in the General Provisions in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A (e.g., 
a period could begin on the compliance date or another date, rather than 
on the first day of the standard

[[Page 528]]

calendar period). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the 
revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request 
is not necessary for each recurring period.
    (2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar 
period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the 
period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified 
in paragraphs (l)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.
    (i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard 
calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there 
remains at least 2 weeks for tasks that shall be performed monthly, at 
least 1 month for tasks that shall be performed each quarter, or at 
least 3 months for tasks that shall be performed annually; or
    (ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end 
of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which 
the initial compliance deadline occurs.
    (3) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires 
completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an 
owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the 
specified period, provided that the task is conducted at a reasonable 
interval after completion of the task during the previous period.

concentration and is determined by the procedures in Sec. 63.144(b), 
except as provided in Sec. 63.1433(a)(2).
    Annual average flow rate, as used in conjunction with the wastewater 
provisions, is determined by the procedures in Sec. 63.144(c).
    Batch cycle means the step or steps, from start to finish, that 
occur in a batch unit operation.
    Batch unit operation means a unit operation involving intermittent 
or discontinuous feed into equipment, and, in general, involves the 
emptying of equipment after the batch cycle ceases and prior to 
beginning a new batch cycle. Mass, temperature, concentration and other 
properties of the process may vary with time. Addition of raw material 
and withdrawal of product do not simultaneously occur in a batch unit 
operation.
    Catalyst extraction means the removal of the catalyst using either 
solvent or physical extraction method.
    Construction means the on-site fabrication, erection, or 
installation of an affected source. Construction also means the on-site 
fabrication, erection, or installation of a process unit or a 
combination of process units which subsequently becomes an affected 
source or part of an affected source due to a change in primary product.
    Continuous record means documentation, either in hard copy or 
computer readable form, of data values measured at least once during 
approximately equal intervals of 15 minutes and recorded at the 
frequency specified in Sec. 63.1439(d).
    Continuous recorder is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that when the 
definition in Sec. 63.111 reads ``or records 15-minute or more frequent 
block average values,'' the phrase ``or records 1-hour or more frequent 
block average values'' shall apply for purposes of this subpart.
    Continuous unit operation means a unit operation where the inputs 
and outputs flow continuously. Continuous unit operations typically 
approach steady-state conditions. Continuous unit operations typically 
involve the simultaneous addition of raw material and withdrawal of the 
product.
    Control technique means any equipment or process control used for 
capturing, recovering, or oxidizing organic hazardous air pollutant 
vapors. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, absorbers, 
adsorbers, boilers, condensers, flares, incinerators, process heaters, 
and scrubbers, or any combination thereof. Process control includes 
extended cookout (as defined in this section). Condensers operating as 
reflux condensers that are necessary for processing, such as liquid 
level control, temperature control, or distillation operation, shall be 
considered inherently part of the process and will not be considered 
control techniques.
    Emission point means an individual process vent, storage vessel, 
wastewater stream, or equipment leak.
    Epoxide means a chemical compound consisting of a three-membered 
cyclic ether. Only emissions of epoxides listed in Table 4 of this 
subpart (i.e., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and

[[Page 530]]

epichlorohydrin) are regulated by the provisions of this subpart.
    Equipment leak means emissions of organic HAP from a connector, 
pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection 
system, open-ended valve or line, valve, surge control vessel, bottoms 
receiver, or instrumentation system in organic HAP service.
    Extended Cookout (ECO) means a control technique that reduces the 
amount of unreacted ethylene oxide (EO) and/or propylene oxide (PO) 
(epoxides) in the reactor. This is accomplished by allowing the product 
to react for a longer time period, thereby having less unreacted 
epoxides and reducing epoxides emissions that may have otherwise 
occurred.
    Flexible operation unit means a process unit that manufactures 
different chemical products by periodically alternating raw materials 
fed to the process unit or operating conditions at the process unit. 
These units are also referred to as campaign plants or blocked 
operations.

process vents in a PMPU from batch unit operations that are associated 
with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product 
that is not classified as a Group 1 combination of batch process vents.
    Group 1 continuous process vent means a process vent from a 
continuous unit operation that is associated with the use of a

accordance with Sec. 63.1428(h)(1), less than or equal to 1.0.
    Group 2 continuous process vent means a process vent from a 
continuous unit operation that is associated with the use of a 
nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product that is not 
classified as a Group 1 continuous process vent.

(liquid or gas) that is at least 5 percent by weight of total organic 
HAP (as defined in this section), as determined according to the 
provisions of Sec. 63.180(d). The provisions of Sec. 63.180(d) also 
specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP 
service.
    Initial start-up means the first time a new or reconstructed 
affected source begins production, or, for equipment added or changed as 
described in Sec. 63.1420(g), the first time the equipment is put into 
operation to produce a polyether polyol. Initial start-up does not 
include operation solely for testing

[[Page 531]]

equipment. Initial start-up does not include subsequent start-ups of an 
affected source or portion thereof following malfunctions or shutdowns 
or following changes in product for flexible operation units. Further, 
for purposes of Sec. 63.1422, initial start-up does not include 
subsequent start-ups of affected sources or portions thereof following 
malfunctions or process unit shutdowns.
    Maintenance wastewater is defined in Sec. 63.101, except that the 
term ``polyether polyol manufacturing process unit'' shall apply 
whenever the term ``chemical manufacturing process unit'' is used. 
Further, the generation of wastewater from the routine rinsing or 
washing of equipment in batch operation between batches is not 
maintenance wastewater, but is considered to be process wastewater, for 
the purposes of this subpart.
    Make or modify the product means to produce the polyether polyol by 
polymerization of epoxides or other cyclic ethers with compounds having 
one or more reactive hydrogens, and to incorporate additives (e.g., 
preservatives, antioxidants, or diluents) in order to maintain the 
quality of the finished products before shipping. Making and modifying 
the product for this regulation does not include grafting, polymerizing 
the polyol, or reacting it with compounds other than EO or PO.
    Maximum true vapor pressure is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that 
the terms ``transfer'' and ``transferred'' shall not apply for the 
purposes of this subpart.
    New process unit means a process unit for which the construction or 
reconstruction commenced after September 4, 1997.
    On-site or on site means, with respect to records required to be 
maintained by this subpart or required by another subpart referenced by 
this subpart, a location within the plant site where the affected source 
is located. On-site storage of records includes, but is not limited to, 
a location at the affected source or PMPU to which the records pertain 
or a location elsewhere at the plant site where the affected source is 
located.
    Operating day refers to the 24-hour period defined by the owner or 
operator in the Notification of Compliance Status required by 
Sec. 63.1439(e)(5). That 24-hour period may be from midnight to midnight 
or another 24-hour period. The operating day is the 24-hour period for 
which daily average monitoring values are determined.
    Organic hazardous air pollutant(s) (organic HAP) means one or more 
of the chemicals listed in Table 4 of this subpart, or any other 
chemical which:
    (1) Is knowingly produced or introduced into the manufacturing 
process other than as an impurity; and
    (2) Is listed in Table 2 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart F in the HON.
    Polyether polyol means a compound formed through the polymerization 
of EO or PO or other cyclic ethers with compounds having one or more 
reactive hydrogens (i.e., a hydrogen atom bonded to nitrogen, oxygen, 
phosphorus, sulfur, etc.) to form polyethers (i.e., compounds with two 
or more ether bonds). This definition of polyether polyol excludes 
cellulose ethers (such as methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, 
hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl 
methyl cellulose) and materials regulated under 40 CFR part 63, subparts 
F, G, and H (the HON), such as glycols and glycol ethers.
    Polyether polyol manufacturing process unit (PMPU) means a process 
unit that manufactures a polyether polyol as its primary product, or a 
process unit designated as a polyether polyol manufacturing unit in 
accordance with Sec. 63.1420(e)(2). A polyether polyol manufacturing 
process unit consists of more than one unit operation. This collection 
of equipment includes purification systems, reactors and their 
associated product separators and recovery devices, distillation units 
and their associated distillate receivers and recovery devices, other 
associated unit operations, storage vessels, surge control vessels, 
bottoms receivers, product transfer racks, connected ducts and piping, 
combustion, recovery, or recapture devices or systems, and the equipment 
(i.e., all pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, 
sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, 
connectors, and instrumentation systems that are associated with the 
PMPU) that are subject

[[Page 532]]

to the equipment leak provisions as specified in Sec. 63.1434.
    Pressure decay curve is the graph of the reactor pressure versus 
time from the point when epoxide feed is stopped until the reactor 
pressure is constant, indicating that most of the epoxide has reacted 
out of the vapor and liquid phases. This curve shall be determined with 
no leaks or vents from the reactor.
    Primary product is defined in and determined by the procedures 
specified in Sec. 63.1420(e).
    Process unit means a collection of equipment assembled and connected 
by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture a product.
    Process vent means a point of emission from a unit operation having 
a gaseous stream that is discharged to the atmosphere either directly or 
after passing through one or more combustion, recovery, or recapture 
devices. A process vent from a continuous unit operation is a gaseous 
emission stream containing more than 0.005 weight-percent total organic 
HAP. A process vent from a batch unit operation is a gaseous emission 
stream containing more than 225 kilograms per year (500 pounds per year) 
of organic HAP emissions. Unit operations that may have process vents 
are condensers, distillation units, reactors, or other unit operations 
within the PMPU. Process vents exclude pressure relief valve discharges, 
gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system(s), and leaks from equipment 
regulated under Sec. 63.1434. A gaseous emission stream is no longer 
considered to be a process vent after the stream has been controlled and 
monitored in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart.
    Process wastewater means wastewater which, during manufacturing or 
processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the 
production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished 
product, by-product, or waste product. Examples are product tank 
drawdown or feed tank drawdown; water formed during a chemical reaction 
or used as a reactant; water used to wash impurities from organic 
products or reactants; equipment washes between batches in a batch 
process; water used to cool or quench organic vapor streams through 
direct contact; and condensed steam from jet ejector systems pulling 
vacuum on vessels containing organics.
    Product means a compound or material which is manufactured by a 
process unit. By-products, isolated intermediates, impurities, wastes, 
and trace contaminants are not considered products.
    Product class means a group of polyether polyols with a similar 
pressure decay curve (or faster pressure decay curves) that are 
manufactured within a given set of operating conditions representing the 
decline in pressure versus time. All products within a product class 
shall have an essentially similar pressure decay curve, and operate 
within a given set of operating conditions. These operating conditions 
are: a minimum reaction temperature; the number of -OH groups in the 
polyol; a minimum catalyst concentration; the type of catalyst (e.g., 
self-catalyzed, base catalyst, or acid catalyst); the epoxide ratio, or 
a range for that ratio; and the reaction conditions of the system (e.g., 
the size of the reactor, or the size of the batch).
    Reactor liquid means the compound or material made in the reactor, 
even though the substance may be transferred to another vessel. This 
material may require further modifications before becoming a final 
product, in which case the reactor liquid is classified as an 
``intermediate.'' This material may be complete at this stage, in which 
case the reactor liquid is classified as a ``product.''
    Reconstruction means the replacement of components of an affected 
source or of a previously unaffected stationary source that becomes an 
affected source as a result of the replacement, to such an extent that:
    (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent 
of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a 
comparable new source; and
    (2) It is technologically and economically feasible for the 
reconstructed source to meet the provisions of this subpart.

[[Page 533]]

    Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and 
normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel value 
(i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, or for sale for fuel 
value, use, or reuse. Examples of equipment that may be recovery devices 
include absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers (except reflux 
condensers), oil-water separators or organic-water separators, or 
organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin film 
evaporation units. For the purposes of the monitoring, recordkeeping, or 
reporting requirements of this subpart, recapture devices are considered 
to be recovery devices.
    Residual is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that when the definition 
in Sec. 63.111 uses the term ``Table 9 compounds,'' the term ``organic 
HAP listed in Table 9 of subpart G'' shall apply, for the purposes of 
this subpart.
    Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an affected source, a 
PMPU within an affected source, a waste management unit or unit 
operation within an affected source, equipment required or used to 
comply with this subpart, or the emptying or degassing of a storage 
vessel. The purposes for a shutdown may include, but are not limited to, 
periodic maintenance, replacement of equipment, or equipment repairs. 
Shutdown does not include the normal periods between batch cycles. For 
continuous unit operations, shutdown includes transitional conditions 
due to changes in product for flexible operation units. For batch unit 
operations, shutdown does not include transitional conditions due to 
changes in product for flexible operation units. For purposes of the 
wastewater provisions, shutdown does not include the routine rinsing or 
washing of equipment between batch cycles.
    Start-up means the setting into operation of an affected source, a 
PMPU within the affected source, a waste management unit or unit 
operation within an affected source, equipment required or used to 
comply with this subpart, or a storage vessel after emptying and 
degassing. For all processes, start-up includes initial start-up and 
operation solely for testing equipment. Start-up does not include the 
recharging of batch unit operations. For continuous unit operations, 
start-up includes transitional conditions due to changes in product for 
flexible operation units. For batch unit operations, start-up does not 
include transitional conditions due to changes in product for flexible 
operation units.
    Steady-state conditions means that all variables (temperatures, 
pressures, volumes, flow rates, etc.) in a process do not vary 
significantly with time; minor fluctuations about constant mean values 
may occur.
    Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
liquids that contain one or more organic HAP. Storage vessels do not 
include:
    (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 
kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
    (3) Vessels with capacities smaller than 38 cubic meters;
    (4) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that 
contains no organic HAP, or organic HAP as impurities only;
    (5) Surge control vessels and bottoms receiver tanks;
    (6) Wastewater storage tanks; and
    (7) Storage vessels assigned to another process unit regulated under 
another subpart of part 63.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) are those compounds, excluding methane 
and ethane, measured according to the procedures of Method 18 or Method 
25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    Unit operation means one or more pieces of process equipment used to 
make a single change to the physical or chemical characteristics of one 
or more process streams. Unit operations include, but are not limited 
to, reactors, distillation units, extraction columns, absorbers, 
decanters, condensers, and filtration equipment.
    Vent stream, as used in reference to process vents, means the 
emissions from a process vent.
    Waste management unit is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that when 
the definition in Sec. 63.111 uses the term ``chemical manufacturing 
process unit,'' the term ``PMPU'' shall apply for the purposes of this 
subpart.

[[Page 534]]

    Wastewater means water that:
    (1) Contains either
    (i) An annual average concentration of organic HAP listed in Table 4 
of this subpart of at least 5 parts per million by weight and has an 
annual average flow rate of 0.02 liter per minute or greater, or

shall be measured at approximately equal intervals of about 15 minutes 
during each 1-hour run. The organic HAP concentration (of the HAP of 
concern) shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated 
sample over the duration of each l-hour test run, or from grab samples 
collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (at 
approximately equal intervals of about 15 minutes). If an integrated

adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. For gas 
streams from continuous unit operations, the organic HAP concentration 
or control efficiency used to determine compliance shall be the average 
organic HAP concentration or control efficiency of the three test runs.
    (B) Testing of process vents from batch unit operations shall be 
conducted at absolute worst-case conditions or hypothetical worst-case 
conditions, as defined in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B)(1) through (5) of this 
section. Worst-case conditions are limited to the maximum production 
allowed in a State or Federal permit or regulation and the conditions 
specified in Sec. 63.1437(a)(1). Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall 
be measured at 15-minute intervals, or at least once during the emission 
episode. The organic HAP or TOC concentration shall be determined from 
samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of the test, 
or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate 
measurements (at approximately equal intervals of about 15 minutes). If 
an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling 
rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow 
rate.
    (1) Absolute worst-case conditions are defined by the criteria 
presented in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section if the 
maximum load is the most challenging condition for the control device. 
Otherwise, absolute worst-case conditions are defined by the conditions 
in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (i) The period in which the inlet to the control device will contain 
at least 50 percent of the maximum HAP load (in lbs) capable of being 
vented to the control device over any 8-hour period. An emission profile 
as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(3)(i) of this section shall be 
used to identify the 8-hour period that includes the maximum projected 
HAP load.
    (ii) A period of time in which the inlet to the control device will 
contain the highest HAP mass loading rate capable of being vented to the 
control device. An emission profile as described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(i)(B)(3)(i) of this section shall be used to identify the period 
of maximum HAP loading.
    (iii) The period of time when the HAP loading or stream composition 
(including non-HAP) is most challenging for the control device. These 
conditions include, but are not limited to the following: periods when 
the stream contains the highest combined VOC and HAP load described by 
the emission profiles in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(3) of this section; 
periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach limits 
of solubility for scrubbing media; or periods when the streams contain 
HAP constituents that approach limits of adsorptivity for carbon 
adsorption systems.
    (2) Hypothetical worst-case conditions are simulated test conditions 
that, at a minimum, contain the highest hourly HAP load of emissions 
that would be predicted to be vented to the control device from the 
emissions profile described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(3)(ii) or (iii) of 
this section.
    (3) The owner or operator shall develop an emission profile for the 
vent to the control device that describes the characteristics of the 
vent stream at the inlet to the control device under worst case 
conditions. The emission profile shall be developed based on any one of 
the procedures described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B)(3) (i) through (iii) 
of this section, as required by paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
    (i) The emission profile shall consider all emission episodes that 
could contribute to the vent stack for a period of time that is 
sufficient to include all processes venting to the stack and shall 
consider production scheduling.

[[Page 541]]

The profile shall describe the HAP load to the device that equals the 
highest sum of emissions from the episodes that can vent to the control 
device in any given period, not to exceed 1 hour. Emissions per episode 
shall be divided by the duration of the episode only if the duration of 
the episode is longer than 1 hour, and emissions per episode shall be 
calculated using the procedures specified in Equation 1:

exceed the highest emissions that would be expected under actual 
processing conditions. The profile shall describe equipment 
configurations used to generate the emission events, volatility of 
materials processed in the equipment, and the rationale used to identify 
and characterize the emission events. The emissions may be based on 
using compounds more volatile than compounds actually used in the 
process(es), and the emissions may be generated from all equipment in 
the process(es) or only selected equipment.
    (iii) The emission profile shall consider the capture and control 
system limitations and the highest emissions that can be routed to the 
control device, based on maximum flow rate and concentrations possible 
because of limitations on conveyance and control equipment (e.g., fans, 
LEL alarms and safety bypasses).
    (4) Three runs, each at a minimum of the complete duration of the 
batch venting episode or 1 hour, whichever is shorter, and a maximum of 
8 hours, are required for performance testing. Each run shall occur over 
the same worst-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of 
this section.

the worst case emission episode(s) shall represent a period of time in 
which a process vent from the batch cycle or combination of cycles (if 
more than one cycle is vented through the same process vent) will 
require the maximum heat removal capacity, in Btu/hr, to cool the 
process vent stream to a temperature that, upon calculation of HAP 
concentration, will yield the required removal efficiency for the entire 
cycle. The calculation of maximum heat load shall be based on the 
emission profile described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(3) of this section 
that will allow calculation of sensible and latent heat loads.
    (ii) The concentration of either TOC (minus methane or ethane) or 
total organic HAP (of the HAP of concern) shall be calculated according

concentrations of the individual components and shall be computed for 
each run using Equation 2:

uncontrolled epoxide emissions prior to the onset of an extended cook 
out.
    (1) Exemptions. The owner or operator is not required to determine 
uncontrolled organic HAP emissions for process vents in a PMPU if the 
conditions in paragraph (d)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section are 
met.
    (i) For PMPUs where all process vents subject to the epoxide 
emission reduction requirements of Sec. 63.1425(b) are controlled at all 
times using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device, or extended 
cookout, the owner or operator is not required to determine uncontrolled 
epoxide emissions.
    (ii) For PMPUs where the combination of process vents from batch 
unit operations associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to 
make or modify the product is subject to the

[[Page 544]]

Group 1 requirements of Sec. 63.1425(c)(1), the owner or operator is not 
required to determine uncontrolled nonepoxide organic HAP emissions for 
those process vents if every process vent from a batch unit operation 
associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the 
product in the PMPU is controlled at all times using a combustion, 
recovery, or recapture device.
    (iii) For PMPUs where all process vents associated with catalyst 
extraction that are subject to the organic emission reduction 
requirements of Sec. 63.1425(d)(2) are controlled at all times using a 
combustion, recovery, or recapture device, the owner or operator is not 
required to determine uncontrolled organic HAP emissions for those 
process vents.
    (2) Process vents from batch unit operations. The uncontrolled 
organic HAP emissions from an individual batch cycle for each process 
vent from a batch unit operation shall be determined using the 
procedures in the NESHAP for Group I Polymers and Resins (40 CFR part 
63, subpart U), Sec. 63.488(b)(1) through (9). Uncontrolled emissions 
from process vents from batch unit operations shall be determined after

shall be determined after the exit from the continuous unit operation 
but before any recovery device.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall determine the hourly uncontrolled 
organic HAP emissions from each process vent from a continuous unit 
operation in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, 
except that the emission rate shall be determined at the location 
specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.

The owner or operator shall determine the organic HAP emission reduction 
for process vents in a PMPU that are complying with 
Sec. 63.1425(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (c)(1)(ii), or (d)(2) using Equation 
7. The organic HAP emission reduction shall be determined for each group 
of process vents subject to the same paragraph (i.e., paragraph (b), 
(c), or (d)) of Sec. 63.1425. For instance, process vents that emit 
epoxides are subject to paragraph (b) of Sec. 63.1425. Therefore, if the 
owner or operator of an existing affected source is complying with the 
98 percent reduction requirement in Sec. 63.1425(b)(2)(ii), the organic 
HAP (i.e., epoxide) emission reduction shall be determined for the group 
of vents in a PMPU that are subject to this paragraph.

specified below in paragraph (e)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this 
section.

    (f) Design evaluation. A design evaluation is required for those 
control techniques that receive less than 10 tons per year (9.1 
megagrams per year) of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from one or

<R05>
Sec. 63.1427  Process vent requirements for processes using extended cookout as an epoxide emission reduction technique.

    (a) Applicability of extended cookout requirements. Owners or 
operators of affected sources that produce polyether polyols using 
epoxides, and that are using ECO as a control technique to reduce 
epoxide emissions in order to comply with percent emission reduction 
requirements in Sec. 63.1425(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) shall comply with 
the provisions of this section. The owner or operator that is using ECO 
in order to comply with the emission factor requirements in 
Sec. 63.1425(b)(1)(iii) or Sec. 63.1425(b)(2)(iv) shall demonstrate that 
the specified emission factor is achieved by following the requirements 
in Sec. 63.1431. If additional control devices are used to further 
reduce the HAP emissions from a process vent already controlled by ECO, 
then the owner or operator shall also comply with the testing, 
monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements associated with 
the additional control device, as specified in Secs. 63.1426, 63.1429, 
and 63.1430, respectively.
    (1) For each product class, the owner or operator shall determine 
the batch cycle percent epoxide emission reduction for the most 
difficult to control product in the product class, where the most 
difficult to control product is the

[[Page 548]]

polyether polyol that is manufactured with the slowest pressure decay 
curve.
    (2) The owner or operator may determine the batch cycle percent 
epoxide emission reduction by directly measuring the concentration of 
the unreacted epoxide, or by using process knowledge, reaction kinetics, 
and engineering knowledge, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of 
this section.
    (i) If the owner or operator elects to use any method other than 
direct measurement, the epoxide concentration shall be determined by 
direct measurement for one product from each product class and compared 
with the epoxide concentration determined using the selected estimation 
method, with the exception noted in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section. If the difference between the directly determined epoxide 
concentration and the calculated epoxide concentration is less than 25 
percent, then the selected estimation method will be considered to be an 
acceptable alternative to direct measurement for that class.
    (ii) If uncontrolled epoxide emissions prior to the end of the ECO 
are less than 10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year), the owner or 
operator is not required to perform the direct measurement required in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Uncontrolled epoxide emissions 
prior to the end of the ECO shall be determined by the procedures in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (b) Define the end of epoxide feed. The owner or operator shall 
define the end of the epoxide feed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) 
or (2) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall determine the concentration of 
epoxide in the reactor liquid at the point in time when all epoxide has 
been added to the reactor and prior to any venting. This concentration 
shall be determined in accordance with the procedures in paragraph 
(f)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) If the conditions in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of 
this section are met, the end of the epoxide feed may be defined by the 
reactor epoxide partial pressure at the point in time when all epoxide 
reactants have been added to the reactor. This reactor epoxide partial 
pressure shall be determined in accordance with the procedures in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (i) No epoxide is emitted before the end of the ECO;
    (ii) Extended cookout is the only control technique to reduce 
epoxide emissions; and
    (iii) The owner or operator elects to determine the percent epoxide 
emission reduction for the ECO using reactor epoxide partial pressure in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (c) Define the onset of the ECO. The owner or operator shall 
calculate the uncontrolled emissions for the batch cycle by calculating 
the epoxide emissions, if any, prior to the onset of the ECO, plus the 
epoxide emissions at the onset of the ECO. The onset of the ECO is 
defined as the point in time when the combined unreacted epoxide 
concentration in the reactor liquid is equal to 25 percent of the 
concentration of epoxides at the end of the epoxide feed, which was 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) The uncontrolled epoxide emissions for the batch cycle shall be 
determined using Equation 8.

Sec. 63.1428  Process vent requirements for group determination of PMPUs using a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product.

    (a) Process vents from batch unit operations. The owner or operator 
shall determine, for each PMPU located at an affected source, if the 
combination of all process vents from batch unit operations that are 
associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the 
product is a Group 1 combination of batch process vents, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1423. The annual uncontrolled nonepoxide organic HAP emissions, 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and annual 
average flow rate, determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section, shall be determined for all process vents from batch unit 
operations associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make 
or modify the product, with the exception of those vents specified in 
paragraph (i) of this section, at the location after all applicable 
control techniques have been applied to reduce epoxide emissions in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) If the owner or operator is using a combustion, recovery, or 
recapture device to reduce epoxide emissions, this location shall be at 
the exit of the combustion, recovery, or recapture device.
    (2) If the owner or operator is using ECO to reduce epoxide 
emissions, this location shall be at the exit from the batch unit 
operation. For the purpose of these determinations, the primary 
condenser operating as a reflux condenser on a reactor or distillation 
column shall be considered part of the unit operation.
    (b) Determination of annual nonepoxide organic HAP emissions. The 
owner or operator shall determine, for each PMPU, the total annual 
nonepoxide organic HAP emissions from the combination of all process 
vents from batch unit operations that are associated with the use of a 
nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product in accordance with 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) The annual nonepoxide organic HAP emissions for each process 
vent from a batch unit operation associated with the use of a nonepoxide 
organic HAP to make or modify the product shall be determined using the 
batch process vent procedures in the NESHAP for Group I Polymers and 
Resins (40 CFR part 63, subpart U), Sec. 63.488(b).
    (2) The owner or operator shall sum the annual nonepoxide organic 
HAP emissions from all individual process vents from batch unit 
operations in a PMPU, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, to obtain the total nonepoxide organic HAP emissions from 
the combination of process vents associated with the use of a nonepoxide 
organic HAP to make or modify the product, for the PMPU.
    (c) Minimum emission level exemption. If the annual emissions of TOC 
or nonepoxide organic HAP from the combination of process vents from 
batch unit operations that are associated with the use of nonepoxide 
organic HAP to make or modify a polyether polyol for a PMPU are less 
than 11,800 kg/yr, the owner or operator of that PMPU is not required to 
comply with the provisions in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
    (d) Determination of average flow rate and annual average flow rate. 
The owner or operator shall determine, for each PMPU, the total annual 
average flow rate for the combination of all process vents from batch 
unit operations that are associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic 
HAP to make or modify a product in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(2) of this section.
    (1) The annual average flow rate for each process vent from batch 
unit operations that is associated with the use

[[Page 557]]

of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product shall be 
determined using the batch process vent procedures in the NESHAP for 
Group I Polymers and Resins (40 CFR part 63, subpart U), Sec. 63.488(e).
    (2) The owner or operator shall sum the annual average flow rates 
from the individual process vents from batch unit operations in a PMPU, 
determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to 
obtain the total annual average flow rate for the combination of process 
vents associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or 
modify the product, for the PMPU.
    (e) Determination of cutoff flow rate. For each PMPU at an affected 
source that uses nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product, 
the owner or operator shall calculate the cutoff flow rate using 
Equation 14.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JN99.013

Where:

CFR = Cutoff flow rate, standard cubic meters per minute (scmm).
AE = Annual TOC or nonepoxide organic HAP emissions from the combination 
          of process vents from batch unit operations that are 
          associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or 
          modify the product, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
          section, kg/yr.

    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Process changes affecting Group 2 combinations of process vents 
in a PMPU that are from batch unit operations. Whenever process changes, 
as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, are made that affect a 
Group 2 combination of batch process vents and that could reasonably be 
expected to change the group status from Group 2 to Group 1, the owner 
or operator shall comply with paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (1) Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, 
increases in production capacity or production rate, changes in 
feedstock type or catalyst type; or whenever there is replacement, 
removal, or modification of recovery equipment considered part of the 
batch unit operation. Any change that results in an increase in the 
annual nonepoxide organic HAP emissions from the estimate used in the 
previous group determination constitutes a process change for the 
purpose of these provisions. Process changes do not include: process 
upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; and changes that are 
within the margin of variation on which the original group determination 
was based.
    (2) For each process affected by a process change, the owner or 
operator shall redetermine the group status by repeating the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, as applicable, 
and determining if the combination of process vents is a Group 1 
combination of batch process vents, as defined in Sec. 63.1423. 
Alternatively, engineering assessment, as described in 
Sec. 63.488(b)(6)(i), may be used to determine the effects of the 
process change.
    (3) Based on the results of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the 
owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (g)(3)(i) or (ii) 
of this section.
    (i) If the redetermination described in paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section indicates that the group status of the combination of process 
vents from batch unit operations in a PMPU that are associated with the 
use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product changes from 
Group 2 to Group 1 as a result of the process change, the owner or 
operator shall submit a report as specified in 
Sec. 63.1439(e)(6)(iii)(D)(1) and shall comply with Group 1 combination 
of batch process vents provisions in this subpart, as specified in 
Sec. 63.1425(c)(1).
    (ii) If the redetermination described in paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section indicates no change in group status, the owner or operator is 
not required to submit a report.
    (h) Process vents from continuous unit operations. (1) The owner or 
operator

[[Page 558]]

shall determine the total resource effectiveness (TRE) index value for 
each process vent from a continuous unit operation that is associated 
with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product. To 
determine the TRE index value, the owner or operator shall conduct a TRE 
determination and calculate the TRE index value according to the HON 
process vent group determination procedures in Sec. 63.115(d)(1) or (2) 
and the TRE equation in Sec. 63.115(d)(3). The TRE index value shall be 
determined at the location after all applicable control techniques have 
been applied to reduce epoxide emissions in accordance with paragraph 
(h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.
    (i) If the owner or operator uses one or more nonepoxide recovery 
devices after all control techniques to reduce epoxide emissions, this 
location shall be after the last nonepoxide recovery device.
    (ii) If the owner or operator does not use a nonepoxide recovery 
device after a combustion, recovery, or recapture device to reduce 
epoxide emissions, this location shall be at the exit of the combustion, 
recovery, or recapture device.
    (iii) If the owner or operator does not use a nonepoxide recovery 
device after extended cookout to reduce epoxide emissions, this location 
shall be at the exit from the continuous unit operation. For the purpose 
of these determinations, the primary condenser operating as a reflux 
condenser on a reactor or distillation column shall be considered part 
of the unit operation.
    (2) The owner or operator of a Group 2 continuous process vent shall 
recalculate the TRE index value as necessary to determine whether the 
process vent is Group 1 or Group 2, whenever process changes are made 
that could reasonably be expected to change the process vent to Group 1. 
Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, increases 
in production capacity or production rate, changes in feedstock type or 
catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of 
recovery equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, process changes do 
not include: process upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; 
and changes that are within the range on which the original TRE 
calculation was based.
    (i) The TRE index value shall be recalculated based on measurements 
of process vent stream flow rate, TOC, and nonepoxide organic HAP 
concentrations, and heating values as specified in the HON process vent 
group determination procedures in Sec. 63.115(a), (b), (c), and (d), as 
applicable, or on best engineering assessment of the effects of the 
change. Engineering assessments shall meet the specifications in 
Sec. 63.115(d)(1).
    (ii) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 
1.0, or, where the TRE index value before the process change was greater 
than 4.0 and the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 
4.0 but greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall submit a report as 
specified in the process vent reporting and recordkeeping provisions in 
Sec. 63.1430(j) or (k), and shall comply with the appropriate provisions 
in the process vent control requirements in Sec. 63.1425 by the dates 
specified in Sec. 63.1422 (the section describing compliance dates for 
sources subject to this subpart).
    (iii) Where the recalculated TRE index value is greater than 4.0, 
the owner or operator is not required to submit a report.
    (i) Combination of process vents from batch unit operations and 
process vents from continuous unit operations. If an owner or operator 
combines a process vent from a batch unit operation that is associated 
with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product 
with a process vent from a continuous unit operation that is associated 
with the use of a nonepoxide prior to the epoxide control technique, or 
prior to a nonepoxide recovery device that is after the epoxide control 
technique, then the provisions in paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this 
section shall apply.
    (1) The process vent from the batch unit operation is not required 
to be included in the group determination required by paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section.

[[Page 559]]

    (2) The TRE index value of the combined stream shall be determined 
in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, and the TRE index 
value shall be calculated during a period when nonepoxide organic HAP 
emissions are being generated by the batch unit operation.

temperature after each regeneration and within 15 minutes of completing 
any cooling cycle are required.
    (7) As an alternative to paragraphs (a)(4) through (6) of this 
section, the owner or operator may install an organic monitoring device 
equipped with a continuous recorder.
    (b) Alternative parameters. An owner or operator of a process vent 
may request approval to monitor parameters other than those listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The request shall be submitted according 
to the procedures specified in the process vent reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements in Sec. 63.1430(j) and the alternative 
parameter monitoring reporting requirements in Sec. 63.1439(f). Approval 
shall be requested if the owner or operator:
    (1) Uses a combustion device other than an incinerator, boiler, 
process heater, or flare; or
    (2) For a Group 2 continuous process vent, maintains a TRE greater 
than 1.0 but less than or equal to 4.0 without a recovery device or with 
a recovery device other than the recovery devices listed in paragraph 
(a) of this section; or
    (3) Uses one of the combustion, recovery, or recapture devices 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section, but seeks to monitor a 
parameter other than those specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Monitoring of bypass lines. The owner or operator of a process 
vent using a process vent system that contains bypass lines that could 
divert a process vent stream away from the combustion, recovery, or 
recapture device used to comply with the process vent control 
requirements in Sec. 63.1425(b), (c), or (d) shall comply with paragraph 
(c)(1) or (2) of this section. Equipment such as low leg drains, high

(c)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that 
takes a reading at least once at approximately equal intervals of about 
15 minutes. Records shall be generated as specified in the process vent 
reporting and recordkeeping provisions in Sec. 63.1430(d)(3). The flow 
indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that 
could divert emissions away from the combustion, recovery, or recapture 
device and to the atmosphere; or
    (2) Secure the bypass line valve in the non-diverting position with 
a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of 
the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every 
month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the non-diverting 
position and emissions are not diverted through the bypass line. Records 
shall be generated as specified in the process vent reporting and 
recordkeeping provisions in Sec. 63.1430(d)(4)(i).
    (d) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. Parameter 
monitoring levels for process vents from continuous or batch unit 
operations using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device to comply 
with the process vent control requirements in Sec. 63.1425(b), (c), or

reporting requirements for process vents from batch unit operations), 
that indicates that the combustion, recovery, or recapture device is 
operated in a manner to ensure compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart. The level shall be established in accordance with the 
procedures specified in the process vent control requirements in 
Sec. 63.1430(d). The

[[Page 561]]

level may be based upon a prior performance test conducted for 
determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by the EPA, and the 
owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test under 
the process vent requirements for determining organic HAP concentration, 
control efficiency, and aggregated organic HAP emission reductions in 
Sec. 63.1426, provided that the prior performance test meets the 
conditions of Sec. 63.1426(b)(3).
    (2) The established level, along with supporting documentation, 
shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status or the 
operating permit application as required in the Notification of 
Compliance Status requirements in Sec. 63.1439(e)(5) or in the operating 
permit application requirements in Sec. 63.1439(e)(8), respectively.
    (3) The operating day shall be defined as part of establishing the 
parameter monitoring level and shall be submitted with the information 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The definition of operating day 
shall specify the time(s) at which an operating day begins and ends.

month period that begins 3 months before the performance test and ends 3 
months after the performance test.
    (ii) Causing damage to equipment; necessitating that the owner or 
operator make a product that does not meet an existing specification for 
sale to a customer; or necessitating that the owner or operator make a 
product in excess of demand.
    (iii) Causing plant or testing personnel to be subject to unsafe 
conditions. Owners or operators that limit testing based on this 
paragraph shall maintain documentation that demonstrates the nature of 
the unsafe conditions and explains measures considered by the owner or 
operator to overcome these conditions. If requested, this documentation 
shall be provided to the Administrator.
    (2) When the General Provisions' data analysis, recordkeeping, and 
reporting requirements in Sec. 63.7(g) refer to the Notification of 
Compliance Status requirements in Sec. 63.9(h), the Notification of 
Compliance Status requirements in Sec. 63.1439(e)(5) shall instead 
apply, for the purposes of this subpart.
    (3) Because the General Provisions' site-specific test plan in 
Sec. 63.7(c)(3) is not required, the General Provisions' requirement for 
the Administrator to approve or deny site-specific test plans, in 
Sec. 63.7(h)(4)(ii), is not applicable for the purposes of this subpart.

[[Page 575]]

    (4) The owner or operator of an affected source shall provide the 
Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, 
except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator 
the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for 
an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to 
operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance 
test, the owner or operator of an affected source shall notify the 
Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) as soon as possible 
of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 
days prior notice of the rescheduled test date of the performance test, 
or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator (or delegated 
State or local agency) by mutual agreement.
    (b) Data shall be reduced in accordance with the EPA approved 
methods specified in the applicable subpart or, if other test methods 
are used, the data and methods shall be validated according to the 
protocol in Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, if an owner 
or operator of an affected source uses a flare to comply with any of the 
requirements of this subpart, the owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. The owner or operator is 
not required to conduct a performance test to determine percent emission 
reduction or outlet organic HAP or TOC concentration. If a compliance 
demonstration has been conducted previously for a flare, using the 
techniques specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, 
that compliance demonstration may be used to satisfy the requirements of 
this paragraph if either no deliberate process changes have been made 
since the compliance demonstration, or the results of the compliance 
demonstration reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes.
    (1) Conduct a visible emission test using the techniques specified 
in Sec. 63.11(b)(4) of the General Provisions;
    (2) Determine the net heating value of the gas being combusted, 
using the techniques specified in Sec. 63.11(b)(6) of the General 
Provisions; and
    (3) Determine the exit velocity using the techniques specified in 
either Sec. 63.11(b)(7)(i) (and Sec. 63.11(b)(7)(iii), where applicable) 
or Sec. 63.11(b)(8) of the General Provisions, as appropriate.

Sec. 63.1438  Parameter monitoring levels and excursions.

    (a) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. The owner or 
operator of a combustion, recovery, or recapture device that has one or 
more parameter monitoring level requirements specified under this 
subpart shall establish a maximum or minimum level for each measured 
parameter. If a performance test is required by this subpart for a 
combustion, recovery, or recapture device, the owner or operator shall 
use the procedures in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to 
establish the parameter monitoring level(s). If a performance test is 
not required by this subpart for a combustion, recovery, or recapture 
device, the owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (b), 
(c), or (d) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring 
levels.

[[Page 576]]

When using the procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section, the owner or operator shall submit the information specified in 
Sec. 63.1439(e)(4)(viii) for review and approval, as part of the 
Precompliance Report.
    (1) The owner or operator shall operate combustion, recovery, and 
recapture devices such that the daily average value of monitored 
parameters remains at or above the minimum established level, or remains 
at or below the maximum established level, except as otherwise provided 
in this subpart.
    (2) As specified in Sec. 63.1439(e)(5)(ii), all established levels, 
along with their supporting documentation and the definition of an 
operating day, shall be submitted as part of the Notification of 
Compliance Status.
    (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring 
parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable 
provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subparts A, F, G, or H.
    (b) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based exclusively 
on performance tests. In cases where a performance test is required by 
this subpart, or the owner or operator of the affected source elects to 
do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, 
and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring 
level for a combustion, recovery, or recapture device based exclusively 
on parameter values measured during the performance test, the owner or 
operator of the affected source shall comply with the procedures in 
paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.
    (1) Process vents from continuous unit operations. During initial 
compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be continuously 
monitored during the required 1-hour runs for process vents from 
continuous unit operations. The monitoring level(s) shall then be 
established as the average of the maximum (or minimum) point values from 
the three 1-hour test runs. The average of the maximum values shall be 
used when establishing a maximum level, and the average of the minimum 
values shall be used when establishing a minimum level.
    (2) Process vents from batch unit operations. For process vents from 
batch unit operations, during initial compliance testing, the 
appropriate parameter shall be monitored continuously during the entire 
test period. The monitoring level(s) shall be those established during 
from the compliance test.
    (c) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on 
performance tests, supplemented by engineering assessments and/or 
manufacturer's recommendations. Parameter monitoring levels established 
under this paragraph shall be based on the parameter values measured 
during the performance test supplemented by engineering assessments and/
or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required 
to be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter values. The 
information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section shall 
be provided in the Notification of Compliance Status.
    (1) The specific level of the monitored parameter(s) for each 
emission point.
    (2) The rationale for the specific level for each parameter for each 
emission point, including any data and calculations used to develop the 
level and a description of why the level indicates proper operation of 
the combustion, recovery, or recapture device.
    (d) Establishment of parameter monitoring based on engineering 
assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. If a performance test 
is not required by this subpart for a combustion, recovery, or recapture 
device, the maximum or minimum level may be based solely on engineering 
assessments and/or manufacturers' recommendations. As required in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the determined level and all 
supporting documentation shall be provided in the Notification of 
Compliance Status.
    (e) Monitoring violations. (1) With the exception of excursions 
excused in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, each 
excursion, as defined in paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (f)(2)(i)(A), (f)(2)(ii), 
(f)(3)(i), and (f)(4) of this section, constitutes a violation of the 
provisions of this subpart in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i), (ii), 
or (iii) of this section.

[[Page 577]]

    (i) For each condenser, each excursion constitutes a violation of 
the emission limit.
    (ii) For each recovery or recapture device other than a condenser, 
where an organic monitoring device is used to monitor concentration, 
each excursion constitutes a violation of the emission limit.
    (iii) For each combustion, recovery, or recapture device other than 
a condenser, each excursion constitutes a violation of the operating 
limit.
    (2) With the exception of excursions excused in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section, each excursion, as defined in paragraphs 
(f)(1)(ii), (f)(1)(iii), (f)(2)(i)(B), and (f)(3)(ii) of this section 
constitutes a violation of the operating limit.
    (f) Parameter monitoring excursion definitions. Parameter monitoring 
excursions are defined in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) With respect to storage vessels (where the applicable monitoring 
plan specifies continuous monitoring), process vents from continuous 
unit operations using combustion, recovery, or recapture devices for 
purposes of compliance, and for process wastewater streams, an excursion 
means any of the three cases listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through 
(iii) of this section.
    (i) The daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is 
above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the 
given parameters.
    (ii) The period of combustion, recovery, or recapture device 
operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this 
section, is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and monitoring data 
are insufficient, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, to 
constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating 
hours.
    (iii) The period of combustion, recovery, or recapture device 
operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this 
section, is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than 2 of the 
hours during the period of operation do not constitute a valid hour of 
data due to insufficient monitoring data, as defined in paragraph 
(f)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (iv) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of 
data, as used in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, if 
measured values are unavailable due to monitoring system breakdowns, 
repairs, calibrated checks, or zero (low-level) and high level 
adjustments, for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour. For data 
compression systems approved under Sec. 63.1439(g)(3), monitoring data 
are insufficient to calculate a valid hour of data if there are less 
than four data measurements made during the hour.
    (v) The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(v)(A) through (D) of 
this section are not considered to be part of the period of combustion, 
recovery, or recapture device operation, for the purposes of paragraphs 
(f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (A) Start-ups;
    (B) Shutdowns;
    (C) Malfunctions; or
    (D) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (2) For storage vessels where the applicable monitoring plan does 
not specify continuous monitoring, an excursion is defined in paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
    (i) If the monitoring plan specifies monitoring a parameter and 
recording its value at specific intervals (such as every 15 minutes or 
every hour), either of the cases listed in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) or (B) 
of this section is considered a single excursion for the combustion 
device.
    (A) When the average value of one or more parameters, averaged over 
the time during which the storage vessel is being filled (i.e., when the 
liquid level in the storage vessel is being raised), is above the 
maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given 
parameters.
    (B) When monitoring data are insufficient. Monitoring data shall be 
considered insufficient when measured values are not available, due to 
monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero (low-
level) and high-level adjustments, for at least 75 percent of the 
specific intervals at which parameters are to be monitored and recorded, 
according to the storage

[[Page 578]]

vessel's monitoring plan, during which the storage vessel is being 
filled.
    (ii) If the monitoring plan does not specify monitoring a parameter 
and recording its value at specific intervals (for example, if the 
relevant operating requirement is to exchange a disposable carbon 
canister before expiration of its rated service life), the monitoring 
plan shall define an excursion in terms of the relevant operating 
requirement.
    (3) With respect to process vents from batch unit operations, an 
excursion means one of the two cases listed in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters 
is above the maximum or below the minimum established level for the 
given parameters.
    (ii) When monitoring data are insufficient for an operating day. 
Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values 
are not available, due to monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, 
calibration checks, or zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments, for 
at least 75 percent of the 15-minute periods when batch emission 
episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control 
device during the operating day, using the procedures specified in 
paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when 
batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to 
the control device.
    (B) Subtract the time during the periods listed in paragraphs 
(f)(3)(ii)(B)(1) through (4) of this section from the total amount of 
time determined above in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, to 
obtain the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are 
insufficient.
    (1) Start-ups;
    (2) Shutdowns;
    (3) Malfunctions; or
    (4) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (C) Determine the total number of 15-minute periods in the operating 
time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient, as was 
determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (D) If measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of 
the total number of 15-minute periods determined in paragraph 
(f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the monitoring data are insufficient for 
the operating day.
    (4) With respect to process vents using ECO to reduce epoxide 
emissions, an excursion means any of the situations described in 
Sec. 63.1427(i)(3)(i) through (v). For each excursion, the owner or 
operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, except as 
provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) Excused excursions. A number of excused excursions shall be 
allowed for each combustion, recovery, or recapture device for each 
semiannual period. The number of excused excursions for each semiannual 
period is specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section. 
This paragraph applies to affected sources required to submit Periodic 
Reports semiannually or quarterly. The first semiannual period is the 6-
month period starting the date the Notification of Compliance Status is 
due.
    (1) For the first semiannual period--six excused excursions.
    (2) For the second semiannual period--five excused excursions.
    (3) For the third semiannual period--four excused excursions.
    (4) For the fourth semiannual period--three excused excursions.
    (5) For the fifth semiannual period--two excused excursions.
    (6) For the sixth and all subsequent semiannual periods--one excused 
excursion.

Sec. 63.1439  General recordkeeping and reporting provisions.

    (a) Data retention. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the 
owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all 
applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 
years. All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that 
they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall

[[Page 579]]

be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by 
computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a 
request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained 
offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable 
form including, but not limited to, on microfilm, computer, floppy disk, 
magnetic tape, or microfiche. If an owner or operator submits copies of 
reports to the applicable EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is 
not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office 
has waived the requirement of Sec. 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of 
copies of reports, the owner or operator is not required to maintain 
copies of reports.
    (b) Subpart A requirements. The owner or operator of an affected 
source shall comply with the applicable recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A (the General Provisions) as 
specified in Table 1 of this subpart. These requirements include, but 
are not limited to, the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(2) of this section.
    (1) Start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan. The owner or operator 
of an affected source shall develop and implement a written start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan as specified in the General Provisions' 
requirements for a Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction Plan in 
Sec. 63.6(e)(3). This plan shall describe, in detail, procedures for 
operating and maintaining the affected source during periods of start-
up, shutdown, and malfunction and a program for corrective action for 
malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment used to 
comply with this subpart. A provision for ceasing to collect, during a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data that would otherwise 
be required by the provisions of this subpart may be included in the 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan only if the owner or operator 
has demonstrated to the Administrator, through the Precompliance Report 
or a supplement to the Precompliance Report, that the monitoring system 
would be damaged or destroyed if it were not shut down during the start-
up, shutdown, or malfunction. The owner or operator of the affected 
source shall keep the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan on site. 
In addition, if the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan is revised, 
the owner or operator shall keep previous (i.e., superseded) versions of 
the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for a period of 5 years 
after each revision to the plan. If the new version of the start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan includes a provision for ceasing to 
collect, during a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data 
that would otherwise be required, the owner or operator shall submit a 
supplement to the Precompliance Report to the Administrator for the 
Administrator's approval, documenting that the monitoring system would 
be damaged or destroyed if it were not shut down during the start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction. Records associated with the plan shall be kept 
as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. Reports 
related to the plan shall be submitted as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The owner or operator shall keep the records specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment or 
combustion, recovery, or recapture devices or continuous monitoring 
systems used to comply with this subpart during which excess emissions 
(as defined in Sec. 63.1420(h)(4)) occur.
    (B) For each start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during which excess 
emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.1420(h)(4)) occur, records reflecting 
whether the procedures specified in the affected source's start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of 
actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing 
a combustion, recovery, or recapture device to a backup combustion, 
recovery, or recapture device, records shall be kept of whether the plan 
was followed. These records may take the form of a ``checklist,'' or 
other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up,

[[Page 580]]

shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.
    (ii) Reports of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. For the 
purposes of this subpart, the semiannual start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction reports shall be submitted on the same schedule as the 
Periodic Reports required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section instead 
of according to the general provisions' Periodic Reporting schedule 
specified in Sec. 63.10(d)(5)(i). The reports shall include the 
information specified in Sec. 63.10(d)(5)(i).
    (2) Application for approval of construction or reconstruction. For 
new affected sources, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
General Provisions' requirements for the application for approval of 
construction or reconstruction, as specified in Sec. 63.5, excluding the 
provisions specified in Sec. 63.5(d)(1)(ii)(H), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(2), and 
(d)(3)(ii).
    (c) Subpart H requirements. The owner or operator of an affected 
source shall comply with the HON equipment leak reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H, except as 
specified in Sec. 63.1434(b) through (g).
    (d) Recordkeeping and documentation. The owner or operator required 
to keep continuous records shall keep records as specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (7) of this section, unless an alternative recordkeeping 
system has been requested and approved as specified in paragraph (g) of 
this section, and except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. 
If a monitoring plan for storage vessels pursuant to Sec. 63.1432(i) 
requires continuous records, the monitoring plan shall specify which 
provisions, if any, of paragraphs (d)(1) through (7) of this section 
apply. As described in Sec. 63.1432(i), certain storage vessels are not 
required to keep continuous records as specified in this paragraph. The 
owner or operator of such storage vessels shall keep records as 
specified in the monitoring plan required by Sec. 63.1432(i).
    (1) The monitoring system shall measure data values at least once 
during approximately equal 15-minute intervals.
    (2) The owner or operator shall record either each measured data 
value or block average values for 1 hour or shorter periods calculated 
from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured 
more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may 
be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) block average 
instead of all measured values. The owner or operator of process vents 
from batch unit operations shall record each measured data value.
    (3) Daily average values of each continuously monitored parameter 
shall be calculated for each operating day as specified in paragraphs 
(d)(3)(i) through (ii) of this section, except as specified in 
paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section.
    (i) The daily average value shall be calculated as the average of 
all parameter values recorded during the operating day, except as 
specified in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The calculated average 
shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous. If intermittent 
emissions episodes occur resulting in emissions being vented to a 
combustion, recapture, or recovery device for a period of less than 24 
hours in the operating day, the daily average shall be calculated based 
only on the period when emissions are being vented to the combustion, 
recapture, or recovery device. For example, if a batch unit operation 
operates such that emissions are vented to a combustion device for 6 
hours, then the daily average is the average of the temperature 
measurements taken during those 6 hours.
    (ii) The operating day shall be the 24-hour period that the owner or 
operator specifies in the operating permit or the Notification of 
Compliance Status, for purposes of determining daily average values.
    (4)-(5) [Reserved]
    (6) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an 
operating day are above the minimum level or below the maximum level 
established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating 
permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the 
minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and 
recording a daily average for that operating day.
    (7) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs

[[Page 581]]

(d)(7)(i) through (v) of this section shall not be included in any 
average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times 
and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process 
or combustion, recovery, or recapture device operation when monitors are 
not operating.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; or
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (8) For continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this 
subpart, records documenting the completion of calibration checks, and 
records documenting the maintenance of continuous monitoring systems 
that are specified in the manufacturer's instructions or that are 
specified in other written procedures that provide adequate assurance 
that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
    (9) The owner or operator of an affected source granted a waiver of 
recordkeeping or reporting requirements under the General Provisions' 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements in Sec. 63.10(f) shall maintain 
the information, if any, specified by the Administrator as a condition 
of the waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
    (e) Reporting and notification. In addition to the reports and 
notifications required by 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, as specified in 
this subpart, the owner or operator of an affected source shall prepare 
and submit the reports listed in paragraphs (e)(3) through (8) of this 
section, as applicable. All reports required by this subpart, and the 
schedule for their submittal, are listed in Table 8 of this subpart.
    (1) Violation of reporting requirements. Owners and operators shall 
not be in violation of the reporting requirements of this paragraph (e) 
for failing to submit information required to be included in a specified 
report if the owner or operator meets the requirements in paragraphs 
(e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. Examples of circumstances where 
this paragraph may apply include information related to newly-added 
equipment or emission points, changes in the process, changes in 
equipment required or utilized for compliance with the requirements of 
this subpart, or changes in methods or equipment for monitoring, 
recordkeeping, or reporting.
    (i) The information was not known in time for inclusion in the 
report specified by this subpart.
    (ii) The owner or operator has been diligent in obtaining the 
information.
    (iii) The owner or operator submits a report according to the 
provisions of paragraphs (e)(1)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) If this subpart expressly provides for supplements to the report 
in which the information is required, the owner or operator shall submit 
the information as a supplement to that report. The information shall be 
submitted no later than 60 days after it is obtained, unless otherwise 
specified in this subpart.
    (B) If this subpart does not expressly provide for supplements, but 
the owner or operator must submit a request for revision of an operating

sufficient to represent combustion, recovery, or recapture device 
operating conditions, considering typical variability of the specific 
process and combustion, recovery, or recapture device operating 
parameter being monitored.
    (3) An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated 
data compression recording system that does not record monitored 
operating parameter values at a set frequency (for example, once at 
approximately equal intervals of about 15 minutes), but that records all 
values that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded 
values, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) The requested system shall be designed to:
    (A) Measure the operating parameter value at least once during 
approximately equal 15-minute intervals;
    (B) Record at least four values each hour during periods of 
operation;
    (C) Record the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;
    (D) Recognize unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not 
functioning properly, alert the operator, and record the incident;
    (E) Calculate daily average values of the monitored operating 
parameter based on all measured data; and
    (F) If the daily average is not an excursion, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1438(f), the data for that operating day may be converted to 
hourly average values and the four or more individual records for each 
hour in the operating day may be discarded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the monitoring system and data compression 
recording system, including the criteria used to determine which

[[Page 589]]

    (4) An owner or operator may request approval to use other 
alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in 
the General Provisions' requirements for using an alternative monitoring 
method in Sec. 63.8(f)(4).
    (h) Reduced recordkeeping program. For any parameter with respect to 
any item of equipment, the owner or operator may implement the 
recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section as 
alternatives to the continuous operating parameter monitoring and 
recordkeeping provisions that would otherwise apply under this subpart. 
The owner or operator shall retain for a period of 5 years each record 
required by paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average value, 
and is not required to retain more frequent monitored operating 
parameter values, for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of 
equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of 
this section are met. An owner or operator electing to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall notify the 
Administrator in the Notification of Compliance Status or, if the 
Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, in the 
Periodic Report immediately preceding implementation of the requirements 
of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or 
impossible data during periods of operation other than start-ups, 
shutdowns or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of -200 deg.C on 
a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The 
owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the 
alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
    (ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly 
throughout each operating day, a running average of the monitoring 
values that have been obtained during that operating day, and the 
capability to observe this running average is readily available to the 
Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator 
shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. All instances in 
an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
    (A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum 
established limits;
    (B) The running average is based on at least six 1-hour average 
values; and
    (C) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data 
during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns or 
malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging 
data are the expected operating condition based on past experience 
(e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or 
other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All 
instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a 
single occurrence.
    (iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an 
alarm or other means, if the running average parameter value calculated 
under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is 
appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is 
being monitored.
    (v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the 
monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements 
of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, at the times specified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(v)(A) through (C) of this section. The owner or 
operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.
    (A) Upon initial installation.
    (B) Annually after initial installation.
    (C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting 
the monitoring system, which might reasonably be expected to alter the 
monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this 
section.
    (vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, 
for which

[[Page 590]]

the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and how 
compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. The description shall identify 
the location and format (e.g., on-line storage, log entries) for each 
required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall 
retain both the current and the most recent superseded description, as 
specified in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
    (C) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring 
system that would reasonably be expected to affect its ability to comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (D) The owner or operator subject to paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(B) of this 
section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as 
long as the description is current. The current description shall, at 
all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location 
by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. The owner or operator shall retain all superseded descriptions 
for at least 5 years after the date of their creation. Superseded 
descriptions shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central 
location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours 
after a request) for at least 6 months after their creation. Thereafter, 
superseded descriptions may be stored off-site.
    (2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a monitored 
parameter with respect to an item of equipment and a period of 6 
consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in 
paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer 
required to record the daily average value, for any operating day when 
the daily average is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum 
established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data 
generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited 
toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and 
the monitoring accomplished during the period prior to the compliance 
date was required and/or approved by the Administrator.
    (i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average 
values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next 
Periodic Report. The notification shall identify the parameter and unit 
of equipment.
    (ii) If, on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased 
recording daily average values as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section, there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining 
the daily average value for each operating day and shall notify the 
Administrator in the next Periodic Report. The owner or operator shall 
continue to retain each daily average value until another period of 6 
consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in 
paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, for the duration specified in 
paragraph (h) of this section. For any calendar week, if compliance with 
paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section does not result in 
retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter 
value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one 
parameter value during a period of operation other than a start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iv) For the purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, an excursion 
means that the daily average of monitoring data for a parameter is 
greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, 
except as provided in paragraphs (h)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) The daily average value during any start-up, shutdown, or 
malfunction shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if the owner or operator follows the 
applicable provisions of the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan 
required by the General Provisions in Sec. 63.6(e)(3).

[[Page 591]]

    (B) An excused excursion, as described in Sec. 63.1438(g), shall not 
be considered an excursion for the purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 63.1503  Definitions.

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act as 
amended (CAA), in Sec. 63.2, or in this section as follows:
    Add-on air pollution control device means equipment installed on a 
process vent that reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to 
the air.
    Afterburner means an air pollution control device that uses 
controlled flame combustion to convert combustible materials to 
noncombustible gases; also known as an incinerator or a thermal 
oxidizer.
    Aluminum scrap shredder means a unit that crushes, grinds, or breaks 
aluminum scrap into a more uniform size prior to processing or charging 
to a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln, or furnace. A bale 
breaker is not an aluminum scrap shredder.
    Bag leak detection system means an instrument that is capable of 
monitoring particulate matter loadings in the exhaust of a fabric filter 
(i.e., baghouse) in order to detect bag failures. A bag leak detection 
system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on 
triboelectric, light scattering, light transmittance, or other effect to 
monitor relative particulate matter loadings.
    Chips means small, uniformly-sized, unpainted pieces of aluminum 
scrap, typically below 1\1/4\ inches in any dimension, primarily 
generated by turning, milling, boring, and machining of aluminum parts.
    Clean charge means furnace charge materials including molten 
aluminum; T-bar; sow; ingot; billet; pig; alloying elements; uncoated/
unpainted thermally dried aluminum chips; aluminum scrap dried at 343 
deg.C (650  deg.F) or higher; aluminum scrap delacquered/decoated at 482 
 deg.C (900  deg.F) or higher; other oil- and lubricant-free unpainted/
uncoated gates and risers; oil-and lubricant-free unpainted/uncoated 
aluminum scrap, shapes, or products (e.g., pistons) that have not 
undergone any process (e.g., machining, coating, painting, etc.) that 
would cause contamination of the aluminum (with oils, lubricants, 
coatings, or paints); and internal runaround.
    Cover flux means salt added to the surface of molten aluminum in a 
group 1 or group 2 furnace, without agitation of the molten aluminum, 
for the purpose of preventing oxidation.
    D/F means dioxins and furans.
    Dioxins and furans means tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and octachlorinated 
dibenzo dioxins and furans.
    Dross means the slags and skimmings from aluminum melting and 
refining operations consisting of fluxing agent(s), impurities, and/or 
oxidized and non-oxidized aluminum, from scrap aluminum charged into the 
furnace.
    Dross-only furnace means a furnace, typically of rotary barrel 
design, dedicated to the reclamation of aluminum from dross formed 
during melting, holding, fluxing, or alloying operations carried out in 
other process units.

[[Page 607]]

Dross and salt flux are the sole feedstocks to this type of furnace.
    Emission unit means a group 1 furnace or in-line fluxer at a 
secondary aluminum production facility.
    Fabric filter means an add-on air pollution control device used to 
capture particulate matter by filtering gas streams through filter 
media; also known as a baghouse.
    Feed/charge means, for a furnace or other process unit that operates 
in batch mode, the total weight of material (including molten aluminum, 
T-bar, sow, ingot, etc.) and alloying agents that enter the furnace 
during an operating cycle. For a furnace or other process unit that 
operates continuously, feed/charge means the weight of material 
(including molten aluminum, T-bar, sow, ingot, etc.) and alloying agents 
that enter the process unit within a specified time period (e.g., a time 
period equal to the performance test period). The feed/charge for a 
dross only furnace includes the total weight of dross and solid flux.
    Fluxing means refining of molten aluminum to improve product 
quality, achieve product specifications, or reduce material loss, 
including the addition of solvents to remove impurities (solvent flux); 
and the injection of gases such as chlorine, or chlorine mixtures, to 
remove magnesium (demagging) or hydrogen bubbles (degassing). Fluxing 
may be performed in the furnace or outside the furnace by an in-line 
fluxer.
    Furnace hearth means the combustion zone of a furnace in which the 
molten metal is contained.
    Group 1 furnace means a furnace of any design that melts, holds, or 
processes aluminum that contains paint, lubricants, coatings, or other 
foreign materials with or without reactive fluxing, or processes clean 
charge with reactive fluxing.
    Group 2 furnace means a furnace of any design that melts, holds, or 
processes only clean charge and that performs no fluxing or performs 
fluxing using only nonreactive, non-HAP-containing/non-HAP-generating 
gases or agents.
    HCl means, for the purposes of this subpart, emissions of hydrogen 
chloride that serve as a surrogate measure of the total emissions of the 
HAPs hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride and chlorine.
    In-line fluxer means a device exterior to a furnace, located in a 
transfer line from a furnace, used to refine (flux) molten aluminum; 
also known as a flux box, degassing box, or demagging box.
    Internal runaround means scrap material generated on-site by 
aluminum extruding, rolling, scalping, forging, forming/stamping, 
cutting, and trimming operations that do not contain paint or solid 
coatings. Aluminum chips generated by turning, boring, milling, and 
similar machining operations that have not been dried at 343  deg.C (650 
 deg.F) or higher, or by an equivalent non-thermal drying process, are 
not considered internal runaround.
    Lime means calcium oxide or other alkaline reagent.
    Lime-injection means the continuous addition of lime upstream of a 
fabric filter.
    Melting/holding furnace, or melter/holder, means a group 1 furnace 
that processes only clean charge, performs melting, holding, and fluxing 
functions, and does not transfer molten aluminum to or from another 
furnace.
    Operating cycle means for a batch process, the period beginning when 
the feed material is first charged to the operation and ending when all 
feed material charged to the operation has been processed. For a batch 
melting or holding furnace process, operating cycle means the period 
including the charging and melting of scrap aluminum and the fluxing, 
refining, alloying, and tapping of molten aluminum (the period from tap-
to-tap).
    PM means, for the purposes of this subpart, emissions of particulate 
matter that serve as a measure of total particulate emissions and as a 
surrogate for metal HAPs contained in the particulates, including but 
not limited to, antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, 
lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium.
    Pollution prevention means source reduction as defined under the 
Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (e.g., equipment or technology 
modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or 
redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in

[[Page 608]]

housekeeping, maintenance, training, or inventory control), and other 
practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through 
increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or 
other resources, or protection of natural resources by conservation.
    Reactive fluxing means the use of any gas, liquid, or solid flux 
(other than cover flux) that results in a HAP emission. Argon and 
nitrogen are not reactive and do not produce HAPs.
    Reconstruction means the replacement of components of an affected 
source or emission unit such that the fixed capital cost of the new 
components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be 
required to construct a comparable new affected source, and it is 
technologically and economically feasible for the reconstructed source 
to meet relevant standard(s) established in this subpart. Replacement of 
the refractory in a furnace is routine maintenance and is not a 
reconstruction. The repair and replacement of in-line fluxer components 
(e.g., rotors/shafts, burner tubes, refractory, warped steel) is 
considered to be routine maintenance and is not considered a 
reconstruction. In-line fluxers are typically removed to a maintenance/
repair area and are replaced with repaired units. The replacement of an 
existing in-line fluxer with a repaired unit is not considered a 
reconstruction.
    Residence time means, for an afterburner, the duration of time 
required for gases to pass through the afterburner combustion zone. 
Residence time is calculated by dividing the afterburner combustion zone 
volume in cubic feet by the volumetric flow rate of the gas stream in 
actual cubic feet per second.
    Rotary dross cooler means a water-cooled rotary barrel device that 
accelerates cooling of dross.
    Scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln means a unit used 
primarily to remove various organic contaminants such as oil, paint, 
lacquer, ink, plastic, and/or rubber from aluminum scrap (including used 
beverage containers) prior to melting.
    Secondary aluminum processing unit (SAPU): an existing SAPU means 
all existing group 1 furnaces and all existing in-line fluxers within a 
secondary aluminum production facility. Each existing group 1 furnace or 
existing in-line fluxer is considered an emission unit within a 
secondary aluminum processing unit. A new SAPU means any combination of 
group 1 furnaces and in-line fluxers which are simultaneously 
constructed after February 11, 1999. Each of the group 1 furnaces or in-
line fluxers within a new SAPU is considered an emission unit within 
that secondary aluminum processing unit.
    Secondary aluminum production facility means any establishment using 
clean charge, post-consumer aluminum scrap, aluminum scrap, aluminum 
ingots, aluminum foundry returns, dross from aluminum production, or 
molten aluminum as the raw material and performing one or more of the 
following processes: scrap shredding, scrap drying/delacquering/
decoating, thermal chip drying, furnace operations (i.e., melting, 
holding, refining, fluxing, or alloying), in-line fluxing, or dross 
cooling. A secondary aluminum production facility may be independent or 
part of a primary aluminum production facility. A facility is a 
secondary aluminum production facility if it includes any of the 
affected sources listed in Sec. 63.1500(b) or (c). Aluminum die casting 
facilities, aluminum foundries and aluminum extrusion facilities that 
process no materials other than materials generated within the facility, 
or clean charge purchased or otherwise obtained from outside the 
facility, and that do not operate sweat furnaces, thermal chip dryers, 
or scrap dryers/delacquering kilns/decoating kilns are not secondary 
aluminum production facilities.
    Sidewell means an open well adjacent to the hearth of a furnace with 
connecting arches between the hearth and the open well through which 
molten aluminum is circulated between the hearth, where heat is applied 
by burners, and the open well, which is used for charging scrap and 
solid flux or salt to the furnace, injecting fluxing agents, and 
skimming dross.
    Sweat furnace means a furnace used exclusively to reclaim aluminum 
from scrap that contains substantial quantities of iron by using heat to 
separate the low-melting point aluminum from

[[Page 609]]

the scrap while the higher melting-point iron remains in solid form.
    TEQ means the international method of expressing toxicity 
equivalents for dioxins and furans as defined in ``Interim Procedures 
for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures to Mixtures of 
Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and -Dibenzofurans (CDDs and CDFs) and 
1989 Update'' (EPA-625/3-89-016), available from the National Technical 
Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 
22161, NTIS no. PB 90-145756.
    THC means, for the purposes of this subpart, total hydrocarbon 
emissions that also serve as a surrogate for the emissions of organic 
HAP compounds.
    Thermal chip dryer means a device that uses heat to evaporate water, 
oil, or oil/water mixtures from unpainted/uncoated aluminum chips.
    Three-day, 24-hour rolling average means daily calculations of the 
average 24-hour emission rate (lbs/ton of feed/charge), over the 3 most 
recent consecutive 24-hour periods, for a secondary aluminum processing 
unit.
    Total reactive chlorine flux injection rate means the sum of the 
total weight of chlorine in the gaseous or liquid reactive flux and the 
total weight of chlorine in the solid reactive chloride flux, divided by 
the total weight of feed/charge, as determined by the procedure in 
Sec. 63.1512(o).

contains sufficient provisions to ensure continuing compliance with 
applicable emission limits and demonstrates, based on documented test 
results, the relationship between emissions of PM, HCl, and D/F and the 
proposed monitoring parameters for each pollutant. Test data must 
establish the highest level of PM, HCl, and D/F that will be emitted 
from the furnace. Subject to permitting agency approval of the OM&M 
plan, this may be determined by conducting performance tests and 
monitoring operating parameters while charging the furnace with feed/
charge materials containing the highest anticipated levels of oils and 
coatings and fluxing at the highest anticipated rate.

requirements.
    (q) Monitoring of scrap contamination level by calculation method 
for group 1 furnace without add-on air pollution control devices. The 
owner or operator of a group 1 furnace dedicated to processing a 
distinct type of furnace feed/charge composed of scrap with a uniform 
composition (such as rejected product from a manufacturing process for 
which the coating-to-scrap ratio can be documented) may include a 
program in the site-specific monitoring plan for determining, 
monitoring, and certifying the scrap contaminant level using a 
calculation method rather than a scrap inspection program. A scrap 
contaminant monitoring program using a calculation method must include:

paragraph (u) of this section, the owner or operator must calculate and 
record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emissions of PM, HCl, and D/F 
for each secondary aluminum processing unit on a daily basis. To 
calculate the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average, the owner or operator 
must:
    (1) Calculate and record the total weight of material charged to 
each emission unit in the secondary aluminum processing unit for each 
24-hour day of operation using the feed/charge weight information 
required in paragraph (e) of this section. If the owner or operator 
chooses to comply on the basis of weight of aluminum produced by the 
emission unit, rather than weight of material charged to the emission 
unit, all performance test emissions results and all calculations must 
be conducted on the aluminum production weight basis.
    (2) Multiply the total feed/charge weight to the emission unit, or 
the weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit, for each emission 
unit for the 24-hour period by the emission rate (in lb/ton of feed/
charge) for that emission unit (as determined during the performance 
test) to provide emissions for each emission unit for the 24-hour 
period, in pounds.
    (3) Divide the total emissions for each SAPU for the 24-hour period 
by the total material charged to the SAPU, or the weight of aluminum 
produced by the SAPU over the 24-hour period to provide the daily 
emission rate for the SAPU.
    (4) Compute the 24-hour daily emission rate using Equation 4:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR00.003
    

Where,

E<INF>day</INF> = The daily PM, HCl, or D/F emission rate for the 
secondary aluminum processing unit for the 24-hour period;
T<INF>i</INF> = The total amount of feed, or aluminum produced, for 
emission unit i for the 24-hour period (tons);
ER<INF>i</INF> = The measured emission rate for emission unit i as 
determined in the performance test (lb/ton or <greek-m>g/Mg of feed/
charge); and
n = The number of emission units in the secondary aluminum processing 
unit.

    (5) Calculate and record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average for each 
pollutant each day by summing the daily emission rates for each 
pollutant over the 3 most recent consecutive days and dividing by 3.
    (u) Secondary aluminum processing unit compliance by individual 
emission unit demonstration. As an alternative to the procedures of 
paragraph (t) of this section, an owner or operator may demonstrate, 
through performance tests, that each individual emission unit within the 
secondary aluminum production unit is in compliance with the applicable 
emission limits for the emission unit.
    (v) Alternative monitoring method for lime addition. The owner or 
operator of a lime-coated fabric filter that employs intermittent or

of an alternative method

[[Page 625]]

for monitoring the lime addition schedule and rate based on monitoring 
the weight of lime added per ton of feed/charge for each operating cycle 
or time period used in the performance test. An alternative monitoring 
method will not be approved unless the owner or operator provides 
assurance through data and information that the affected source will 
meet the relevant emission standards on a continuous basis.
    (w) Alternative monitoring methods. An owner or operator may submit 
an application to the Administrator for approval of alternate monitoring 
requirements to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of 
this subpart, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (w)(1) through (6) 
of this section.
    (1) The Administrator will not approve averaging periods other than 
those specified in this section.
    (2) The owner or operator must continue to use the original 
monitoring requirement until necessary data are submitted and approval 
is received to use another monitoring procedure.
    (3) The owner or operator shall submit the application for approval 
of alternate monitoring methods no later than the notification of the 
performance test. The application must contain the information specified 
in paragraphs (w)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section:
    (i) Data or information justifying the request, such as the 
technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality of using the 
required approach;
    (ii) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring 
requirements, including the operating parameters to be monitored, the 
monitoring approach and technique, and how the limit is to be 
calculated; and
    (iii) Data and information documenting that the alternative 
monitoring requirement(s) would provide equivalent or better assurance 
of compliance with the relevant emission standard(s).
    (4) The Administrator will not approve an alternate monitoring 
application unless it would provide equivalent or better assurance of 
compliance with the relevant emission standard(s). Before disapproving 
any alternate monitoring application, the Administrator will provide:
    (i) Notice of the information and findings upon which the intended 
disapproval is based; and
    (ii) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present 
additional supporting information before final action is taken on the 
application. This notice will specify how much additional time is 
allowed for the owner or operator to provide additional supporting 
information.
    (5) The owner or operator is responsible for submitting any 
supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to 
consider the application prior to the performance test. Neither 
submittal of an application nor the Administrator's failure to approve 
or disapprove the application relieves the owner or operator of the 
responsibility to comply with any provisions of this subpart.
    (6) The Administrator may decide at any time, on a case-by-case 
basis, that additional or alternative operating limits, or alternative 
approaches to establishing operating limits, are necessary to 
demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.

Sec. 63.1511  Performance test/compliance demonstration general requirements.

    (a) Site-specific test plan. Prior to conducting a performance test 
required by this subpart, the owner or operator must prepare and submit 
a site-specific test plan meeting the requirements in Sec. 63.7(c).
    (b) Initial performance test. Following approval of the site-
specific test plan, the owner or operator must demonstrate initial 
compliance with each applicable emission, equipment, work practice, or 
operational standard for each affected source and emission unit, and 
report the results in the notification of compliance status report as 
described in Sec. 63.1515(b). The owner or operator must conduct each 
performance test according to the requirements of the general provisions 
in subpart A of this part and this subpart. Owners or operators of 
affected sources located at facilities which are area sources are 
subject only to those performance testing requirements pertaining to D/
F. Owners or operators of sweat furnaces meeting the specifications of

[[Page 626]]

Sec. 63.1505(f)(1) are not required to conduct a performance test.
    (1) The owner or operator must conduct each test while the affected 
source or emission unit is operating at the highest production level 
with charge materials representative of the range of materials processed 
by the unit and, if applicable, at the highest reactive fluxing rate.
    (2) Each performance test for a continuous process must consist of 3 
separate runs; pollutant sampling for each run must be conducted for the 
time period specified in the applicable method or, in the absence of a 
specific time period in the test method, for a minimum of 3 hours.
    (3) Each performance test for a batch process must consist of three 
separate runs; pollutant sampling for each run must be conducted over 
the entire process operating cycle.

through a common stack, pollutant sampling for each run must be 
conducted over a period of time during which all affected sources or 
emission units complete at least 1 entire process operating cycle or for 
24 hours, whichever is shorter.
    (5) Initial compliance with an applicable emission limit or standard 
is demonstrated if the average of three runs conducted during the 
performance test is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit 
or standard.
    (c) Test methods. The owner or operator must use the following 
methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to determine compliance with the

device.
    (j) Secondary aluminum processing unit. The owner or operator must 
conduct performance tests as described in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) 
of this section. The results of the performance tests are used to 
establish emission rates in lb/ton of feed/charge for PM and HCl and 
<greek-m>g TEQ/Mg of feed/charge for D/F emissions from each emission 
unit. These emission rates are used for compliance monitoring in the 
calculation of the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emission rates using 
the equation in Sec. 63.1510(t). A performance test is required for:
    (1) Each group 1 furnace processing only clean charge to measure

the lime-injected fabric filter every 15 minutes during the HCl and D/F 
performance tests;
    (2) Determine and record the 15-minute block average temperatures 
for the 3 test runs; and
    (3) Determine and record the 3-hour block average of the recorded 
temperature measurements for the 3 test runs.
    (o) Flux injection rate. The owner or operator must use these 
procedures to establish an operating parameter value or range for the 
total reactive chlorine flux injection rate.
    (1) Continuously measure and record the weight of gaseous or liquid 
reactive flux injected for each 15 minute period during the HCl and D/F 
tests, determine and record the 15-minute block average weights, and

    (4) Divide the weight of total chlorine usage (W<INF>t</INF>) for 
the 3 test runs by the recorded measurement of the total weight of feed 
for the 3 test runs; and
    (5) If a solid reactive flux other than magnesium chloride is used, 
the owner or operator must derive the appropriate proportion factor 
subject to approval by the applicable permitting authority.
    (p) Lime injection. The owner or operator of an affected source or 
emission unit using a lime-injected fabric filter system must use these

(Recordkeeping and reporting requirements). Section Sec. 63.11 (Control 
device requirements) does not apply to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1542  Definitions.

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in subpart A of 
this part, or in this section as follows:
    Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of 
continuously monitoring relative particulate matter (dust) loadings in 
the exhaust of a baghouse in order to detect bag leaks and other upset 
conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, 
an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, light 
transmittance, or other effect to continuously monitor relative 
particulate matter loadings.
    Blast furnace means any reduction furnace to which sinter is charged 
and which forms separate layers of molten slag and lead bullion.
    Building means a roofed and walled structure with limited openings 
to allow access and egress for people and vehicles.
    Charging location means the physical opening through which raw 
materials are introduced into a sinter machine, blast furnace, or dross 
furnace.
    Dross furnace means any smelting furnace to which drosses are 
charged and which chemically and physically separates lead from other 
impurities.
    Drossing and refining kettle means an open-top vessel that is 
constructed of cast iron or steel and is indirectly heated from below 
and contains molten lead for the purpose of drossing, refining, or 
alloying lead. Included are pot

[[Page 647]]

furnaces, receiving kettles, and holding kettles.
    Fugitive dust source means a stationary source of hazardous air 
pollutant emissions at a primary lead smelter resulting from the 
handling, storage, transfer, or other management of lead-bearing 
materials where the source is not associated with a specific process, 
process vent, or stack. Fugitive dust sources include roadways, storage 
piles, materials handling transfer points, and materials transport 
areas.
    Furnace area means any area of a primary lead smelter in which a 
blast furnace or dross furnace is located.
    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process 
equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures 
that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are 
not malfunctions.
    Materials storage and handling area means any area of a primary lead 
smelter in which lead-bearing materials (including ore concentrate, 
sinter, granulated lead, dross, slag, and flue dust) are stored or 
handled between process steps, including areas in which materials are 
stored in piles, bins, or tubs, and areas in which material is prepared 
for charging to a sinter machine or smelting furnace.
    Operating time means the period of time in hours that an affected 
source is in operation beginning at a startup and ending at the next 
shutdown.
    Plant operating time means the period of time in hours that either a 
sinter machine or blast furnace is in operation.
    Plant roadway means any area of a primary lead smelter that is 
subject to vehicle traffic, including traffic by fork lifts, front-end 
loaders, or vehicles carrying ore concentrates or cast lead ingots. 
Excluded from this definition are employee and visitor parking areas, 
provided they are not subject to traffic by vehicles carrying lead-
bearing materials.
    Primary lead smelter means any facility engaged in the production of 
lead metal from lead sulfide ore concentrates through the use of 
pyrometallurgical techniques.
    Process fugitive source means a source of hazardous air pollutant 
emissions at a primary lead smelter that is associated with lead 
smelting or refining but is not the primary exhaust stream and is not a 
fugitive dust source. Process fugitive sources include sinter machine 
charging locations, sinter machine discharge locations, sinter crushing

Subpart UUU  [Reserved]


<R04>
 Subpart VVV--National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: 
                     Publicly Owned Treatment Works

    Source: 64 FR 57579, Oct. 26, 1999, unless otherwise noted.

                              Applicability


<R05>
Sec. 63.1580  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if the following are all true:
    (1) You own or operate a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that 
includes an affected source (Sec. 63.1595);
    (2) The affected source is located at a major source of hazardous 
air pollutant (HAP) emissions; and
    (3) Your POTW is required to develop and implement a pretreatment 
program as defined by 40 CFR 403.8 (for a POTW owned or operated by a 
municipality, state, or intermunicipal or interstate agency), or your 
POTW would meet the general criteria for development and implementation 
of a pretreatment program (for a POTW owned or operated by a department, 
agency, or instrumentality of the Federal government).

    Note to paragraph (a)(2): See Sec. 63.2 of the national emission 
standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) general provisions in 
subpart A of this part for a definition of major source.

    (b) If your existing POTW treatment plant is not located at a major 
source as of October 26, 1999, but thereafter becomes a major source for 
any reason other than reconstruction, then, for the purpose of this 
subpart, your POTW treatment plant would be considered an existing 
source.
    (c) If an industrial major source complies with applicable NESHAP 
requirements by using the treatment and controls located at your POTW, 
your POTW is considered to be a major source regardless of whether you 
otherwise meet the applicable criteria.
    (d) If you reconstruct your POTW treatment plant, then the 
requirements for a new or reconstructed POTW treatment plant, as defined 
in Sec. 63.1595, apply.

[[Page 655]]


<R05>
Sec. 63.1581  Does the subpart distinguish between different types of POTW treatment plants?

    Yes, POTW treatment plants are divided into two subcategories. A 
POTW treatment plant which does not meet the characteristics of an 
industrial POTW treatment plant belongs in the non-industrial POTW 
treatment plant subcategory as defined in Sec. 63.1595.

      Industrial POTW Treatment Plant Description and Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.1582  What are the characteristics of an industrial POTW treatment plant?

    (a) Your POTW is an industrial POTW treatment plant if an industrial 
discharger complies with its NESHAP by using the treatment and controls 
located at your POTW. Your POTW accepts the regulated waste stream and 
provides treatment and controls as an agent for the industrial 
discharger. Industrial POTW treatment plant is defined in Sec. 63.1595.
    (b) If, in the future, an industrial discharger begins complying 
with its NESHAP by using the treatment and controls at your POTW, then 
on the date that the industrial discharger certifies compliance, your 
POTW treatment plant will be considered an industrial POTW treatment 
plant.
    (c) If your POTW treatment plant accepts one or more specific 
regulated industrial waste streams as part of compliance with one or 
more other NESHAP, then you are subject to all the requirements of each 
appropriate NESHAP for each waste stream, as described in the following 
section. In the case of overlapping NESHAP requirements, the more 
stringent of the requirements will apply.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1583  What are the emission points and control requirements for an industrial POTW treatment plant?

    (a) The emission points and control requirements for an existing 
industrial POTW treatment plant are specified in the appropriate 
NESHAP(s) for the industrial user(s) (see Sec. 63.1582). For example, an 
existing industrial POTW treatment plant that provides treatment for a 
facility subject to subpart FF of this part, the National Emission 
Standard for Benzene Waste Operations, must meet the treatment and 
control requirements specified in Sec. 61.348(d)(4) of this chapter.
    (b) The emission points and control requirements for a new or 
reconstructed industrial POTW treatment plant are either those specified 
by the particular NESHAP(s) which apply to the industrial user(s) who 
discharge their waste for treatment to the POTW, or those emission 
points and control requirements set forth in Sec. 63.1586. The set of 
control requirements which applies to a particular new or reconstructed 
POTW is that set which requires the most stringent overall control of 
HAP emissions. If you are uncertain which set of requirements is more 
stringent, this determination should be made in consultation with the 
permitting authority. Reconstruction is defined in Sec. 63.1595.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1584  When do I have to comply?

    (a) Existing industrial POTW treatment plant. If you have an 
existing industrial POTW treatment plant, the appropriate NESHAP(s) for 
the industrial user(s) sets the compliance date, or the compliance date 
is 60 days after October 26, 1999, whichever is later.
    (b) New industrial POTW treatment plant. If you have a new 
industrial POTW treatment plant, you must be in compliance as soon as 
you begin accepting the waste stream(s) for treatment. If you begin 
accepting a specific regulated industrial waste stream(s) for treatment, 
you must be in compliance by the time specified in the appropriate 
NESHAP(s) for the industrial user(s).


<R05>
Sec. 63.1585  How does an industrial POTW treatment plant demonstrate compliance?

    (a) An existing industrial POTW treatment plant demonstrates 
compliance by operating treatment and control devices which meet all 
requirements specified in the appropriate industrial NESHAP(s). 
Requirements may include performance tests, routine monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting.
    (b) If you have a new or reconstructed industrial POTW plant, you

[[Page 656]]

must first determine whether the control requirements set forth in the 
applicable industrial NESHAP(s) or the control requirements applicable 
to a new or reconstructed nonindustrial POTW under Sec. 63.1586 would 
require more stringent overall control of HAP emissions. You must then 
meet whichever set of requirements is more stringent. If you determine 
that the controls required by the applicable industrial NESHAP(s) are 
more stringent, you demonstrate compliance by operating treatment and 
control devices which meet all requirements specified in those 
industrial NESHAP(s). If you determine that the controls required for a 
new or reconstructed nonindustrial POTW are more stringent, you 
demonstrate compliance by meeting all requirements in Secs. 63.1586 
through 63.1590.

            Non-industrial POTW Treatment Plant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.1586  What are the emission points and control requirements for a non-industrial POTW treatment plant?

    There are no control requirements for an existing non-industrial 
POTW treatment plant. The control requirements for a new or 
reconstructed non-industrial POTW treatment plant are as follows:
    (a) Covers on the emission points up to, but not including, the 
secondary influent pumping station or the secondary treatment units. 
These emission points are treatment units that include, but are not 
limited to, influent waste stream conveyance channels, bar screens, grit 
chambers, grinders, pump stations, aerated feeder channels, primary 
clarifiers, primary effluent channels, and primary screening stations. 
In addition, all covered units, except primary clarifiers, must have the 
air in the headspace ducted to a control device in accordance with the 
standards for closed-vent systems and control devices in Sec. 63.693 of 
subpart DD of this part, except you may substitute visual inspections 
for leak checks rather than Method 21 of Appendix A of part 60 of this 
chapter. Reconstructed is defined in Sec. 63.1595.
    (1) Covers must be tightly fitted and designed and operated to 
minimize exposure of the wastewater to the atmosphere. This includes, 
but is not limited to, the absence of visible cracks, holes, or gaps in 
the roof sections or between the roof and the supporting wall; broken, 
cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and 
broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure 
devices.
    (2) If wastewater is in a treatment unit, each opening must be 
maintained in a closed, sealed position, unless plant personnel are 
present and conducting wastewater or sludge sampling, or equipment 
inspection, maintenance, or repair.
    (b) As an alternative to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this 
section, you may comply by demonstrating, for all units up to the 
secondary influent pumping station or the secondary treatment units, 
that the fraction emitted does not exceed 0.014. You must demonstrate 
that for your POTW, the sum of all HAP emissions from those units 
divided by the sum of all HAP mass loadings results in a annual rolling 
average of the fraction emitted no greater than 0.014. You may use any 
combination of pretreatment, wastewater treatment plant modifications, 
and control devices to achieve this performance standard; however, you 
must demonstrate, to the Administrator's satisfaction that:
    (1) You have accurately determined your POTW's annual HAP mass 
loadings and your POTW's annual HAP emissions as of the date of start-
up;
    (2) Your POTW meets the fraction emitted standard of 0.014 or less; 
and
    (3) Your POTW has established procedures to demonstrate continuous 
compliance which are consistent with the criteria set forth in 
Sec. 63.1588(c)(4).


<R05>
Sec. 63.1587  When do I have to comply?

    If your POTW treatment plant began construction on or after December 
1, 1998, you must comply with all provisions of this subpart either 
immediately upon startup, or by six months after October 26, 1999, 
whichever date is later.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1588  What inspections must I conduct?

    (a) If your treatment units are required to have covers, you must 
conduct the following inspections:

[[Page 657]]

    (1) You must visually check the cover and its closure devices for 
defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not 
limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or 
between the roof and the supporting wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise 
damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing 
hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.
    (2) You must perform an initial visual inspection with follow-up 
inspections at least once per year.
    (3) In the event that you find a defect on a treatment unit in use, 
you must repair the defect within 45 days. If you cannot repair within 
45 days, you must notify the EPA or the designated State authority 
immediately and report the reason for the delay and the date you expect 
to complete the repair. If you find a defect on a treatment unit that is 
not in service, you must repair the defect prior to putting the 
treatment unit back in wastewater service.
    (b) If you own or operate a control device used to meet the 
requirements for Sec. 63.1586, you must comply with the inspection and 
monitoring requirements of Sec. 63.695(c) of subpart DD of this part.
    (c) To comply with the performance standard specified in 
Sec. 63.1586(b), you must develop an inspection and monitoring plan. 
This inspection and monitoring plan must include, at a minimum, the 
following:
    (1) A method to determine, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, 
the influent HAP mass loading, i.e., the annual mass quantity for each 
HAP entering the wastewater treatment plant.
    (2) A method to determine, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, 
your POTW's annual HAP emissions for all units up to and including the 
secondary influent pumping station or up to and not including the 
secondary treatment units as of October 26, 1999. The method you use to 
determine your HAP emissions, such as modeling or direct source 
measurement, must:
    (i) Be approved by your EPA Regional Office, State, or local 
regulatory agency for use at your POTW;
    (ii) Account for all factors affecting emissions from your plant 
including, but not limited to, emissions from wastewater treatment 
units; emissions resulting from inspection, maintenance, and repair 
activities; fluctuations (e.g., daily, monthly, annual, seasonal) in 
your influent wastewater HAP concentrations; annual industrial loading; 
performance of control devices; or any other factors that could affect 
your annual HAP emissions; and
    (iii) Include documentation that the values and sources of all data, 
operating conditions, assumptions, etc., used in your method result in 
an accurate estimation of annual emissions from your plant.
    (3) Documentation, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that 
your POTW meets the fraction emitted standard of 0.014 or less, i.e., 
the sum of all HAP emissions from paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
divided by the sum of all HAP mass loadings from paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section results in a fraction emitted of 0.014 or less as described 
in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (4) A method to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator, that your POTW is in continuous compliance with the 
requirements of Sec. 63.1586(b). Continuous compliance means that your 
emissions, when averaged over the course of a year, do not exceed the 
level of emissions that allows your POTW to comply with Sec. 63.1586(b). 
For example, you may identify a parameter(s) that you can monitor that 
assures your emissions, when averaged over the entire year, will meet 
the requirements in Sec. 63.1586(b). Some example parameters that may be 
considered for monitoring include your wastewater influent HAP 
concentration and flow, industrial loading from your permitted 
industrial dischargers, and your control device performance criteria. 
Where emission reductions are due to proper operation of equipment, work 
practices, or other operational procedures, your demonstration must 
specify the frequency of inspections and the number of days to 
completion of repairs. You must, at a minimum, perform the following 
each month to demonstrate that your annual rolling average of the 
fraction emitted is 0.014 or less:

[[Page 658]]

    (i) Determine the average daily flow of the wastewater entering your 
POTW treatment plant for the month;
    (ii) Determine the flow-weighted monthly concentration of each HAP 
in your influent listed in Table 1 to subpart DD of this part;
    (iii) Using the current month's information in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) 
and (ii) of this section, determine a total annual loading (Mg/year) of 
each HAP entering your POTW treatment plant;
    (iv) Sum up the values in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section and 
determine a total annual loading value (Mg/year) for all HAP entering 
your POTW treatment plant for the current month;
    (v) Based on the current month's information in paragraph 
(c)(4)(iii) of this section along with source testing and emission 
modeling, for each HAP, determine annual emissions (Mg/year) from all 
wastewater units up to, but not including, secondary treatment units;
    (vi) Sum up the values in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section and 
determine the total annual emissions value for the month for all HAP 
from all wastewater units up to, but not including, secondary treatment 
units;
    (vii) Calculate the fraction emitted value for the month by dividing 
the total annual HAP emissions value from paragraph (c)(4)(vi) of this 
section by the total annual loading from paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this 
section; and
    (viii) Average the fraction emitted value for the month determined 
in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, with the values determined for 
the previous 11 months, to calculate an annual rolling average of the 
fraction HAP emitted.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1589  What records must I keep?

    (a) To comply with the equipment standard specified in 
Sec. 63.1586(b), you must prepare and maintain the following records:
    (1) A record for each treatment unit inspection required by 
Sec. 63.1588(a). You must include a treatment unit identification number 
(or other unique identification description as selected by you) and the 
date of inspection.
    (2) For each defect detected during inspections required by 
Sec. 63.1588(a), you must record the location of the defect, a 
description of the defect, the date of detection, the corrective action 
taken to repair the defect, and the date the repair to correct the 
defect is completed.
    (3) In the event that repair of the defect is delayed, in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 63.1588(a), you must also record the reason 
for the delay and the date you expect to complete the repair.
    (4) If you own or operate a control device used to meet the 
requirements for Sec. 63.1586, you must comply with the recordkeeping 
requirements of Sec. 63.696(a), (b), (g), and (h).
    (b) To comply with the performance standard specified in 
Sec. 63.1586(b), you must prepare and maintain the following records:
    (1) A record of the methods and data used to determine your POTW's 
annual HAP emissions as determined in Sec. 63.1588(c);
    (2) A record of the methods and data used to determine that your 
POTW meets the fraction emitted standard of 0.014 or less, as determined 
in Sec. 63.1588(c); and
    (3) A record of the methods and data that demonstrates that your 
POTW is in continuous compliance with the requirements of 
Sec. 63.1588(c).


<R05>
Sec. 63.1590  What reports must I submit?

    (a)(1) If you have an existing nonindustrial POTW treatment plant, 
you are not required to submit a notification of compliance status. If 
you have a new or reconstructed nonindustrial POTW treatment plant, you 
must submit to the Administrator a notification of compliance status, 
signed by the responsible official who must certify its accuracy, 
attesting to whether your POTW treatment plant has complied with this 
subpart. This notification must be submitted initially, and each time a 
notification of compliance status is required under this subpart. At a 
minimum, the notification must list--
    (i) The methods that were used to determine compliance;
    (ii) The results of any monitoring procedures or methods that were 
conducted;
    (iii) The methods that will be used for determining continuing 
compliance;

[[Page 659]]

                          General Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.1591  What are my notification requirements?

    (a) If you are subject to this subpart, and your State has not been 
delegated authority, you must submit notifications to the appropriate 
EPA Regional Office. If your State has been delegated authority you must 
submit notifications to your State and a copy of each notification to 
the appropriate EPA Regional Office. The Regional Office may waive this 
requirement for any notifications at its discretion.
    (b) You must notify the Administrator in writing no later than 120 
calendar days after the effective date of this subpart (or within 120 
calendar days after your POTW treatment plant becomes subject to the 
relevant standard), and you must provide the following information:
    (1) Your name and address;
    (2) The address (i.e., physical location) of your POTW treatment 
plant;
    (3) An identification of these standards as the basis of the 
notification and your POTW treatment plant's compliance date; and
    (4) A brief description of the nature, size, design, and method of 
operation of your POTW treatment plant, including its operating design 
capacity and an identification of each point of emission for each HAP, 
or if a definitive identification is not yet possible, a preliminary 
identification of each point of emission for each HAP.
    (c) You must notify the Administrator if your data show that you are 
no longer in continuous compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1592  Which General Provisions apply to my POTW treatment plant?

    Table 1 to this subpart lists the General Provisions (40 CFR part 
63, subpart A) which apply to POTW treatment plants.

[[Page 660]]


<R05>
Sec. 63.1593  How will the EPA determine if I am in compliance with this subpart?

    (a) The Administrator will determine compliance with this subpart by 
reviewing your reports and records or by inspecting your POTW treatment 
plant.
    (b) If you fail to comply with any or all of the provisions of this 
subpart, you will be considered in violation of this subpart. For 
example, failure to perform any or all of the following, specified in 
Sec. 63.1588, would be a violation: failure to visually inspect the 
cover on your treatment unit, failure to repair a defect on a treatment 
unit in use within the specified time period, failure to report a delay 
in repair, failure to determine your POTW's annual HAP emissions when 
your new or reconstructed POTW becomes subject to this subpart, failure 
to demonstrate that your POTW achieves an HAP fraction emitted of 0.014, 
or failure to demonstrate that your POTW is in continuous compliance 
with the requirements of Sec. 63.1586(b).
    (c) Your POTW treatment plant may be exempted from compliance with 
this subpart if the President determines that the technology to 
implement these standards is not available, and that it is in the 
national security interests of the United States to do so. This 
exemption may last for up to 2 years at a time and may be extended for 
additional periods of up to 2 years each.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1594  Who enforces this subpart?

    If the Administrator has delegated authority to your State, then the 
State enforces this subpart. If the Administrator has not delegated 
authority to your State, then the EPA Regional Office enforces this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1595  List of definitions.

    Affected source means the group of all equipment that comprise the 
POTW treatment plant.
    Area source means any stationary source of HAP that is not a major 
source.
    Cover means a device that prevents or reduces air pollutant 
emissions to the atmosphere by forming a continuous barrier over the 
waste material managed in a treatment unit. A cover may have openings 
(such as access hatches, sampling ports, gauge wells) that are necessary 
for operation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of the treatment unit 
on which the cover is used. A cover may be a separate piece of equipment 
which can be detached and removed from the treatment unit, or a cover 
may be formed by structural features permanently integrated into the 
design of the treatment unit. The cover and its closure devices must be 
made of suitable materials that will minimize exposure of the waste 
material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain 
the integrity of the cover and its closure devices throughout its 
intended service life.
    Fraction emitted means the fraction of the mass of HAP entering the 
POTW wastewater treatment plant which is emitted prior to secondary 
treatment. The value is calculated using the following steps:
    (1) Determine mass emissions from all equipment up to but not 
including secondary treatment for each HAP listed in Table 1 to subpart 
DD of this part;
    (2) Sum the HAP emissions (<greek-S><greek-E>);
    (3) sum the HAP mass loadings (<greek-S>L) in the influent to the 
POTW wastewater treatment plant; and
    (4) Calculate the fraction emitted (f<INF>e</INF>monthly) using 
f<INF>e</INF>monthly=<greek-S>E/<greek-S>L.
    HAP means hazardous air pollutant(s).
    Industrial POTW means a POTW that accepts a waste stream regulated 
by an industrial NESHAP and provides treatment and controls as an agent 
for the industrial discharger. The industrial discharger complies with 
its NESHAP by using the treatment and controls located at the POTW. For 
example, an industry discharges its benzene-containing waste stream to 
the POTW for treatment to comply with 40 CFR part 61, Subpart FF--
National Emission Standard for Benzene Waste Operations. This definition 
does not include POTW treating waste streams not specifically regulated 
under another NESHAP.
    Industrial user means a nondomestic source introducing any pollutant 
or combination of pollutants into a

[[Page 661]]

POTW. Industrial users can be commercial or industrial facilities whose 
wastes enter local sewers.
    Non-industrial POTW means a POTW that does not meet the definition 
of an industrial POTW as defined above.
    Publicly owned treatment works (POTW) means a treatment works, as 
that term is defined by section 112(e)(5) of the Clean Air Act, which is 
owned by a municipality (as defined by section 502(4) of the Clean Water 
Act), a State, an intermunicipal or interstate agency, or any 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government. This 
definition includes any intercepting sewers, outfall sewers, sewage 
collection systems, pumping, power, and other equipment. The wastewater 
treated by these facilities is generated by industrial, commercial, and 
domestic sources. As used in this regulation, the term POTW refers to 
both any publicly owned treatment works which is owned by a State, 
municipality, or intermunicipal or interstate agency and therefore 
eligible to receive grant assistance under the Subchapter II of the 
Clean Water Act, and any federally owned treatment works as that term is 
described in section 3023 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
    POTW treatment plant means that portion of the POTW which is 
designed to provide treatment (including recycling and reclamation) of 
municipal sewage and industrial waste.
    Reconstruction means the replacement of components of an affected or 
a previously unaffected stationary source such that:
    (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent 
of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a 
comparable new source; and
    (2) It is technologically and economically feasible for the 
reconstructed source to meet the relevant standard(s) established by the 
Administrator (or a State) pursuant to section 112 of the Act. Upon 
reconstruction, an affected source, or a stationary source that becomes 
an affected source, is subject to relevant standards for new sources, 
including compliance dates, irrespective of any change in emissions of 
HAP from that source.
    Secondary treatment means treatment processes, typically biological, 
designed to reduce the concentrations of dissolved and colloidal organic 
matter in wastewater.
    Waste and wastewater means a material, or spent or used water or

Sec. 63.1651  Definitions.

    Terms in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act (Act), in 
subpart A of this part, or in this section as follows:
    Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of 
continuously monitoring particulate matter (dust) loadings in the 
exhaust of a baghouse in order to detect bag leaks and other upset 
conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, 
an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, light 
transmittance, or other effect to continuously monitor relative 
particulate matter loadings.
    Capture system means the equipment (including hoods, ducts, fans, 
dampers, etc.) used to capture or transport particulate matter generated 
by an affected submerged arc furnace.
    Casting means the period of time from when molten ferroalloy falls 
from the furnace tapping runner into the ladle until pouring into molds 
is completed. This includes the following operations: ladle filling, 
pouring alloy from one ladle to another, slag separation, slag removal, 
and ladle transfer by crane, truck, or other conveyance.
    Crushing and screening equipment means the crushers, grinders, 
mills, screens and conveying systems used to crush, size, and prepare 
for packing manganese-containing materials, including raw materials, 
intermediate products, and final products.
    Fugitive dust source means a stationary source from which manganese-
bearing particles are discharged to the atmosphere due to wind or 
mechanical inducement such as vehicle traffic. Fugitive dust sources 
include plant roadways, yard areas, and outdoor material storage and 
transfer operations.
    Furnace power input means the resistive electrical power consumption 
of a submerged arc furnace, expressed as megawatts (MW).

[[Page 665]]

    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process 
equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures 
caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not 
malfunctions.
    Metal oxygen refining (MOR) process means the reduction of the 
carbon content of ferromanganese through the use of oxygen.
    Open submerged arc furnace means an electric submerged arc furnace 
that is equipped with a canopy hood above the furnace to collect primary 
emissions.
    Operating time means the period of time in hours that the affected 
source is in operation beginning at a startup and ending at the next 
shutdown.
    Plant roadway means any area at a ferromanganese and silicomanganese 
production facility that is subject to plant mobile equipment, such as 
fork lifts, front end loaders, or trucks, carrying manganese-bearing 
materials. Excluded from this definition are employee and visitor 
parking areas, provided they are not subject to traffic by plant mobile 
equipment.
    Primary emissions means gases and emissions collected by hoods and 
ductwork located above an open furnace or under the cover of a semi-
closed or sealed furnace.
    Sealed submerged arc furnace means an electric submerged arc furnace 
equipped with a total enclosure or cover from which primary emissions 
are evacuated directly.
    Semi-closed submerged arc furnace means an electric submerged arc 
furnace equipped with a partially sealed cover over the furnace. This 
cover is equipped with openings to allow penetration of the electrodes 
into the furnace. Mix is introduced into the furnace around the 
electrode holes forming a partial seal between the electrodes and the 
cover. Furnace emissions generated under the cover are ducted to an 
emission control device. Emissions that escape the cover are collected 
and vented through stacks directly to the atmosphere.
    Shop means the building which houses one or more submerged arc 
furnaces.
    Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an affected source for 
any purpose.
    Startup means the setting in operation of an affected source for any 
purpose.
    Submerged arc furnace means any furnace wherein electrical energy is 
converted to heat energy by transmission of current between electrodes 
partially submerged in the furnace charge. The furnace may be of an 
open, semi-sealed, or sealed design.
    Tapping emissions means a source of air pollutant emissions that 
occur during the process of removing the molten product from the 
furnace.
    Tapping period means the time from when a tap hole is opened until

    (c) Compliance demonstration with the emission standards. (1) The 
owner or operator must conduct an initial performance test for air 
pollution control devices or vent stacks subject to Sec. 63.1652(a) 
through (e) to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission 
standards.
    (2) The owner or operator must conduct annual performance tests for 
the air pollution control devices and vent stacks associated with the 
submerged arc furnaces, with the exception of any air pollution control 
devices that serve tapping emissions combined with non-furnace 
emissions, such as the MOR process or equipment associated with crushing 
and screening. Also excluded are air pollution control devices that 
serve dedicated non-furnace emissions, such as the MOR process or 
equipment associated with crushing and screening. The results of these 
annual tests

[[Page 668]]

will be used to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards in 
Sec. 63.1652(a) through (e), as applicable.
    (3) Following development, and approval, if required, of the site-
specific test plan, the owner or operator must conduct a performance 
test for each air pollution control device or vent stack to measure 
particulate matter and determine compliance with the applicable 
standard.
    (i) An owner or operator of sources subject to the particulate 
matter concentration standards in Sec. 63.1652(a)(2), (d), or (e), must 
determine compliance as follows:
    (A) Determine the particulate matter concentration using Method 5 or 
5D, as applicable.
    (B) Compliance is demonstrated if the average concentration for the 
three runs comprising the performance test does not exceed the standard.
    (ii) An owner or operator of sources subject to the particulate mass 
rate standards in Sec. 63.1652(b) or (c) must determine compliance as 
follows:
    (A) Determine the particulate matter concentration and volumetric 
flow rate using Method 5 or 5D, as applicable.
    (B) Compute the mass rate (E<INF>M</INF>) of particulate matter for 
each run using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20MY99.000

Where:

E<INF>M</INF> = mass rate of particulate matter, kg/hr (lb/hr).
N = total number of exhaust streams at which emissions are quantified.
C<INF>si</INF> = concentration of particulate matter from exhaust stream 
          ``i'', mg/dscm (gr/dscf).
Q<INF>sdi</INF> = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas from exhaust 
          stream ``i'', dscm/hr (dscf/hr)
K = conversion factor, 1  x  10<SUP>6</SUP> mg/kg (7,000 gr/lb).

    (C) Compliance is demonstrated if the average of the mass rates for 
the three runs comprising the performance test does not exceed the 
standard.
    (iii) An owner or operator of sources subject to the particulate 
matter process-weighted rate standard in Sec. 63.1652(a)(1) must 
determine compliance as follows:
    (A) Determine particulate matter concentration and volumetric flow 
rate using Method 5 or 5D, as applicable.
    (B) Compute the process-weighted mass rate (E<INF>P</INF>) of 
particulate matter for each run using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20MY99.001

Where:

E<INF>P</INF> = process-weighted mass rate of particulate matter, kg/hr/
          MW (lb/hr/MW).
N = total number of exhaust streams at which emissions are quantified.
C<INF>si</INF> = concentration of particulate matter from exhaust stream 
          ``i'', mg/dscm (gr/dscf)
Q<INF>sdi</INF> = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas from exhaust 
          stream ``i'', dscm/hr (dscf/hr)
P = Average furnace power input, MW
K = conversion factor, 1  x  10<SUP>6</SUP> mg/kg (7,000 gr/lb).

    (C) Compliance is demonstrated if the average process-weighted mass 
rate for the three runs comprising the performance test does not exceed 
the standard.
    (4) If a venturi scrubber is used to comply with the emission 
standards, the owner or operator must establish as a site-specific 
operating parameter the lowest average pressure drop on any individual 
complying run in the three runs constituting any compliant test. The 
pressure drop must be monitored at least every 5 minutes during the test 
and hourly averages recorded.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (ii) The owner or operator may augment the data obtained under 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section by conducting multiple performance 
tests to establish a range of compliant operating parameter values. The 
lowest value of this range would be selected as the operating parameter 
monitoring value. The use of historic compliance data may be used to 
establish the compliant operating parameter value if the previous values 
were recorded during performance tests using the same test methods 
specified in this subpart and established as required in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section.
    (d) Compliance demonstration with opacity standards. (1)(i) The 
owner or operator subject to Sec. 63.1653 must conduct initial opacity 
observations of the

[[Page 669]]

shop building to demonstrate compliance with the applicable opacity 
standards according to Sec. 63.6(h)(5), which addresses the conduct of 
opacity or visible emission observations.
    (ii) In conducting the opacity observations of the shop building, 
the observer must limit his or her field of view to the area of the shop 
building roof monitor that corresponds to the placement of the affected 
submerged arc furnaces.
    (iii) The owner or operator must conduct the opacity observations 
according to EPA Method 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, for a minimum 
of 60 minutes.
    (2)(i) When demonstrating initial compliance with the shop building 
opacity standard, as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the 
owner or operator must simultaneously establish parameter values for one 
of the following: the control system fan motor amperes and all capture 
system damper positions, the total volumetric flow rate to the air 
pollution control device and all capture system damper positions, or 
volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood that comprises 
the capture system.
    (ii) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to 
reestablish these parameters whenever he or she can demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the submerged arc furnace operating 
conditions upon which the parameters were previously established are no 
longer applicable. The values of these parameters determined during the 
most recent demonstration of compliance must be maintained at the 
appropriate level for each applicable period.
    (3) The owner or operator must demonstrate continuing compliance 
with the opacity standards by following the monitoring requirements 
specified in Sec. 63.1657(c) and the reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements specified in Secs. 63.1659(b)(4) and 63.1660(b).
    (e) Compliance demonstration with the operational and work practice 
standards. (1) Fugitive dust sources. Failure to have a fugitive dust 
control plan or failure to report deviations from the plan and take 
necessary corrective action would be a violation of the general duty to 
ensure that fugitive dust sources are operated and maintained in a 
manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for 
minimizing emissions per Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i) of subpart A.
    (2) Baghouses equipped with bag leak detection systems. The owner or 
operator demonstrates compliance with the bag leak detection system 
requirements by submitting reports as required by Sec. 63.1659(b)(5) 
showing that the alarm on the system does not sound for more than 5 
percent of the total operating time in a 6-month period. Calculate the 
percentage of total operating time the alarm on the bag leak detection 
system sounds as follows:
    (i) Do not include alarms that occur due solely to a malfunction of 
the bag leak detection system in the calculation.
    (ii) Do not include alarms that occur during startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction in the calculation if the condition is described in the 
startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and the owner or operator 
follows all the procedures in the plan defined for this condition.
    (iii) Count 1 hour of alarm time for each alarm where the owner or 
operator initiates procedures to determine the cause within 1 hour of 
the alarm.
    (iv) Count the actual time it takes the owner or operator to 
initiate procedures to determine the cause of the alarm for each alarm 
where the owner or operator does not initiate procedures to determine 
the cause within 1 hour of the alarm.
    (v) Calculate the percentage of time the alarm on the bag leak 
detection system sounds as the ratio of the sum of alarm times to the 
total operating time multiplied by 100.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1657  Monitoring requirements.

    (a) Baghouses. (1) For the baghouses serving the submerged arc 
furnaces, the metal oxygen refining process, and crushing and screening 
operations, the owner or operator must observe on a daily basis for the 
presence of any visible emissions.
    (2) In addition to the daily visible emissions observation, the 
owner or operator must conduct the following activities:
    (i) Daily monitoring of pressure drop across each baghouse cell, or 
across the

[[Page 670]]

baghouse if it is not possible to monitor each cell individually, to 
ensure the pressure drop is within the normal operating range identified 
in the baghouse maintenance plan.
    (ii) Weekly confirmation that dust is being removed from hoppers 
through visual inspection, or equivalent means of ensuring the proper 
functioning of removal mechanisms.
    (iii) Daily check of compressed air supply for pulse-jet baghouses.
    (iv) An appropriate methodology for monitoring cleaning cycles to 
ensure proper operation.
    (v) Monthly check of bag cleaning mechanisms for proper functioning 
through visual inspection or equivalent means.
    (vi) Quarterly visual check of bag tension on reverse air and 
shaker-type baghouses to ensure that the bags are not kinked (kneed or 
bent) or laying on their sides. Such checks are not required for shaker-
type baghouses using self-tensioning (spring loaded) devices.
    (vii) Quarterly confirmation of the physical integrity of the 
baghouse structure through visual inspection of the baghouse interior 
for air leaks.
    (viii) Semiannual inspection of fans for wear, material buildup, and 
corrosion through visual inspection, vibration detectors, or equivalent 
means.
    (3) In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed 
submerged arc furnace must install and continuously operate a bag leak 
detection system if the furnace primary and/or tapping emissions are 
ducted to a negative pressure baghouse or to a positive pressure 
baghouse equipped with a stack. The bag leak detection system must meet 
the following requirements:
    (i) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at 
concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains 
per actual cubic foot) or less.
    (ii) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative particulate matter loadings, and the owner or operator must 
continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system.
    (iii) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound when an increase in relative particulate loadings 
is detected over a preset level. The alarm must be located where it can 
be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
    (iv) Each bag leak detection system that works based on the 
triboelectric effect must be installed, calibrated, operated, and 
maintained consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
guidance document ``Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-
454/R-98-015). Other bag leak detection systems must be installed, 
calibrated, and maintained consistent with the manufacturer's written 
specifications and recommendations.
    (v) The initial adjustment of the system must, at a minimum, consist 
of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) 
and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the alarm set 
points and the alarm delay time.
    (vi) Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator must not 
adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or 
alarm delay time, except as detailed in the maintenance plan required 
under Sec. 63.1655(b). In no event must the sensitivity be increased by 
more than 100 percent or decreased more than 50 percent over a 365-day 
period unless a responsible official certifies the baghouse has been 
inspected and found to be in good operating condition.
    (vii) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (4) As part of the maintenance plan required by Sec. 63.1655(b), the 
owner or operator must develop and implement corrective action 
procedures to be followed in the case of a bag leak detection system 
alarm (for baghouses equipped with such a system), the observation of 
visible emissions from the baghouse, or the indication through the 
periodic baghouse system inspections that the system is not operating 
properly. The owner or operator must initiate corrective action as soon 
as practicable after the occurrence of the

[[Page 671]]

observation or event indicating a problem.
    (5) The corrective action plan must include procedures used to 
determine the cause of an alarm or other indications of problems as well 
as actions to minimize emissions. These actions may include the 
following:
    (i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or 
filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in 
emissions.
    (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
    (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media, or otherwise 
repairing the control device.
    (iv) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment.
    (v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe, or otherwise 
repairing the bag leak detection system.
    (vi) Shutting down the process producing the particulate matter 
emissions.
    (6) Failure to monitor or failure to take corrective action under 
the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section would be a violation 
of the general duty to operate in a manner consistent with good air 
pollution control practices that minimizes emissions per 
Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i) of subpart A.
    (b) Venturi scrubbers. (1) The owner or operator must monitor the 
pressure drop across the venturi at least every 5 minutes and record the 
average hourly pressure drop. Measurement of an average hourly pressure 
drop less than the pressure drop operating parameter limit established 
during a successful compliance demonstration would be a violation of the 
applicable emission standard, unless the excursion in the pressure drop 
is due to a malfunction.
    (2) As part of the maintenance plan required by Sec. 63.1655(b), the 
owner or operator must develop and implement corrective action 
procedures to be followed in the case of a violation of the pressure 
drop requirement. The owner or operator must initiate corrective action 
as soon as practicable after the excursion.
    (3) Failure to monitor or failure to take corrective action under 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is a violation of the 
general duty to operate in a manner consistent with good air pollution 
control practices that minimizes emissions per Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i).
    (c) Shop opacity. The owner or operator subject to the opacity 
standards in Sec. 63.1653 must comply with one of the monitoring options 
in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. The selected 
option must be consistent with that selected during the initial 
performance test described in Sec. 63.1656(d)(2). Alternatively, the 
owner or operator may use the provisions of Sec. 63.8(f) to request 
approval to use an alternative monitoring method.
    (1) The owner or operator must check and record the control system 
fan motor amperes and capture system damper positions once per shift.
    (2) The owner or operator must install, calibrate, and maintain a 
monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate 
through each separately ducted hood.
    (3) The owner or operator must install, calibrate, and maintain a 
monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at 
the inlet of the air pollution control device and must check and record 
the capture system damper positions once per shift.
    (4) The flow rate monitoring devices must meet the following 
requirements:
    (i) Be installed in an appropriate location in the exhaust duct such 
that reproducible flow rate monitoring will result.
    (ii) Have an accuracy <plus-minus>10 percent over its normal 
operating range and be calibrated according to the manufacturer's 
instructions.
    (5) The Administrator may require the owner or operator to 
demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring device(s) relative to Methods 
1 and 2 of appendix A of part 60 of this chapter.
    (6) Failure to maintain the appropriate capture system parameters 
(fan motor amperes, flow rate, and/or damper positions) establishes the 
need to initiate corrective action as soon as practicable after the 
monitoring excursion in order to minimize excess emissions.
    (7) Failure to monitor or failure to take corrective action under 
the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section is a violation of the 
general duty to operate in a manner consistent with

[[Page 672]]

good air pollution control practices that minimizes emissions per 
Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i).

Secs. 63.1662--63.1679  [Reserved]

                   Appendix A to Part 63--Test Methods

   Method 301--Field Validation of Pollutant Measurement Methods from 
                           Various Waste Media

                     1. Applicability and principle

    1.1  Applicability. This method, as specified in the applicable 
subpart, is to be used whenever a source owner or operator (hereafter 
referred to as an ``analyst'') proposes a test method to meet a U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirement in the absence of a 
validated method. This Method includes procedures for determining and 
documenting the quality, i.e., systematic error (bias) and random error 
(precision), of the measured concentrations from an effected source. 
This method is applicable to various waste media (i.e., exhaust gas, 
wastewater, sludge, etc.).
    1.1.1  If EPA currently recognizes an appropriate test method or 
considers the analyst's test method to be satisfactory for a particular 
source, the Administrator may waive the use of this protocol or may 
specify a less rigorous validation procedure. A list of validated 
methods may be obtained by contacting the Emission Measurement Technical 
Information Center (EMTIC), Mail Drop 19, U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, (919) 541-0200. Procedures for 
obtaining a waiver are in Section 12.0.
    1.1.2  This method includes optional procedures that may be used to 
expand the applicability of the proposed method. Section 7.0 involves 
ruggedness testing (Laboratory Evaluation), which demonstrates the 
sensitivity of the method to various parameters. Section 8.0 involves a 
procedure for including sample stability in bias and precision for 
assessing sample recovery and analysis times; Section 9.0 involves a 
procedure for the determination of the practical limit of quantitation 
for determining the lower limit of the method. These optional procedures 
are required for the waiver consideration outlined in Section 12.0.
    1.2  Principle. The purpose of these procedures is to determine bias 
and precision of a test method at the level of the applicable standard. 
The procedures involve (a) introducing known concentrations of an 
analyte or comparing the test method against a validated test method to 
determine the method's bias and (b) collecting multiple or collocated 
simultaneous samples to determine the method's precision.
    1.2.1  Bias. Bias is established by comparing the method's results 
against a reference value and may be eliminated by employing a 
correction factor established from the data obtained during the 
validation test. An offset bias may be handled accordingly. Methods that 
have bias correction factors outside 0.7 to 1.3 are unacceptable. 
Validated method to proposed method comparisons, section 6.2, requires a 
more restrictive test of central tendency and a lower correction factor 
allowance of 0.90 to 1.10.
    1.2.2  Precision. At the minimum, paired sampling systems shall be 
used to establish precision. The precision of the method at the level of 
the standard shall not be greater than 50 percent relative standard 
deviation. For a validated method to proposed method equivalency 
comparisons, section 6.2, the analyst must demonstrate that the 
precision of the proposed test method is as precise as the validated 
method for acceptance.

                             2. Definitions

    2.1  Negative bias. Bias resulting when the measured result is less 
than the ``true'' value.
    2.2  Paired sampling system. A sampling system capable of obtaining 
two replicate samples that were collected as closely as possible in 
sampling time and sampling location.
    2.3  Positive bias. Bias resulting when the measured result is 
greater than the ``true'' value.
    2.4  Proposed method. The sampling and analytical methodology 
selected for field validation using the method described herein.
    2.5  Quadruplet sampling system. A sampling system capable of 
obtaining four replicate samples that were collected as closely as 
possible in sampling time and sampling location.
    2.6  Surrogate compound. A compound that serves as a model for the 
types of compounds being analyzed (i.e., similar chemical structure, 
properties, behavior). The model can be

[[Page 676]]

distinguished by the method from the compounds being analyzed.

                          3. Reference Material

    The reference materials shall be obtained or prepared at the level 
of the standard. Additional runs with higher and lower reference 
material concentrations may be made to expand the applicable range of 
the method, in accordance with the ruggedness test procedures.
    3.1  Exhaust Gas Tests. The analyst shall obtain a known 
concentration of the reference material (i.e., analyte of concern) from 
an independent source such as a specialty gas manufacturer, specialty 
chemical company, or commercial laboratory. A list of vendors may be 
obtained from EMTIC (see Section 1.1.1). The analyst should obtain the 
manufacturer's stability data of the analyte concentration and 
recommendations for recertification.
    3.2  Other Waste Media Tests. The analyst shall obtain pure liquid 
components of the reference materials (i.e., analytes of concern) from 
an independent manufacturer and dilute them in the same type matrix as 
the source waste. The pure reference materials shall be certified by the 
manufacturer as to purity and shelf life. The accuracy of all diluted 
reference material concentrations shall be verified by comparing their 
response to independently-prepared materials (independently prepared in 
this case means prepared from pure components by a different analyst).
    3.3  Surrogate Reference Materials. The analyst may use surrogate 
compounds, e.g., for highly toxic or reactive organic compounds, 
provided the analyst can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction 
that the surrogate compound behaves as the analyte. A surrogate may be 
an isotope or one that contains a unique element (e.g., chlorine) that 
is not present in the source or a derivation of the toxic or reactive 
compound, if the derivative formation is part of the method's procedure. 
Laboratory experiments or literature data may be used to show behavioral 
acceptability.
    3.4  Isotopically Labeled Materials. Isotope mixtures may contain 
the isotope and the natural analyte. For best results, the isotope 
labeled analyte concentration should be more than five times the natural 
concentration of the analyte.

                    4. EPA Performance Audit Material

    4.1  To assess the method bias independently, the analyst shall use 
(in addition to the reference material) an EPA performance audit 
material, if it is available. The analyst may contact EMTIC (see section 
1.1.1) to receive a list of currently available EPA audit materials. If 
the analyte is listed, the analyst should request the audit material at 
least 30 days before the validation test. If an EPA audit material is 
not available, request documentation from the validation report 
reviewing authority that the audit material is currently not available 
from EPA. Include this documentation with the field validation report.
    4.2  The analyst shall sample and analyze the performance audit 
sample three times according to the instructions provided with the audit 
sample. The analyst shall submit the three results with the field 
validation report. Although no acceptance criteria are set for these 
performance audit results, the analyst and reviewing authority may use 
them to assess the relative error of sample recovery, sample 
preparation, and analytical procedures and then consider the relative 
error in evaluating the measured emissions.

    5. Procedure for Determination of Bias and Precision in the Field

    The analyst shall select one of the sampling approaches below to 
determine the bias and precision of the data. After analyzing the 
samples, the analyst shall calculate the bias and precision according to 
the procedure described in section 6.0. When sampling a stationary 
source, follow the probe placement procedures in section 5.4.
    5.1  Isotopic Spiking. This approach shall be used only for methods 
that require mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Bias and precision are 
calculated by procedures described in section 6.1.
    5.1.1  Number of Samples and Sampling Runs. Collect a total of 12 
replicate samples by either obtaining six sets of paired samples or 
three sets of quadruplet samples.
    5.1.2  Spiking Procedure. Spike all 12 samples with the reference 
material at the level of the standard. Follow the appropriate spiking 
procedures listed below for the applicable waste medium.
    5.1.2.1  Exhaust Gas Testing. The spike shall be introduced as close 
to the tip of the sampling probe as possible.
    5.1.2.1.1  Gaseous Reference Material with Sorbent or Impinger 
Sampling Trains. Sample the reference material (in the laboratory or in 
the field) at a concentration which is close to the allowable 
concentration standard for the time required by the method, and then 
sample the gas stream for an equal amount of time. The time for sampling 
both the reference material and gas stream should be equal; however, the 
time should be adjusted to avoid sorbent breakthrough.
    5.1.2.1.2  Gaseous Reference Material with Sample Container (Bag or 
Canister). Spike the sample containers after completion of each test run 
with an amount equal to the allowable concentration standard of the 
emission point. The final concentration of the reference material shall 
approximate the level of the emission concentration in the stack. The 
volume amount of reference material

[[Page 677]]

shall be less than 10 percent of the sample volume.
    5.1.2.1.3  Liquid and Solid Reference Material with Sorbent or 
Impinger Trains. Spike the trains with an amount equal to the allowable 
concentration standard before sampling the stack gas. The spiking should 
be done in the field; however, it may be done in the laboratory.
    5.1.2.1.4  Liquid and Solid Reference Material with Sample Container 
(Bag or Canister). Spike the containers at the completion of each test 
run with an amount equal to the level of the emission standard.
    5.1.2.2  Other Waste Media. Spike the 12 replicate samples with the 
reference material either before or directly after sampling in the 
field.
    5.2  Comparison Against a Validated Test Method. Bias and precision 
are calculated using the procedures described in section 6.2. This 
approach shall be used when a validated method is available and an 
alternative method is being proposed.
    5.2.1  Number of Samples and Sampling Runs. Collect nine sets of 
replicate samples using a paired sampling system (a total of 18 samples) 
or four sets of replicate samples using a quadruplet sampling system (a 
total of 16 samples). In each sample set, the validated test method 
shall be used to collect and analyze half of the samples.
    5.2.2  Performance Audit Exception. Conduct the performance audit as 
required in section 4.0 for the validated test method. Conducting a 
performance audit on the test method being evaluated is recommended.
    5.3  Analyte Spiking. This approach shall be used when sections 5.1 
and 5.2 are not applicable. Bias and precision are calculated using the 
procedures described in Section 6.3.
    5.3.1  Number of Samples and Sampling Runs. Collect a total of 24 
samples using the quadruplet sampling system (a total of 6 sets of 
replicate samples).
    5.3.2  In each quadruplet set, spike half of the samples (two out of 
the four) with the reference material according to the applicable 
procedure in section 5.1.2.1 or 5.1.2.2.
    5.4  Probe Placement and Arrangement for Stationary Source Stack or 
Duct Sampling. The probes shall be placed in the same horizontal plane. 
For paired sample probes the arrangement should be that the probe tip is 
2.5 cm from the outside edge of the other with a pitot tube on the 
outside of each probe. Other paired arrangements for the pitot tube may 
be acceptable. For quadruplet sampling probes, the tips should be in a 
6.0 cm  x  6.0 cm square area measured from the center line of the 
opening of the probe tip with a single pitot tube in the center or two 
pitot tubes with their location on either side of the probe tip 
configuration. An alternative arrangement should be proposed whenever 
the cross-sectional area of the probe tip configuration is approximately 
5 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.

                             6. Calculations

    Data resulting from the procedures specified in section 5.0 shall be 
treated as follows to determine bias, correction factors, relative 
standard deviations, precision, and data acceptance.
    6.1  Isotopic Spiking. Analyze the data for isotopic spiking tests 
as outlined in sections 6.1.1 through 6.1.6.
    6.1.1  Calculate the numerical value of the bias using the results 
from the analysis of the isotopically spiked field samples and the 
calculated value of the isotopically labeled spike:

B=CS-S<INF>m</INF>    Eq. 301=1

where:

B=Bias at the spike level.
S<INF>m</INF>=Mean of the measured values of the isotopically spiked 
          samples.
CS=Calculated value of the isotopically labeled spike.
    6.1.2  Calculate the standard deviation of the S<INF>i</INF> values 
as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.048


Eq. 301-2

where:

S <INF>i</INF>=Measured value of the isotopically labeled analyte in the 
          ith field sample,
n=Number of isotopically spiked samples, 12.
    6.1.3.  Calculate the standard deviation of the mean (SDM) as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.049


Eq. 301-3
    6.1.4 Test the bias for statistical significance by calculating the 
t-statistic,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.050

Eq. 301-4

and compare it with the critical value of the two-sided t-distribution 
at the 95-percent confidence level and n-1 degrees of freedom. This 
critical value is 2.201 for the eleven degrees of freedom when the 
procedure specified in section 5.1.2 is followed. If the calculated t-
value is greater than the critical value the bias is statistically 
significant and the analyst should proceed to evaluate the correction 
factor.

[[Page 678]]

    6.1.5  Calculation of a Correction Factor. If the t-test does not 
show that the bias is statistically significant, use all analytical 
results without correction and proceed to the precision evaluation. If 
the method's bias is statistically significant, calculate the correction 
factor, CF, using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.051

Eq. 301-5
If the CF is outside the range of 0.70 to 1.30, the data and method are 
considered unacceptable. For correction factors within the range, 
multiply all analytical results by the CF to obtain the final values.
    6.1.6  Calculation of the Relative Standard Deviation (Precision). 
Calculate the relative standard deviation as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.052

Eq. 301-6
where S<INF>m</INF> is the measured mean of the isotopically labeled 
spiked samples.
    6.2  Comparison with Validated Method. Analyze the data for 
comparison with a validated method as outlined in sections 6.2.1 or 
6.2.2, as appropriate. Conduct these procedures in order to determine if 
a proposed method produces results equivalent to a validated method. 
Make all necessary bias corrections for the validated method, as 
appropriate. If the proposed method fails either test, the method 
results are unacceptable, and conclude that the proposed method is not 
as precise or accurate as the validated method. For highly variable 
sources, additional precision checks may be necessary. The analyst 
should consult with the Administrator if a highly variable source is 
suspected.
    6.2.1  Paired Sampling Systems.
    6.2.1.1.  Precision. Determine the acceptance of the proposed 
method's variance with respect to the variability of the validated 
method results. If a significant difference is determined, the proposed 
method and the results are rejected. Proposed methods demonstrating F-
values equal to or less than the critical value have acceptable 
precision.
    6.2.1.2  Calculate the variance of the proposed method, 
S<INF>p</INF>2, and the variance of the validated method, 
S<INF>v</INF>2, using the following equation:

S<INF>(porv)</INF>2=SD<SUP>2</SUP>     Eq. 301-7

where:

SD<INF>v</INF>=Standard deviation provided with the validated method,
SD<INF>p</INF>=Standard deviation of the proposed method calculated 
          using Equation 301-9a.

    6.2.1.3  The F-test. Determine if the variance of the proposed 
method is significantly different from that of the validated method by 
calculating the F-value using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.053

Eq. 301-8
    Compare the experimental F value with the critical value of F. The 
critical value is 1.0 when the procedure specified in section 5.2.1 for 
paired trains is followed. If the calculated F is greater than the 
critical value, the difference in precision is significant and the data 
and proposed method are unacceptable.
    6.2.1.4  Bias Analysis. Test the bias for statistical significance 
by calculating the t-statistic and determine if the mean of the 
differences between the proposed method and the validated method is 
significant at the 80-percent confidence level. This procedure requires 
the standard deviation of the validated method, SD<INF>v</INF>, to be 
known. Employ the value furnished with the method. If the standard 
deviation of the validated method is not available, the paired replicate 
sampling procedure may not be used. Determine the mean of the paired 
sample differences, d<INF>m</INF>, and the standard deviation, 
SD<INF>d</INF>, of the differences, d<INF>1</INF>'s, using Equation 301-
2 where: d<INF>i</INF> replaces S<INF>i</INF>, d<INF>m</INF> replaces 
S<INF>m</INF>. Calculate the standard deviation of the proposed method, 
SD<INF>p</INF>, as follows:

SD<INF>p</INF>=SD<INF>d</INF>-SD<INF>v</INF>    Eq. 301-9a

(If SD<INF>v</INF>>SD<INF>d</INF>, let SD=SD<INF>d</INF>/1.414).

    Calculate the value of the t-statistic using the following equation:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.054
    
Eq. 301-9

where n is the total number of paired samples. For the procedure in 
section 5.2.1, n equals nine. Compare the calculated t-statistic with 
the corresponding value from the table of the t-statistic. When nine 
runs are conducted, as specified in section 5.2.1, the critical value of 
the t-statistic is 1.397 for eight degrees of freedom. If the calculated 
t-value is greater than the critical value the bias is statistically 
significant and the analyst should proceed to evaluate the correction 
factor.
    6.2.1.5  Calculation of a Correction Factor. If the statistical test 
cited above does not show a significant bias with respect to the 
reference method, assume that the proposed

[[Page 679]]

method is unbiased and use all analytical results without correction. If 
the method's bias is statistically significant, calculate the correction 
factor, CF, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.055

Eq. 301-10

where V<INF>m</INF> is the mean of the validated method's values.
    Multiply all analytical results by CF to obtain the final values. 
The method results, and the method, are unacceptable if the correction 
factor is outside the range of 0.9 to 1.10.
    6.2.2  Quadruplet Replicate Sampling Systems.
    6.2.2.1  Precision. Determine the acceptance of the proposed 
method's variance with respect to the variability of the validated 
method results. If a significant difference is determined the proposed 
method and the results are rejected.
    6.2.2.2  Calculate the variance of the proposed method, 
S<INF>p</INF><SUP>2</SUP>, using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.056

Eq. 301-11

where the d<INF>i</INF>'s are the differences between the validated 
method values and the proposed method values.

    6.2.2.3  The F-test. Determine if the variance of the proposed 
method is more variable than that of the validated method by calculating 
the F-value using Equation 301-8. Compare the experimental F value with 
the critical value of F. The critical value is 1.0 when the procedure 
specified in section 5.2.2 for quadruplet trains is followed. The 
calculated F should be less than or equal to the critical value. If the 
difference in precision is significant the results and the proposed 
method are unacceptable.
    6.2.2.4  Bias Analysis. Test the bias for statistical significance 
at the 80 percent confidence level by calculating the t-statistic. 
Determine the bias (mean of the differences between the proposed method 
and the validated method, d<INF>m</INF>) and the standard deviation, 
SD<INF>d</INF>, of the differences. Calculate the standard deviation of 
the differences, SD<INF>d</INF>, using Equation 301-2 and substituting 
d<INF>i</INF> for S<INF>i</INF>. The following equation is used to 
calculate d<INF>i</INF>:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.057

Eq. 301-12

and: V<INF>1i</INF>=First measured value of the validated method in the 
          ith test sample.
P<INF>1i</INF>=First measured value of the proposed method in the ith 
          test sample.

    Calculate the t-statistic using Equation 301-9 where n is the total 
number of test sample differences (d<INF>i</INF>). For the procedure in 
section 5.2.2, n equals four. Compare the calculated t-statistic with 
the corresponding value from the table of the t-statistic and determine 
if the mean is significant at the 80-percent confidence level. When four 
runs are conducted, as specified in section 5.2.2, the critical value of 
the t-statistic is 1.638 for three degrees of freedom. If the calculated 
t-value is greater than the critical value the bias is statistically 
significant and the analyst should proceed to evaluate the correction 
factor.
    6.2.2.5  Correction Factor Calculation. If the method's bias is 
statistically significant, calculate the correction factor, CF, using 
Equation 301-10. Multiply all analytical results by CF to obtain the 
final values. The method results, and the method, are unacceptable if 
the correction factor is outside the range of 0.9 to 1.10.
    6.3  Analyte Spiking. Analyze the data for analyte spike testing as 
outlined in Sections 6.3.1 through 6.3.3.
    6.3.1  Precision.
    6.3.1.1  Spiked Samples. Calculate the difference, d<INF>i</INF>, 
between the pairs of the spiked proposed method measurements for each 
replicate sample set. Determine the standard deviation (SD<INF>s</INF>) 
of the spiked values using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.058

Eq. 301-13

where: n = Number of runs.
    Calculate the relative standard deviation of the proposed spiked 
method using Equation 301-6 where S<INF>m</INF> is the measured mean of 
the analyte spiked samples. The proposed method is unacceptable if the 
RSD is greater than 50 percent.
    6.3.1.2  Unspiked Samples. Calculate the standard deviation of the 
unspiked values using Equation 301-13 and the relative standard 
deviation of the proposed unspiked method using Equation 301-6 where 
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured mean of the analyte spiked samples. The 
RSD must be less than 50 percent.

[[Page 680]]

    6.3.2  Bias. Calculate the numerical value of the bias using the 
results from the analysis of the spiked field samples, the unspiked 
field samples, and the calculated value of the spike:

B=S<INF>m</INF>-M<INF>m</INF>-CS
Eq. 301-14

where: B = Bias at the spike level.
S<INF>m</INF> = Mean of the spiked samples.
M<INF>m</INF> = Mean of the unspiked samples.
CS = Calculated value of the spiked level.
    6.3.2.1  Calculate the standard deviation of the mean using the 
following equation where SD<INF>s</INF> and SD<INF>u</INF> are the 
standard deviations of the spiked and unspiked sample values 
respectively as calculated using Equation 301-13.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.059

Eq. 301-15

    6.3.2.2  Test the bias for statistical significance by calculating 
the t-statistic using Equation 301-4 and comparing it with the critical 
value of the two-sided t-distribution at the 95-percent confidence level 
and n-1 degrees of freedom. This critical value is 2.201 for the eleven 
degrees of freedom.
    6.3.3  Calculation of a Correction Factor. If the t-test shows that 
the bias is not statistically significant, use all analytical results 
without correction. If the method's bias is statistically significant, 
calculate the correction factor using Equation 301-5. Multiply all 
analytical results by CF to obtain the final values.

                    7. Ruggedness Testing (Optional)

    7.1  Laboratory Evaluation.
    7.1.1  Ruggedness testing is a useful and cost-effective laboratory 
study to determine the sensitivity of a method to certain parameters 
such as sample collection rate, interferant concentration, collecting 
medium temperature, or sample recovery temperature. This Section 
generally discusses the principle of the ruggedness test. A more 
detailed description is presented in citation 10 of Section 13.0.
    7.1.2  In a ruggedness test, several variables are changed 
simultaneously rather than one variable at a time. This reduces the 
number of experiments required to evaluate the effect of a variable. For 
example, the effect of seven variables can be determined in eight 
experiments rather than 128 (W.J. Youden, Statistical Manual of the 
Association of Official Analytical Chemists, Association of Official 
Analytical Chemists, Washington, DC, 1975, pp. 33-36).
    7.1.3  Data from ruggedness tests are helpful in extending the 
applicability of a test method to different source concentrations or 
source categories.

   8. Procedure for Including Sample Stability in Bias and Precision 
                               Evaluations

    8.1  Sample Stability.
    8.1.1  The test method being evaluated must include procedures for 
sample storage and the time within which the collected samples shall be 
analyzed.
    8.1.2  This section identifies the procedures for including the 
effect of storage time in bias and precision evaluations. The evaluation 
may be deleted if the test method specifies a time for sample storage.
    8.2  Stability Test Design. The following procedures shall be 
conducted to identify the effect of storage times on analyte samples. 
Store the samples according to the procedure specified in the test 
method. When using the analyte spiking procedures (section 5.3), the 
study should include equal numbers of spiked and unspiked samples.
    8.2.1  Stack Emission Testing.
    8.2.1.1  For sample container (bag or canister) and impinger 
sampling systems, sections 5.1 and 5.3, analyze six of the samples at 
the minimum storage time. Then analyze the same six samples at the 
maximum storage time.
    8.2.1.2  For sorbent and impinger sampling systems, sections 5.1 and 
5.3, that require extraction or digestion, extract or digest six of the 
samples at the minimum storage time and extract or digest six other 
samples at the maximum storage time. Analyze an aliquot of the first six 
extracts (digestates) at both the minimum and maximum storage times. 
This will provide some freedom to analyze extract storage impacts.
    8.2.1.3  For sorbent sampling systems, sections 5.1 and 5.3, that 
require thermal desorption, analyze six samples at the minimum storage 
time. Analyze another set of six samples at the maximum storage time.
    8.2.1.4  For systems set up in accordance with section 5.2, the 
number of samples analyzed at the minimum and maximum storage times 
shall be half those collected (8 or 9). The procedures for samples 
requiring extraction or digestion should parallel those in section 
8.2.1.
    8.2.2  Other Waste Media Testing. Analyze half of the replicate 
samples at the minimum storage time and the other half at the maximum 
storage time in order to identify the effect of storage times on analyte 
samples.

   9. Procedure for Determination of Practical Limit of Quantitation 
                               (Optional)

    9.1  Practical Limit of Quantitation.
    9.1.1  The practical limit of quantitation (PLQ) is the lowest level 
above which quantitative results may be obtained with an acceptable 
degree of confidence. For this protocol, the PLQ is defined as 10 times 
the standard deviation, s<INF>o</INF>, at the blank level. This PLQ 
corresponds to an uncertainty of

[[Page 681]]

<plus-minus>30 percent at the 99-percent confidence level.
    9.1.2  The PLQ will be used to establish the lower limit of the test 
method.
    9.2  Procedure I for Estimating s<INF>o</INF>. This procedure is 
acceptable if the estimated PLQ is no more than twice the calculated 
PLQ. If the PLQ is greater than twice the calculated PLQ use Procedure 
II.
    9.2.1  Estimate the PLQ and prepare a test standard at this level. 
The test standard could consist of a dilution of the reference material 
described in section 3.0.
    9.2.2  Using the normal sampling and analytical procedures for the 
method, sample and analyze this standard at least seven times in the 
laboratory.
    9.2.3  Calculate the standard deviation, s<INF>o</INF>, of the 
measured values.
    9.2.4  Calculate the PLQ as 10 times s<INF>o</INF>.
    9.3  Procedure II for Estimating s<INF>o</INF>. This procedure is to 
be used if the estimated PLQ is more than twice the calculated PLQ.
    9.3.1  Prepare two additional standards at concentration levels 
lower than the standard used in Procedure I.
    9.3.2  Sample and analyze each of these standards at least seven 
times.
    9.3.3  Calculate the standard deviation for each concentration 
level.
    9.3.4  Plot the standard deviations of the three test standards as a 
function of the standard concentrations.
    9.3.5  Draw a best-fit straight line through the data points and 
extrapolate to zero concentration. The standard deviation at zero 
concentration is S<INF>0</INF>.
    9.3.6  Calculate the PLQ as 10 times S<INF>0</INF>.

                10.0 Field Validation Report Requirements

    The field validation report shall include a discussion of the 
regulatory objectives for the testing which describe the reasons for the 
test, applicable emission limits, and a description of the source. In 
addition, validation results shall include:
    10.1  Summary of the results and calculations shown in section 6.0.
    10.2  Reference material certification and value(s).
    10.3  Performance audit results or letter from the reviewing 
authority stating the audit material is currently not available.
    10.4  Laboratory demonstration of the quality of the spiking system.
    10.5  Discussion of laboratory evaluations.
    10.6  Discussion of field sampling.
    10.7  Discussion of sample preparations and analysis.
    10.8  Storage times of samples (and extracts, if applicable).
    10.9  Reasons for eliminating any results.

                          11. Followup Testing

    The correction factor calculated in section 6.0 shall be used to 
adjust the sample concentrations in all followup tests conducted at the 
same source. These tests shall consist of at least three replicate 
samples, and the average shall be used to determine the pollutant 
concentration. The number of samples to be collected and analyzed shall 
be as follows, depending on the validated method precision level:
    11.1  Validated relative standard deviation (RSD) <ls-thn-eq> 
<plus-minus>15 Percent. Three replicate samples.
    11.2  Validated RSD <ls-thn-eq> <plus-minus>30 Percent. Six 
replicate samples.
    11.3  Validated RSD <ls-thn-eq> <plus-minus>50 Percent. Nine 
replicate samples.
    11.4  Equivalent method. Three replicate samples.

                  12. Procedure for Obtaining a Waiver

    12.1  Waivers. These procedures may be waived or a less rigorous 
protocol may be granted for site-specific applications. The following 
are three example situations for which a waiver may be considered.
    12.1.1  ``Similar'' Sources. If the test method has been validated 
previously at a ``similar'' source, the procedures may be waived 
provided the requester can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that the sources are ``similar.'' The methods's 
applicability to the ``similar'' source may be demonstrated by 
conducting a ruggedness test as described in section 6.0.
    12.1.2  ``Documented'' Methods. In some cases, bias and precision 
may have been documented through laboratory tests or protocols different 
from this method. If the analyst can demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Administrator that the bias and precision apply to a particular 
application, the Administrator may waive these procedures or parts of 
the procedures.
    12.1.3  ``Conditional'' Test Methods. When the method has been 
demonstrated to be valid at several sources, the analyst may seek a 
``conditional'' method designation from the Administrator. 
``Conditional'' method status provides an automatic waiver from the 
procedures provided the test method is used within the stated 
applicability.
    12.2  Application for Waiver. In general, the requester shall 
provide a thorough description of the test method, the intended 
application, and results of any validation or other supporting 
documents. Because of the many potential situations in which the 
Administrator may grant a waiver, it is neither possible nor desirable 
to prescribe the exact criteria for a waiver. At a minimum, the 
requester is responsible for providing the following.
    12.2.1  A clearly written test method, preferably in the format of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A Test Methods. The method must include an 
applicability statement, concentration range, precision, bias 
(accuracy), and time in which samples must be analyzed.

[[Page 682]]

    12.2.2.2  Summaries (see section 10.0) of previous validation tests 
or other supporting documents. If a different procedure from that 
described in this method was used, the requester shall provide 
appropriate documents substantiating (to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator) the bias and precision values.
    12.2.2.3  Results of testing conducted with respect to sections 7.0, 
8.0, and 9.0.
    12.2.3  Discussion of the applicability statement and arguments for 
approval of the waiver. This discussion should address as applicable the 
following: Applicable regulation, emission standards, effluent 
characteristics, and process operations.
    12.3  Requests for Waiver. Each request shall be in writing and 
signed by the analyst. Submit requests to the Director, OAQPS, Technical 
Support Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research 
Triangle Park, NC 27711.

Method 303--Determination of Visible Emissions From By-Product Coke Oven 
                                Batteries

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1  Applicability. This method applies to the determination of 
visible emissions (VE) from the following by-product coke oven battery 
sources: Charging systems during charging, doors, topside port lids, and 
offtake systems on operating coke ovens; and collecting mains. In order 
for the test method results to be indicative of plant performance, the 
time of day of the run should vary.
    1.2  Principle. A certified observer visually determines the VE from 
coke oven battery sources (the certification procedures are described in 
section 2). This method does not require that opacity of emissions be 
determined or that magnitude be differentiated.
    1.3  Definitions.
    1.3.1  Bench. The platform structure in front of the oven doors.
    1.3.2  By-product Coke Oven Battery. A source consisting of a group 
of ovens connected by common walls, where coal undergoes destructive 
distillation under positive pressure to produce coke and coke oven gas, 
from which by-products are recovered.
    1.3.3  Charge or Charging Period. The period of time that commences 
when coal begins to flow into an oven through a topside port and ends 
when the last charging port is recapped.
    1.3.4  Charging System. An apparatus used to charge coal to a coke 
oven (e.g., a larry car for wet coal charging systems).
    1.3.5  Coke Oven Door. Each end enclosure on the pusher side and the 
coking side of an oven. The chuck, or leveler-bar, door is considered 
part of the pusher side door. The coke oven door area includes the 
entire area

battery between two adjacent buck stays.
    1.3.6  Coke Side. The side of a battery from which the coke is 
discharged from ovens at the end of the coking cycle.
    1.3.7  Collecting Main. Any apparatus that is connected to one or 
more offtake systems and that provides a passage for conveying gases 
under positive pressure from the by-product coke oven battery to the by-
product recovery system.
    1.3.8  Consecutive Charges. Charges observed successively, excluding 
any charge during which the observer's view of the charging system or 
topside ports is obscured.
    1.3.9  Damper-off. To close off the gas passage between the coke 
oven and the collecting main, with no flow of raw coke oven gas from the 
collecting main into the oven or into the oven's offtake system(s).
    1.3.10  Decarbonization Period. The period of time for combusting 
oven carbon that commences when the oven lids are removed from an empty 
oven or when standpipe caps of an oven are opened. The period ends with 
the initiation of the next charging period for that oven.

include the standpipe and standpipe caps, goosenecks, stationary jumper 
pipes, mini-standpipes, and standpipe and gooseneck connections.
    1.3.14  Operating Oven. Any oven not out of operation for rebuild or 
maintenance work extensive enough to require the oven to be skipped in 
the charging sequence.
    1.3.15  Oven. A chamber in the coke oven battery in which coal 
undergoes destructive distillation to produce coke.
    1.3.16  Push Side. The side of the battery from which the coke is 
pushed from ovens at the end of the coking cycle.
    1.3.17  Run. The observation of visible emissions from topside port 
lids, offtake systems, coke oven doors, or the charging of a single oven 
in accordance with this method.
    1.3.18  Shed. Structures for capturing coke oven emissions on the

charged into the oven of a by-product coke oven battery.
    1.3.21  Traverse Time. Accumulated time for a traverse as measured 
by a stopwatch. Traverse time includes time to stop and write down oven 
numbers but excludes time waiting for obstructions of view to clear or 
for time to walk around obstacles.
    1.3.22  Visible Emissions (VE). Any emission seen by the unaided 
(except for corrective lenses) eye, excluding steam or condensing water.

                        2. Observer Certification

    2.1  Certification Procedures. This method requires only the 
determination of whether VE occur and does not require the determination 
of opacity levels; therefore, observer certification according to Method 
9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is not required to obtain 
certification under this method. However, in order to receive Method 303 
observer certification, the first-time observer (trainee) shall have 
attended the lecture portion of the Method 9 certification course. In 
addition, the trainee shall successfully complete the Method 303 
training course, satisfy the field observation requirement, and 
demonstrate adequate performance and sufficient knowledge of Method 303. 
The Method 303 training course shall be conducted by or under the 
sanction of the EPA and shall consist of classroom instruction and field 
observations, and a proficiency test.
    2.1.1  The classroom instruction shall familiarize the trainees with 
Method 303 through lecture, written training materials, and a Method 303 
demonstration video. A successful completion of the classroom portion of 
the Method 303 training course shall be demonstrated by a perfect score 
on a written test. If the trainee fails to answer all of the questions 
correctly, the trainee may review the appropriate portion of the 
training materials and retake the test.
    2.1.2  The field observations shall be a minimum of 12 hours and 
shall be completed before attending the Method 303 certification course. 
Trainees shall observe the operation of a coke oven battery as it 
pertains to Method 303, including topside operations, and shall also 
practice conducting Method 303 or similar methods. During the field 
observations, trainees unfamiliar with coke battery operations shall 
receive instruction from an experienced coke oven observer familiar with 
Method 303 or similar methods and the operation of coke batteries. The 
trainee must verify completion of at least 12 hours of field observation 
prior to attending the Method 303 certification course.
    2.1.3  All trainees must demonstrate proficiency in the application 
of Method 303 to a panel of three certified Method 303 observers, 
including an ability to differentiate coke oven emissions from 
condensing water vapor

[[Page 684]]

and smoldering coal. Each panel member shall have at least 120 days 
experience in reading visible emissions from coke ovens. The visible 
emissions inspections that will satisfy the experience requirement must 
be inspections of coke oven battery fugitive emissions from the emission 
points subject to emission standards under subpart L of this part (i.e., 
coke oven doors, topside port lids, offtake system(s), and charging 
operations), using either Method 303 or predecessor State or local test 
methods. A ``day's experience'' for a particular inspection is a day on 
which one complete inspection was performed for that emission point 
under Method 303 or a predecessor State or local method. A ``day's 
experience'' does not mean 8 or 10 hours performing inspections, or any 
particular time expressed in minutes or hours that may have been spent 
performing them. Thus, it would be possible for an individual to qualify 
as a Method 303 panel member for some emission points, but not others 
(e.g., an individual might satisfy the experience requirement for coke 
oven doors, but not topside port lids). Until November 15, 1994, the EPA 
may waive the certification requirement (but not the experience 
requirement) for panel members. The composition of the panel shall be 
approved by the EPA. The panel shall observe the trainee in a series of 
training runs and a series of certification runs. There shall be a 
minimum of 1 training run for doors, topside port lids, and offtake 
systems, and a minimum of 5 training runs (i.e., 5 charges) for 
charging. During training runs, the panel can advise the trainee on 
proper procedures. There shall be a minimum of 3 certification runs for 
doors, topside port lids, and offtake systems, and a minimum of 15 
certification runs for charging (i.e., 15 charges). The certifications 
runs shall be unassisted. Following the certification test runs, the 
panel shall approve or disapprove certification based on the trainee's 
performance during the certification runs. To obtain certification, the 
trainee shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the panel a high degree 
of proficiency in performing Method 303. To aid in evaluating the 
trainee's performance, a checklist, provided by the EPA, will be used.
    Caution: Because coke oven batteries have hazardous environments, 
the training materials and the field training shall cover the 
precautions required by the company to address health and safety 
hazards. Special emphasis shall be given to the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA) regulations pertaining to exposure of coke 
oven workers (see Citation 3 in the Bibliography). In general, the 
regulation requires that special fire-retardant clothing and respirators 
be worn in certain restricted areas of the coke oven battery. The OSHA 
regulation also prohibits certain activities, such as chewing gum, 
smoking, and eating in these areas.
    2.2  Observer Certification/Recertification. The coke oven observer 
certification is valid for 1 year from date of issue. The observer shall 
recertify annually by viewing the training video and answering all of 
the questions on the certification test correctly. Every 3 years, an 
observer shall be required to pass the proficiency test in section 2.1.3 
in order to be certified.
    2.3  The EPA (or applicable enforcement agency) shall maintain 
records reflecting a certified observer's successful completion of the 
proficiency test, which shall include the completed proficiency test 
checklists for the certification runs.
    2.4  An owner or operator of a coke oven battery subject to subpart 
L of this part may observe a training and certification program under 
this section.

  3. Procedure for Determining VE From Charging Systems During Charging

    3.1  Number of Oven Charges. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part 
for the number of oven charges to observe. The observer shall observe 
consecutive charges. Charges that are nonconsecutive can only be 
observed when necessary to replace observations terminated prior to the 
completion of a charge because of visual interferences. (See section 
3.5.)
    3.2  Data Records. Record all the information requested at the top 
of the charging system inspection sheet (Figure 303-1). For each charge, 
record the identification number of the oven being charged, the 
approximate beginning time of the charge, and the identification of the 
larry car used for the charge.
    3.3  Observer Position. Stand in an area or move to positions on the 
topside of the coke oven battery with an unobstructed view of the entire 
charging system. For wet coal charging systems or non-pipeline coal 
charging systems, the observer should have an unobstructed view of the 
emission points of the charging system, including larry car hoppers, 
drop sleeves, and the topside ports of the oven being charged. Some 
charging systems are configured so that all emission points can only be 
seen from a distance of five ovens. For other batteries, distances of 8 
to 12 ovens are adequate.
    3.4  Observation. The charging period begins when coal begins to 
flow into the oven and ends when the last charging port is recapped. 
During the charging period, observe all of the potential sources of VE 
from the entire charging system. For wet coal charging systems or non-
pipeline coal charging systems, sources of VE typically include the 
larry car hoppers, drop sleeves, slide gates, and topside ports on the 
oven being charged. Any VE from an open standpipe cap on the oven being 
charged is included as charging VE.

[[Page 685]]

    3.4.1  Using an accumulative-type stopwatch with unit divisions of 
at least 0.5 seconds, determine the total time VE are observed as 
follows. Upon observing any VE emerging from any part of the charging 
system, start the stopwatch. Stop the watch when VE are no longer 
observed emerging, and restart the watch when VE reemerges.
    3.4.2  When VE occur simultaneously from several points during a 
charge, consider the sources as one. Time overlapping VE as continuous 
VE. Time single puffs of VE only for the time it takes for the puff to 
emerge from the charging system. Continue to time VE in this manner for 
the entire charging period. Record the accumulated time to the nearest 
0.5 second under ``Visible emissions, seconds'' on Figure 303-1.
    3.5  Visual Interference. If fugitive VE from other sources at the 
coke oven battery site (e.g., door leaks or condensing water vapor from 
the coke oven wharf) prevent a clear view of the charging system during 
a charge, stop the stopwatch and make an appropriate notation under 
``Comments'' on Figure 303-1. Label the observation an observation of an 
incomplete charge, and observe another charge to fulfill the 
requirements of section 3.1.
    3.6  VE Exemptions. Do not time the following VE:
    3.6.1  The VE from burning or smoldering coal spilled on top of the 
oven, topside port lid, or larry car surfaces;
    Note: The VE from smoldering coal are generally white or gray. These 
VE generally have a plume of less than 1 meter long. If the observer 
cannot safely and with reasonable confidence determine that VE are from 
charging, do not count them as charging emissions.

    3.6.2  The VE from the coke oven doors or from the leveler bar; or
    3.6.3  The VE that drift from the top of a larry car hopper if the 
emissions had already been timed as VE from the drop sleeve.

    Note: When the slide gate on a larry car hopper closes after the 
coal has been added to the oven, the seal may not be airtight. On 
occasions, a puff of smoke observed at the drop sleeves is forced past 
the slide gate up into the larry car hopper and may drift from the top; 
time these VE either at the drop sleeves or the hopper. If the larry car 
hopper does not have a slide gate or the slide gate is left open or 
partially closed, VE may quickly pass through the larry car hopper 
without being observed at the drop sleeves and will appear as a strong 
surge of smoke; time these as charging VE.

    3.7  Total Time Record. Record the total time that VE were observed 
for each charging operation in the appropriate column on the charging 
system inspection sheet.
    3.8  Five charging observations (runs) obtained in accordance with 
this method shall be considered a valid set of observations for that 
day. No observation of an incomplete charge shall be included in a daily 
set of observations that is lower than the lowest reading for a complete 
charge. If both complete and incomplete charges have been observed, the 
daily set of observations shall include the five highest values 
observed. Four or three charging observations (runs) obtained in 
accordance with this method shall be considered a valid set of charging 
observations only where it is not possible to obtain five charging 
observations, because of visual interferences (see section 3.5) or 
inclement weather prevent a clear view of the charging system during 
charging. However, observations from three or four charges that satisfy 
these requirements shall not be considered a valid set of charging 
observations if use of such set of observations in a calculation under 
section 3.9 would cause the value of A to be less than 145.
    3.9  Log Average. For each day on which a valid daily set of 
observations is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling log average 
of seconds of visible emissions from the charging operation for each 
battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily sets of 
observations, in accordance with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.003

where

e=2.72,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.004

ln=Natural logarithm, and
X<INF>i</INF>=Seconds of VE during the i<SUP>th</SUP> charge.
A=150 or the number of valid observations (runs). The value of A shall 
          not be less than 145, except for purposes of determinations 
          under Sec. 63.306(c) (work practice plan implementation) or 
          Sec. 63.306(d) (work practice plan revisions) of this part. No 
          set of observations shall be considered valid for such a 
          recalculation that otherwise would not be considered a valid 
          set of observations for a calculation under this paragraph.

        4. Procedure for Determining VE From Coke Oven Door Areas

    The intent of this procedure is to determine VE from coke oven door 
areas by carefully observing the door area from a standard distance 
while walking at a normal pace.
    4.1  Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for the 
appropriate number of runs.
    4.2  Battery Traverse. To conduct a battery traverse, walk the 
length of the battery on the outside of the pusher machine and

[[Page 686]]

quench car tracks at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing to make 
appropriate entries on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2). A 
single test run consists of two timed traverses, one for the coke side 
and one for the push side. The walking pace shall not exceed an average 
rate of 4 seconds per oven door, excluding time spent moving around 
stationary obstructions or waiting for other obstructions to move from 
positions blocking the view of a series of doors. Extra time is allowed 
for each leak for the observer to make the proper notation. A walking 
pace of 3 seconds per oven door has been found to be typical. Record the 
actual traverse time with a stopwatch.
    4.2.1  Time only the time spent observing the doors and recording 
door leaks. To measure actual traverse time, use an accumulative-type 
stopwatch with unit divisions of 0.5 seconds or less. Exclude 
interruptions to the traverse and time required for the observer to move 
to positions where the view of the battery is unobstructed, or for 
obstructions, such as the door machine, to move from positions blocking 
the view of a series of doors.
    4.2.2  Various situations may arise that will prevent the observer 
from viewing a door or a series of doors. Prior to the door inspection, 
the owner or operator may elect to temporarily suspend charging 
operations for the duration of the inspection, so that all of the doors 
can be viewed by the observer. The observer has two options for dealing 
with obstructions to view: (a) Stop the stopwatch and wait for the 
equipment to move or the fugitive emissions to dissipate before 
completing the traverse; or (b) stop the stopwatch, skip the affected 
ovens, and move to a position to continue the traverse. Restart the 
stopwatch and continue the traverse. After the completion of the 
traverse, if the equipment has moved or the fugitive emissions have 
dissipated, inspect the affected doors. If the equipment is still 
preventing the observer from viewing the doors, then the affected doors 
may be counted as not observed. If option (b) is used because of doors 
blocked by machines during charging operations, then, of the affected 
doors, exclude the door from the most recently charged oven from the 
inspection. Record the oven numbers and make an appropriate notation 
under ``Comments'' on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2).
    4.2.3  When batteries have sheds to control emissions, conduct the 
inspection from outside the shed unless the doors cannot be adequately 
viewed. In this case, conduct the inspection from the bench. Be aware of 
special safety considerations pertinent to walking on the bench and 
follow the instructions of company personnel on the required equipment 
and operations procedures. If possible, conduct the bench traverse 
whenever the bench is clear of the door machine and hot coke guide.
    4.3  Observations. Record all the information requested at the top 
of the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2), including the number 
of inoperable ovens. Record the clock time at the start of the traverse 
on each side of the battery. Record which side is being inspected, i.e., 
coke side or push side. Other information may be recorded at the 
discretion of the observer, such as the location of the leak (i.e., top 
of the door, chuck door, etc.), the reason for any interruption of the 
traverse, or the position of the sun relative to the battery and sky 
conditions (i.e., overcast, partly sunny, etc.).
    4.3.1  Begin the test run by starting the stopwatch and traversing 
either the coke side or the push side of the battery. After completing 
one side, stop the watch. Complete this procedure on the other side. If 
inspecting more than one battery, the observer may view the push sides 
and the coke sides sequentially.
    4.3.2  During the traverse, look around the entire perimeter of each 
oven door. The door is considered leaking if VE are detected in the coke 
oven door area. The coke oven door area includes the entire area on the 
vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top of the 
battery between two adjacent buck stays (e.g., the oven door, chuck 
door, between the masonry brick, buck stay or jamb, or other sources). 
Record the oven number and make the appropriate notation on the door 
area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2).

    Note: Multiple VE from the same door area (e.g., VE from both the 
chuck door and the push side door) are counted as only one emitting 
door, not as multiple emitting doors.
    4.3.3  Do not record the following sources as door area VE:
    4.3.3.1  VE from ovens with doors removed. Record the oven number 
and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;''
    4.3.3.2  VE from ovens taken out of service. The owner or operator 
shall notify the observer as to which ovens are out of service. Record 
the oven number and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;'' or
    4.3.3.3  VE from hot coke that has been spilled on the bench as a 
result of pushing.
    4.4  Criteria for Acceptance. After completing the run, calculate 
the maximum time allowed to observe the ovens by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.005

where

T=Total time allowed for traverse, seconds;
D<INF>t</INF>=Total number of oven doors on the battery; and
L=Number of doors with VE.

[[Page 687]]

    4.4.1  If the total traverse time exceeds T, void the run, and 
conduct another run to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of 
this part.
    4.5  Calculations for Percent Leaking Doors (PLD). Determine the 
total number of doors for which observations were made on the coke oven 
battery as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.006

where

D<INF>ob</INF>=Total number of doors observed on operating ovens;
D<INF>i</INF>=Number of doors on nonoperating ovens;
D<INF>no</INF>=Number of doors not observed; and
N=Total number of ovens in the battery.
    4.5.1  For each test run (one run includes both the coke side and 
the push side traverses), sum the number of doors with door area VE. For 
batteries subject to an approved alternative standard under Sec. 63.305 
of this part, calculate the push side and the coke side PLD separately.
    4.5.2  Calculate percent leaking doors by using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.007

where

PLD=Percent leaking doors for the test run;
L<INF>y</INF>=Number of doors with VE observed from the yard; and
D<INF>ob</INF>=Total number of doors observed on operating ovens.
    4.5.3  When traverses are conducted from the bench under sheds, 
calculate the coke side and the push side separately. Use the following 
equation to calculate a yard-equivalent reading:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.008

where

N=Total number of ovens on the battery;
L<INF>b</INF>=Yard-equivalent reading; and
L<INF>s</INF>=Number of doors with VE observed from the bench under 
          sheds.

    If L<INF>b</INF> is less than zero, use zero for L<INF>b</INF> in 
Equation 303-6 in the calculation of PLD.
    4.5.3.1  Use the following equation to calculate PLD:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.009
    
where

PLD=Percent leaking coke oven doors for the run;
L<INF>b</INF>=Yard equivalent reading;
L<INF>y</INF>=Number of doors with VE observed from the yard on the push 
          side; and
D<INF>ob</INF>=Total number of doors observed on operating ovens.

    Round off PLD to the nearest hundredth of 1 percent and record as 
the percent leaking coke oven doors for the run.
    4.5.3.2  30-day Rolling Average. For each day on which a valid 
observation is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling average for 
each battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily 
observations, in accordance with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.010

   5. Procedure for Determining VE from Topside Port Lids and Offtake 
                                 Systems

    5.1  Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for the 
number of runs to be conducted. Simultaneous runs or separate runs for 
the topside port lids and offtake systems may be conducted.
    5.2  Battery Traverse. To conduct a topside traverse of the battery, 
walk the length of the battery at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing 
only to make appropriate entries on the topside inspection sheet (Figure 
303-3). The walking pace shall not exceed an average rate of 4 seconds 
per oven, excluding time spent moving around stationary obstructions or 
waiting for other obstructions to move from positions blocking the view. 
Extra time is allowed for each leak for the observer to make the proper 
notation. A walking pace of 3 seconds per oven is typical. Record the 
actual traverse time with a stopwatch.
    5.3  Topside Port Lid Observations. To observe lids of the ovens 
involved in the charging operation, the observer shall wait to view the 
lids until approximately 5 minutes after the completion of the charge. 
Record all the information requested on the topside inspection sheet 
(Figure 303-3). Record the clock time when traverses begin and end. If 
the observer's view is obstructed during the traverse (e.g., steam from 
the coke wharf, larry car, etc.), follow the guidelines given in section 
4.2.2.
    5.3.1  To perform a test run, conduct a single traverse on the 
topside of the battery. The observer shall walk near the center of the 
battery but may deviate from this path

[[Page 688]]

to avoid safety hazards (such as open or closed charging ports, luting 
buckets, lid removal bars, and topside port lids that have been removed) 
and any other obstacles. Upon noting VE from the topside port lid(s) of 
an oven, record the oven number and port number, then resume the 
traverse. If any oven is dampered-off from the collecting main for 
decarbonization, note this under ``Comments'' for that particular oven.

    Note: Count the number of topside ports, not the number of points, 
exhibiting VE, i.e., if a topside port has several points of VE, count 
this as one port exhibiting VE.

    5.3.2  Do not count the following as topside port lid VE:
    5.3.2.1  VE from between the brickwork and oven lid casing or VE 
from cracks in the oven brickwork. Note these VE under ``Comments;''
    5.3.2.2  VE from topside ports involved in a charging operation. 
Record the oven number, and make an appropriate notation (i.e., not 
observed because ports open for charging) under ``Comments;''
    5.3.2.3  Topside ports having maintenance work done. Record the oven 
number and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;'' or
    5.3.2.4  Condensing water from wet-sealing material. Ports with only 
visible condensing water from wet-sealing material are counted as 
observed but not as having VE.
    5.3.2.5  Visible emissions from the flue inspection ports and caps.
    5.4  Offtake Systems Observations. To perform a test run, traverse 
the battery as in section 5.3.1. Look ahead and back two to four ovens 
to get a clear view of the entire offtake system for each oven. Consider 
visible emissions from the following points as offtake system VE: (a) 
the flange between the gooseneck and collecting main (``saddle''), (b) 
the junction point of the standpipe and oven (``standpipe base''), (c) 
the other parts of the offtake system (e.g., the standpipe cap), and (d) 
the junction points with ovens and flanges of jumper pipes.
    5.4.1  Do not stray from the traverse line in order to get a 
``closer look'' at any part of the offtake system unless it is to 
distinguish leaks from interferences from other sources or to avoid 
obstacles.
    5.4.2  If the centerline does not provide a clear view of the entire 
offtake system for each oven (e.g., when standpipes are longer than 15 
feet), the observer may conduct the traverse farther from (rather than 
closer to) the offtake systems.
    5.4.3  Upon noting a leak from an offtake system during a traverse, 
record the oven number. Resume the traverse. If the oven is dampered-off 
from the collecting main for decarbonization and VE are observed, note 
this under ``Comments'' for that particular oven.
    5.4.4  If any part or parts of an offtake system have VE, count it 
as one emitting offtake system. Each stationary jumper pipe is 
considered a single offtake system.
    5.4.5  Do not count standpipe caps open for a decarbonization period 
or standpipes of an oven being charged as source of offtake system VE. 
Record the oven number and write ``Not observed'' and the reason (i.e., 
decarb or charging) under ``Comments.''

    Note: VE from open standpipes of an oven being charged count as 
charging emissions. All VE from closed standpipe caps count as offtake 
leaks.

    5.5  Criteria for Acceptance. After completing the run (allow 2 
traverses for batteries with double mains), calculate the maximum time 
allowed to observe the topside port lids and/or offtake systems by the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.011

where

T=Total time allowed for traverse, seconds;
N=Total number of ovens in the battery; and
Z=Number of topside port lids or offtake systems with VE.
    5.5.1  If the total traverse time exceeds T, void the run and 
conduct another run to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of 
this part.
    5.6  In determining the percent leaking topside port lids and 
percent leaking offtake systems, do not include topside port lids or 
offtake systems with VE from the following ovens:
    5.6.1  Empty ovens, including ovens undergoing maintenance, which 
are properly dampered off from the main.
    5.6.2  Ovens being charged or being pushed.
    5.6.3  Up to 3 full ovens that have been dampered off from the main 
prior to pushing.
    5.6.4  Up to 3 additional full ovens in the pushing sequence that 
have been dampered off from the main for offtake system cleaning, for 
decarbonization, for safety reasons, or when a charging/pushing schedule 
involves widely separated ovens (e.g., a Marquard system); or that have 
been dampered off from the main for maintenance near the end of the 
coking cycle. Examples of reasons that ovens are dampered off for

[[Page 689]]

safety reasons are to avoid exposing workers in areas with insufficient 
clearance between standpipes and the larry car, or in areas where 
workers could be exposed to flames or hot gases from open standpipes, 
and to avoid the potential for removing a door on an oven that is not 
dampered off from the main.
    5.6.5  Topside Port Lids. Determine the percent leaking topside port 
lids for each run as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.012

where

PLL=Percent leaking topside port lids for the run;
P<INF>VE</INF>=Number of topside port lids with VE;
P<INF>ovn</INF>=Number of ports per oven;
N=Total number of ovens in the battery;
N<INF>i</INF>=Number of inoperable ovens; and
P<INF>NO</INF>=Number of ports not observed.
    5.6.5.1  Round off this percentage to the nearest hundredth of 1 
percent and record this percentage as the percent leaking topside port 
lids for the run.
    5.6.5.2  30-day Rolling Average. For each day on which a valid daily 
observation is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling average for 
each battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily 
observations, in accordance with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.013

    5.6.6  Offtake Systems. Determine the percent leaking offtake 
systems for the run as follows:

where
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.014

PLO=Percent leaking offtake systems;
T<INF>VE</INF>=Number of offtake systems with VE;
T<INF>ovn</INF>=Number of offtake systems (excluding jumper pipes) per 
          oven;
N=Total number of ovens in the battery;
N<INF>i</INF>=Total number of inoperable ovens;
T<INF>NO</INF>=Number of offtake systems not observed; and
J=Number of stationary jumper pipes.
    5.6.6.1  Round off this percentage to the nearest hundredth of 1 
percent and record this percentage as the percent leaking offtake 
systems for the run.
    5.6.6.2  30-day Rolling Average. For each day on which a valid daily 
observation is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling average for 
each battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily 
observations, in accordance with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.015

    6. Procedure for Determining VE From Collecting Mains
    6.1  Traverse. To perform a test run, traverse both the collecting 
main catwalk and the battery topside along the side closest to the 
collecting main. If the battery has a double main, conduct two sets of 
traverses for each run, i.e., one set for each main.

[[Page 690]]

    6.2  Data Recording. Upon noting VE from any portion of a collection 
main, identify the source and approximate location of the source of VE 
and record the time under ``Collecting main'' on Figure 303-3; then 
resume the traverse.
    6.3  Collecting Main Pressure Check. After the completion of the 
door traverse, the topside port lids, and offtake systems, compare the 
collecting main pressure during the inspection to the collecting main 
pressure during the previous 8 to 24 hours. Record the following: (a) 
The pressure during inspection, (b) presence of pressure deviation from 
normal operations, and (c) the explanation for any pressure deviation 
from normal operations, if any, offered by the operators. The owner or 
operator of the coke battery shall maintain the pressure recording 
equipment and conduct the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) 
necessary to ensure reliable pressure readings and shall keep the QA/QC 
records for at least 6 months. The observer may periodically check the 
QA/QC records to determine their completeness. The owner or operator 
shall provide access to the records within 1 hour of an observer's 
request.

 Method 303A--Determination of Visible Emissions From Nonrecovery Coke 
                             Oven Batteries

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1  Applicability. This method determines percent leaking doors.
    1.2  Principle. A certified observer visually determines the VE from 
coke oven battery sources. This method does not require that opacity of 
emissions be determined or that magnitude be differentiated.
    1.3  Definitions.

                               2. Training

    2.1  Training. This method requires only the determination of 
whether VE occur and does not require the determination of opacity 
levels; therefore, observer certification according to Method 9 in 
appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is not required. However, the 
first-time observer (trainee) shall have attended the lecture portion of 
the Method 9 certification course. Furthermore, before conducting any VE 
observations, an observer shall become familiar with nonrecovery coke 
oven battery operations and with this test method by observing for a 
minimum of 4 hours the operation of a nonrecovery coke oven battery.

        3. Procedure for Determining VE From Coke Oven Door Areas

    The intent of this procedure is to determine VE from coke oven door 
areas by carefully observing the door area while walking at a normal 
pace.
    3.1  Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for the 
appropriate number of runs.
    3.2  Battery Traverse. To conduct a battery traverse, walk the 
length of the battery on the outside of the pusher machine and quench 
car tracks at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing to make appropriate 
entries on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1). A single test 
run consists of two timed traverses, one for the coke side and one for 
the push side.
    3.2.1  Various situations may arise that will prevent the observer 
from viewing a door or a series of doors. The observer has two options 
for dealing with obstructions to view: (a) Wait for the equipment to 
move or the fugitive emissions to dissipate before completing the 
traverse; or (b) skip the affected ovens and move to a position to 
continue the traverse. Continue the traverse. After the completion of 
the traverse, if the equipment has moved or the fugitive emissions have 
dissipated, complete the traverse by inspecting the affected doors. 
Record the oven numbers and make an appropriate notation under 
``Comments'' on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1).
    3.2.2  When batteries have sheds to control pushing emissions, 
conduct the inspection from outside the shed, if the shed allows such 
observations, or from the bench. Be aware of special safety 
considerations pertinent to walking on the bench and follow the 
instructions of company personnel on the required equipment and 
operations procedures. If possible, conduct the bench traverse whenever 
the bench is clear of the door machine and hot coke guide.
    3.3  Observations. Record all the information requested at the top 
of the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1), including the number 
of inoperable ovens. Record which side is being inspected, i.e., coke 
side or push side. Other information may be recorded at the discretion 
of the observer, such as the location of the leak (e.g., top of the 
door), the reason for any interruption of the traverse, or the position 
of the sun relative to the battery and sky conditions (i.e., overcast, 
partly sunny, etc.).
    3.3.1  Begin the test run by traversing either the coke side or the 
push side of the battery. After completing one side, traverse the other 
side.
    3.3.2  During the traverse, look around the entire perimeter of each 
oven door. The door is considered leaking if VE are detected in the coke 
oven door area. The coke oven door area includes the entire area on the 
vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top of the 
battery. Record the oven number and make the appropriate notation on the 
door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1).
    3.3.3  Do not record the following sources as door area VE:
    3.3.3.1  VE from ovens with doors removed. Record the oven number 
and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;''
    3.3.3.2  VE from ovens where maintenance work is being conducted. 
Record the oven number and make an appropriate notation under 
``Comments;'' or
    3.3.3.3  VE from hot coke that has been spilled on the bench as a 
result of pushing.
    3.4  Calculations for percent leaking doors (PLD). Determine the 
total number of doors for which observations were made on the coke oven 
battery as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.016

where

D<INF>ob</INF>=Total number of doors observed on operating ovens;
D<INF>i</INF>=Number of doors on nonoperating ovens;
D<INF>no</INF>=Number of doors not observed; and
N=Total number of ovens in the battery.

[[Page 695]]

    3.4.1  For each test run (one run includes both the coke side and 
the push side traverses), sum the number of doors with door area VE.
    Note: Multiple VE from the same door area are counted as only one 
emitting door, not as multiple emitting doors.
    3.4.2  Calculate percent leaking doors by using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.017

where

PLD=Percent leaking doors for the test run;
L<INF>y</INF>=Number of doors with VE observed from the yard; and
D<INF>ob</INF>=Total number of doors observed on operating ovens.

    3.4.3  When traverses are conducted from the bench under sheds, 
calculate the coke side and the push side reading separately. Use the 
following equation to calculate a yard-equivalent reading for the coke 
side:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.018

    where

N=Total number of ovens on the battery;
L<INF>b</INF>=Yard-equivalent reading; and
L<INF>s</INF>=Number of doors with VE observed from the bench under 
          sheds.

    If L<INF>b</INF> is less than zero, use zero for L<INF>b</INF> in 
Equation 303A-4 in the calculation of PLD.
    3.4.3.1  Use the following equation to calculate PLD:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27OC93.019
    
    where

PLD=Percent leaking coke oven doors for the run;
L<INF>b</INF>=Yard equivalent reading;
L<INF>y</INF>=Number of doors with VE observed from the yard on the push 
          side; and
D<INF>ob</INF>=Total number of doors observed on operating ovens.
    Round off PLD to the nearest hundredth of 1 percent and record as 
the percent leaking coke oven doors for the run.
    3.4.3.2  30-day Rolling Average. For each day on which a valid 
observation is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling average for 
each battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily 
observations, in accordance with the following equation:

Method 304A: Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds 
                              (Vent Option)

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1  Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of biodegradation rates of organic compounds in an activated sludge 
process. The test method is designed to evaluate the ability of an 
aerobic biological reaction system to degrade or destroy specific 
components in waste streams. The method may also be used to determine 
the effects of changes in wastewater composition on operation. The 
biodegradation rates determined by utilizing this method are not 
representative of a full-scale system. The rates measured by this method 
shall be used in conjunction with the procedures listed in appendix C of 
this part to calculate the fraction emitted to the air versus the 
fraction biodegraded.
    1.2  Principle. A self-contained benchtop bioreactor system is 
assembled in the laboratory. A sample of mixed liquor is added and the 
waste stream is then fed continuously. The benchtop bioreactor is 
operated under conditions nearly identical to the target full-scale 
activated sludge process. Bioreactor temperature, dissolved oxygen 
concentration, average residence time in the reactor, waste composition, 
biomass concentration, and biomass composition of the full-scale process 
are the parameters which are duplicated in the benchtop bioreactor. 
Biomass shall be removed from the target full-scale activated sludge 
unit and held for no more than 4 hours prior to use in the benchtop 
bioreactor. If antifoaming agents are used in the full-scale system, 
they shall

[[Page 697]]

also be used in the benchtop bioreactor. The feed flowing into and the 
effluent exiting the benchtop bioreactor are analyzed to determine the 
biodegradation rates of the target compounds. The flow rate of the exit 
vent is used to calculate the concentration of target compounds 
(utilizing Henry's law) in the exit gas stream. If Henry's law constants 
for the compounds of interest are not known, this method cannot be used 
in the determination of the biodegradation rate and Method 304B is the 
suggested method. The choice of analytical methodology for measuring the 
compounds of interest at the inlet and outlet to the benchtop bioreactor 
are left to the discretion of the source, except where validated methods 
are available.

                              2. Apparatus

    Figure 1 illustrates a typical laboratory apparatus used to measure 
biodegradation rates. While the following description refers to Figure 
1, the EPA recognizes that alternative reactor configurations, such as 
alternative reactor shapes and locations of probes and the feed inlet, 
will also meet the intent of this method. Ensure that the benchtop 
bioreactor system is self-contained and isolated from the atmosphere 
(except for the exit vent stream) by leak-checking fittings, tubing, 
etc.
    2.1  Laboratory apparatus.
    2.1.1  Benchtop Bioreactor. The biological reaction is conducted in 
a biological oxidation reactor of at least 6 liters capacity. The 
benchtop bioreactor is sealed and equipped with internal probes for 
controlling and monitoring dissolved oxygen and internal temperature. 
The top of the reactor is equipped for aerators, gas flow ports, and 
instrumentation (while ensuring that no leaks to the atmosphere exist 
around the fittings).

[[Page 698]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.019

    2.1.2  Aeration gas. Aeration gas is added to the benchtop 
bioreactor through three diffusers, which are glass tubes that extend to 
the bottom fifth of the reactor depth. A pure oxygen pressurized 
cylinder is recommended in order to maintain the specified oxygen 
concentration. Install a blower (e.g., Diaphragm Type, 15 SCFH capacity) 
to blow the

[[Page 699]]

aeration gas into the reactor diffusers. Measure the aeration gas flow 
rate with a rotameter (e.g., 0-15 SCFH recommended). The aeration gas 
will rise through the benchtop bioreactor, dissolving oxygen into the 
mixture in the process. The aeration gas must provide sufficient 
agitation to keep the solids in suspension. Provide an exit for the 
aeration gas from the top flange of the benchtop bioreactor through a 
water-cooled (e.g., Allihn-type) vertical condenser. Install the 
condenser through a gas-tight fitting in the benchtop bioreactor 
closure. Install a splitter which directs a portion of the gas to an 
exit vent and the rest of the gas through an air recycle pump back to 
the benchtop bioreactor. Monitor and record the flow rate through the 
exit vent at least 3 times per day throughout the day.
    2.1.3  Wastewater Feed. Supply the wastewater feed to the benchtop 
bioreactor in a collapsible low-density polyethylene container or 
collapsible liner in a container (e.g., 20 L) equipped with a spigot cap 
(collapsible containers or liners of other material may be required due 
to the permeability of some volatile compounds through polyethylene). 
Obtain the wastewater feed by sampling the wastewater feed in the target 
process. A representative sample of wastewater shall be obtained from 
the piping leading to the aeration tank. This sample may be obtained 
from existing sampling valves at the discharge of the wastewater feed 
pump, or collected from a pipe discharging to the aeration tank, or by 
pumping from a well-mixed equalization tank upstream from the aeration 
tank. Alternatively, wastewater can be pumped continuously to the 
laboratory apparatus from a bleed stream taken from the equalization 
tank of the full-scale treatment system.
    2.1.3.1  Refrigeration System. Keep the wastewater feed cool by ice 
or by refrigeration to 4  deg.C. If using a bleed stream from the 
equalization tank, refrigeration is not required if the residence time 
in the bleed stream is less than five minutes.
    2.1.3.2  Wastewater Feed Pump. The wastewater is pumped from the 
refrigerated container using a variable-speed peristaltic pump drive 
equipped with a peristaltic pump head. Add the feed solution to the 
benchtop bioreactor through a fitting on the top flange. Determine the 
rate of feed addition to provide a retention time in the benchtop 
bioreactor that is numerically equivalent to the retention time in the 
full-scale system. The wastewater shall be fed at a rate sufficient to 
achieve 90 to 100 percent of the full-scale system residence time.
    2.1.3.3  Treated wastewater feed. The benchtop bioreactor effluent 
exits at the bottom of the reactor through a tube and proceeds to the 
clarifier.
    2.1.4  Clarifier. The effluent flows to a separate closed clarifier 
that allows separation of biomass and effluent (e.g., 2-liter pear-
shaped glass separatory funnel, modified by removing the stopcock and 
adding a 25-mm OD glass tube at the bottom). Benchtop bioreactor 
effluent enters the clarifier through a tube inserted to a depth of 0.08 
m (3 in.) through a stopper at the top of the clarifier. System effluent 
flows from a tube inserted through the stopper at the top of the 
clarifier to a drain (or sample bottle when sampling). The underflow 
from the clarifier leaves from the glass tube at the bottom of the 
clarifier. Flexible tubing connects this fitting to the sludge recycle 
pump. This pump is coupled to a variable speed pump drive. The discharge 
from this pump is returned through a tube inserted in a port on the side 
of the benchtop bioreactor. An additional port is provided near the 
bottom of the benchtop bioreactor for sampling the reactor contents. The 
mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor flows into the center of the 
clarifier. The clarified system effluent separates from the biomass and 
flows through an exit near the top of the clarifier. There shall be no 
headspace in the clarifier.
    2.1.5  Temperature Control Apparatus. Capable of maintaining the 
system at a temperature equal to the temperature of the full-scale 
system. The average temperature should be maintained within 
<plus-minus>2  deg.C of the set point.
    2.1.5.1  Temperature Monitoring Device. A resistance type 
temperature probe or a thermocouple connected to a temperature readout 
with a resolution of 0.1  deg.C or better.
    2.1.5.2  Benchtop Bioreactor Heater. The heater is connected to the 
temperature control device.
    2.1.6  Oxygen Control System. Maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration at the levels present in the full-scale system. Target 
full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentration 
below 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration 
in the benchtop bioreactor within 0.5 mg/L of the target dissolved 
oxygen level. Target full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved 
oxygen concentration above 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved 
oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor within 1.5 mg/L of the 
target dissolved oxygen concentration; however, for target full-scale 
activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentrations above 2 
mg/L, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor may 
not drop below 1.5 mg/L. If the benchtop bioreactor is outside the 
control range, the dissolved oxygen is noted and the reactor operation 
is adjusted.
    2.1.6.1  Dissolved Oxygen Monitor. Dissolved oxygen is monitored 
with a polarographic probe (gas permeable membrane) connected to a 
dissolved oxygen meter (e.g., 0 to 15 mg/L, 0 to 50  deg.C).

[[Page 700]]

    2.1.6.2  Benchtop bioreactor Pressure Monitor. The benchtop 
bioreactor pressure is monitored through a port in the top flange of the 
reactor. This is connected to a gauge control with a span of 13-cm water 
vacuum to 13-cm water pressure or better. A relay is activated when the 
vacuum exceeds an adjustable setpoint which opens a solenoid valve 
(normally closed), admitting oxygen to the system. The vacuum setpoint 
controlling oxygen addition to the system shall be set at approximately 
2.5 <plus-minus> 0.5 cm water and maintained at this setting except 
during brief periods when the dissolved oxygen concentration is 
adjusted.
    2.1.7  Connecting Tubing. All connecting tubing shall be Teflon or 
equivalent in impermeability. The only exception to this specification 
is the tubing directly inside the pump head of the wastewater feed pump, 
which may be Viton, Silicone or another type of flexible tubing. Note: 
Mention of trade names or products does not constitute endorsement by 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
    2.2  Analysis. If the identity of the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater is not known, a representative sample of the wastewater shall 
be analyzed in order to identify all of the compounds of interest 
present. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry screening method is 
recommended.
    2.2.1  After identifying the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater, develop and/or use one or more analytical techniques capable 
of measuring each of those compounds (more than one analytical technique 
may be required, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater). 
Test Method 18, found in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, may be used as a 
guideline in developing the analytical technique. Purge and trap 
techniques may be used for analysis providing the target components are 
sufficiently volatile to make this technique appropriate. The limit of 
quantitation for each compound shall be determined.\1\ If the effluent 
concentration of any target compound is below the limit of quantitation 
determined for that compound, the operation of the Method 304 unit may 
be altered to attempt to increase the effluent concentration above the 
limit of quantitation. Modifications to the method shall be approved 
prior to the test. The request should be addressed to Method 304 
contact, Emissions Measurement Center, Mail Drop 19, U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
    2.2.2  Calibration Standards. Prepare calibration standards from 
pure certified standards in an aqueous medium. Prepare and analyze three 
concentrations of calibration standards for each target component (or 
for a mixture of components) in triplicate daily throughout the analyses 
of the test samples. At each concentration level, a single calibration 
shall be within 5 percent of the average of the three calibration 
results. The low and medium calibration standards shall bracket the 
expected concentration of the effluent (treated) wastewater. The medium 
and high standards shall bracket the expected influent concentration.

                               3. Reagents

    3.1  Wastewater. Obtain a representative sample of wastewater at the 
inlet to the full-scale treatment plant if there is an existing full-
scale treatment plant (see section 2.1.3). If there is no existing full-
scale treatment plant, obtain the wastewater sample as close to the 
point of determination as possible. Collect the sample by pumping the 
wastewater into the 20-L collapsible container. The loss of volatiles 
shall be minimized from the wastewater by collapsing the container 
before filling, by minimizing the time of filling, and by avoiding a 
headspace in the container after filling. If the wastewater requires the 
addition of nutrients to support the biomass growth and maintain biomass 
characteristics, those nutrients are added and mixed with the container 
contents after the container is filled.
    3.2  Biomass. Obtain the biomass or activated sludge used for rate 
constant determination in the bench-scale process from the existing 
full-scale process or from a representative biomass culture (e.g., 
biomass that has been developed for a future full-scale process). This 
biomass is preferentially obtained from a thickened acclimated mixed 
liquor sample. Collect the sample either by bailing from the mixed 
liquor in the aeration tank with a weighted container, or by collecting 
aeration tank effluent at the effluent overflow weir. Transport the 
sample to the laboratory within no more than 4 hours of collection. 
Maintain the biomass concentration in the benchtop bioreactor at the 
level of the full-scale system +10 percent throughout the sampling 
period of the test method.
    4. Procedure. Safety Note: If explosive gases are produced as a 
byproduct of biodegradation and could realistically pose a hazard, 
closely monitor headspace concentration of these gases to ensure 
laboratory safety. Placement of the benchtop bioreactor system inside a 
laboratory hood is recommended regardless of byproducts produced.
    4.1  Benchtop Bioreactor Operation. Charge the mixed liquor to the 
benchtop bioreactor, minimizing headspace over the liquid surface to 
minimize entrainment of mixed liquor in the circulating gas. Fasten the 
benchtop bioreactor headplate to the reactor over the liquid surface. 
Maintain the temperature of the contents of the benchtop bioreactor 
system at the temperature of the target full-scale system, +2  deg.C, 
throughout the testing period. Monitor and record the temperature of the 
benchtop bioreactor contents at least to the nearest 0.1  deg.C.

[[Page 701]]

    4.1.1  Wastewater Storage. Collect the wastewater sample in the 20-L 
collapsible container. Store the container at 4  deg.C throughout the 
testing period. Connect the container to the benchtop bioreactor feed 
pump.
    4.1.2  Wastewater Flow Rate. The hydraulic residence time of the 
aeration tank is calculated as the ratio of the volume of the tank (L) 
to the flow rate (L/min). At the beginning of a test, the container 
shall be connected to the feed pump and solution shall be pumped to the 
benchtop bioreactor at the required flow rate to achieve the calculated 
hydraulic residence time of wastewater in the aeration tank.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.020

Where:
Q<INF>test</INF>=wastewater flow rate (L/min)
Qf<INF>fs</INF>=average flow rate of full-scale process (L/min)
V<INF>fs</INF>=volume of full-scale aeration tank (L)
    The target flow rate in the test apparatus is the same as the flow 
rate in the target full-scale process multiplied by the ratio of 
benchtop bioreactor volume (e.g., 6 L) to the volume of the full-scale 
aeration tank. The hydraulic residence time shall be maintained at 90 to 
100 percent of the residence time maintained in the full-scale unit. A 
nominal flow rate is set on the pump based on a pump calibration. 
Changes in the elasticity of the tubing in the pump head and the 
accumulation of material in the tubing affect this calibration. The 
nominal pumping rate shall be changed as necessary based on volumetric 
flow measurements. Discharge the benchtop bioreactor effluent to a 
wastewater storage, treatment, or disposal facility, except during 
sampling or flow measurement periods.
    4.1.3  Sludge Recycle Rate. Set the sludge recycle rate at a rate 
sufficient to prevent accumulation in the bottom of the clarifier. Set 
the air circulation rate sufficient to maintain the biomass in 
suspension.
    4.1.4  Benchtop Bioreactor Operation and Maintenance. Temperature, 
dissolved oxygen concentration, exit vent flow rate, benchtop bioreactor 
effluent flow rate, and air circulation rate shall be measured and 
recorded three times throughout each day of benchtop bioreactor 
operation. If other parameters (such as pH) are measured and maintained 
in the target full-scale unit, these parameters, where appropriate, 
shall be monitored and maintained to target full-scale specifications in 
the benchtop bioreactor. At the beginning of each sampling period 
(section 4.2), sample the benchtop bioreactor contents for suspended 
solids analysis. Take this sample by loosening a clamp on a length of 
tubing attached to the lower side port. Determine the suspended solids 
gravimetrically by the Gooch crucible/glass fiber filter method for 
total suspended solids, in accordance with Standard Methods <SUP>3</SUP> 
or equivalent. When necessary, sludge shall be wasted from the lower 
side port of the benchtop bioreactor, and the volume that is wasted 
shall be replaced with an equal volume of the reactor effluent. Add 
thickened activated sludge mixed liquor as necessary to the benchtop 
bioreactor to increase the suspended solids concentration to the desired 
level. Pump this mixed liquor to the benchtop bioreactor through the 
upper side port (Item 24 in Figure 1). Change the membrane on the 
dissolved oxygen probe before starting the test. Calibrate the oxygen 
probe immediately before the start of the test and each time the 
membrane is changed.
    4.1.5  Inspection and Correction Procedures. If the feed line tubing 
becomes clogged, replace with new tubing. If the feed flow rate is not 
within 5 percent of target flow any time the flow rate is measured, 
reset pump or check the flow measuring device and measure flow rate 
again until target flow rate is achieved.
    4.2  Test Sampling. At least two and one half hydraulic residence 
times after the system has reached the targeted specifications shall be 
permitted to elapse before the first sample is taken. Effluent samples 
of the clarifier discharge (Item 20 in Figure 1) and the influent 
wastewater feed are collected in 40-mL septum vials to which two drops 
of 1:10 hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water have been added. Sample the 
clarifier discharge directly from the drain line. These samples will be 
composed of the entire flow from the system for a period of several 
minutes. Feed samples shall be taken from the feed pump suction line 
after temporarily stopping the benchtop bioreactor feed, removing a 
connector, and squeezing the collapsible feed container. Store both 
influent and effluent samples at 4  deg.C immediately after collection 
and analyze within 8 hours of collection.
    4.2.1  Frequency of Sampling. During the test, sample and analyze 
the wastewater feed and the clarifier effluent at least six times. The 
sampling intervals shall be separated by at least 8 hours. During any 
individual sampling interval, sample the wastewater feed simultaneously 
with or immediately after the effluent sample. Calculate the relative 
standard deviation (RSD) of the amount removed (i.e., effluent 
concentration--wastewater feed concentration). The RSD values shall be  
15 percent. If an RSD value is > 15 percent, continue sampling and 
analyzing influent and effluent sets of samples until the RSD values are 
within specifications.
    4.2.2  Sampling After Exposure of System to Atmosphere. If, after 
starting sampling procedures, the benchtop bioreactor system is exposed 
to the atmosphere (due to leaks, maintenance, etc.), allow at least one 
hydraulic residence time to elapse before resuming sampling.

[[Page 702]]

                  5. Operational Checks and Calibration

    5.1  Dissolved Oxygen. Fluctuation in dissolved oxygen concentration 
may occur for numerous reasons, including undetected gas leaks, 
increases and decreases in mixed liquor suspended solids resulting from 
cell growth and solids loss in the effluent stream, changes in diffuser 
performance, cycling of effluent flow rate, and overcorrection due to 
faulty or sluggish dissolved oxygen probe response. Control the 
dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor by changing 
the proportion of oxygen in the circulating aeration gas. Should the 
dissolved oxygen concentration drift below the designated experimental 
condition, bleed a small amount of aeration gas from the system on the 
pressure side (i. e., immediately upstream of one of the diffusers). 
This will create a vacuum in the system, triggering the pressure 
sensitive relay to open the solenoid valve and admit oxygen to the 
system. Should the dissolved oxygen concentration drift above the 
designated experimental condition, slow or stop the oxygen input to the 
system until the dissolved oxygen concentration approaches the correct 
level.
    5.2  Sludge Wasting. Determine the suspended solids concentration 
(section 4.1.4) at the beginning of a test, and once per day thereafter 
during the test. If the test is completed within a two day period, 
determine the suspended solids concentration after the final sample set 
is taken. If the suspended solids concentration exceeds the specified 
concentration, remove a fraction of the sludge from the benchtop 
bioreactor. The required volume of mixed liquor to remove is determined 
as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.021

Where:
V<INF>w</INF> is the wasted volume (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and
S<INF>s</INF> is the specified solids (g/L).

    Remove the mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor by loosening a 
clamp on the mixed liquor sampling tube and allowing the required volume 
to drain to a graduated flask. Clamp the tube when the correct volume 
has been wasted. Replace the volume of the liquid wasted by pouring the 
same volume of effluent back into the benchtop bioreactor. Dispose of 
the waste sludge properly.
    5.3  Sludge Makeup. In the event that the suspended solids 
concentration is lower than the specifications, add makeup sludge back 
into the benchtop bioreactor. Determine the amount of sludge added by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.022

Where:
V<INF>w</INF> is the volume of sludge to add (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>w</INF> is the solids in the makeup sludge (g/L),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and
S<INF>s</INF> is the specified solids (g/L).

    5.4  Wastewater Pump Calibration. Determine the wastewater flow rate 
by collecting the system effluent for a time period of at least one 
hour, and measuring the volume with a graduated cylinder. Record the 
collection time period and volume collected. Determine flow rate. Adjust 
the pump speed to deliver the specified flow rate.

Method 304B: Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds 
                            (Scrubber Option)

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1  Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of biodegradation rates of organic compounds in an activated sludge 
process. The test method is designed to evaluate the ability of an 
aerobic biological reaction system to degrade or destroy specific 
components in waste streams. The method may also be used to determine 
the effects of changes in wastewater composition on operation. The 
biodegradation rates determined by utilizing this method are not 
representative of a full-scale system. Full-scale systems embody 
biodegradation and air emissions in competing reactions. This method 
measures biodegradation in absence of air emissions. The rates measured 
by this method shall be used in conjunction with the procedures listed 
in appendix C of this part to calculate the fraction emitted to the air 
versus the fraction biodegraded.
    1.2  Principle. A self-contained benchtop bioreactor system is 
assembled in the laboratory. A sample of mixed liquor is added and the 
waste stream is then fed continuously. The benchtop bioreactor is 
operated under conditions nearly identical to the target full-scale 
activated sludge process, except that air emissions are not a factor. 
The benchtop bioreactor temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, 
average residence time in the reactor, waste composition, biomass 
concentration, and biomass composition of the target full-scale process 
are the parameters which are duplicated in the laboratory system. 
Biomass shall be removed from the target full-scale activated sludge 
unit and held for no more than 4 hours prior to use in the benchtop 
bioreactor. If antifoaming agents are used in the full-scale system, 
they shall also be used in the benchtop bioreactor. The feed flowing 
into and the effluent exiting the benchtop bioreactor are analyzed to 
determine the biodegradation rates of the target compounds. The choice 
of analytical methodology for measuring the compounds of interest at the 
inlet and outlet to the benchtop bioreactor are left to the discretion 
of the source, except where validated methods are available.

                              2. Apparatus

    Figure 1 illustrates a typical laboratory apparatus used to measure 
biodegradation rates. While the following description refers to Figure 
1, the EPA recognizes that alternative reactor configurations, such as 
alternative reactor shapes and locations of probes and the feed inlet, 
will also meet the intent of this method. Ensure that the benchtop

[[Page 704]]

bioreactor system is self-contained and isolated from the atmosphere by 
leak-checking fittings, tubing, etc.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.062


[[Page 705]]


    2.1  Laboratory apparatus.
    2.1.1  Benchtop Bioreactor. The biological reaction is conducted in 
a biological oxidation reactor of at least 6-liters capacity. The 
benchtop bioreactor is sealed and equipped with internal probes for 
controlling and monitoring dissolved oxygen and internal temperature. 
The top of the benchtop bioreactor is equipped for aerators, gas flow 
ports, and instrumentation (while ensuring that no leaks to the 
atmosphere exist around the fittings).
    2.1.2  Aeration gas. Aeration gas is added to the benchtop 
bioreactor through three diffusers, which are glass tubes that extend to 
the bottom fifth of the reactor depth. A pure oxygen pressurized 
cylinder is recommended in order to maintain the specified oxygen 
concentration. Install a blower (e.g., Diaphragm Type, 15 SCFH capacity) 
to blow the aeration gas into the benchtop bioreactor diffusers. Measure 
the aeration gas flow rate with a rotameter (e.g., 0-15 SCFH 
recommended). The aeration gas will rise through the benchtop 
bioreactor, dissolving oxygen into the mixture in the process. The 
aeration gas must provide sufficient agitation to keep the solids in 
suspension. Provide an exit for the aeration gas from the top flange of 
the benchtop bioreactor through a water-cooled (e.g., Allihn-type) 
vertical condenser. Install the condenser through a gas-tight fitting in 
the benchtop bioreactor closure. Design the system so that at least 10 
percent of the gas flows through an alkaline scrubber containing 175 mL 
of 45 percent by weight solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and 5 
drops of 0.2 percent alizarin yellow dye. Route the balance of the gas 
through an adjustable scrubber bypass. Route all of the gas through a 1-
L knock-out flask to remove entrained moisture and then to the intake of 
the blower. The blower recirculates the gas to the benchtop bioreactor.
    2.1.3  Wastewater Feed. Supply the wastewater feed to the benchtop 
bioreactor in a collapsible low-density polyethylene container or 
collapsible liner in a container (e.g., 20 L) equipped with a spigot cap 
(collapsible containers or liners of other material may be required due 
to the permeability of some volatile compounds through polyethylene). 
Obtain the wastewater feed by sampling the wastewater feed in the target 
process. A representative sample of wastewater shall be obtained from 
the piping leading to the aeration tank. This sample may be obtained 
from existing sampling valves at the discharge of the wastewater feed 
pump, or collected from a pipe discharging to the aeration tank, or by 
pumping from a well-mixed equalization tank upstream from the aeration 
tank. Alternatively, wastewater can be pumped continuously to the 
laboratory apparatus from a bleed stream taken from the equalization 
tank of the full-scale treatment system.
    2.1.3.1  Refrigeration System. Keep the wastewater feed cool by ice 
or by refrigeration to 4 deg.C. If using a bleed stream from the 
equalization tank, refrigeration is not required if the residence time 
in the bleed stream is less than five minutes.
    2.1.3.2  Wastewater Feed Pump. The wastewater is pumped from the 
refrigerated container using a variable-speed peristaltic pump drive 
equipped with a peristaltic pump head. Add the feed solution to the 
benchtop bioreactor through a fitting on the top flange. Determine the 
rate of feed addition to provide a retention time in the benchtop 
bioreactor that is numerically equivalent to the retention time in the 
target full-scale system. The wastewater shall be fed at a rate 
sufficient to achieve 90 to 100 percent of the target full-scale system 
residence time.
    2.1.3.3  Treated wastewater feed. The benchtop bioreactor effluent 
exits at the bottom of the reactor through a tube and proceeds to the 
clarifier.
    2.1.4  Clarifier. The effluent flows to a separate closed clarifier 
that allows separation of biomass and effluent (e.g., 2-liter pear-
shaped glass separatory funnel, modified by removing the stopcock and 
adding a 25-mm OD glass tube at the bottom). Benchtop bioreactor 
effluent enters the clarifier through a tube inserted to a depth of 0.08 
m (3 in.) through a stopper at the top of the clarifier. System effluent 
flows from a tube inserted through the stopper at the top of the 
clarifier to a drain (or sample bottle when sampling). The underflow 
from the clarifier leaves from the glass tube at the bottom of the 
clarifier. Flexible tubing connects this fitting to the sludge recycle 
pump. This pump is coupled to a variable speed pump drive. The discharge 
from this pump is returned through a tube inserted in a port on the side 
of the benchtop bioreactor. An additional port is provided near the 
bottom of the benchtop bioreactor for sampling the reactor contents. The 
mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor flows into the center of the 
clarifier. The clarified system effluent separates from the biomass and 
flows through an exit near the top of the clarifier. There shall be no 
headspace in the clarifier.
    2.1.5  Temperature Control Apparatus. Capable of maintaining the 
system at a temperature equal to the temperature of the full-scale 
system. The average temperature should be maintained within 
<plus-minus>2 deg.C of the set point.
    2.1.5.1  Temperature Monitoring Device. A resistance type 
temperature probe or a thermocouple connected to a temperature readout 
with a resolution of 0.1 deg.C or better.
    2.1.5.2  Benchtop Bioreactor Heater. The heater is connected to the 
temperature control device.
    2.1.6  Oxygen Control System. Maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration at the levels present in the full-scale system. Target 
full-

[[Page 706]]

scale activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentration below 
2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration in 
the benchtop bioreactor within 0.5 mg/L of the target dissolved oxygen 
level. Target full-scale activated sludge systems with dissolved oxygen 
concentration above 2 mg/L are required to maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration in the benchtop bioreactor within 1.5 mg/L of the target 
dissolved oxygen concentration; however, for target full-scale activated 
sludge systems with dissolved oxygen concentrations above 2 mg/L, the 
dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor may not drop 
below 1.5 mg/L. If the benchtop bioreactor is outside the control range, 
the dissolved oxygen is noted and the reactor operation is adjusted.
    2.1.6.1  Dissolved Oxygen Monitor. Dissolved oxygen is monitored 
with a polarographic probe (gas permeable membrane) connected to a 
dissolved oxygen meter (e.g., 0 to 15 mg/L, 0 to 50 deg.C).
    2.1.6.2  Benchtop Bioreactor Pressure Monitor. The benchtop 
bioreactor pressure is monitored through a port in the top flange of the 
reactor. This is connected to a gauge control with a span of 13-cm water 
vacuum to 13-cm water pressure or better. A relay is activated when the 
vacuum exceeds an adjustable setpoint which opens a solenoid valve 
(normally closed), admitting oxygen to the system. The vacuum setpoint 
controlling oxygen addition to the system shall be set at approximately 
2.5 <plus-minus> 0.5 cm water and maintained at this setting except 
during brief periods when the dissolved oxygen concentration is 
adjusted.
    2.1.7  Connecting Tubing. All connecting tubing shall be Teflon or 
equivalent in impermeability. The only exception to this specification 
is the tubing directly inside the pump head of the wastewater feed pump, 
which may be Viton, Silicone or another type of flexible tubing. Note: 
Mention of trade names or products does not constitute endorsement by 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
    2.2  Analysis. If the identity of the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater is not known, a representative sample of the wastewater shall 
be analyzed in order to identify all of the compounds of interest 
present. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry screening method is 
recommended.
    2.2.1  After identifying the compounds of interest in the 
wastewater, develop and/or use one or more analytical technique capable 
of measuring each of those compounds (more than one analytical technique 
may be required, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater). 
Method 18, found in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, may be used as a 
guideline in developing the analytical technique. Purge and trap 
techniques may be used for analysis providing the target components are 
sufficiently volatile to make this technique appropriate. The limit of 
quantitation for each compound shall be determined.\1\ If the effluent 
concentration of any target compound is below the limit of quantitation 
determined for that compound, the operation of the Method 304 unit may 
be altered to attempt to increase the effluent concentration above the 
limit of quantitation. Modifications to the method shall be approved 
prior to the test. The request should be addressed to Method 304 
contact, Emissions Measurement Center, Mail Drop 19, U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
    2.2.2  Calibration Standards. Prepare calibration standards from 
pure certified standards in an aqueous medium. Prepare and analyze three 
concentrations of calibration standards for each target component (or 
for a mixture of components) in triplicate daily throughout the analyses 
of the test samples. At each concentration level, a single calibration 
shall be within 5 percent of the average of the three calibration 
results. The low and medium calibration standards shall bracket the 
expected concentration of the effluent (treated) wastewater. The medium 
and high standards shall bracket the expected influent concentration.

                               3. Reagents

    3.1  Wastewater. Obtain a representative sample of wastewater at the 
inlet to the full-scale treatment plant if there is an existing full-
scale treatment plant (See Section 2.1.3). If there is no existing full-
scale treatment plant, obtain the wastewater sample as close to the 
point of determination as possible. Collect the sample by pumping the 
wastewater into the 20-L collapsible container. The loss of volatiles 
shall be minimized from the wastewater by collapsing the container 
before filling, by minimizing the time of filling, and by avoiding a 
headspace in the container after filling. If the wastewater requires the 
addition of nutrients to support the biomass growth and maintain biomass 
characteristics, those nutrients are added and mixed with the container 
contents after the container is filled.
    3.2  Biomass. Obtain the biomass or activated sludge used for rate 
constant determination in the bench-scale process from the existing 
full-scale process or from a representative biomass culture (e.g., 
biomass that has been developed for a future full-scale process). This 
biomass is preferentially obtained from a thickened acclimated mixed 
liquor sample. Collect the sample either by bailing from the mixed 
liquor in the aeration tank with a weighted container, or by collecting 
aeration tank effluent at the effluent overflow weir. Transport the 
sample to the laboratory within no more than 4 hours of

[[Page 707]]

collection. Maintain the biomass concentration in the benchtop 
bioreactor at the level of the target full-scale system +10 percent 
throughout the sampling period of the test method.

                              4. Procedure

    Safety Note: If explosive gases are produced as a byproduct of 
biodegradation and could realistically pose a hazard, closely monitor 
headspace concentration of these gases to ensure laboratory safety. 
Placement of the benchtop bioreactor system inside a laboratory hood is 
recommended regardless of byproducts produced.
    4.1 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation. Charge the mixed liquor to the 
benchtop bioreactor, minimizing headspace over the liquid surface to 
minimize entrainment of mixed liquor in the circulating gas. Fasten the 
benchtop bioreactor headplate to the reactor over the liquid surface. 
Maintain the temperature of the contents of the benchtop bioreactor 
system at the temperature of the target full-scale system, +2  deg.C, 
throughout the testing period. Monitor and record the temperature of the 
reactor contents at least to the nearest 0.1  deg.C.
    4.1.1  Wastewater Storage. Collect the wastewater sample in the 20-L 
collapsible container. Store the container at 4  deg.C throughout the 
testing period. Connect the container to the benchtop bioreactor feed 
pump.
    4.1.2  Wastewater Flow Rate. The hydraulic residence time of the 
aeration tank is calculated as the ratio of the volume of the tank (L) 
to the flow rate (L/min). At the beginning of a test, the container 
shall be connected to the feed pump and solution shall be pumped to the 
benchtop bioreactor at the required flow rate to achieve the calculated 
hydraulic residence time of wastewater in the aeration tank.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.027

Where:
Q<INF>test</INF>=wastewater flow rate (L/min)
Q<INF>fs</INF>=average flow rate of full-scale process (L/min)
V<INF>fs</INF>=volume of full-scale aeration tank (L)

The target flow rate in the test apparatus is the same as the flow rate 
in the target full-scale process multiplied by the ratio of benchtop 
bioreactor volume (e.g., 6 L) to the volume of the full-scale aeration 
tank. The hydraulic residence time shall be maintained at 90 to 100 
percent of the residence time maintained in the target full-scale unit. 
A nominal flow rate is set on the pump based on a pump calibration. 
Changes in the elasticity of the tubing in the pump head and the 
accumulation of material in the tubing affect this calibration. The 
nominal pumping rate shall be changed as necessary based on volumetric 
flow measurements. Discharge the benchtop bioreactor effluent to a 
wastewater storage, treatment, or disposal facility, except during 
sampling or flow measurement periods.
    4.1.3 Sludge Recycle Rate. Set the sludge recycle rate at a rate 
sufficient to prevent accumulation in the bottom of the clarifier. Set 
the air circulation rate sufficient to maintain the biomass in 
suspension.
    4.1.4 Benchtop Bioreactor Operation and Maintenance. Temperature, 
dissolved oxygen concentration, flow rate, and air circulation rate 
shall be measured and recorded three times throughout each day of 
testing. If other parameters (such as pH) are measured and maintained in 
the target full-scale unit, these parameters shall, where appropriate, 
be monitored and maintained to full-scale specifications in the benchtop 
bioreactor. At the beginning of each sampling period (section 4.2), 
sample the benchtop bioreactor contents for suspended solids analysis. 
Take this sample by loosening a clamp on a length of tubing attached to 
the lower side port. Determine the suspended solids gravimetrically by 
the Gooch crucible/glass fiber filter method for total suspended solids, 
in accordance with Standard Methods<SUP>3</SUP> or equivalent. When 
necessary, sludge shall be wasted from the lower side port of the 
benchtop bioreactor, and the volume that is wasted shall be replaced 
with an equal volume of the benchtop bioreactor effluent. Add thickened 
activated sludge mixed liquor as necessary to the benchtop bioreactor to 
increase the suspended solids concentration to the desired level. Pump 
this mixed liquor to the benchtop bioreactor through the upper side port 
(Item 24 in Figure 1). Change the membrane on the dissolved oxygen probe 
before starting the test. Calibrate the oxygen probe immediately before 
the start of the test and each time the membrane is changed. The 
scrubber solution shall be replaced each weekday with 175 mL 45 percent 
W/W KOH solution to which five drops of 0.2 percent alizarin yellow 
indicator in water have been added. The potassium hydroxide solution in 
the alkaline scrubber shall be changed if the alizarin yellow dye color 
changes.
    4.1.5 Inspection and Correction Procedures. If the feed line tubing 
becomes clogged, replace with new tubing. If the feed flow rate is not 
within 5 percent of target flow any time the flow rate is measured, 
reset pump or check the flow measuring device and measure flow rate 
again until target flow rate is achieved.
    4.2 Test Sampling. At least two and one half hydraulic residence 
times after the system has reached the targeted specifications shall be 
permitted to elapse before the first sample is taken. Effluent samples 
of the clarifier discharge (Item 20 in Figure 1) and the influent 
wastewater feed are collected in 40-mL

[[Page 708]]

septum vials to which two drops of 1:10 hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water 
have been added. Sample the clarifier discharge directly from the drain 
line. These samples will be composed of the entire flow from the system 
for a period of several minutes. Feed samples shall be taken from the 
feed pump suction line after temporarily stopping the benchtop 
bioreactor feed, removing a connector, and squeezing the collapsible 
feed container. Store both influent and effluent samples at 4 deg.C 
immediately after collection and analyze within 8 hours of collection.
    4.2.1 Frequency of Sampling. During the test, sample and analyze the 
wastewater feed and the clarifier effluent at least six times. The 
sampling intervals shall be separated by at least 8 hours. During any 
individual sampling interval, sample the wastewater feed simultaneously 
with or immediately after the effluent sample. Calculate the RSD of the 
amount removed (i.e., effluent concentration--wastewater feed 
concentration). The RSD values shall be  15 percent. If an RSD value is 
> 15 percent, continue sampling and analyzing influent and effluent sets 
of samples until the RSD values are within specifications.
    4.2.2 Sampling After Exposure of System to Atmosphere. If, after 
starting sampling procedures, the benchtop bioreactor system is exposed 
to the atmosphere (due to leaks, maintenance, etc.), allow at least one 
hydraulic residence time to elapse before resuming sampling.

                  5. Operational Checks and Calibration

    5.1 Dissolved Oxygen. Fluctuation in dissolved oxygen concentration 
may occur for numerous reasons, including undetected gas leaks, 
increases and decreases in mixed liquor suspended solids resulting from 
cell growth and solids loss in the effluent stream, changes in diffuser 
performance, cycling of effluent flow rate, and overcorrection due to 
faulty or sluggish dissolved oxygen probe response. Control the 
dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor by changing 
the proportion of oxygen in the circulating aeration gas. Should the 
dissolved oxygen concentration drift below the designated experimental 
condition, bleed a small amount of aeration gas from the system on the 
pressure side (i.e., immediately upstream of one of the diffusers). This 
will create a vacuum in the system, triggering the pressure sensitive 
relay to open the solenoid valve and admit oxygen to the system. Should 
the dissolved oxygen concentration drift above the designated 
experimental condition, slow or stop the oxygen input to the system 
until the dissolved oxygen concentration approaches the correct level.
    5.2  Sludge Wasting. Determine the suspended solids concentration 
(section 4.1.4) at the beginning of a test, and once per day thereafter 
during the test. If the test is completed within a two day period, 
determine the suspended solids concentration after the final sample set 
is taken. If the suspended solids concentration exceeds the specified 
concentration, remove a fraction of the sludge from the benchtop 
bioreactor. The required volume of mixed liquor to remove is determined 
as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.028

Where:
V<INF>w</INF> is the wasted volume (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and
S<INF>s</INF> is the specified solids (g/L).

    Remove the mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor by loosening a 
clamp on the mixed liquor sampling tube and allowing the required volume 
to drain to a graduated flask. Clamp the tube when the correct volume 
has been wasted. Replace the volume of the liquid wasted by pouring the 
same volume of effluent back into the benchtop bioreactor. Dispose of 
the waste sludge properly.
    5.3  Sludge Makeup. In the event that the suspended solids 
concentration is lower than the specifications, add makeup sludge back 
into the benchtop bioreactor. Determine the amount of sludge added by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.029

Where:
V<INF>w</INF> is the volume of sludge to add (Liters),
V<INF>r</INF> is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),
S<INF>w</INF> is the solids in the makeup sludge (g/L),
S<INF>m</INF> is the measured solids (g/L), and
S<INF>s</INF> is the specified solids (g/L).

    5.4  Wastewater Pump Calibration. Determine the wastewater flow rate 
by collecting the system effluent for a time period of at least one 
hour, and measuring the volume with a graduated cylinder. Record the 
collection time period and volume collected. Determine flow rate. Adjust 
the pump speed to deliver the specified flow rate.

  Method 305: Measurement of Emission Potential of Individual Volatile 
                       Organic Compounds in Waste

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    This procedure is used to determine the emission potential of 
individual volatile organics (VOs) in waste. The heated purge conditions 
established by Method 25D (40 CFR part 60, Appendix A) are used to 
remove VOs from a 10-g sample of waste suspended in a 50/50 solution of 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) and water. The purged VOs are quantified by 
using the sample collection and analytical techniques appropriate for 
the VOs present in the waste. The recovery efficiency of the sample 
collection and analytical technique is determined for each waste matrix. 
A correction factor is determined for each compound (if acceptable 
recovery criteria requirements are met of 70 to 130 percent recovery for 
every target compound), and the measured waste concentration is 
corrected with the correction factor for each compound. A minimum of 
three replicate waste samples shall be analyzed.

                       2. Apparatus and Materials

    2.1  Method 25D Purge Apparatus.

[[Page 710]]

    2.1.1  Purge Chamber. The purge chamber shall accommodate the 10-g 
sample of waste suspended in a matrix of 50 mL of PEG and 50 mL of 
deionized, hydrocarbon-free water. Three fittings are used on the glass 
chamber top. Two #7 Ace-threads are used for the purge gas inlet and 
outlet connections. A #50 Ace-thread is used to connect the top of the 
chamber to the base (see Figure 1). The base of the chamber has a side-
arm equipped with a #22 Sovirel fitting to allow for easy sample 
introductions into the chamber. The dimensions of the chamber are shown 
in Figure 1.
    2.1.2  Flow Distribution Device (FDD). The FDD enhances the gas-to-
liquid contact for improved purging efficiency. The FDD is a 6 mm OD by 
30 cm long glass tube equipped with four arm bubblers as shown in Figure 
1. Each arm shall have an opening of 1 mm in diameter.
    2.1.3  Coalescing Filter. The coalescing filter serves to discourage 
aerosol formation of sample gas once it leaves the purge chamber. The 
glass filter has a fritted disc mounted 10 cm from the bottom. Two #7 
Ace-threads are used for the inlet and outlet connections. The 
dimensions of the chamber are shown in Figure 2.
    2.1.4  Oven. A forced convection airflow oven capable of maintaining 
the purge chamber and coalescing filter at 75<plus-minus>2 deg.C.
    2.1.5  Toggle Valve. An on/off valve constructed from brass or 
stainless steel rated to 100 psig. This valve is placed in line between 
the purge nitrogen source and the flow controller.

    2.1.6  Flow Controller. High-quality stainless steel flow controller 
capable of restricting a flow of nitrogen to 6<plus-minus>0.06 L/min at 
40 psig.
    2.1.7  Polyethylene Glycol Cleaning System.
    2.1.7.1  Round-Bottom Flask. One liter, three-neck glass round-
bottom flask for cleaning PEG. Standard taper 24/40 joints are mounted 
on each neck.

    2.1.7.4  Thermometer. Partial immersion glass thermometer.
    2.1.7.5  Hose Adapter. Glass with 24/40 standard tapered joint.
    2.1.8  Reagents.
    2.1.8.1  Polyethylene Glycol. Ninety-eight percent pure organic 
polymer with an average molecular weight of 400. Volatile organics are 
removed from the PEG prior to use by heating to 120<plus-minus>5 deg.C 
and purging with pure nitrogen at 1 L/min for 2 hours. The PEG is stored 
at room temperature under a nitrogen purge maintained at 1 L/min until 
used. A typical apparatus used to clean the PEG is shown in Figure 3.
    2.1.8.2  Water. Organic-free deionized water is required.

[[Page 713]]

    2.1.8.3  Nitrogen. High-purity nitrogen (less than 0.5 ppm total 
hydrocarbons) is used to remove test compounds from the purge matrix. 
The source of nitrogen shall be regulated continuously to 40 psig before 
the on/off toggle valve.
    2.2  Volatile Organic Recovery System.
    2.2.1  Splitter Valve (Optional). Stainless steel cross-pattern 
valve capable of splitting nominal flow rates from the purge flow of 6 
L/min. The valve shall be maintained at 75<plus-minus>2 deg.C in the 
heated zone and shall be placed downstream of the coalescing filter. It 
is recommended that 0.125 in. OD tubing be used to direct the split vent 
flow from the heated zone. The back pressure caused by the 0.125 in. OD 
tubing is critical for maintaining proper split valve operation. Note: 
The splitter valve design is optional; it may be used in cases where the 
concentration of a pollutant would saturate the adsorbents.
    2.2.2  Injection Port. Stainless steel 1/4 in. OD compression 
fitting tee with a 6-mm septum fixed on the top port. The injection port 
is the point of entry for the recovery study solution. If using a 
gaseous standard to determine recovery efficiency, connect the gaseous 
standard to the injection port of the tee.
    2.2.3  Knockout Trap (Optional but Recommended). A 25-mL capacity 
glass reservoir body with a full-stem impinger (to avoid leaks, a 
modified midget glass impinger with a screw cap and ball/socket clamps 
on the inlet and outlet is recommended). The empty impinger is placed in 
an ice water bath between the injection port and the sorbent cartridge. 
Its purpose is to reduce the water content of the purge gas (saturated 
at 75 deg.C) before the sorbent cartridge.

[[Page 714]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.068

    2.2.4  Insulated Ice Bath. A 350-mL dewar or other type of insulated 
bath is used to maintain ice water around the knockout trap.
    2.2.5  Sorbent Cartridges. Commercially available glass or stainless 
steel cartridge packed with one or more appropriate sorbents. The amount 
of adsorbent packed in the cartridge depends on the breakthrough volume 
of the test compounds but is limited by back pressure caused by the 
packing (not to exceed 7 psig). More than one sorbent cartridge placed 
in series may be necessary depending upon the mixture of the measured 
components.
    2.2.6  Volumetric Glassware. Type A glass 10-mL volumetric flasks 
for measuring a final volume from the water catch in the knockout trap.
    2.2.7  Thermal Desorption Unit. A clam-shell type oven, used for the 
desorption of direct thermal desorption sorbent tubes. The oven shall be 
capable of increasing the temperature of the desorption tubes rapidly to 
recommended desorption temperature.
    2.2.8  Ultrasonic Bath. Small bath used to agitate sorbent material 
and desorption solvent. Ice water shall be used in the bath because of 
heat transfer caused by operation of the bath.
    2.2.9  Desorption Vials. Four-dram (15-mL) capacity borosilicate 
glass vials with Teflon-lined caps.
    2.2.10 Reagents.

[[Page 715]]

    2.2.10.1  Water. Same as specified in Section 2.1.8.2.
    2.2.10.2  Desorption Solvent (when used). Appropriate high-purity 
(99.99 percent) solvent for desorption shall be used. Analysis shall be 
performed (utilizing the same analytical technique as that used in the 
analysis of the waste samples) on each lot to determine purity.
    2.3  Analytical System. A gas chromatograph (GC) is commonly used to 
separate and quantify compounds from the sample collection and recovery 
procedure. Method 18 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) may be used as a 
guideline for determining the appropriate GC column and GC detector 
based on the test compounds to be determined. Other types of analytical 
instrumentation may be used (i.e., HPLC) in lieu of GC systems as long 
as the recovery efficiency criteria of this method are met.
    2.3.1  Gas Chromatograph. The GC shall be equipped with a constant-
temperature liquid injection port or a heated sampling loop/valve 
system, as appropriate. The GC oven shall be temperature-programmable 
over the useful range of the GC column. The choice of detectors is based 
on the test compounds to be determined.
    2.3.2  GC Column. Select the appropriate GC column based on (1) 
literature review or previous experience, (2) polarity of the analytes, 
(3) capacity of the column, or (4) resolving power (i.e., length, 
diameter, film thickness) required.
    2.3.3  Data System. A programmable electronic integrator for 
recording, analyzing, and storing the signal generated by the detector.
    2.3.4  Reagents. The gases required for GC operation shall be of the 
highest obtainable purity (hydrocarbon free). Consult the operating 
manual for recommended settings.

                              3. Procedure

    Assemble the glassware and associated fittings (see Figures 4 or 5, 
as appropriate) and leak-check the system (approximately 7 psig is the 
target pressure). After an initial leak check, mark the pressure gauge 
and use the initial checkpoint to monitor for leaks throughout 
subsequent analyses. If the pressure in the system drops below the 
target pressure at any time during analysis, that analysis shall be 
considered invalid.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.069

    3.1  Recovery Efficiency Determination. Determine the individual 
recovery efficiency (RE) for each of the target compounds in duplicate 
before the waste samples are analyzed. To determine the RE, generate a 
water blank (Section 3.2.4) and use the injection port to introduce a 
known volume of spike solution (or certified gaseous standard)

[[Page 716]]

containing all of the target compounds at the levels expected in the 
waste sample. Introduce the spike solution immediately after the 
nitrogen purge has been started (Section 3.2.2). Follow the procedures 
outlined in Section 3.2.3. Analyze the recovery efficiency samples using 
the techniques described in Section 3.3.  Determine the recovery 
efficiency (Equation 1, Section 4.2) by comparing the amount of compound 
recovered to the theoretical amount spiked. Determine the RE twice for 
each compound; the RSD shall be <ls-thn-eq> 10 percent for each 
compound. If the RSD for any compound is not <ls-thn-eq> 10 percent, 
modify the sampling/analytical procedure and complete an RE study in 
duplicate, or continue determining RE until the RSD meets the acceptable 
criteria. The average RE shall be 0.70<ls-thn-eq>RE<ls-thn-eq>1.30 for 
each compound. If the average RE does not meet these criteria, an 
alternative sample collection and/or analysis technique shall be 
developed and the recovery efficiency determination shall be repeated 
for that compound until the criteria are met for every target compound. 
Example modifications of the sampling/analytical system include changing 
the adsorbent material, changing the desorption solvent, utilizing 
direct thermal desorption of test compounds from the sorbent tubes, 
utilizing another analytical technique.
    3.2  Sample Collection and Recovery.
    3.2.1  The sample collection procedure in Method 25D shall be used 
to collect (into a preweighed vial) 10 g of waste into PEG, cool, and 
ship to the laboratory. Remove the sample container from the cooler and 
wipe the exterior to remove any ice or water. Weigh the container and 
sample to the nearest 0.01 g and record the weight. Pour the sample from 
the container into the purge flask. Rinse the sample container three 
times with approximately 6 mL of PEG (or the volume needed to total 50 
mL of PEG in the purge flask), transferring the rinses to the purge 
flask. Add 50 mL of organic-free deionized water to the purge flask. Cap 
the purge flask tightly in between each rinse and after adding all the 
components into the flask.
    3.2.2  Allow the oven to equilibrate to 75<plus-minus>  deg.C. Begin 
the sample recovery process by turning the toggle valve on, thus 
allowing a 6-L/min flow of pure nitrogen through the purge chamber.
    3.2.3  Stop the purge after 30 min. Immediately remove the sorbent 
tube(s) from the apparatus and cap both ends. Remove the knockout trap 
and transfer the water catch to a 10-mL volumetric flask. Rinse the trap 
with organic-free deionized water and transfer the rinse to the 
volumetric flask. Dilute to the 10-mL mark with water. Transfer the 
water sample to a sample vial and store at 4 deg.C with zero headspace. 
The analysis of the contents of the water knockout trap is optional for 
this method. If the target compounds are water soluble, analysis of the 
water is recommended; meeting the recovery efficiency criteria in these 
cases would be difficult without adding the amount captured in the 
knockout trap.
    3.2.4  Water Blank. A water blank shall be analyzed daily to 
determine the cleanliness of the purge and recovery system. A water 
blank is generated by adding 60 mL of organic-free deionized water to 50 
mL of PEG in the purge chamber. Treat the blank as described in Section 
3.2.2 and 3.2.3. The purpose of the water blank is to insure that no 
contaminants exist in the sampling and analytical apparatus which would 
interfere with the quantitation of the target compounds. If contaminants 
are present, locate the source of contamination, remove it, and repeat 
the water blank analysis.
    3.3  Sample Analysis. Sample analysis in the context of this method 
refers to techniques to remove the target compounds from the sorbent 
tubes, separate them using a chromatography technique, and quantify them 
with an appropriate detector. Two types of sample extraction techniques 
typically used for sorbents include solvent desorption or direct thermal 
desorption of test compounds to a secondary focusing unit (either 
sorbent or cryogen based). The test compounds are then typically 
transferred to a GC system for analysis. Other analytical systems may be 
used (i.e., HPLC) in lieu of GC systems as long as the recovery 
efficiency criteria of this method are met.
    3.3.1  Recover the test compounds from the sorbent tubes that 
require solvent desorption by transferring the adsorbent material to a 
sample vial containing the desorption solvent. The desorption solvent 
shall be the same as the solvent used to prepare calibration standards. 
The volume of solvent depends on the amount of adsorbed material to be 
desorbed (1.0 mL per 100 mg of adsorbent material) and also on the 
amount of test compounds present. Final volume adjustment and or 
dilution can be made so that the concentration of test compounds in the 
desorption solvent is bracketed by the concentration of the calibration 
solutions. Ultrasonicate the desorption solvent for 15 min in an ice 
bath. Allow the sample to sit for a period of time so that the adsorbent 
material can settle to the bottom of the vial. Transfer the solvent with 
a pasteur pipet (minimizing the amount of adsorbent material taken) to 
another vial and store at 4  deg.C.
    3.3.2  The analytical instrument shall be calibrated with a minimum 
of three levels of standards for each compound whose concentrations 
bracket the concentration of test compounds from the sorbent tubes. 
Liquid calibration standards shall be used for calibration in the 
analysis of the solvent extracts. The liquid calibration standards shall 
be prepared in the desorption solvent matrix. The calibration standards 
may be prepared

[[Page 717]]

and injected individually or as a mixture. If thermal desorption and 
focusing (onto another sorbent or cryogen focusing) are used, a 
certified gaseous mixture or a series of gaseous standards shall be used 
for calibration of the instrument. The gaseous standards shall be 
focused and analyzed in the same manner as the samples.
    3.3.3  The analytical system shall be certified free from 
contaminants before a calibration is performed (see Section 3.2.4). The 
calibration standards are used to determine the linearity of the 
analytical system. Perform an initial calibration and linearity check by 
analyzing the three calibration standards for each target compound in 
triplicate starting with the lowest level and continuing to the highest 
level. If the triplicate analyses do not agree within 5 percent of their 
average, additional analyses will be needed until the 5 percent criteria 
is met. Calculate the response factor (Equation 3, Section 4.4) from the 
average area counts of the injections for each concentration level. 
Average the response factors of the standards for each compound. The 
linearity of the detector is acceptable if the response factor of each 
compound at a particular concentration is within 10 percent of the 
overall mean response factor for that compound. Analyze daily a mid-
level calibration standard in duplicate and calculate a new response 
factor. Compare the daily response factor average to the average 
response factor calculated for the mid-level calibration during the 
initial linearity check; repeat the three-level calibration procedure if 
the daily average response factor differs from the initial linearity 
check mid-level response factor by more than 10 percent. Otherwise, 
proceed with the sample analysis.
    3.3.4  Analyze the desorption solvent or direct thermal desorption 
tubes from each sample using the same analytical parameters used for the 
calibration standard. Calculate the total weight detected for each 
compound (Equation 4, Section 4.5). The slope (area/amount) and y-
intercept are calculated from the line bracketed between the two closest 
calibration points. Correct the concentration of each waste sample with 
the appropriate recovery efficiency factor and the split flow ratio (if 
used). The final concentration of each individual test compound is 
calculated by dividing the corrected measured weight for that compound 
by the weight of the original sample determined in Section 3.2.1 
(Equation 5, Section 4.6).
    3.4  Repeat the sample collection, recovery, and analysis twice 
more, for a total of three samples. Report the corrected concentration 
of each of the waste samples, average waste concentration, and relative 
standard deviation (Equation 6, Section 4.7).

Method 306--Determination of Chromium Emissions From Decorative and Hard 
            Chromium Electroplating and Anodizing Operations

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1 Applicability. This method applies to the determination of 
chromium (Cr) in emissions from decorative and hard chrome 
electroplating facilities and anodizing operations.
    1.2 Principle. (a) A sample is extracted isokinetically from the 
source using an unheated Method 5 sampling train (40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A), with a glass nozzle and probe liner, but with the filter 
omitted. The sample time has to be at least 2 hours. The Cr emissions 
are collected in an alkaline solution: 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or 
0.1 N sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<INF>3</INF>). The collected samples 
remain in the alkaline solution until analysis. Samples with high Cr 
concentrations may be analyzed using inductively coupled plasma emission 
spectrometry (ICP) at 267.72 nm. Alternatively, if improved detection 
limits are required, a portion of the alkaline impinger solution is 
digested with nitric acid and analyzed by graphite furnace atomic 
absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) at 357.9 nm.
    (b) If it is desirable to determine hexavalent chromium 
(Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>) emissions, the samples may be analyzed using an ion 
chromatograph equipped with a post-column reactor (IC/PCR) and a visible 
wavelength detector. To increase sensitivity for trace levels of 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>, a preconcentration system can be used in conjunction 
with the IC/PCR.

           2. Range, Sensitivity, Precision, and Interferences

    2.1  Range. The recommended analytical range for each of the three 
analytical techniques is given below. The upper limit of all three 
techniques can be extended indefinitely by appropriate dilution.
    2.1.1  GFAAS Range. As reported in Method 7191 of SW-846 (Citation 5 
in Bibliography), the optimum concentration range for GFAAS is 5 to 100 
<greek-m>g Cr/l of concentrated analyte.
    2.1.2  ICP Range. A linear response curve for ICP can be obtained in 
the range of 10 to at least 500 <greek-m>g Cr/l of absorbing solution.
    2.1.3  IC/PCR Range. In 40 CFR part 266, appendix IX, the lower 
limit of the detection range for IC/PCR when employing a 
preconcentration procedure is reported to be about 0.1 <greek-m>g 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/l of absorbing solution.
    2.2  Sensitivity.
    2.2.1  Analytical Sensitivity.
    2.2.1.1  ICP Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum detection limit for 
ICP, as reported in Method 6010A of SW-846, is 7 <greek-m>g Cr/l.
    2.2.1.2  GFAAS Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum detection limit 
for GFAAS, as reported in Method 7191 of SW-846, is 1 <greek-m>g Cr/l.
    2.2.1.3  IC/PCR Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum detection limit 
for IC/PCR with a preconcentrator, as reported in 40 CFR part 266, 
appendix IX is 0.05 <greek-m>g Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/l.
    2.2.2  In-stack Sensitivity. The in-stack sensitivity depends upon 
the analytical detection limit, the volume of stack gas sampled, and the 
total volume of the impinger absorbing solution plus the rinses. Using 
the analytical detection limits given in sections 2.2.1.1, 2.2.1.2, and 
2.2.1.3; a stack gas sample volume of 1.7 dscm; and a total liquid 
sample volume of 500 ml; the corresponding in-stack detection limits are 
0.0021 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.00015 mg Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000015 mg 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/dscm for IC/PCR with preconcentration. However, it is 
recommended that the concentration of Cr in the analytical solutions be 
at least five times the analytical detection limit to optimize 
sensitivity in the analyses. Using this guideline and the same 
assumptions for impinger sample volume and stack gas sample volume (500 
ml and 1.7 dscm, respectively), the recommended minimum stack 
concentrations for optimum sensitivity are 0.0103 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 
0.00074 mg Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000074 mg Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/dscm for 
IC/

[[Page 719]]

PCR with preconcentration. If required, the in-stack detection limits 
can be improved by either increasing the stack gas sample volume, 
reducing the volume of the digested sample for GFAAS, improving the 
analytical detection limits, or any combination of the three.
    2.3  Precision. The following precision data have been reported for 
the three analytical methods. In the case of the GFAAS there is also 
bias data. In all cases, when sampling precision is combined with 
analytical precision, the resulting overall precision may be lower.
    2.3.1  GFAAS Precision. As reported in Method 7191 of SW-846, in a 
single laboratory (EMSL), using Cincinnati, Ohio tap water spiked at 
concentrations of 19, 48, and 77 <greek-m>g Cr/l, the standard 
deviations were <plus-minus>0.1, <plus-minus>0.2, and <plus-minus>0.8, 
respectively. Recoveries at these levels were 97 percent, 101 percent, 
and 102 percent, respectively.
    2.3.2  ICP Precision. As reported in Method 6010A of SW-846, in an 
EPA round-robin Phase 1 study, seven laboratories applied the ICP 
technique to acid/distilled water matrices that had been spiked with 
various metal concentrates. For true values of 10, 50, and 150 
<greek-m>g Cr/l; the mean reported values were 10, 50, and 149 
<greek-m>g Cr/l; and the mean percent relative standard deviations were 
18, 3.3, and 3.8 percent, respectively.
    2.3.3  IC/PCR Precision. As reported in 40 CFR part 266, appendix 
IX, the precision of the IC/PCR with sample preconcentration is 5 to 10 
percent; the overall precision for sewage sludge incinerators emitting 
120 ng/dscm of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> and 3.5 <greek-m>g/dscm of total Cr is 25 
percent and 9 percent for Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> and total Cr, respectively; 
and for hazardous waste incinerators emitting 300 ng/dscm of 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> the precision is 20 percent.
    2.4  Interferences.
    2.4.1  GFAAS Interferences. Low concentrations of calcium and/or 
phosphate may cause interferences; at concentrations above 200 
<greek-m>g/l, calcium's effect is constant and eliminates the effect of 
phosphate. Calcium nitrate is therefore added to the concentrated 
analyte to ensure a known constant effect. Other matrix modifiers 
recommended by the instrument manufacturer may also be suitable. 
Nitrogen should not be used as the purge gas due to cyanide band 
interference. Background correction may be required because of possible 
significant levels of nonspecific absorption and scattering at the 357.9 
nm analytical wavelength. Zeeman or Smith-Hieftje background correction 
is recommended to correct for interferences due to high levels of 
dissolved solids in the alkaline impinger solutions.
    2.4.2  ICP Interferences.
    2.4.2.1  ICP Spectral Interferences. (a) Spectral interferences are 
caused by:
    (1) Overlap of a spectral line from another element;
    (2) Unresolved overlap of molecular band spectra;
    (3) Background contribution from continuous or recombination 
phenomena; and
    (4) Stray light from the line emission of high-concentration 
elements.
    (b) Spectral overlap may be compensated for by computer correcting 
the raw data after monitoring and measuring the interfering element. At 
the 267.72-nm Cr analytical wavelength, iron, manganese, and uranium are 
potential interfering elements. Background and stray light interferences 
can usually be compensated for by a background correction adjacent to 
the analytical line. Unresolved overlap requires the selection of an 
alternative Cr wavelength. Consult the instrument manufacturer's 
operation manual for interference correction procedures.
    2.4.2.2  ICP Physical Interferences. High levels of dissolved solids 
in the samples may cause significant inaccuracies due to salt buildup at 
the nebulizer and torch tips. This problem can be controlled by diluting 
the sample or providing for extended rinse times between sample 
analyses. Standards are prepared in the same matrix as the samples 
(i.e., 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF>).
    2.4.2.3  ICP Chemical Interferences. These include molecular 
compound formation, ionization effects and solute vaporization effects, 
and are usually not significant in ICP, especially if the standards and 
samples are matrix matched.
    2.4.3  IC/PCR Interferences. Components in the sample matrix may 
cause Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> to convert to trivalent chromium (Cr<SUP>+3</SUP>) 
or cause Cr<SUP>+3</SUP> to convert to Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>. The 
chromatographic separation of Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> using ion chromatography 
reduces the potential for other metals to interfere with the post-column 
reaction. For the IC/PCR analysis, only compounds that coelute with 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> and affect the diphenylcarbazide reaction will cause 
interference. Periodic analyses of reagent water blanks are used to 
demonstrate that the analytical system is essentially free of 
contamination. Sample cross-contamination that can occur when high-level 
and low-level samples or standards are analyzed alternately is 
eliminated by thorough purging of the sample loop. Purging can easily be 
achieved by increasing the injection volume of the samples to ten times 
the size of the sample loop.

                              3. Apparatus

    3.1  Sampling Train. A schematic of the sampling train used in this 
method is shown in Figure 306-1. The train is the same as Method 5, 
section 2.1 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A), except that the filter is 
omitted, and quartz or borosilicate glass must be used for the probe 
nozzle and liner in place of stainless steel. It is not necessary to 
heat the probe liner. Probe fittings of plastic such as

[[Page 720]]

Teflon, polypropylene, etc. are recommended over metal fittings to 
prevent contamination. If desired, a single combined probe nozzle and 
liner may be used, but such a single glass piece is not a requirement of 
this methodology. Use 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> in the 
impingers in place of water.
    3.2  Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, section 2.2 (40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A), with the following exceptions:

necessary for sample recovery. If a probe brush is used, it must be 
nonmetallic.

NaHCO<INF>3</INF>, whichever was used as the impinger absorbing 
solution, in place of acetone to recover the sample.
    3.2.3  Sample Storage Containers. Polyethylene, with leak-free screw 
cap, 500 ml or 1,000 ml.
    3.2.4  Filtration Apparatus for IC/PCR. Teflon, or equivalent, 
filter holder and 0.45 <greek-m>m acetate, or equivalent, filter.

sample injection valve, post-column reagent delivery and mixing system, 
and a visible detector, capable of operating at 520 nm, all with a 
nonmetallic (or inert) flow path. An electronic peak area mode is 
recommended, but other recording devices and integration techniques are 
acceptable provided the repeatability criteria and the linearity 
criteria for the calibration curve described in section 6.4.1 can be 
satisfied. A sample loading system will be required if preconcentration 
is employed.
    3.3.4.2  Analytical Column. A high performance ion chromatograph 
(HPIC) nonmetallic column with anion separation characteristics and a 
high loading capacity designed for separation of metal chelating 
compounds to prevent metal interference. Resolution described in section 
5.5 must be obtained. A nonmetallic guard column with the same ion-
exchange material is recommended.
    3.3.4.3  Preconcentration Column. An HPIC nonmetallic column with 
acceptable anion retention characteristics and sample loading rates as 
described in section 5.5.

sulfate ((NH<INF>4</INF>)<INF>2</INF> SO<INF>4</INF>) to 500 ml of 
reagent water. Dilute to 1 l with reagent water and mix well. Other 
combinations of eluents and/or columns may be employed provided peak 
resolution, as described in section 5.5, repeatability and linearity, as 
described in section 6.4.1, and analytical sensitivity are acceptable.
    4.3.6  Post-Column Reagent, for IC/PCR. An effective post-column 
reagent for use with the chromatographic eluent described in section

was used as the impinger absorbing solution, to achieve a matrix similar 
to the actual field samples. Suggested levels are 0, 25, 50, and 100

                              5. Procedure

    5.1  Sampling. (a) Same as Method 5, section 4.1 (40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A), except omit the filter and filter holder from the sampling 
train, use a glass nozzle and probe liner, do not heat the probe, place 
100 ml of 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> in each of the first two 
impingers, and record the data for each run on a data sheet such as the 
one shown in Figure 306-2.
    (b) Clean all glassware prior to sampling in hot soapy water 
designed for laboratory cleaning of glassware. Next, rinse the glassware 
three times with tap water, followed by three additional rinses with 
reagent water. Then soak all glassware in 10 percent (v/v) 
HNO<INF>3</INF> solution for a minimum of 4 hours, rinse three times 
with reagent water, and allowed to air dry. Cover all glassware openings 
where contamination can occur with Parafilm, or equivalent, until the 
sampling train is assembled for sampling.
    (c) If the sample is going to be analyzed for Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> using 
IC/PCR, determine the pH of the solution in the first impinger at the 
end of the sampling run using a pH indicator strip. The pH of the 
solution should be greater than 8.5. If not, the concentration of the 
NaOH or NaHCO<INF>3</INF> impinger absorbing solution should be 
increased to 0.5 N and the sample should be rerun.

[[Page 723]]

    5.2  Sample Recovery. Follow the basic procedures of Method 5, 
section 4.2, with the exceptions noted below; a filter is not recovered 
from this train.
    5.2.1  Container No. 1. Measure the volume of the liquid in the 
first, second, and third impingers and quantitatively transfer into a 
labelled sample container. Use approximately 200 to 300 ml of 0.1 N NaOH 
or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> to rinse the probe nozzle, probe liner, three 
impingers, and connecting glassware; add this rinse to the same 
container.
    5.2.2  Container No. 2 (Reagent Blank). Place approximately 500 ml 
of 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> absorbing solution in a labeled 
sample container.
    5.2.3  Sample Filtration for IC/PCR. If the sample is to be analyzed 
for Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> by IC/PCR, it must be filtered immediately following 
recovery to remove any insoluble matter. Nitrogen gas may be used as a 
pressure assist to the filtration process. Filter the entire contents of 
Container No. 1 through a 0.45-<greek-m>m acetate filter (or 
equivalent), and collect the filtrate in a 1,000 ml graduated cylinder. 
Rinse the sample container with reagent water three separate times, pass 
these rinses through the filter, and add the rinses to the sample 
filtrate. Determine the final volume of the filtrate and rinses and 
return them to the rinsed polyethylene sample container.
    5.2.4  Sample Preservation. Refrigerate samples upon receipt. 
(Containers Nos. 1 and 2).
    5.3  Sample Preparation and Analysis for GFAAS. For analysis by 
GFAAS, an acid digestion of the alkaline impinger solution is required. 
Two types of blanks are required for the analysis. The calibration blank 
is used in establishing the analytical curve, and the reagent blank is 
used to assess possible contamination resulting from the sample 
processing. The 1.0 percent HNO<INF>3</INF> is the calibration blank. 
The 0.1 N NaOH solution or the 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> from section 
5.2.2 is the reagent blank. The reagent blank must be carried through 
the complete analytical procedure, including the acid digestion, and 
must contain the same acid concentration in the final solution as the 
sample solutions.
    5.3.1  Acid Digestion for GFAAS. (a) In a beaker, add 10 ml of 
concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> to a sample aliquot of 100 ml taken for 
analysis. Cover the beaker with a watch glass. Place the beaker on a hot 
plate and reflux the sample down to near dryness. Add another 5 ml of 
concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> to complete the digestion. Carefully reflux 
the sample volume down to near dryness. Wash down the beaker walls and 
watch glass with reagent water. The final concentration of 
HNO<INF>3</INF> in the solution should be 1 percent (v/v). Transfer the 
digested sample to a 50 ml volumetric flask. Add 0.5 ml of concentrated 
HNO<INF>3</INF>, and 1 ml of the 10 <greek-m>g/ml of Ca 
(NO<INF>3</INF>)<INF>2</INF>.
    (b) Dilute to 50 ml with reagent water. A different final volume may 
be used, based on the expected Cr concentration, but the HNO<INF>3</INF> 
concentration must be maintained at 1 percent (v/v).

[[Page 724]]

    5.3.2 Sample Analysis by GFAAS. (a) The 357.9-nm wavelength line 
shall be used. Follow the manufacturer's operating instructions for all 
other spectrophotometer parameters.

[[Page 725]]

    (b) Furnace parameters suggested by the manufacturer should be 
employed as guidelines. Since temperature-sensing mechanisms and 
temperature controllers can vary between instruments and/or with time, 
the validity of the furnace parameters must be periodically confirmed by 
systematically altering the furnace parameters while analyzing a 
standard. In this manner, losses of analyte due to higher-than-necessary 
temperature settings or losses in sensitivity due to less than optimum 
settings can be minimized. Similar verification of furnace parameters 
may be required for complex sample matrices. Calibrate the GFAAS system 
following the procedures specified in section 6.
    (c) Inject a measured aliquot of digested sample into the furnace 
and atomize. If the concentration found exceeds the calibration range, 
the sample should be diluted with the calibration blank solution (1.0 
percent HNO<INF>3</INF>) and reanalyzed. Consult the operator's manual 
for suggested injection volumes. The use of multiple injections can 
improve accuracy and help detect furnace pipetting errors.
    (d) Analyze a minimum of one matrix-matched reagent blank per sample 
batch to determine if contamination or any memory effects are occurring. 
Analyze a calibration blank and a midpoint calibration check standard 
after approximately every 10 sample injections.
    (e) Calculate the Cr concentrations:
    (1) By the method of standard additions (see operator's manual),
    (2) From the calibration curve, or
    (3) Directly from the instrument's concentration readout. All 
dilution or concentration factors must be taken into account. All 
results should be reported in <greek-m>g Cr/ml with up to three 
significant figures.
    5.4  Sample Analysis by ICP. (a) The ICP measurement is performed 
directly on the alkaline impinger solution; acid digestion is not 
necessary provided the samples and standards are matrix matched. 
However, ICP should only be used when the solution analyzed has a Cr 
concentration greater than 35 <greek-m>g/l.
    (b) Two types of blanks are required for the analysis. The 
calibration blank is used in establishing the analytical curve, and the 
reagent blank is used to assess possible contamination resulting from 
sample processing. Use either 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF>, 
whichever was used for the impinger absorbing solution, for the 
calibration blank. The calibration blank can be prepared fresh in the 
laboratory; it does not have to be from the same batch of solution that 
was used in the field. Prepare a sufficient quantity to flush the system 
between standards and samples. The reagent blank (section 5.2.2) is a 
sample of the impinger solution used for sample collection that is 
collected in the field during the testing program.
    (c) Set up the instrument with proper operating parameters including 
wavelength, background correction settings (if necessary), and 
interfering element correction settings (if necessary). The instrument 
must be allowed to become thermally stable before beginning performance 
of measurements (usually requiring at least 30 min of operation prior to 
calibration). During this warmup period, the optical calibration and 
torch position optimization may be performed (consult the operator's 
manual).
    (d) Calibrate the instrument according to the instrument 
manufacturer's recommended procedures, and the procedures specified in 
section 6.3. Before analyzing the samples, reanalyze the highest 
calibration standard as if it were a sample. Concentration values 
obtained should not deviate from the actual values by more than 5 
percent, or the established control limits, whichever is lower (see 
sections 6 and 7). If they do, follow the recommendations of the 
instrument manufacturer to correct for this condition.
    (e) Flush the system with the calibration blank solution for at 
least 1 min before the analysis of each sample or standard. Analyze the 
midpoint calibration standard and the calibration blank after each 10 
samples. Use the average intensity of multiple exposures for both 
standardization and sample analysis to reduce random error.
    (f) Dilute and reanalyze samples that are more concentrated than the 
linear calibration limit or use an alternate, less sensitive Cr 
wavelength for which quality control data are already established.
    (g) If dilutions are performed, the appropriate factors must be 
applied to sample values. All results should be reported in <greek-m>g 
Cr/ml with up to three significant figures.
    5.5  Sample Analyses by IC/PCR. (a) The Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> content of 
the sample filtrate is determined by IC/PCR. To increase sensitivity for 
trace levels of chromium, a preconcentration system is also used in 
conjunction with the IC/PCR.
    (b) Prior to preconcentration and/or analysis, filter all field 
samples through a 0.45-<greek-m>m filter. This filtration should be 
conducted just prior to sample injection/analysis.
    (c) The preconcentration is accomplished by selectively retaining 
the analyte on a solid absorbent (as described in section 3.4.3.3), 
followed by removal of the analyte from the absorbent. Inject the sample 
into a sample loop of the desired size (use repeated loadings or a 
larger size loop for greater sensitivity). The Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> is 
collected on the resin bed of the column. Switch the injection valve so 
that the eluent displaces the concentrated Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> sample, 
moving it off the preconcentration column and onto the IC anion 
separation column. After separation from other sample components, the 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> forms a specific complex in the post-column reactor with 
the DPC reaction solution, and

[[Page 726]]

the complex is detected by visible absorbance at a wavelength of 520 nm. 
The amount of absorbance measured is proportional to the concentration 
of the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> complex formed. Compare the IC retention time and 
the absorbance of the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> complex with known Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> 
standards analyzed under identical conditions to provide both 
qualitative and quantitative analyses.
    (d) Two types of blanks are required for the analysis. The 
calibration blank is used in establishing the analytical curve, and the 
reagent blank is used to assess possible contamination resulting from 
sample processing. Use either 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF>, 
whichever was used for the impinger solution, for the calibration blank. 
The calibration blank can be prepared fresh in the laboratory; it does 
not have to be from the same batch of solution that was used in the 
field. The reagent blank (section 5.2.2) is a sample of the impinger 
solution used for sample collection that is collected in the field 
during the testing program.
    (e) Prior to sample analysis, establish a stable baseline with the 
detector set at the required attenuation by setting the eluent flow rate 
at approximately 1 ml/min and the post-column reagent flow rate at 
approximately 0.5 ml/min. Note: As long as the ratio of eluent flow rate 
to PCR flow rate remains constant, the standard curve should remain 
linear. Inject a sample of reagent water to ensure that no 
Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> appears in the water blank.
    (f) First, inject the calibration standards prepared, as described 
in section 4.3.9 to cover the appropriate concentration range, starting 
with the lowest standard first. Next, inject, in duplicate, the 
calibration reference standard (as described in section 7.3.1), followed 
by the reagent blank (section 5.2.2), and the field samples. Finally, 
repeat the injection of the calibration standards to assess instrument 
drift. Measure areas or heights of the Cr<SUP>+6</SUP>/DPC complex 
chromatogram peaks. The response for replicate, consecutive injections 
of samples must be within 5 percent of the average response, or the 
injection should be repeated until the 5 percent criterion can be met. 
Use the average response (peak areas or heights) from the duplicate 
injections of calibration standards to generate a linear calibration 
curve. From the calibration curve, determine the concentrations of the 
field samples employing the average response from the duplicate 
injections.

                             6. Calibration

    6.1  Sampling Train Calibration. Perform all of the calibrations 
described in Method 5, section 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A). The 
alternate calibration procedures described in section 7 of Method 5 (40 
CFR part 60, appendix A) may also be used.
    6.2  GFAAS Calibration. Either run a series of chromium standards 
and a calibration blank and construct a calibration curve by plotting 
the concentrations of the standards against the absorbencies, or using 
the method of standard additions, plot added concentration versus 
absorbance. For instruments that read directly in concentration, set the 
curve corrector to read out the proper concentration, if applicable. 
This is customarily performed automatically with most instrument 
computer-based data systems.
    6.2.1  GFAAS Calibration Curve. If a calibration curve is used, it 
should be prepared daily with a minimum of a calibration blank and three 
standards. Calibration standards for total chromium should start with 1 
percent v/v HNO<INF>3</INF> with no chromium for the calibration blank, 
with appropriate increases in total chromium concentration for the other 
calibration standards (see section 4.3.9.). Calibration standards should 
be prepared fresh daily.
    6.3  ICP Calibration. Calibrate the instrument according to the 
instrument manufacturer's recommended procedures, using a calibration 
blank and three standards for the initial calibration. Calibration 
standards should be prepared fresh daily, as described in section 4.3.9. 
Be sure that samples and calibration standards are matrix matched. Flush 
the system with the calibration blank between each standard. Use the 
average intensity of multiple exposures for both standardization and 
sample analysis to reduce random error.
    6.4  IC/PCR Calibration. Prepare a calibration curve using the 
calibration blank and three calibration standards prepared fresh daily 
as described in section 4.3.9. Run the standards with the field samples 
as described in section 5.5.

                           7. Quality Control

    7.1  GFAAS Quality Control
    7.1.1  GFAAS Calibration Reference Standards. If a calibration curve 
is used, it must be verified by use of at least one calibration 
reference standard (made from a reference material or other independent 
standard material) at or near the mid-range of the calibration curve. 
The calibration reference standard must be measured within 10 percent of 
it's true value for the curve to be considered valid. The curve must be 
validated before sample analyses are performed.
    7.1.2  GFAAS Check Standards. (a) Run a check standard and a 
calibration blank after approximately every 10 sample injections, and at 
the end of the analytical run. These standards are run, in part, to 
monitor the life and performance of the graphite tube. Lack of 
reproducibility or a significant change in the signal for the check 
standard indicates that the graphite tube should be replaced. Check 
standards can be the mid-range calibration standard or the reference 
standard. The results of the check standard shall agree within 10 
percent of the expected

[[Page 727]]

value. If not, terminate the analyses, correct the problem, recalibrate 
the instrument, and reanalyze all samples analyzed subsequent to the 
last acceptable check standard analysis.
    (b) The results of the calibration blank are to agree within three 
standard deviations of the mean blank value. If not, repeat the analysis 
two more times and average the results. If the average is not within 
three standard deviations of the background mean, terminate the 
analyses, correct the problem, recalibrate, and reanalyze all samples 
analyzed subsequent to the last acceptable calibration blank analysis.
    7.1.3  GFAAS Duplicate Samples. Run one duplicate sample for every 
20 samples, (or one per source test, whichever is more frequent). 
Duplicate samples are brought through the whole sample preparation and 
analytical process separately. Duplicate samples shall agree within 10 
percent.
    7.1.4  GFAAS Matrix Spiking. Spiked samples shall be prepared and 
analyzed daily to ensure that correct procedures are being followed and 
that all equipment is operating properly. Spiked sample recovery 
analyses should indicate a recovery for the Cr spike of between 75 and 
125 percent. Spikes are added prior to any sample preparation. Cr levels 
in the spiked sample should provide final solution concentrations that 
fall within the linear portion of the calibration curve.
    7.1.5  GFAAS Method of Standard Additions. Whenever sample matrix 
problems are suspected and standard/sample matrix matching is not 
possible or whenever a new sample matrix is being analyzed, the method 
of standard additions shall be used for the analysis of all extracts. 
Section 5.4.2 of Method 12 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) specifies a 
performance test to determine if the method of standard additions is 
necessary.
    7.1.6  GFAAS Reagent Blank Samples. Analyze a minimum of one matrix-
matched reagent blank (section 5.2.2) per sample batch to determine if 
contamination or memory effects are occurring. The results should agree 
within three standard deviations of the mean blank value.
    7.2  ICP Quality Control.
    7.2.1  ICP Interference Check. Prepare an interference check 
solution to contain known concentrations of interfering elements that 
will provide an adequate test of the correction factors in the event of 
potential spectral interferences. Two potential interferences, iron and 
manganese, may be prepared as 1,000 <greek-m>g/ml and 200 <greek-m>g/ml 
solutions, respectively. The solutions should be prepared in dilute 
HNO<INF>3</INF> (1-5 percent). Particular care must be taken to ensure 
that the solutions and/or salts used to prepare the solutions are of ICP 
grade purity (i.e., that no measurable Cr contamination exists in the 
salts/solutions). Commercially prepared interfering element check 
standards are available. Verify the interelement correction factors 
every three months by analyzing the interference check solution. The 
correction factors are calculated according to the instrument 
manufacturer's directions. If interelement correction factors are used 
properly, no false Cr should be detected.
    7.2.2  ICP Calibration Reference Standards. Prepare a calibration 
reference standard in the same alkaline matrix as the calibration 
standards; it should be at least 10 times the instrumental detection 
limit. This reference standard should be prepared from a different Cr 
stock solution source than that used for preparation of the calibration 
curve standards and is used to verify the accuracy of the calibration 
curve. Prior to sample analysis, analyze at least one reference 
standard. The calibration reference standard must be measured within 10 
percent of it's true value for the curve to be considered valid. The 
curve must be validated before sample analyses are performed.
    7.2.3  ICP Check Standards. Run a check standard and a calibration 
blank after every 10 samples, and at the end of the analytical run. 
Check standards can be the mid-range calibration standard or the 
reference standard. The results of the check standard shall agree within 
10 percent of the expected value; if not, terminate the analyses, 
correct the problem, recalibrate the instrument, and rerun all samples 
analyzed subsequent to the last acceptable check standard analysis. The 
results of the calibration blank are to agree within three standard 
deviations of the mean blank value. If not, repeat the analysis two more 
times and average the results. If the average is not within three 
standard deviations of the background mean, terminate the analyses, 
correct the problem, recalibrate, and reanalyze all samples analyzed 
subsequent to the last acceptable calibration blank analysis.
    7.2.4  ICP Duplicate Samples. Analyze one duplicate sample for every 
20 samples, (or one per source test, whichever is more frequent). 
Duplicate samples are brought through the whole sample preparation and 
analytical process. Duplicate samples shall agree within 10 percent.
    7.2.5  ICP Reagent Blank Samples. Analyze a minimum of one matrix-
matched reagent blank (section 5.2.2) per sample batch to determine if 
contamination or memory effects are occurring. The results should agree 
within three standard deviations of the mean blank value.
    7.3  IC/PCR Quality Control.
    7.3.1  IC/PCR Calibration Reference Standards. Prepare a calibration 
reference standard in the same alkaline matrix as the calibration 
standards at a concentration that is at or near the mid-point of the 
calibration curve. This reference standard should be prepared from a 
different Cr stock solution source than that used for preparing the 
calibration curve standards. The reference

[[Page 728]]

standard is used to verify the accuracy of the calibration curve. Prior 
to sample analysis, analyze at least one reference standard. The results 
of this analysis of the reference standard must be within 10 percent of 
the true value of the reference standard for the calibration curve to be 
considered valid. The curve must be validated before sample analyses are 
performed.
    7.3.2  IC/PCR Check Standards. (a) Run the calibration blank and 
calibration standards with the field samples as described in section 
5.5. For each standard, determine the peak areas (recommended) or the 
peak heights, calculate the average response from the duplicate 
injections, and plot the average response against the Cr+6 concentration 
in <greek-m>g/l. The individual responses for each calibration standard 
determined before and after field sample analysis must be within 5 
percent of the average response for the analysis to be valid. If the 5 
percent criteria is exceeded, excessive drift and/or instrument 
degradation may have occurred, and must be corrected before further 
analyses are performed.
    (b) Employing linear regression, calculate a predicted value for 
each calibration standard using the average response for the duplicate 
injections. Each predicted value must be within 7 percent of the actual 
value for the calibration curve to be considered acceptable. If not 
acceptable, remake and/or rerun the calibration standards. If the 
calibration curve is still unacceptable, reduce the range of the curve.
    7.3.3  IC/PCR Duplicate Samples. Analyze one duplicate sample for 
every 20 samples, (or one per source test, whichever is more frequent). 
Duplicate samples are brought through the whole sample preparation and 
analytical process. Duplicate samples shall agree within 10 percent.
    7.3.4  ICP Reagent Blank Samples. Analyze a minimum of one matrix-
matched reagent blank (section 5.2.2) per sample batch to determine if 
contamination or memory effects are occurring. The results should agree 
within three standard deviations of the mean blank value.

                        8. Emission Calculations

    Carry out the calculations, retaining one extra decimal figure 
beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures after final 
calculations.
    8.1 Total Cr in Sample. Calculate M<INF>Cr</INF>, the total 
<greek-m>g Cr in each sample, as follows:

M<INF>Cr</INF> = (V<INF>ml</INF>) (C<INF>S</INF>) (F) (D)    Eq.306-1
where:

V<INF>ml</INF> = Volume of impinger contents plus rinses, ml.
C<INF>S</INF> = Concentration of Cr in sample solution, <greek-m>g Cr/
          ml.
F = Dilution factor.
= Volume of aliquot after dilution, ml; Volume of aliquot before 
          dilution, ml
D = Digestion factor.
= Volume of sample aliquot after digestion, ml; Volume of sample aliquot 
          submitted to digestion, ml
    8.2  Average Dry Gas Meter Temperature and Average Orifice Pressure 
Drop. Same as Method 5, section 6.2.
    8.3  Dry Gas Volume, Volume of Water Vapor, Moisture Content. Same 
as Method 5, sections 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5, respectively.
    8.4 Cr  Emission Concentration. Calculate C<INF>Cr</INF>, the Cr 
concentration in the stack gas, in mg/dscm on a dry basis, corrected to 
standard conditions, as follows:

C<INF>Cr</INF>=(10<SUP>-3</SUP> mg/<greek-m>g) (M<INF>Cr</INF>/
          V<INF>m(std)</INF>)    Eq. 306-2
where:

V<INF>m(std)</INF>=Gas sample volume measured by the dry gas meter, 
          corrected to dry standard conditions, dscm.

    8.5  Isokinetic Variation, Acceptable Results. Same as Method 5, 
sections 6.11 and 6.12, respectively.

  Method 306A--Determination of Chromium Emissions From Decorative and 
          Hard Chromium Electroplating and Anodizing Operations

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1  Applicability. This method applies to the determination of 
chromium (Cr) in emissions from decorative and hard chromium 
electroplating facilities and anodizing operations. The method is less 
expensive and less complex to conduct than Method 306 of this appendix. 
Correctly applied, the precision and bias of the sample results will be 
comparable to those obtained with the isokinetic Method 306 of this 
appendix. This method is applicable under ambient moisture, air, and 
temperature conditions.

[[Page 729]]

    1.2  Principle. A sample is extracted from the source at a constant 
sampling rate determined by a critical orifice and collected in a probe 
and impingers. The sampling time at the sampling traverse points is 
varied according to the stack gas velocity at each point to obtain a 
proportional sample. The concentration is determined by the same 
analytical procedures used in Method 306 of this appendix: inductively-
coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP), graphite furnace atomic 
absorption spectrometry (GFAAS), or ion chromatography with a post-
column reactor (IC/PCR).

           2. Range, Sensitivity, Precision, and Interferences

    Same as Method 306, section 2 of this appendix.

                              3. Apparatus

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.
    3.1  Sampling Train. A schematic of the sampling train is shown in 
Figure 306A-1. The components of the train are available commercially, 
but some fabrication and assembly are required. If Method 306 equipment 
is available, the sampling train may be assembled as specified in Method 
306 of this appendix and the sampling rate of the meter box set at the 
delta H<INF>@</INF> specified for the calibrated orifice; this train is 
then operated as specified in this method.
    3.1.1  Probe Nozzle/Tubing and Sheath. Use approximately 1/4 in. 
inside diameter (ID) glass or rigid plastic tubing about 8 in. long with 
a short 90 deg. bend at one end to form the nozzle. Grind a slight taper 
on the nozzle end before making the bend. Attach the nozzle to flexible 
tubing of sufficient length to collect a sample from the stack. Use a 
straight piece of larger diameter rigid tubing (such as metal conduit or 
plastic water pipe) to form a sheath that begins about 1 in. from the 
90 deg. bend on the nozzle and encases the flexible tubing.

[[Page 730]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.072

    3.1.2  S-Type Pitot. Same as Method 2, section 3 (40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A).
    3.1.3  Sample Line. Use thick wall flexible plastic tubing (e.g., 
polyethylene, polypropylene, or polyvinylchloride) about \1/4\ in. to 
\3/8\ in. ID to connect the train components. A combination of rigid 
plastic tubing and thin wall flexible tubing may be used as long as 
neither tubing collapses when leak-checking the train. Metal tubing 
cannot be used.
    3.1.4  Impingers. One quart capacity ``Mason'' glass canning jars 
with vacuum seal lids are used. Three impingers are required: the first 
is for collecting the pollutant in the absorbing solution, the second is 
empty and is used to collect any absorbing solution carried over from 
the first impinger, and the third contains the drying agent. Install 
leak-tight inlet and outlet tubes in the lids of each impinger for 
assembly with the train. The tubes may be made of approximately \1/4\ 
in. ID glass or rigid plastic tubing. For the inlet tube of the first 
impinger, heat the glass or plastic tubing and

[[Page 731]]

draw until the tubing separates. Cut the tip off until the tip orifice 
is \3/32\ in. in diameter. When fabricating the first impinger, place 
the tip orifice \3/16\ in. above the bottom of the jar when assembled. 
For the second impinger, the inlet tube need not be drawn and sized, but 
the tip should be approximately 2 in. above the bottom of the jar. The 
inlet tube of the third impinger should extend to about \1/2\ in. above 
the bottom of the jar. Locate the outlet tube end of all impingers about 
\1/2\ in. beneath the bottom of the lid.
    3.1.5  Manometer. Inclined/vertical type, or equivalent device, as 
described in section 2.2 of Method 2 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A).
    3.1.6  Critical Orifice. The critical orifice is a small restriction 
in the sample line (approximately \1/16\ in. in diameter) that is 
located upstream of the vacuum pump and sets the sample rate at about 
0.75 cfm. An orifice can be made of \3/32\ in. brass tubing 
approximately \9/16\ in. long sealed inside larger diameter, 
approximately \5/16\ in., brass tubing to serve as a critical orifice 
giving a constant sample flow. Materials other than brass can be used to 
construct the critical orifice as long as the flow through the sampling 
train is approximately 0.75 cfm.
    3.1.7  Connecting Hardware. Standard pipe and fittings, \1/4\ in. or 
\1/8\ in., are used to install the vacuum pump and dry gas meter in the 
sampling train.
    3.1.8  Pump Oiler. A glass oil reservoir with a wick mounted at the 
vacuum pump inlet lubricates the pump vanes. The oiler should be an 
inline type and not vented to the atmosphere.
    3.1.9  Vacuum Pump. Gast Model 0522-V103-G18DX, or equivalent, 
capable of delivering at least 1.5 cfm at 15 in. Hg vacuum.
    3.1.10  Oil Trap. An empty glass oil reservoir without wick is 
mounted at pump outlet to prevent oil from reaching the dry gas meter.
    3.1.11  Dry Gas Meter. A Rockwell model 175-s test meter, or 
equivalent, with a thermometer installed to monitor meter temperature. 
The dry gas meter must be capable of measuring volume to within 2 
percent.
    3.2  Sample Recovery.
    3.2.1   Wash Bottles. These are glass or inert plastic, 500 or 1000 
ml, with spray tube.
    3.2.2  Sample Containers. The first mason jar impinger of the 
sampling train serves as the sample container. A new lid and plastic 
wrap are substituted for the impinger inlet/outlet assembly.
    3.3  Analysis. Same as Method 306, section 3.3 of this appendix.

                               4. Reagents

    4.1  Sampling. Same as Method 306, section 4.1 of this appendix.
    4.2  Sample Recovery. Same as Method 306, section 4.2 of this 
appendix.

                              5. Procedure

    5.1  Sampling.
    5.1.1  Pretest Preparation.
    5.1.1.1  Port Location. Locate the sampling ports as specified in 
section 2.1 of Method 1 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A). Use a total of 24 
sampling points for round ducts and 25 points for rectangular ducts. 
Locate the sampling points as specified in section 2.3 of Method 1 (40 
CFR part 60, Appendix A). Mark the pitot and sampling probe with thin 
strips of tape to permit velocity pressure and sample traversing. For 
ducts less than 12 in. in diameter, use a total of 16 points.
    5.1.1.2  Velocity Pressure Traverse. (a) Perform a velocity pressure 
traverse before the first sample run. Figure 306A-2 may be used to 
record velocity pressure data. If testing occurs over several days, 
perform the traverse at the beginning of each day. Perform velocity 
pressure traverses as specified in section 3 of Method 2 (40 CFR part 
60, appendix A), but record only the <greek-D> p (velocity head) values 
for each sampling point.
    (b) Check for cyclonic flow during the first traverse to verify that 
it does not exist; if cyclonic flow does exist, make sure that the 
absolute average angle of misalignment does not exceed 20 deg.. If the 
average angle of misalignment exceeds 20 deg. at an outlet location, 
install straightening vanes to eliminate the cyclonic flow. If it is 
necessary to test an inlet location where cyclonic flow exists, it may 
not be possible to install straightening vanes. In this case, a 
variation of the alignment method must be used. This must be approved by 
the Administrator.

[[Page 732]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.073

    5.1.1.3  Point Sampling Times. Since the sampling rate of the train 
is held constant by the critical orifice, it is necessary to calculate 
specific sampling times for each point in order to obtain a proportional 
sample. If all sampling can be completed in a single day, it is 
necessary to calculate the point sampling times only once. If sampling 
occurs over several days, recalculate the point sample times each day. 
Determine the average of

[[Page 733]]

the <greek-D> p values obtained during the traverse (Figure 306A-2). 
Calculate the sampling times for each point using Equation 306A-1. 
Convert the decimal parts of minutes to seconds. If the stack diameter 
is less than 12 in., use 7.5 minutes in place of 5 minutes in the 
equation and 16 sampling points.

Where:

n=Sampling point number.
<greek-D> p=Velocity head measured by Type-S pitot tube, in. 
          H<INF>2</INF> O

    5.1.1.4 Preparation of Sampling Train. Assemble the sampling train 
as shown in Figure 306A-1. Secure the nozzle-liner assembly to the 
sheath to prevent slipping when sampling. Before charging, rinse the 
first mason jar impinger with either 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or 
0.1 N sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<INF>3</INF>); discard the solution. Put 
250 ml of 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> absorbing solution into 
the first mason jar impinger. Similarly, rinse the second mason jar 
impinger and leave empty. Put silica gel into the third mason jar 
impinger until the impinger is half full. Place the impingers into an 
ice bath and check to ensure that the lids are tight.
    5.1.1.5  Train Leak Check Procedure. Wait until the ice has cooled 
the impingers. Next, seal the nozzle with a finger covered by a piece of 
clear plastic wrap and turn on the pump. The vacuum in the line between 
the pump and the critical orifice must be at least 15 in. Hg. Observe 
any leak rate on the dry gas meter. The leak rate should not exceed 0.02 
cfm.
    5.1.2  Sampling Train Operation.
    5.1.2.1  Record all pertinent process and sampling data on the data 
sheet (see Figure 306A-3). Ensure that the process operation is suitable 
for sample collection.

[[Page 734]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.074

    5.1.2.2  Place the probe/nozzle into the duct at the first sampling 
point and seal the port. Turn on the pump. A minimum vacuum of 15 in. Hg 
or 0.47 atmosphere between the critical orifice and pump is required to 
maintain critical flow. Sample for the time interval previously 
determined for that point. Move to the second point and sample for the 
time interval determined for that point; sample all points on the 
traverse in this manner.

[[Page 735]]

Keep ice around the impingers during the run. Complete the traverse and 
turn off the pump. Move to the next sampling port and repeat. Record the 
final dry gas meter reading. (NOTE: If an approximate mass emission rate 
is desired, record the stack temperature before and after the run.)
    5.1.2.3  Post Test Leak Check. Remove the probe assembly and 
flexible tubing from the first impinger. Do not cover the nozzle. Seal 
the inlet tube of the first impinger with a finger covered by clear 
plastic wrap and turn on the pump. The vacuum in the line between the 
pump and the critical orifice must be at least 15 in. Hg. Observe any 
leak rate on the dry gas meter. If the leak rate exceeds 0.02 cfm, 
reject the run. If the leak rate is acceptable, take the probe assembly 
and impinger assembly to the sample recovery area.
    5.2  Sample Recovery.
    5.2.1   Container No. 1. (a) After the train has been moved to the 
sample recovery area, disconnect the tubing that joins the first 
impinger with the second.
    (b) The first impinger jar is also used as the sample container jar. 
Unscrew the lid from the first impinger jar. Lift the inlet/outlet tube 
assembly almost out of the jar, and using the wash bottle, rinse the 
outside of the impinger tip that was immersed in the impinger jar with 
extra absorbing solution; rinse the inside of the tip as well.
    (c) Recover the second impinger by removing the lid and pouring any 
contents from the second impinger into the first impinger. Rinse the 
second impinger including the inside and outside of the impinger stem as 
well as any connecting plastic tubing with extra absorbing solution and 
place the rinse into the first impinger.
    (d) Hold the nozzle and connecting plastic tubing in a vertical 
position so that the tubing forms a ``U.'' Using the wash bottle, 
partially fill the tubing with sampling reagent. Raise and lower the end 
of the plastic tubing several times to cause the reagent to contact the 
major portion of the internal parts of the assembly thoroughly. Do not 
raise the solution level too high or part of the sample will be lost. 
Place the nozzle end of the assembly over the mouth of the first 
impinger jar (sample container) and elevate the plastic tubing so that 
the solution flows rapidly out of the nozzle. Perform this procedure 
three times. Next, repeat the recovery procedure but allow the solution 
to flow rapidly out the open end of the plastic tubing into the first 
impinger jar.
    (e) Place a piece of clear plastic wrap over the mouth of the first 
impinger jar. Use a standard lid and band assembly to seal the jar. 
Label the jar with the sample number and mark the liquid level to gauge 
any losses during handling.
    5.2.2  Container No. 2 (Reagent Blank). Place approximately 500 ml 
of the 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO<INF>3</INF> absorbing solution in a 
labeled sample container.
    5.2.3  Sample Filtration for IC/PCR. If the sample is to be analyzed 
for Cr<SUP>+6</SUP> by IC/PCR, it must be filtered immediately following 
recovery as described in section 5.2.3 of Method 306 of this appendix.
    5.3  Analysis. Sample preparation and analysis procedures are 
identical to Method 306, section 5.3 of this appendix.

                             6. Calibration

    6.1  Dry Gas Meter. (a) Dry gas meter calibrations may be performed 
by either the manufacturer, a firm who provides calibration services, or 
the tester. The dry gas meter calibration coefficient (Y<INF>m</INF>) 
must be determined prior to initial use of the meter, and must be 
checked following each field use.
    (b) If the dry gas meter is new, the manufacturer will have 
specified the Y<INF>m</INF> for the meter. The manufacturer may also 
have included a calibration orifice and a data sheet with the meter that 
may be used for calibration purposes. The sheet will specify a standard 
cubic foot volume and a sample time, and these values were determined 
when the orifice was used to set the initial Y<INF>m</INF> for the 
meter. The Y<INF>m</INF> may be checked by disconnecting the critical 
orifice in the sampling train and replacing it with the calibration 
orifice. The inlet side of the calibration orifice is open to the 
atmosphere and is not reconnected to the sample train. Record the 
initial dry gas meter volume and meter temperature. Turn on the pump and 
operate it for the number of minutes specified by the manufacturer's 
data sheet. Stop the pump and record the final dry gas meter volume and 
temperature. Subtract the start volume from the stop volume and average 
the temperatures. Check the Y<INF>m</INF> for the dry gas meter after 
the test by using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25JA95.004

Where:

Ft.<SUP>3</SUP><INF>m</INF>=Cubic feet given by meter manufacturer
T<INF>m</INF>=Temperature of meter in degrees Fahrenheit
Ft<SUP>3</SUP><INF>pt</INF>=Cubic feet from dry gas meter, post test
P<INF>bar</INF>=Barometric pressure in inches of mercury
    Compare the Y<INF>m</INF> just calculated with the Ym given by the 
manufacturer:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25JA95.005


[[Page 736]]


    If this value is between 0.95 and 1.05, the Y<INF>m</INF> of the 
meter is acceptable. If the value lies outside the specified range, the 
test series shall either be voided, or calculations for the test series 
shall be performed using whichever meter coefficient value (i.e., before 
and after) that gives the lower value of total sample volume. Return the 
dry gas meter to the manufacturer for recalibration. The calibration may 
also be conducted as specified in section 5.3.1 or section 7 of Method 5 
(40 CFR part 60, appendix A), except that it is only necessary to check 
the calibration at an approximate flow rate of 0.75 cfm. The calibration 
of the dry gas meter must be checked after each field use in the same

Method 306-B--Surface Tension Measurement and Recordkeeping for Chromium 
      Plating Tanks Used at Electroplating and Anodizing Facilities

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1  Applicability. This method is applicable to all decorative 
plating and anodizing operations where a wetting agent is used in the 
tank as the primary mechanism for reducing emissions from the surface of 
the solution.
    1.2  Principle. During an electroplating or anodizing operation, gas 
bubbles generated during the process rise to the surface of the tank 
liquid and burst. Upon bursting, tiny droplets of chromic acid become 
entrained in ambient air. The addition of a wetting agent to the tank 
bath reduces the surface tension of the liquid and diminishes the 
formation of these droplets.

                              2. Apparatus

    2.1  Stalagmometer. Any commercially available stalagmometer or 
equivalent surface tension measuring device may be used to measure the 
surface tension of the plating or anodizing tank liquid.
    2.2  Tensiometer. A tensiometer may be used to measure the surface 
tension of the tank liquid provided the procedures specified in ASTM 
Method D 1331-89, Standard Test Methods for Surface and Interfacial 
Tension of Solutions of Surface Active Agents (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 63.14) are followed.

                              3. Procedure

    3.1  The surface tension of the tank bath may be measured by using a 
tensiometer, a stalagmometer or any other device suitable for measuring 
surface tension in dynes per centimeter. If the tensiometer is used, the 
instructions given in ASTM Method D 1331-89, Standard Test Methods for 
Surface and Interfacial Tension of Solutions of Surface Active Agents 
(incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14) must be followed. If a 
stalagmometer or other device is used to measure surface tension, the 
instructions that came with the measuring device must be followed.
    3.2  (a) Measurements of the bath surface tension are done using a 
progressive system which minimizes the number of surface tension 
measurements required when the proper surface tension is maintained. 
Initially, measurements must be made every 4 hours of tank operation for 
the first 40 hours of tank operation after the compliance date. Once 
there are no exceedances during 40 hours of tank operation, measurements 
may be conducted once every 8 hours of tank operation. Once there are no 
exceedances during 40 hours of tank operation, measurements may be 
conducted once every 40 hours of tank operation on an on-going basis, 
until an exceedance occurs. The maximum time interval for measurements 
is once every 40 hours of tank operation.
    (b) If a measurement of the surface tension of the solution is above 
the 45 dynes per centimeter limit, the time interval reverts back to the 
original monitoring schedule of once every 4 hours. A subsequent 
decrease in frequency would then be allowed according to the previous 
paragraph.

                            4. Recordkeeping

    4.1  Log book of surface tension measurements and fume suppressant 
additions. The surface tension of the plating or anodizing tank bath 
must be measured as specified in section 3.2. The measurements must be 
recorded in the log book. In addition to the record of surface tension 
measurements, the frequency of fume suppressant maintenance additions 
and the amount of fume suppressant added during each maintenance 
addition will be recorded in the log book. The log book will be readily 
available for inspection by regulatory personnel.
    4.2  Instructions for apparatus used in measuring surface tension. 
Also included with the log book must be a copy of the instructions for 
the apparatus used for measuring the surface tension of the plating or 
anodizing bath. If a tensiometer is used, a copy of ASTM Method D 1331-
89, Standard Methods for Surface and Interfacial Tension of Solutions of 
Surface Active Agents (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14) must 
be included with the log book.

 Method 307--Determination of Emissions From Halogenated Solvent Vapor 
            Cleaning Machines Using a Liquid Level Procedure

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1  Applicability. This method is applicable to the determination 
of the halogenated solvent emissions from solvent vapor cleaners in the 
idling mode.
    1.2  Principle. The solvent level in the solvent cleaning machine is 
measured using inclined liquid level indicators. The change in liquid 
level corresponds directly to the amount of solvent lost from the 
solvent cleaning machine.

                              2. Apparatus

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.
    2.1  Inclined Liquid Level Indicator. A schematic of the inclined 
liquid level indicators used in this method is shown in figure 307-1; 
two inclined liquid level indicators having 0.05 centimeters divisions 
or smaller shall be used. The liquid level indicators shall be made of 
glass, Teflon, or any similar material that will not react with the 
solvent

[[Page 738]]

being used. A 6-inch by 1-inch slope is recommended; however the slope 
may vary depending on the size and design of the solvent cleaning 
machine.
    Note: It is important that the inclined liquid level indicators be 
constructed with ease of reading in mind. The inclined liquid level 
indicators should also be mounted so that they can be raised or lowered 
if necessary to suit the solvent cleaning machine size.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.075

    2.2  Horizontal Indicator. Device to check the inclined liquid level 
indicators orientation relative to horizontal.
    2.3  Velocity Meter. Hotwire and vane anemometers, or other devices 
capable of measuring the flow rates ranging from 0 to 15.2 meters per 
minute across the solvent cleaning machine.

                              3. Procedure

    3.1  Connection of the Inclined Liquid Level Indicator. Connect one 
of the inclined liquid level indicators to the boiling sump drain and 
the other inclined liquid level indicator to the immersion sump drain 
using Teflon tubing and the appropriate fittings. A schematic diagram is 
shown in figure 307-2.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.076

    3.2  Positioning of Velocity Meter. Position the velocity meter so 
that it measures the flow rate of the air passing directly across the 
solvent cleaning machine.
    3.3  Level the Inclined Liquid Level Indicators.
    3.4  Initial Inclined Liquid Level Indicator Readings. Open the sump 
drainage valves. Allow the solvent cleaning machine to operate long 
enough for the vapor zone to form and the system to stabilize (check 
with manufacturer). Record the inclined liquid level indicators readings 
and the starting time on the data sheet. A sample data sheet is provided 
in figure 307-3.

    8.1  Sampling. The following items are required for sampling:
    8.1.1  Preparation of Collection Train. Measure 20 ml of water into 
the midget impinger. The adsorbent tube must contain 520 mg of silica 
gel in the front section and 260 mg of silica gel in the backup section.

    8.1.2  Leak Check. A leak check prior to the sampling run is 
optional; however, a leak check after the sampling run is mandatory. The 
leak-check procedure is as follows:
    Temporarily attach a suitable (e.g., 0-to 40-ml/min) rotameter to 
the outlet of the DGM, and place a vacuum gauge at or near the probe 
inlet. Plug the probe inlet, pull a vacuum of at least 250 mm (10 inch) 
Hg, and note the flow rate as indicated by the rotameter. A leakage rate 
not in excess of 2 percent of the average sampling rate is acceptable.

    Note: Carefully release the probe inlet plug before turning off the 
pump.

    8.1.3  Sample Collection. Record the initial DGM reading and 
barometric pressure. To begin sampling, position the tip of the 
Teflon<SUP></SUP> tubing at the sampling point, connect the tubing to 
the impinger, and start the pump. Adjust the sample flow to a constant 
rate between 200 and 1000 ml/min as indicated by the rotameter. Maintain 
this constant rate (<plus-minus>10 percent) during the entire sampling 
run. Take readings (DGM, temperatures at DGM and at impinger outlet, and 
rate meter) at least every 5 minutes. Add more ice during the run to 
keep the temperature of the gases leaving the last impinger at 20  deg.C 
(68  deg.F) or less. At the conclusion of each run,

[[Page 743]]

turn off the pump, remove the Teflon<SUP></SUP> tubing from the stack, 
and record the final readings. Conduct a leak check as in section 8.1.2. 
(This leak check is mandatory.) If a leak is found, void the test run or 
use procedures acceptable to the Administrator to adjust the sample 
volume for the leakage.
    8.2  Sample Recovery. The following items are required for sample 
recovery:
    8.2.1  Impinger. Disconnect the impinger. Pour the contents of the 
midget impinger into a graduated cylinder. Rinse the midget impinger and 
the connecting tubes with water, and add the rinses to the graduated 
cylinder. Record the sample volume. Transfer the sample to a glass vial 
and cap with a Teflon<SUP></SUP> septum. Discard any excess sample. 
Place the samples in an ice chest for shipment to the laboratory.
    8.2.2.  Adsorbent Tubes. Seal the silica gel adsorbent tubes and 
place them in an ice chest for shipment to the laboratory.

    9.2  Applicability. When the method is used to analyze samples to 
demonstrate compliance with a source emission regulation, an audit 
sample must be analyzed, subject to availability.
    9.3  Audit Procedure. Analyze an audit sample with each set of 
compliance samples. Concurrently analyze the audit sample and a set of 
compliance samples in the same manner to evaluate the technique of the 
analyst and the standards preparation. The same analyst, analytical 
reagents, and analytical system shall be used both for the compliance 
samples and the EPA audit sample.
    9.4  Audit Sample Availability. Audit samples will be supplied only 
to enforcement agencies for compliance tests. Audit samples may be 
obtained by writing: Source Test Audit Coordinator (MD-77B), Air 
Measurement Research Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory, 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711; 
or by calling the Source Test Audit Coordinator (STAC) at (919) 541-
7834. The audit sample request must be made at least 30 days prior to 
the scheduled compliance sample analysis.
    9.5  Audit Results. Calculate the audit sample concentration 
according to the calculation procedure provided in the audit 
instructions included with the audit sample. Fill in the audit sample 
concentration and the analyst's name on the audit response form included 
with the audit instructions. Send one copy to the EPA Regional Office or 
the appropriate enforcement agency and a second copy to the STAC. The 
EPA Regional office or the appropriate enforcement agency will report 
the results of the audit to the laboratory being audited. Include this 
response with the results of the compliance samples in relevant reports 
to the EPA Regional Office or the appropriate enforcement agency.

                  10.0  Calibration and Standardization

    10.1  Metering System. The following items are required for the 
metering system:
    10.1.1  Initial Calibration.
    10.1.1.1  Before its initial use in the field, first leak-check the 
metering system (drying tube, needle valve, pump, rotameter, and DGM) as 
follows: Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to the drying tube, and pull 
a vacuum of 250 mm (10 inch) Hg; plug or pinch off the outlet of the 
flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum shall remain stable 
for at least 30 seconds. Carefully release the vacuum gauge before 
releasing the flow meter end.
    10.1.1.2  Next, remove the drying tube, and calibrate the metering 
system (at the sampling flow rate specified by the method) as follows: 
Connect an appropriately sized wet test meter (e.g., 1 liter per 
revolution (0.035 cubic feet per revolution)) to the inlet of the drying 
tube. Make three independent calibrations runs, using at least five 
revolutions of the DGM per run. Calculate the calibration factor, Y (wet 
test meter calibration volume divided by the DGM volume, both volumes 
adjusted to the same reference temperature and pressure), for each run, 
and average the results. If any Y-value deviates by more than 2 percent 
from the average, the metering system is unacceptable for use. 
Otherwise, use the average as the calibration factor for subsequent test 
runs.
    10.1.2  Posttest Calibration Check. After each field test series, 
conduct a calibration check as in section 10.1.1 above, except for the 
following variations: (a) The leak check is not to be conducted, (b) 
three, or more revolutions of the DGM may be used, and (c) only two 
independent runs need be made. If the calibration factor does not 
deviate by more than 5 percent from the initial calibration factor 
(determined in section 10.1.1), then the DGM volumes obtained during the 
test series are acceptable. If the calibration factor deviates by more 
than 5 percent, recalibrate the metering system as in section 10.1.1, 
and for the calculations, use the calibration factor (initial or 
recalibration) that yields the lower gas volume for each test run.
    10.1.3  Temperature Sensors. Calibrate against mercury-in-glass 
thermometers.

[[Page 744]]

    10.1.4  Rotameter. The rotameter need not be calibrated, but should 
be cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer's instruction.
    10.1.5  Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer.
    10.2  Gas Chromatograph. The following procedures are required for 
the gas chromatograph:
    10.2.1  Initial Calibration. Inject 1 <greek-m>l of each of the 
standards prepared in sections 7.2.3.3 and 7.2.3.4 into the GC and 
record the response. Repeat the injections for each standard until two 
successive injections agree within 5 percent. Using the mean response 
for each calibration standard, prepare a linear least squares equation 
relating the response to the mass of methanol in the sample. Perform the 
calibration before analyzing each set of samples.
    10.2.2  Continuing Calibration. At the beginning of each day, 
analyze the mid level calibration standard as described in section 
10.5.1. The response from the daily analysis must agree with the 
response from the initial calibration within 10 percent. If it does not, 
the initial calibration must be repeated.

                       11.0  Analytical Procedure

    11.1  Gas Chromatograph Operating Conditions. The following 
operating conditions are required for the GC:
    11.1.1  Injector. Configured for capillary column, splitless, 200 
deg.C (392  deg.F).
    11.1.2  Carrier. Helium at 10 ml/min.
    11.1.3  Oven. Initially at 45  deg.C for 3 minutes; then raise by 10 
 deg.C to 70  deg.C; then raise by 70  deg.C/min to 200  deg.C.
    11.2  Impinger Sample. Inject 1 <greek-m>l of the stored sample into 
the GC. Repeat the injection and average the results. If the sample 
response is above that of the highest calibration standard, either 
dilute the sample until it is in the measurement range of the 
calibration line or prepare additional calibration standards. If the 
sample response is below that of the lowest calibration standard, 
prepare additional calibration standards. If additional calibration 
standards are prepared, there shall be at least two that bracket the 
response of the sample. These standards should produce approximately 50 
percent and 150 percent of the response of the sample.
    11.3  Silica Gel Adsorbent Sample. The following items are required 
for the silica gel adsorbent samples:
    11.3.1  Preparation of Samples. Extract the front and backup 
sections of the adsorbent tube separately. With a file, score the glass 
adsorbent tube in front of the first section of silica gel. Break the 
tube open. Remove and discard the glass wool. Transfer the first section 
of the silica gel to a 5-ml glass vial and stopper the vial. Remove the 
spacer between the first and second section of the adsorbent tube and 
discard it. Transfer the second section of silica gel to a separate 5-ml 
glass vial and stopper the vial.
    11.3.2  Desorption of Samples. Add 3 ml of the 10 percent n-propanol 
solution to each of the stoppered vials and shake or vibrate the vials 
for 30 minutes.
    11.3.3  Inject a 1-<greek-m>l aliquot of the diluted sample from 
each vial into the GC. Repeat the injection and average the results. If 
the sample response is above that of the highest calibration standard, 
either dilute the sample until it is in the measurement range of the 
calibration line or prepare additional calibration standards. If the 
sample response is below that of the lowest calibration standard, 
prepare additional calibration standards. If additional calibration 
standards are prepared, there shall be at least two that bracket the 
response of the sample. These standards should produce approximately 50 
percent and 150 percent of the response of the sample.

hexane isomer (2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, n-hexane, and 
methylcyclo-pentane). Enter these percentages into the method 
calibration table.
    10.3  Heat the standard bottle for 30 minutes in a 105  deg.C oven.
    10.4  Inject about 0.25 cc of vapor into the gas chromatograph and 
after the analysis is finished, calibrate according to the procedures 
described by the instrument manufacturer.

                             11.0  Procedure

    11.1  Using a cold mill set at a wide roller gap (125-150 mm), mill 
about 250 grams of crumb two times to homogenize the sample.
    11.2  Weigh about 2 grams of wet crumb into a septum bottle and cap 
with a septum ring. Add 20 <greek-m>l of chloroform with a syringe and 
place in a 105  deg.C oven for 45 minutes.
    11.3  Run the moisture content on a separate portion of the sample 
and calculate the grams of dry rubber put into the septum bottle.
    11.4  Set up the data station on the required method and enter the 
dry rubber weight in the sample weight field.
    11.5  Inject a 0.25 cc vapor sample into the chromatograph and push 
the start button.
    11.6  At the end of the analysis, the data station will print a 
report listing the concentration of each identified component.
    11.7  To analyze water samples, pipet 5 ml of sample into the septum 
bottle, cap and add 20 <greek-m>l of chloroform. Place in a 105  deg.C 
oven for 30 minutes.
    11.8  Enter 5 grams into the sample weight field.
    11.9  Inject a 0.25 cc vapor sample into the chromatograph and push 
the start button.
    11.10  At the end of the analysis, the data station will print a 
report listing the concentration of each identified component.

                   12.0  Data Analysis and Calculation

    12.1  For samples that are prepared as in section 11 of this method, 
ppm n-hexane is read directly from the computer.
    12.2  The formulas for calculation of the results are as follows:

    ppm<INF>hexane</INF>=(A<INF>hexane</INF> x R<INF>hexane</INF>)/
(A<INF>is</INF> x R<INF>is</INF>)

    Where:
    A<INF>hexane</INF>=area of hexane
    R<INF>hexane</INF>=response of hexane
    A<INF>is</INF>=area of the internal standard
    R<INF>is</INF>=response of the internal standard

[[Page 747]]

    % hexane in crumb=(ppm<INF>hexane</INF>/sample amount)100
    12.3  Correct the results by the value of R (as determined in 
sections 9.3.4, 9.3.5, and 9.3.6 of this method).

                        13.0  Method Performance

    13.1  The test has a standard deviation of 0.14 wt% at 0.66 wt% 
hexane. Spike recovery of 12 samples at two levels of hexane averaged 
102.3%. Note: Recovery must be determined for each type of sample. The 
values given here are meant to be examples of method performance.

                       14.0  Pollution Prevention

    14.1  Waste generation should be minimized where possible. Sample 
size should be an amount necessary to adequately run the analysis.

                         15.0  Waste Management

    15.1  All waste shall be handled in accordance with federal and 
state environmental regulations.

    1.1  Data Quality Objectives:
    In the production of ethylene-propylene terpolymer crumb rubber, the 
polymer is recovered from solution by flashing off the solvent with 
steam and hot water. The resulting water-crumb slurry is then pumped to 
the finishing units. Certain amounts of solvent (hexane being the most 
commonly used solvent) and diene monomer remain in the crumb. The 
analyst uses the following procedure to determine those amounts.

                         2.0  Summary of Method

    2.1  The crumb rubber sample is dissolved in toluene to which 
heptane has been added as an internal standard. Acetone is then added to 
this solution to precipitate the crumb, and the supernatant is analyzed 
for hexane and diene by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame 
ionization detector (FID).

                            3.0  Definitions

    3.1  Included in text as needed.

                           4.0  Interferences

    4.1  None known.
    4.2  Benzene, introduced as a contaminant in the toluene solvent, 
elutes between methyl cyclopentane and cyclohexane. However, the benzene 
peak is completely resolved.
    4.3  2,2-dimethyl pentane, a minor component of the hexane used in 
our process, elutes just prior to methyl cyclopentane. It is included as 
``hexane'' in the analysis whether it is integrated separately or 
included in the methyl cyclopentane peak.

                               5.0  Safety

    5.1  This procedure does not purport to address all of the safety 
concerns associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user 
of this procedure to establish appropriate safety and health practices 
and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
    5.2  Chemicals used in this analysis are flammable and hazardous 
(see specific toxicity information below). Avoid contact with sources of 
ignition during sample prep. All handling should be done beneath a hood. 
Playtex or nitrile gloves recommended.
    5.3  Hexane is toxic by ingestion and inhalation. Vapor inhalation 
causes irritation of nasal and respiratory passages, headache, 
dizziness, nausea, central nervous system depression. Chronic 
overexposure can cause severe nerve damage. May cause irritation on 
contact with skin or eyes. May cause damage to kidneys.
    5.3  ENB may be harmful by inhalation, ingestion, or skin 
absorption. Vapor or mist is irritating to the eyes, mucous membranes, 
and upper respiratory tract. Causes skin irritation.
    5.4  Toluene is harmful or fatal if swallowed. Vapor harmful if 
inhaled. Symptoms: headache, dizziness, hallucinations, distorted 
perceptions, changes in motor activity, nausea, diarrhea, respiratory 
irritation, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, liver, 
kidney and lung damage. Contact can cause severe eye irritation. May 
cause skin irritation. Causes irritation of eyes, nose, and throat.

[[Page 748]]

    5.5  Acetone, at high concentrations or prolonged overexposure, may 
cause headache, dizziness, irritation of eyes and respiratory tract, 
loss of strength, and narcosis. Eye contact causes severe irritation; 
skin contact may cause mild irritation. Concentrations of 20,000 ppm are 
immediately dangerous to life and health.
    5.6  Heptane is harmful if inhaled or swallowed. May be harmful if 
absorbed through the skin. Vapor or mist is irritating to the eyes, 
mucous membranes, and upper respiratory tract. Prolonged or repeated 
exposure to skin causes defatting and dermatitis.
    5.7  The steam oven used to dry the polymer in this procedure is set 
at 110 deg. C. Wear leather gloves when removing bottles from the oven.

    7.5.6  Purity Check: Analyze according to section 11.2. NOTE: You 
must ``precipitate'' the sample with an equal part of acetone (thus 
duplicating actual test conditions-- see section 11.1 of this method, 
sample prep) before analyzing. Analyze the reagent 3 times to quantify 
the C<INF>6</INF> and ENB interferences. Inspect the results to ensure 
good agreement among the three runs (within 10%).
    7.5.7  Tag the bottle with the following information:

7.5.6 of this method)

    7.6  Quality Control Solution: the quality control solution is 
prepared by adding specific amounts of mixed hexanes (barge hexane), n-
nonane and ENB to some polymer dissolving solution. Nonane elutes in the 
same approximate time region as ENB and is used to quantify in that 
region because it has a longer shelf life. ENB, having a high tendency 
to polymerize, is used in the QC solution only to ensure that both ENB 
isomers elute at the proper time.
    First, a concentrated stock solution is prepared; the final QC 
solution can then be prepared by diluting the stock solution.
    7.6.1  In preparation of stock solution, fill a 1-liter volumetric 
flask partially with polymer dissolving solution (PDS)--see section 7.5 
of this method. Add 20.0 ml barge hexane, 5.0 ml n-nonane, and 3 ml ENB. 
Finish filling the volumetric to the mark with PDS.
    7.6.2  In preparation of quality control solution, dilute the 
quality control stock solution (above) precisely 1:10 with PDS, i.e. 10 
ml of stock solution made up to 100 ml (volumetric flask) with PDS. Pour 
the solution into a 4 oz. Boston round bottle and store in the 
refrigerator.

            8.0  Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    8.1  Line up facility to catch crumb samples. The facility is a 
special facility where the sample is drawn.
    8.1.1  Ensure that the cock valve beneath facility is closed.
    8.1.2  Line up the system from the slurry line cock valve to the 
cock valve at the nozzle on the stripper.
    8.1.3  Allow the system to flush through facility for a period of 30 
seconds.
    8.2  Catch a slurry crumb sample.
    8.2.1  Simultaneously close the cock valves upstream and downstream 
of facility.
    8.2.2  Close the cock valve beneath the slurry line in service.
    8.2.3  Line up the cooling tower water through the sample bomb water 
jacket to the sewer for a minimum of 30 minutes.
    8.2.4  Place the sample catching basket beneath facility and open 
the cock valve underneath the bomb to retrieve the rubber crumb.
    8.2.5  If no rubber falls by gravity into the basket, line up 
nitrogen to the bleeder upstream of the sample bomb and force the rubber 
into the basket.
    8.2.6  Close the cock valve underneath the sample bomb.
    8.3  Fill a plastic ``Whirl-pak'' sample bag with slurry crumb and 
send it to the lab immediately.
    8.4  Once the sample reaches the lab, it should be prepped as soon 
as possible to avoid hexane loss through evaporation. Samples which have 
lain untouched for more than 30 minutes should be discarded.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    Quality control is monitored via a computer program that tracks 
analyses of a prepared QC sample (from section 7.6.2 of this method). 
The QC sample result is entered daily into the program, which plots the 
result as a data point on a statistical chart. If the data point does 
not satisfy the ``in-control'' criteria (as defined by the lab quality 
facilitator), an ``out-of-control'' flag appears, mandating corrective 
action.
    In addition, the area of the n-heptane peak is monitored so that any 
errors in making up the polymer dissolving solution will be caught and 
corrected. Refer to section 12.4 of this method.

    9.1  Fill an autosampler vial with the quality control solution 
(from section 7.6.2 of this method) and analyze on the GC as normal (per 
section 11 of this method).
    9.2  Add the concentrations of the 5 hexane isomers as they appear 
on the CALS printout. Also include the 2,2-dimethyl-pentane peak just 
ahead of the methyl cyclopentane (the fourth major isomer) peak in the 
event that the peak integration split this peak out. Do not include the 
benzene peak in the sum. Note the nonane concentration. Record both 
results (total hexane and nonane) in the QC computer program. If out of 
control, and GC appears to be functioning within normal parameters, 
reanalyze a fresh control sample.

[[Page 750]]

If the fresh QC is not in control, check stock solution for contaminants 
or make up a new QC sample with the toluene currently in use. If 
instrument remains out-of-control, more thorough GC troubleshooting may 
be needed.
    Also, verify that the instrument has detected both isomers of ENB 
(quantification not necessary--see section 7.0 of this method).
    9.3  Recovery efficiency must be determined for each sample type and 
whenever modifications are made to the method. Recovery shall be between 
70 and 130 percent. All test results must be corrected by the recovery 
efficiency value (R).
    9.3.1  Approximately 10 grams of wet EPDM crumb (equivalent to about 
5 grams of dry rubber) shall be added to six sample bottles containing 
100 ml of hexane in crumb polymer dissolving solution (toluene 
containing 0.3 gram n-heptane/100 ml solution). The polymer shall be 
dissolved by agitating the bottles on a shaker for 4 hours. The polymer 
shall be precipitated using 100 ml acetone.
    9.3.2  The supernatant liquid shall be decanted from the polymer. 
Care shall be taken to remove as much of the liquid phase from the 
sample as possible to minimize the effect of retained liquid phase upon 
the next cycle of the analysis. The supernatant liquid shall be analyzed 
by gas chromatography using an internal standard quantitation method 
with heptane as the internal standard.
    9.3.3  The precipitated polymer from the steps described above shall 
be re-dissolved using toluene as the solvent. The toluene solvent and 
acetone precipitant shall be determined to be free of interfering 
compounds.
    9.3.4  The rubber which was dissolved in the toluene shall be 
precipitated with acetone as before, and the supernatant liquid decanted 
from the precipitated polymer. The liquid shall be analyzed by gas 
chromatography and the rubber phase dried in a steam-oven to determine 
the final polymer weight.
    9.3.5  The ratios of the areas of the hexane peaks and of the 
heptane internal standard peak shall be calculated for each of the six 
samples in the two analysis cycles outlined above. The area ratios of 
the total hexane to heptane (R1) shall be determined for the two 
analysis cycles of the sample set. The ratio of the values of R1 from 
the second analysis cycle to the first cycle shall be determined to give 
a second ratio (R2).

                  10.0  Calibration and Standardization

    The procedure for preparing a Quality Control sample with the 
internal standard in it is outlined in section 7.6 of this method.

    10.1  The relative FID response factors for n-heptane, the internal 
standard, versus the various hexane isomers and ENB are relatively 
constant and should seldom need to be altered. However Baseline 
construction is a most critical factor in the production of good data. 
For this reason, close attention should be paid to peak integration. 
Procedures for handling peak integration will depend upon the data 
system used.
    10.2  If recalibration of the analysis is needed, make up a 
calibration blend of the internal standard and the analytes as detailed 
below and analyze it using the analytical method used for the samples.
    10.2.1  Weigh 5 g heptane into a tared scintillation vial to five 
places.
    10.2.2  Add 0.2 ml ENB to the vial and reweigh.
    10.2.3  Add 0.5 ml hexane to the vial and reweigh.
    10.2.4  Cap, and shake vigorously to mix.
    10.2.5  Calculate the weights of ENB and of hexane added and divide 
their weights by the weight of the n-heptane added. The result is the 
known of given value for the calibration.
    10.2.6  Add 0.4 ml of this mixture to a mixture of 100 ml toluene 
and 100 ml of acetone. Cap and shake vigorously to mix.
    10.2.7  Analyze the sample.
    10.2.8  Divide the ENB area and the total areas of the hexane peaks 
by the n-heptane area. This result is the ``found'' value for the 
calibration.
    10.2.9  Divide the appropriate ``known'' value from 10.2.5 by the 
found value from 10.2.8. The result is the response factor for the 
analyte in question. Previous work has shown that the standard deviation 
of the calibration method is about 1% relative.

                             11.0  Procedure

    11.1  SAMPLE PREPARATION
    11.1.1  Tare an 8oz sample bottle--Tag attached, cap off; record 
weight and sample ID on tag in pencil.
    11.1.2  Place crumb sample in bottle: RLA-1: 20g; RLA-3: 10g--(gives 
a dry wt of <difference>10g); (gives a dry wt of <difference>5.5g).
    11.1.3  Dispense 100ml of PDS into each bottle. SAMPLE SHOULD BE 
PLACED INTO SOLUTION ASAP TO AVOID HEXANE LOSS--Using ``Dispensette'' 
pipettor. Before dispensing, ``purge'' the dispensette (25% of its 
volume) into a waste bottle to eliminate any voids.
    11.1.4  Tightly cap bottles and load samples into shaker.
    11.1.5  Insure that ``ON-OFF'' switch on the shaker itself is 
``ON.''
    11.1.6  Locate shaker timer. Insure that toggle switch atop timer 
control box is in the middle (``off'') position. If display reads 
``04:00'' (4 hours), move toggle switch to the left position. Shaker 
should begin operating.
    11.1.7  After shaker stops, add 100 ml acetone to each sample to 
precipitate polymer. Shake minimum of 5 minutes on shaker--

[[Page 751]]

Vistalon sample may not have fully dissolved; nevertheless, for purposes 
of consistency, 4 hours is the agreed-upon dissolving time.
    11.1.8  Using a 5-ml glass Luer-lock syringe and Acrodisc filter, 
filter some of the supernatant liquid into an autosampler vial; crimp 
the vial and load it into the GC autosampler for analysis (section 11.2 
of this method)--The samples are filtered to prevent polymer buildup in 
the GC. Clean the syringes in toluene.
    11.1.9  Decant remaining supernatant into a hydrocarbon waste sink, 
being careful not to discard any of the polymer. Place bottle of 
precipitate into the steam oven and dry for six hours--Some grades of 
Vistalon produce very small particles in the precipitate, thus making 
complete decanting impossible without discarding some polymer. In this 
case, decant as much as possible and put into the oven as is, allowing 
the oven to drive off remaining supernatant (this practice is avoided 
for environmental reasons). WARNING: OVEN IS HOT--110  deg.C (230 deg. 
F).
    11.1.10  Cool, weigh and record final weight of bottle.
    11.2  GC ANALYSIS
    11.2.1  Initiate the CALS computer channel.
    11.2.2  Enter the correct instrument method into the GC's 
integrator.
    11.2.3  Load sample vial(s) into autosampler.
    11.2.4  Start the integrator.
    11.2.5  When analysis is complete, plot CALS run to check baseline 
skim.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1  Add the concentrations of the hexane peaks as they appear on 
the CALS printout. Do not include the benzene peak in the sum.
    12.2  Subtract any hexane interferences found in the PDS (see 
section 7.5.6 of this method); record the result.
    12.3  Note the ENB concentration on the CALS printout. Subtract any 
ENB interference found in the PDS and record this result in a ``% ENB by 
GC'' column in a logbook.
    12.4  Record the area (from CALS printout) of the heptane internal 
standard peak in a ``C7 area'' column in the logbook. This helps track 
instrument performance over the long term.
    12.5  After obtaining the final dry weight of polymer used (section 
11.1.10 of this method), record that result in a ``dry wt.'' column of 
the logbook.
    12.6  Divide the %C6 by the dry weight to obtain the total PHR 
hexane in crumb. Similarly, divide the %ENB by the dry weight to obtain 
the total PHR ENB in crumb. Note that PHR is an abbreviation for ``parts 
per hundred''. Record both the hexane and ENB results in the logbook.
    12.7  Correct all results by the recovery efficiency value (R).

                        13.0  Method Performance

    13.1  The method has been shown to provide 100% recovery of the 
hexane analyte. The method was found to give a 6% relative standard 
deviation when the same six portions of the same sample were carried 
through the procedure. Note: These values are examples; each sample type 
must be tested for sample recovery.

                       14.0  Pollution Prevention

    14.1  Dispose of all hydrocarbon liquids in the appropriate disposal 
sink system; never pour hydrocarbons down a water sink.
    14.2  As discussed in section 11.1.9 of this method, the analyst can 
minimize venting hydrocarbon vapor to the atmosphere by decanting as 
much hydrocarbon liquid as possible before oven drying.

                         15.0  Waste Mamagement

    15.1  The Technician conducting the analysis should follow the 
proper waste management practices for their laboratory location.

 Method 310C--Determination of Residual N-Hexane in EPDM Rubber Through 
                           Gas Chromatography

                       1.0  Scope and Application

    1.1  This method describes a procedure for the determination of 
residual hexane in EPDM wet crumb rubber in the 0.01--2% range by 
solvent extraction of the hexane followed by gas chromatographic 
analysis where the hexane is detected by flame ionization and quantified 
via an internal standard.
    1.2  This method may involve hazardous materials operations and 
equipment. This method does not purport to address all the safety 
problems associated with it use, if any. It is the responsibility of the 
user to consult and establish appropriate safety and health practices 
and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

                              2.0  Summary

    2.1  Residual hexane contained in wet pieces of EPDM polymer is 
extracted with MIBK. A known amount of an internal standard (IS) is 
added to the extract which is subsequently analyzed via gas 
chromatography where the hexane and IS are separated and detected 
utilizing a megabore column and flame ionization detection (FID). From 
the

[[Page 752]]

response to the hexane and the IS, the amount of hexane in the EPDM 
polymer is calculated.

                            3.0  Definitions

    3.1  Hexane--refers to n-hexane
    3.2  Heptane--refers to n-heptane
    3.3  MIBK--methyl isobutyl ketone (4 methyl 2--Pentanone)

                           4.0  Interferences

    4.1  Material eluting at or near the hexane and/or the IS will cause 
erroneous results. Prior to extraction, solvent blanks must be analyzed 
to confirm the absence of interfering peaks.

    7.3  n-hexane, 99% + purity

                         8.0  Sample Collection

    8.1  Trap a sample of the EPDM crumb slurry in the sampling 
apparatus. Allow the crumb slurry to circulate through the sampling 
apparatus for 5 minutes; then close off the values at the bottom and top 
of the sampling apparatus, trapping the crumb slurry. Run cooling water 
through the water jacket for a minimum of 30 minutes. Expel the cooled 
crumb slurry into a sample catching basket. If the crumb does not fall 
by gravity, force it out with demineralized water or nitrogen. Send the 
crumb slurry to the lab for analysis.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    9.1  The Royalene crumb sample is extracted three times with MIBK 
containing an internal standard. The hexane from each extraction is 
added together to obtain a total hexane content. The percent hexane in 
the first extraction is then calculated and used as the recovery factor 
for the analysis.
    9.2  Follow this test method through section 11.4 of the method. 
After removing the sample of the first extraction to be run on the gas 
chromatograph, drain off the remainder of the extraction solvent, 
retaining the crumb sample in the sample jar. Rinse the crumb with 
demineralized water to remove any MIBK left on the surface of the crumb. 
Repeat the extraction procedure with fresh MIBK with internal standard 
two more times.
    9.3  After the third extraction, proceed to section 11.5 of this 
method and obtain the percent hexane in each extraction. Use the sample 
weight obtained in section 12.1 of this method to calculate the percent 
hexane in each of the extracts.
    9.4  Add the percent hexane obtained from the three extractions for 
a total percent hexane in the sample.
    9.5  Use the following equations to determine the recovery factor 
(R):
    % Recovery of the first extraction=(% hexane in the first extract/
total % hexane) x 100
    Recovery Factor (R)=(% Hexane Recovered in the first extract)/100

                            10.0  Calibration

    10.1  Preparation of Internal Standard (IS) solution:
    Accuracy weigh 30 grams of n-heptane into a 1000 ml volumetric 
flask. Dilute to the mark with reagent grade MIBK. Label this Solution 
``A''. Pipette 100 mls. of Solution A into a 4 liter volumetric flask. 
Fill the flask to the mark with reagent MIBK. Label this Solution ``B''. 
Solution ``B'' will have a concentration of 0.75 mg/ml of heptane.
    10.2  Preparation of Hexane Standard Solution (HS):
    Using a 50 uL syringe, weigh by difference, 20 mg of n-hexane into a 
50 ml volumetric flask containing approximately 40 ml of Solution B. 
Fill the flask to the mark with Solution B and mix well.
    10.3  Conditions for GC analysis of standards and samples:
    Temperature:
    Initial=40  deg.C
    Final=150  deg.C
    Injector=160  deg.C
    Detector=280  deg.C
    Program Rate=5.0  deg.C/min

    Initial Time=5 minutes Final Time=6 minutes
    Flow Rate=5.0 ml/min
    Sensitivity=detector response must be adjusted to keep the hexane 
and IS on scale.
    10.4  Fill an autosampler vial with the HS, analyze it three times 
and calculate a Hexane Relative Response Factor (RF) as follows:

    RF=(A<INF>IS</INF>  x  C<INF>HS</INF>  x  P<INF>HS</INF>)/
(A<INF>HS</INF>  x  C<INF>IS</INF>  x  P<INF>IS</INF>)    (1)

Method 311--Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and 
          Coatings by Direct Injection Into a Gas Chromatograph

                        1. Scope and Application

    1.1  Applicability. This method is applicable for determination of 
most compounds designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as 
volatile hazardous air pollutants (HAP's) (See Reference 1) that are 
contained in paints and coatings. Styrene, ethyl acrylate, and methyl 
methacrylate can be measured by ASTM D 4827-93 or ASTM D 4747-87. 
Formaldehyde can be measured by ASTM PS 9-94 or ASTM D 1979-91. Toluene 
diisocyanate can be measured in urethane prepolymers by ASTM D 3432-89. 
Method 311 applies only to those volatile HAP's which are added to the 
coating when it is manufactured, not to those which may form as the 
coating cures (reaction products or cure volatiles). A separate or 
modified test procedure must be used to measure these reaction products 
or cure volatiles in order to determine the total volatile HAP emissions 
from a coating. Cure volatiles are a significant component of the total 
HAP content of some coatings. The term ``coating'' used in this method 
shall be understood to mean paints and coatings.
    1.2  Principle. The method uses the principle of gas chromatographic 
separation and quantification using a detector that responds to 
concentration differences. Because there are many potential analytical 
systems or sets of operating conditions that may represent useable 
methods for determining the concentrations of the compounds cited in 
Section 1.1 in the applicable matrices, all systems that employ this 
principle, but differ only in details of equipment and operation, may be 
used as alternative methods, provided that the prescribed quality 
control, calibration, and method performance requirements are met. 
Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include information 
relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, but not 
limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, injection 
port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.

                          2. Summary of Method

    Whole coating is added to dimethylformamide and a suitable internal 
standard compound is added. An aliquot of the sample mixture is injected 
onto a

[[Page 754]]

chromatographic column containing a stationary phase that separates the 
analytes from each other and from other volatile compounds contained in 
the sample. The concentrations of the analytes are determined by 
comparing the detector responses for the sample to the responses 
obtained using known concentrations of the analytes.

                        3. Definitions [Reserved]

                            4. Interferences

    4.1  Coating samples of unknown composition may contain the compound 
used as the internal standard. Whether or not this is the case may be 
determined by following the procedures of Section 11 and deleting the 
addition of the internal standard specified in Section 11.5.3. If 
necessary, a different internal standard may be used.
    4.2  The GC column and operating conditions developed for one 
coating formulation may not ensure adequate resolution of target 
analytes for other coating formulations. Some formulations may contain 
nontarget analytes that coelute with target analytes. If there is any 
doubt about the identification or resolution of any gas chromatograph 
(GC) peak, it may be necessary to analyze the sample using a different 
GC column or different GC operating conditions.
    4.3  Cross-contamination may occur whenever high-level and low-level 
samples are analyzed sequentially. The order of sample analyses 
specified in Section 11.7 is designed to minimize this problem.
    4.4  Cross-contamination may also occur if the devices used to 
transfer coating during the sample preparation process or for injecting 
the sample into the GC are not adequately cleaned between uses. All such 
devices should be cleaned with acetone or other suitable solvent and 
checked for plugs or cracks before and after each use.

                                5. Safety

    5.1  Many solvents used in coatings are hazardous. Precautions 
should be taken to avoid unnecessary inhalation and skin or eye contact. 
This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. 
This test method does not purport to address all of the safety problems 
associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this 
test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to 
determine the applicability of regulatory limitations in regards to the 
performance of this test method.
    5.2  Dimethylformamide is harmful if inhaled or absorbed through the 
skin. The user should obtain relevant health and safety information from 
the manufacturer. Dimethylformamide should be used only with adequate 
ventilation. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and clothing. In case of 
contact, immediately flush skin or eyes with plenty of water for at 
least 15 minutes. If eyes are affected, consult a physician. Remove and 
wash contaminated clothing before reuse.
    5.3  User's manuals for the gas chromatograph and other related 
equipment should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken 
related to their use.

                        6. Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include 
information relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, 
but not limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, 
injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.

    6.1  Sample Collection.
    6.1.1  Sampling Containers. Dual-seal sampling containers, four to 
eight fluid ounce capacity, should be used to collect the samples. Glass 
sample bottles or plastic containers with volatile organic compound 
(VOC) impermeable walls must be used for corrosive substances (e.g., 
etch primers and certain coating catalysts such as methyl ethyl ketone 
(MEK) peroxide). Sample containers, caps, and inner seal liners must be 
inert to the compounds in the sample and must be selected on a case-by-
case basis.
    6.1.1.1  Other routine sampling supplies needed include waterproof 
marking pens, tubing, scrappers/spatulas, clean rags, paper towels, 
cooler/ice, long handle tongs, and mixing/stirring paddles.
    6.1.2  Personal safety equipment needed includes eye protection, 
respiratory protection, a hard hat, gloves, steel toe shoes, etc.
    6.1.3  Shipping supplies needed include shipping boxes, packing 
material, shipping labels, strapping tape, etc.
    6.1.4  Data recording forms and labels needed include coating data 
sheets and sample can labels.

    Note: The actual requirements will depend upon the conditions 
existing at the source sampled.

    6.2  Laboratory Equipment and Supplies.
    6.2.1  Gas Chromatograph (GC). Any instrument equipped with a flame 
ionization detector and capable of being temperature programmed may be 
used. Optionally, other types of detectors (e.g., a mass spectrometer), 
and any necessary interfaces, may be used provided that the detector 
system yields an appropriate and reproducible response to the analytes 
in the injected sample. Autosampler injection may be used, if available.
    6.2.2  Recorder. If available, an electronic data station or 
integrator may be used to record the gas chromatogram and associated 
data. If a strip chart recorder is used, it must

[[Page 755]]

meet the following criteria: A 1 to 10 millivolt (mV) linear response 
with a full scale response time of 2 seconds or less and a maximum noise 
level of <plus-minus>0.03 percent of full scale. Other types of 
recorders may be used as appropriate to the specific detector installed 
provided that the recorder has a full scale response time of 2 seconds 
or less and a maximum noise level of <plus-minus>0.03 percent of full 
scale.
    6.2.3  Column. The column must be constructed of materials that do 
not react with components of the sample (e.g., fused silica, stainless 
steel, glass). The column should be of appropriate physical dimensions 
(e.g., length, internal diameter) and contain sufficient suitable 
stationary phase to allow separation of the analytes. DB-5, DB-Wax, and 
FFAP columns are commonly used for paint analysis; however, it is the 
responsibility of each analyst to select appropriate columns and 
stationary phases.
    6.2.4  Tube and Tube Fittings. Supplies to connect the GC and gas 
cylinders.
    6.2.5  Pressure Regulators. Devices used to regulate the pressure 
between gas cylinders and the GC.
    6.2.6  Flow Meter. A device used to determine the carrier gas flow 
rate through the GC. Either a digital flow meter or a soap film bubble 
meter may be used to measure gas flow rates.
    6.2.7  Septa. Seals on the GC injection port through which liquid or 
gas samples can be injected using a syringe.
    6.2.8  Liquid Charging Devices. Devices used to inject samples into 
the GC such as clean and graduated 1, 5, and 10 microliter (<greek-m>l) 
capacity syringes.
    6.2.9  Vials. Containers that can be sealed with a septum in which 
samples may be prepared or stored. The recommended size is 25 ml 
capacity. Mininert<SUP></SUP> valves have been found satisfactory and 
are available from Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Illinois.
    6.2.10  Balance. Device used to determine the weights of standards 
and samples. An analytical balance capable of accurately weighing to 
0.0001 g is required.

                        7. Reagents and Standards

    7.1  Purity of Reagents. Reagent grade chemicals shall be used in 
all tests. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents shall conform to the 
specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American 
Chemical Society, where such specifications are available. Other grades 
may be used provided it is first ascertained that the reagent is of 
sufficient purity to permit its use without lessening the accuracy of 
determination.
    7.2  Carrier Gas. Helium carrier gas shall have a purity of 99.995 
percent or higher. High purity nitrogen may also be used. Other carrier 
gases that are appropriate for the column system and analyte may also be 
used. Ultra-high purity grade hydrogen gas and zero-grade air shall be 
used for the flame ionization detector.
    7.3  Dimethylformamide (DMF). Solvent for all standards and samples. 
Some other suitable solvent may be used if DMF is not compatible with 
the sample or coelutes with a target analyte.

    Note: DMF may coelute with ethylbenzene or p-xylene under the 
conditions described in the note under Section 6.2.3.

    7.4  Internal Standard Materials. The internal standard material is 
used in the quantitation of the analytes for this method. It shall be 
gas chromatography spectrophotometric quality or, if this grade is not 
available, the highest quality available. Obtain the assay for the 
internal standard material and maintain at that purity during use. The 
recommended internal standard material is 1-propanol; however, selection 
of an appropriate internal standard material for the particular coating 
and GC conditions used is the responsibility of each analyst.
    7.5  Reference Standard Materials. The reference standard materials 
are the chemicals cited in Section 1.1 which are of known identity and 
purity and which are used to assist in the identification and 
quantification of the analytes of this method. They shall be the highest 
quality available. Obtain the assays for the reference standard 
materials and maintain at those purities during use.
    7.6  Stock Reference Standards. Stock reference standards are 
dilutions of the reference standard materials that may be used on a 
daily basis to prepare calibration standards, calibration check 
standards, and quality control check standards. Stock reference 
standards may be prepared from the reference standard materials or 
purchased as certified solutions.
    7.6.1  Stock reference standards should be prepared in 
dimethylformamide for each analyte expected in the coating samples to be 
analyzed. The concentrations of analytes in the stock reference 
standards are not specified but must be adequate to prepare the 
calibration standards required in the method. A stock reference standard 
may contain more than one analyte provided all analytes are chemically 
compatible and no analytes coelute. The actual concentrations prepared 
must be known to within 0.1 percent (e.g., 0.1000 <plus-minus> 0.0001 g/
g solution). The following procedure is suggested. Place about 35 ml of 
dimethylformamide into a tared ground-glass stoppered 50 ml volumetric 
flask. Weigh the flask to the nearest 0.1 mg. Add 12.5 g of the 
reference standard material and reweigh the flask. Dilute to volume with 
dimethylformamide and reweigh. Stopper the flask and mix the contents by 
inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in grams 
per

[[Page 756]]

gram of solution from the net gain in weights, correcting for the 
assayed purity of the reference standard material.

    Note: Although a glass-stoppered volumetric flask is convenient, any 
suitable glass container may be used because stock reference standards 
are prepared by weight.

    7.6.2  Transfer the stock reference standard solution into one or 
more Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store, with minimal headspace, at 
-10 deg.C to 0 deg.C and protect from light.
    7.6.3  Prepare fresh stock reference standards every six months, or 
sooner if analysis results from daily calibration check standards 
indicate a problem. Fresh stock reference standards for very volatile 
HAP's may have to be prepared more frequently.
    7.7  Calibration Standards. Calibration standards are used to 
determine the response of the detector to known amounts of reference 
material. Calibration standards must be prepared at a minimum of three 
concentration levels from the stock reference standards (see Section 
7.6). Prepare the calibration standards in dimethylformamide (see 
Section 7.3). The lowest concentration standard should contain a 
concentration of analyte equivalent either to a concentration of no more 
than 0.01% of the analyte in a coating or to a concentration that is 
lower than the actual concentration of the analyte in the coating, 
whichever concentration is higher. The highest concentration standard 
should contain a concentration of analyte equivalent to slightly more 
than the highest concentration expected for the analyte in a coating. 
The remaining calibration standard should contain a concentration of 
analyte roughly at the midpoint of the range defined by the lowest and 
highest concentration calibration standards. The concentration range of 
the standards should thus correspond to the expected range of analyte 
concentrations in the prepared coating samples (see Section 11.5). Each 
calibration standard should contain each analyte for detection by this 
method expected in the actual coating samples (e.g., some or all of the 
compounds listed in Section 1.1 may be included). Each calibration 
standard should also contain an appropriate amount of internal standard 
material (response for the internal standard material is within 25 to 75 
percent of full scale on the attenuation setting for the particular 
reference standard concentration level). Calibration Standards should be 
stored for 1 week only in sealed vials with minimal headspace. If the 
stock reference standards were prepared as specified in Section 7.6, the 
calibration standards may be prepared by either weighing each addition 
of the stock reference standard or by adding known volumes of the stock 
reference standard and calculating the mass of the standard reference 
material added. Alternative 1 (Section 7.7.1) specifies the procedure to 
be followed when the stock reference standard is added by volume. 
Alternative 2 (Section 7.7.2) specifies the procedure to be followed 
when the stock reference standard is added by weight.

    Note: To assist with determining the appropriate amount of internal 
standard to add, as required here and in other sections of this method, 
the analyst may find it advantageous to prepare a curve showing the area 
response versus the amount of internal standard injected into the GC.

    7.7.1  Preparation Alternative 1. Determine the amount of each stock 
reference standard and dimethylformamide solvent needed to prepare 
approximately 25 ml of the specific calibration concentration level 
desired. To a tared 25 ml vial that can be sealed with a crimp-on or 
Mininert<SUP></SUP> valve, add the total amount of dimethylformamide 
calculated to be needed. As quickly as practical, add the calculated 
amount of each stock reference standard using new pipets (or pipet tips) 
for each stock reference standard. Reweigh the vial and seal it. Using 
the known weights of the standard reference materials per ml in the 
stock reference standards, the volumes added, and the total weight of 
all reagents added to the vial, calculate the weight percent of each 
standard reference material in the calibration standard prepared. Repeat 
this process for each calibration standard to be prepared.
    7.7.2  Preparation Alternative 2. Determine the amount of each stock 
reference standard and dimethylformamide solvent needed to prepare 
approximately 25 ml of the specific calibration concentration level 
desired. To a tared 25 ml vial that can be sealed with a crimp-on or 
Mininert<SUP></SUP> valve, add the total amount of dimethylformamide 
calculated to be needed. As quickly as practical, add the calculated 
amount of a stock reference standard using a new pipet (or pipet tip) 
and reweigh the vial. Repeat this process for each stock reference 
standard to be added. Seal the vial after obtaining the final weight. 
Using the known weight percents of the standard reference materials in 
the stock reference standards, the weights of the stock reference 
standards added, and the total weight of all reagents added to the vial, 
calculate the weight percent of each standard reference material in the 
calibration standard prepared. Repeat this process for each calibration 
standard to be prepared.

       8. Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage

    8.1  Copies of material safety data sheets (MSDS's) for each sample 
should be obtained prior to sampling. The MSDS's contain information on 
the ingredients, and physical and chemical properties data. The MSDS's 
also

[[Page 757]]

contain recommendations for proper handling or required safety 
precautions. Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include 
information relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, 
but not limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, 
injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.
    8.2  A copy of the blender's worksheet can be requested to obtain 
data on the exact coating being sampled. A blank coating data sheet form 
(see Section 18) may also be used. The manufacturer's formulation 
information from the product data sheet should also be obtained.
    8.3  Prior to sample collection, thoroughly mix the coating to 
ensure that a representative, homogeneous sample is obtained. It is 
preferred that this be accomplished using a coating can shaker or 
similar device; however, when necessary, this may be accomplished using 
mechanical agitation or circulation systems.
    8.3.1  Water-thinned coatings tend to incorporate or entrain air 
bubbles if stirred too vigorously; mix these types of coatings slowly 
and only as long as necessary to homogenize.
    8.3.2  Each component of multicomponent coatings that harden when 
mixed must be sampled separately. The component mix ratios must be 
obtained at the facility at the time of sampling and submitted to the 
analytical laboratory.
    8.4  Sample Collection. Samples must be collected in a manner that 
prevents or minimizes loss of volatile components and that does not 
contaminate the coating reservoir. A suggested procedure is as follows. 
Select a sample collection container which has a capacity at least 25 
percent greater than the container in which the sample is to be 
transported. Make sure both sample containers are clean and dry. Using 
clean, long-handled tongs, turn the sample collection container upside 
down and lower it into the coating reservoir. The mouth of the sample 
collection container should be at approximately the midpoint of the 
reservoir (do not take the sample from the top surface). Turn the sample 
collection container over and slowly bring it to the top of the coating 
reservoir. Rapidly pour the collected coating into the sample container, 
filling it completely. It is important to fill the sample container 
completely to avoid any loss of volatiles due to volatilization into the 
headspace. Return any unused coating to the reservoir or dispose as 
appropriate.

    Note: If a company requests a set of samples for its own analysis, a 
separate set of samples, using new sample containers, should be taken at 
the same time.

    8.5  Once the sample is collected, place the sample container on a 
firm surface and insert the inner seal in the container by placing the 
seal inside the rim of the container, inverting a screw cap, and 
pressing down on the screw cap which will evenly force the inner seal 
into the container for a tight fit. Using clean towels or rags, remove 
all residual coating material from the outside of the sample container 
after inserting the inner seal. Screw the cap onto the container.
    8.5.1  Affix a sample label (see Section 18) clearly identifying the 
sample, date collected, and person collecting the sample.
    8.5.2  Prepare the sample for transportation to the laboratory. The 
sample should be maintained at the coating's recommended storage 
temperature specified on the Material Safety Data Sheet, or, if no 
temperature is specified, the sample should be maintained within the 
range of 5 deg.C to 38 deg.C.
    8.9  The shipping container should adhere to U.S. Department of 
Transportation specification DOT 12-B. Coating samples are considered 
hazardous materials; appropriate shipping procedures should be followed.

                           9. Quality Control

    9.1  Laboratories using this method should operate a formal quality 
control program. The minimum requirements of the program should consist 
of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing 
analysis of blanks and quality control samples to evaluate and document 
quality data. The laboratory must maintain records to document the 
quality of the data generated. When results indicate atypical method 
performance, a quality control check standard (see Section 9.4) must be 
analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-
control mode of operation.
    9.2  Before processing any samples, the analyst must demonstrate, 
through analysis of a reagent blank, that there are no interferences 
from the analytical system, glassware, and reagents that would bias the 
sample analysis results. Each time a set of analytical samples is 
processed or there is a change in reagents, a reagent blank should be 
processed as a safeguard against chronic laboratory contamination. The 
blank samples should be carried through all stages of the sample 
preparation and measurement steps.
    9.3  Required instrument quality control parameters are found in the 
following sections:
    9.3.1  Baseline stability must be demonstrated to be <ls-thn-eq>5 
percent of full scale using the procedures given in Section 10.1.
    9.3.2  The GC calibration is not valid unless the retention time 
(RT) for each analyte at each concentration is within <plus-minus>0.05 
min of the retention time measured for that analyte in the stock 
standard.
    9.3.3  The retention time (RT) of any sample analyte must be within 
<plus-minus>0.05 min of the average RT of the analyte in the calibration

[[Page 758]]

standards for the analyte to be considered tentatively identified.
    9.3.4  The GC system must be calibrated as specified in Section 
10.2.
    9.3.5  A one-point daily calibration check must be performed as 
specified in Section 10.3.
    9.4  To establish the ability to generate results having acceptable 
accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following 
operations.
    9.4.1  Prepare a quality control check standard (QCCS) containing 
each analyte expected in the coating samples at a concentration expected 
to result in a response between 25 percent and 75 percent of the limits 
of the calibration curve when the sample is prepared as described in 
Section 11.5. The QCCS may be prepared from reference standard materials 
or purchased as certified solutions. If prepared in the laboratory, the 
QCCS must be prepared independently from the calibration standards.
    9.4.2  Analyze three aliquots of the QCCS according to the method 
beginning in Section 11.5.3 and calculate the weight percent of each 
analyte using Equation 1, Section 12.
    9.4.3  Calculate the mean weight percent (X) for each analyte from 
the three results obtained in Section 9.4.2.
    9.4.4  Calculate the percent accuracy for each analyte using the 
known concentrations (Ti) in the QCCS using Equation 3, Section 12.
    9.4.5  Calculate the percent relative standard deviation (percent 
RSD) for each analyte using Equation 7, Section 12, substituting the 
appropriate values for the relative response factors (RRF's) in said 
equation.
    9.4.6  If the percent accuracy (Section 9.4.4) for all analytes is 
within the range 90 percent to 110 percent and the percent RSD (Section 
9.4.5) for all analytes is <ls-thn-eq>20 percent, system performance is 
acceptable and sample analysis may begin. If these criteria are not met 
for any analyte, then system performance is not acceptable for that 
analyte and the test must be repeated for those analytes only. Repeated 
failures indicate a general problem with the measurement system that 
must be located and corrected. In this case, the entire test, beginning 
at Section 9.4.1, must be repeated after the problem is corrected.
    9.5  Great care must be exercised to maintain the integrity of all 
standards. It is recommended that all standards be stored at -10  deg.C 
to 0  deg.C in screw-cap amber glass bottles with Teflon liners.
    9.6  Unless otherwise specified, all weights are to be recorded 
within 0.1 mg.

                  10. Calibration and Standardization.

    10.1  Column Baseline Drift. Before each calibration and series of 
determinations and before the daily calibration check, condition the 
column using procedures developed by the laboratory or as specified by 
the column supplier. Operate the GC at initial (i.e., before sample 
injection) conditions on the lowest attenuation to be used during sample 
analysis. Adjust the recorder pen to zero on the chart and obtain a 
baseline for at least one minute. Initiate the GC operating cycle that 
would be used for sample analysis. On the recorder chart, mark the pen 
position at the end of the simulated sample analysis cycle. Baseline 
drift is defined as the absolute difference in the pen positions at the 
beginning and end of the cycle in the direction perpendicular to the 
chart movement. Calculate the percent baseline drift by dividing the 
baseline drift by the chart width representing full-scale deflection and 
multiply the result by 100.
    10.2  Calibration of GC. Bring all stock standards and calibration 
standards to room temperature while establishing the GC at the 
determined operating conditions.
    10.2.1  Retention Times (RT's) for Individual Compounds.

    Note: The procedures of this subsection are required only for the 
initial calibration. However, it is good laboratory practice to follow 
these procedures for some or all analytes before each calibration. The 
procedures were written for chromatograms output to a strip chart 
recorder. More modern instruments (e.g., integrators and electronic data 
stations) determine and print out or display retention times 
automatically.

    The RT for each analyte should be determined before calibration. 
This provides a positive identification for each peak observed from the 
calibration standards. Inject an appropriate volume (see Note in Section 
11.5.2) of one of the stock reference standards into the gas 
chromatograph and record on the chart the pen position at the time of 
the injection (see Section 7.6.1). Dilute an aliquot of the stock 
reference standard as required in dimethylformamide to achieve a 
concentration that will result in an on-scale response. Operate the gas 
chromatograph according to the determined procedures. Select the peak(s) 
that correspond to the analyte(s) [and internal standard, if used] and 
measure the retention time(s). If a chart recorder is used, measure the 
distance(s) on the chart from the injection point to the peak maxima. 
These distances, divided by the chart speed, are defined as the RT's of 
the analytes in question. Repeat this process for each of the stock 
reference standard solutions.

    Note: If gas chromatography with mass spectrometer detection (GC-MS) 
is used, a stock reference standard may contain a group of analytes, 
provided all analytes are adequately separated during the analysis. Mass 
spectral library matching can be used to identify the analyte associated 
with each peak in the gas chromatogram. The retention time for the 
analyte then becomes the

[[Page 759]]

retention time of its peak in the chromatogram.

    10.2.2  Calibration. The GC must be calibrated using a minimum of 
three concentration levels of each potential analyte. (See Section 7.7 
for instructions on preparation of the calibration standards.) Beginning 
with the lowest concentration level calibration standard, carry out the 
analysis procedure as described beginning in Section 11.7. Repeat the 
procedure for each progressively higher concentration level until all 
calibration standards have been analyzed.
    10.2.2.1  Calculate the RT's for the internal standard and for each 
analyte in the calibration standards at each concentration level as 
described in Section 10.2.1. The RT's for the internal standard must not 
vary by more than 0.10 minutes. Identify each analyte by comparison of 
the RT's for peak maxima to the RT's determined in Section 10.2.1.
    10.2.2.2  Compare the retention times (RT's) for each potential 
analyte in the calibration standards for each concentration level to the 
retention times determined in Section 10.2.1. The calibration is not 
valid unless all RT's for all analytes meet the criteria given in 
Section 9.3.2.
    10.2.2.3  Tabulate the area responses and the concentrations for the 
internal standard and each analyte in the calibration standards. 
Calculate the response factor for the internal standard 
(RF<INF>is</INF>) and the response factor for each compound relative to 
the internal standard (RRF) for each concentration level using Equations 
5 and 6, Section 12.
    10.2.2.4  Using the RRF's from the calibration, calculate the 
percent relative standard deviation (percent RSD) for each analyte in 
the calibration standard using Equation 7, Section 12. The percent RSD 
for each individual calibration analyte must be less than 15 percent. 
This criterion must be met in order for the calibration to be valid. If 
the criterion is met, the mean RRF's determined above are to be used 
until the next calibration.
    10.3  Daily Calibration Checks. The calibration curve (Section 
10.2.2) must be checked and verified at least once each day that samples 
are analyzed. This is accomplished by analyzing a calibration standard 
that is at a concentration near the midpoint of the working range and 
performing the checks in Sections 10.3.1, 10.3.2, and 10.3.3.
    10.3.1  For each analyte in the calibration standard, calculate the 
percent difference in the RRF from the last calibration using Equation 
8, Section 12. If the percent difference for each calibration analyte is 
less than 10 percent, the last calibration curve is assumed to be valid. 
If the percent difference for any analyte is greater than 5 percent, the 
analyst should consider this a warning limit. If the percent difference 
for any one calibration analyte exceeds 10 percent, corrective action 
must be taken. If no source of the problem can be determined after 
corrective action has been taken, a new three-point (minimum) 
calibration must be generated. This criterion must be met before 
quantitative analysis begins.
    10.3.2  If the RF<INF>is</INF> for the internal standard changes by 
more than <plus-minus>20 percent from the last daily calibration check, 
the system must be inspected for malfunctions and corrections made as 
appropriate.
    10.3.3  The retention times for the internal standard and all 
calibration check analytes must be evaluated. If the retention time for 
the internal standard or for any calibration check analyte changes by 
more than 0.10 min from the last calibration, the system must be 
inspected for malfunctions and corrections made as required.

                              11. Procedure

    11.1  All samples and standards must be allowed to warm to room 
temperature before analysis. Observe the given order of ingredient 
addition to minimize loss of volatiles.
    11.2  Bring the GC system to the determined operating conditions and 
condition the column as described in Section 10.1.

    Note: The temperature of the injection port may be an especially 
critical parameter.Information about the proper temperature may be found 
on the CPDS.

    11.3  Perform the daily calibration checks as described in Section 
10.3. Samples are not to be analyzed until the criteria in Section 10.3 
are met.
    11.4  Place the as-received coating sample on a paint shaker, or 
similar device, and shake the sample for a minimum of 5 minutes to 
achieve homogenization.
    11.5  Note: The steps in this section must be performed rapidly and 
without interruption to avoid loss of volatile organics. These steps 
must be performed in a laboratory hood free from solvent vapors. All 
weights must be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mg.
    11.5.1  Add 16 g of dimethylformamide to each of two tared vials (A 
and B) capable of being septum sealed.
    11.5.2  To each vial add a weight of coating that will result in the 
response for the major constituent being in the upper half of the linear 
range of the calibration curve.

    Note: The magnitude of the response obviously depends on the amount 
of sample injected into the GC as specified in Section 11.8. This volume 
must be the same as used for preparation of the calibration curve, 
otherwise shifts in compound retention times may occur. If a sample is 
prepared that results in a response outside the limits of the 
calibration curve, new samples must be prepared; changing the volume 
injected to bring the response within the calibration curve limits is 
not permitted.


[[Page 760]]


    11.5.3  Add a weight of internal standard to each vial (A and B) 
that will result in the response for the internal standard being between 
25 percent and 75 percent of the linear range of the calibration curve.
    11.5.4  Seal the vials with crimp-on or Mininert<Register> septum 
seals.
    11.6  Shake the vials containing the prepared coating samples for 60 
seconds. Allow the vials to stand undisturbed for ten minutes. If solids 
have not settled out on the bottom after 10 minutes, then centrifuge at 
1,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The analyst also has the option of injecting 
the sample without allowing the solids to settle.
    11.7  Analyses should be conducted in the following order: daily 
calibration check sample, method blank, up to 10 injections from sample 
vials (i.e., one injection each from up to five pairs of vials, which 
corresponds to analysis of 5 coating samples).
    11.8  Inject the prescribed volume of supernatant from the 
calibration check sample, the method blank, and the sample vials onto 
the chromatographic column and record the chromatograms while operating 
the system under the specified operating conditions.
    Note: The analyst has the option of injecting the unseparated 
sample.

                   12. Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Qualitative Analysis. An analyte (e.g., those cited in Section 
1.1) is considered tentatively identified if two criteria are satisfied: 
(1) elution of the sample analyte within <plus-minus>0.05 min of the 
average GC retention time of the same analyte in the calibration 
standard; and (2) either (a) confirmation of the identity of the 
compound by spectral matching on a gas chromatograph equipped with a 
mass selective detector or (b) elution of the sample analyte within 
<plus-minus>0.05 min of the average GC retention time of the same 
analyte in the calibration standard analyzed on a dissimilar GC column.
    12.1.1 The RT of the sample analyte must meet the criteria specified 
in Section 9.3.3.
    12.1.2 When doubt exists as to the identification of a peak or the 
resolution of two or more components possibly comprising one peak, 
additional confirmatory techniques (listed in Section 12.1) must be 
used.
    12.2 Quantitative Analysis. When an analyte has been identified, the 
quantification of that compound will be based on the internal standard 
technique.
    12.2.1 A single analysis consists of one injection from each of two 
sample vials (A and B) prepared using the same coating. Calculate the 
concentration of each identified analyte in the sample as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.003

    12.2.2 Report results for duplicate analysis (sample vials A and B) 
without correction.
    12.3 Precision Data. Calculate the percent difference between the 
measured concentrations of each analyte in vials A and B as follows.
    12.3.1 Calculate the weight percent of the analyte in each of the 
two sample vials as described in Section 12.2.1.
    12.3.2 Calculate the percent difference for each analyte as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.004
    
where A<INF>i</INF> and B<INF>i</INF> are the measured concentrations of 
the analyte in vials A and B.
    12.4 Calculate the percent accuracy for analytes in the QCCS (See 
Section 9.4) as follows:

[[Page 761]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.005

where X<INF>x</INF> is the mean measured value and T<INF>x</INF> is the 
known true value of the analyte in the QCCS.
    12.5 Obtain retention times (RT's) from data station or integrator 
or, for chromatograms from a chart recorder, calculate the RT's for 
analytes in the calibration standards (See Section 10.2.2.2) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.006

    12.6 Calculate the response factor for the internal standard (See 
Section 10.2.2.3) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.007

where:
    A<INF>is</INF> = Area response of the internal standard.
    C<INF>is</INF> = Weight percent of the internal standard.
    12.7 Calculate the relative response factors for analytes in the 
calibration standards (See Section 10.2.2.3) as follows:
where:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.008

    RRF<INF>x</INF> = Relative response factor for an individual 
analyte.
    A<INF>x</INF> = Area response of the analyte being measured.
    C<INF>x</INF> = Weight percent of the analyte being measured.
    12.8 Calculate the percent relative standard deviation of the 
relative response factors for analytes in the calibration standards (See 
Section 10.2.2.4) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07DE95.009

    12.9 Calculate the percent difference in the relative response 
factors between the calibration curve and the daily calibration checks 
(See Section 10.3) as follows:

    16. Waste Management
    16.1 The coating samples and laboratory standards and reagents may 
contain compounds which require management as hazardous waste. It is the 
laboratory's responsibility to ensure all wastes are managed in 
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
    16.2 To avoid excessive laboratory waste, obtain only enough sample 
for laboratory analysis.
    16.3 It is recommended that discarded waste coating solids, used 
rags, used paper towels, and other nonglass or nonsharp waste materials 
be placed in a plastic bag before disposal. A separate container, 
designated ``For Sharp Objects Only,'' is recommended for collection of 
discarded glassware and other sharp-edge items used in the laboratory. 
It is recommended that unused or excess samples and reagents be placed 
in a solvent-resistant plastic or metal container with a lid or cover 
designed for flammable liquids. This container should not be stored in 
the area where analytical work is performed. It is recommended that a 
record be kept of all compounds placed in the container for 
identification of the contents upon disposal.

Method 312A--Determination of Styrene in Latex Styrene-Butadiene Rubber, 
                       Through Gas Chromatography

                        1.  Scope and Application

    1.1  This method describes a procedure for determining parts per 
million (ppm) styrene monomer (CAS No. 100-42-5) in aqueous samples, 
including latex samples and styrene stripper water.
    1.2  The sample is separated in a gas chromatograph equipped with a 
packed column and a flame ionization detector.

                         2.0  Summary of Method

    2.1  This method utilizes a packed column gas chromatograph with a 
flame ionization detector to determine the concentration of residual 
styrene in styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) latex samples.

                            3.0  Definitions

    3.1  The definitions are included in the text as needed.

                           4.0  Interferences

    4.1  In order to reduce matrix effects and emulsify the styrene, 
similar styrene free latex is added to the internal standard. There are 
no known interferences.
    4.2  The operating parameters are selected to obtain resolution 
necessary to determine styrene monomer concentrations in latex.

                               5.0  Safety

    5.1  It is the responsibility of the user of this procedure to 
establish appropriate safety and health practices.

date and time.

[[Page 768]]

                          9.0  Quality Control

    9.1  The instrument is calibrated by injecting calibration solution 
(Section 7.2 of this method) five times.
    9.2  The retention time for components of interest and relative 
response of monomer to the internal standard is determined.
    9.3  Recovery efficiency must be determined once for each sample 
type and whenever modifications are made to the method.
    9.3.1  A set of six latex samples shall be collected. Two samples 
shall be prepared for analysis from each sample. Each sample shall be 
analyzed in duplicate.
    9.3.2  The second set of six latex samples shall be analyzed in 
duplicate before spiking each sample with approximately 1000 ppm 
styrene. The spiked samples shall be analyzed in duplicate.
    9.3.3  For each hydrocarbon, calculate the average recovery 
efficiency (R) using the following equations:

    where:
    R=<greek-S>(R<INF>n</INF>)/6

    where:
    R<INF>n</INF>=(c<INF>ns</INF>-c<INF>v</INF>)/S<INF>n</INF>

    n=sample number
    c<INF>ns</INF>=concentration of compound measured in spiked sample 
number n.
    c<INF>nu</INF>= concentration of compound measured in unspiked 
sample number n.
    S<INF>n</INF>=theoretical concentration of compound spiked into 
sample n.
    9.3.4  A value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.3.5  R is used to correct all reported results for each compound 
by dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type.

method:

    ppm styrene = A x D

    Where:
    A = ``ppm'' readout from computer
    D = dilution factor (10 for latex samples)

    12.2  For samples that are prepared as in section 11.2.2 of this 
method, ppm styrene is read directly from the computer.

                        13.0  Method Performance

    13.1  This test has a standard deviation (1) of 3.3 ppm at 100 ppm 
styrene. The average Spike Recovery from six samples at 1000 ppm Styrene 
was 96.7 percent. The test method was validated using 926 ppm styrene 
standard. Six analysis of the same standard provided average 97.7 
percent recovery. Note: These are example recoveries and do not replace 
quality assurance procedures in this method.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    9.1  For each sample type, 12 samples of SBR latex shall be obtained 
from the process for the recovery study. Half the vials and caps shall 
be tared, labeled ``spiked'', and numbered 1 through 6. The other vials

through 6.
    9.2  The six vials labeled ``spiked'' shall be spiked with an amount 
of styrene to approximate 50% of the solution's expected residual 
styrene level.
    9.3  The spiked samples shall be shaken for several hours and 
allowed to cool to room temperature before analysis.
    9.4  The six samples of unspiked solution shall be coagulated and a 
mean styrene value shall be determined, along with the standard 
deviation, and the percent relative standard deviation.
    9.5  The six samples of the spiked solution shall be coagulated and 
the results of the analyses shall be determined using the following 
equations:

    M<INF>r</INF>=M<INF>s</INF>-M<INF>u</INF>
    R=M<INF>r</INF>/S

    where:
    M<INF>u</INF>=Mean value of styrene in the unspiked sample
    M<INF>s</INF>=Measured amount of styrene in the spiked sample
    M<INF>r</INF>=Measured amount of the spiked compound
    S=Amount of styrene added to the spiked sample
    R=Fraction of spiked styrene recovered

    9.6  A value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.7  R is used to correct all reported results for each compound by

internal standard solution into the 2-oz bottle.
    11.3  Cap the bottle. Using a mechanical shaker, shake the bottle 
for at least one minute or until coagulation of the latex is complete as 
indicated by a clear solvent.
    11.4  Using the conditions prescribed (section 6.5 of this method),

method.

                             13.0  Precision

    13.1  Precision for the method was determined at the 80, 144, 590, 
and 1160 ppm levels. The standard deviations were 0.8, 1.5, 5 and 9 ppm 
respectively. The percent relative standard deviations (%RSD) were 1% or 
less at all levels. Five degrees of freedom were used for all precision 
data except at the 80 ppm level, where nine degrees of freedom were 
used. Note: These are example results and do not replace quality 
assurance procedures in this method.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    9.1  The laboratory is required to operate a formal quality control 
program. This consists of an initial demonstration of the capability of 
the method as well as ongoing analysis of standards, blanks, and spiked 
samples to demonstrate continued performance.
    9.1.1  When the method is first set up, a calibration is run and the 
recovery efficiency for each type of sample must be determined.
    9.1.2  If new types of samples are being analyzed, then recovery 
efficiency for each new type of sample must be determined. New type 
includes any change, such as polymer type, physical form or a 
significant change in the composition of the matrix.
    9.2  Recovery efficiency must be determined once for each sample 
type and whenever modifications are made to the method.
    9.2.1 In determining the recovery efficiency, the quadruplet 
sampling system shall be used. Six sets of samples (for a total of 24) 
shall be taken. In each quadruplet set, half of the samples (two out of 
the four) shall be spiked with styrene.
    9.2.2 Prepare the samples as described in section 8 of this method. 
To the vials labeled ``spiked'', add a known amount of styrene that is 
expected to be present in the latex.
    9.2.3 Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. 
Record the concentrations of styrene reported for each pair of spiked 
and unspiked samples with the same vial number.
    9.2.4 For each hydrocarbon, calculate the average recovery 
efficiency (R) using the following equation:

    R=<greek-S>(R<INF>n</INF>)/12
    Where: n = sample number
    R<INF>n</INF>=(M<INF>s</INF>-M<INF>u</INF>)/S
    M<INF>s</INF>=total mass of compound (styrene) measured in spiked 
sample (<greek-m>g)
    M<INF>u</INF>=total mass of compound (styrene) measured in unspiked 
sample (<greek-m>g)
    S=theoretical mass of compound (styrene) spiked into sample 
(<greek-m>g)
    R=fraction of spiked compound (styrene) recovered

    9.2.5  A different R value should be obtained for each sample type. 
A value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.2.6 R  is used to correct all reported results for each compound 
by dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type.

                            10.0  Calibration

    A styrene control sample will be tested weekly to confirm the FID 
response and calibration.

    10.1  Using the Styrene Certification Solution prepared in 7.8.1, 
perform test analysis as described in 7.8.2 using the equation in 
7.8.2.3 to calculate results.
    10.2  Calculate the weight of styrene in the styrene control sample 
using the following equation:

    W<INF>sty</INF>=(F<INF>x</INF> xA<INF>sty</INF> 
xW<INF>is</INF>)A<INF>is</INF>

    The instrument can be considered calibrated if the weight of the 
styrene analyzed is within range of 0.00097--0.00103gms.

                             11.0  Procedure

    11.1  Using an auto pipet, add 25ml of Internal Standard Solution to 
a 4 oz. wide-mouth bottle.
    11.2  Using a calibrated auto pipet, add 5.0 <plus-minus> 0.01g 
latex to the bottle containing the 25ml of Internal Standard Solution.
    11.3  Cap the bottle and place on the wrist action shaker. Shake the 
sample for a minimum of five minutes using the timer on the shaker. 
Remove from shaker.
    11.4  Using a disposable pipet, fill the 2ml sample vial with the 
clear alcohol extract. (If the extract is not clear, it should be 
filtered using a funnel and filter paper.) Cap and seal the vial.
    11.5  Place the sample in the autosampler tray and start the GC and 
Integrator. The sample will be injected into the GC by the auto-
injector, and the Integrator will print the results.
    11.6  Gas Chromatograph Conditions

    Oven Temp--70  deg.C
    Injector Temp--225  deg.C
    Detector Temp--275  deg.C
    Helium Pressure--500 KPA

linked) 1 micrometer film thickness

                           12.0  Calculations

    12.1  The integrator is programmed to do the following calculation 
at the end of the analysis:

    %ResidualStyrene=(A<INF>x</INF> XW<INF>is</INF>)/(A<INF>is</INF> 
XW<INF>x</INF>)XF<INF>x</INF> X100

    Where:
    A<INF>x</INF>=Peak area of styrene
    A<INF>is</INF>=Peak area of internal standard

[[Page 773]]

    W<INF>x</INF>=Weight of sample = 5g
    W<INF>is</INF>=Weight of internal std. = 0.00125g
    F<INF>x</INF>=Analyzed response factor = 1.0

    12.2  The response factor is determined by analyzing a solution of 
0.02g of styrene and 0.02g of alpha methyl styrene in 100ml of 2-
propanol. Calculate the factor by the following equation:

    F<INF>x</INF>=(W<INF>x</INF> xA<INF>is</INF>)/(W<INF>is</INF> 
xA<INF>x</INF>)

    Where:
    W<INF>x</INF>=Weight of styrene
    A<INF>x</INF>=Peak area of styrene
    W<INF>is</INF>=Weight of alpha methyl styrene
    A<INF>is</INF>=Peak area of alpha methyl styrene

   Method 313A--Determination of Residual Hydrocarbons in Rubber Crumb

                       1.0  Scope and Application

    1.1  This method determines residual toluene and styrene in stripper 
crumb of the of the following types of rubber: polybutadiene (PBR) and 
styrene/butadiene rubber (SBR), both derived from solution 
polymerization processes that utilize toluene as the polymerization 
solvent.
    1.2  The method is applicable to a wide range of concentrations of 
toluene and styrene provided that calibration standards cover the 
desired range. It is applicable at least over the range of 0.01 to 10.0 
% residual toluene and from 0.1 to 3.0 % residual styrene. It is 
probably applicable over a wider range, but this must be verified prior 
to use.
    1.3  The method may also be applicable to other process samples as 
long as they are of a similar composition to stripper crumb. See section 
3.1 of this method for a description of stripper crumb.

                         2.0  Summary of Method

    2.1  The wet crumb is placed in a sealed vial and run on a headspace 
sampler which heats the vial to a specified temperature for a specific 
time and then injects a known volume of vapor into a capillary GC. The 
concentration of each component in the vapor is proportional to the 
level of that component in the crumb sample and does not depend on water 
content of the crumb.
    2.2  Identification of each component is performed by comparing the 
retention times to those of known standards.
    2.3  Results are calculated by the external standard method since 
injections are all performed in an identical manner. The response for 
each component is compared with that obtained from dosed samples of 
crumb.
    2.4  Measured results of each compound are corrected by dividing 
each by the average recovery efficiency determined for the same compound 
in the same sample type.

                            3.0  Definitions

    3.1  Stripper crumb refers to pieces of rubber resulting from the 
steam stripping of a toluene solution of the same polymer in a water 
slurry. The primary component of this will be polymer with lesser 
amounts of entrained water and residual toluene and other hydrocarbons. 
The amounts of hydrocarbons present must be such that the crumb is a 
solid material, generally less that 10 % of the dry rubber weight.

                           4.0  Interferences

    4.1  Contamination is not normally a problem since samples are 
sealed into vials immediately on sampling.
    4.2  Cross contamination in the headspace sampler should not be a 
problem if the correct sampler settings are used. This should be 
verified by running a blank sample immediately following a normal or 
high sample. Settings may be modified if necessary if this proves to be 
a problem, or a blank sample may be inserted between samples.
    4.3  Interferences may occur if volatile hydrocarbons are present 
which have retention times close to that of the components of interest. 
Since the solvent makeup of the processes involved are normally fairly 
well defined this should not be a problem. If it is found to be the 
case, switching to a different chromatographic column will probably 
resolve the situation.

                               5.0  Safety

    5.1  The chemicals specified in this method should all be handled 
according to standard laboratory practices as well as any special 
precautions that may be listed in the MSDS for that compound.
    5.2  Sampling of strippers or other process streams may involve high 
pressures and temperatures or may have the potential for exposure to 
chemical fumes. Only personnel who have been trained in the specific 
sampling procedures required for that process should perform this 
operation. An understanding of the process involved is necessary. Proper 
personal protective equipment should be worn. Any sampling devices 
should be inspected prior to use. A detailed sampling

[[Page 774]]

procedure which specifies exactly how to obtain the sample must be 
written and followed.

    7.3  Dry rubber of same type as the stripper crumb samples.

            8.0  Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    8.1  Collect a sample of crumb in a manner appropriate for the 
process equipment being sampled.
    8.1.1  If conditions permit, this may be done by passing a stream of 
the crumb slurry through a strainer, thus separating the crumb from the 
water. Allow the water to drain freely, do not attempt to squeeze any 
water from the crumb. Results will not depend on the exact water content 
of the samples. Immediately place several pieces of crumb directly into 
a headspace vial. This should be done with rubber gloves to protect the 
hands from both the heat and from contact with residual hydrocarbons. 
The vial should be between \1/4\ and \1/3\ full. Results do not depend 
on sample size as long as there is sufficient sample to reach an 
equilibrium vapor pressure in the headspace of the vial. Cap and seal 
the vial. Prepare each sample at least in duplicate. This is to minimize 
the effect of the variation that naturally occurs in the composition of 
non homogeneous crumb. The free water is not analyzed by this method and 
should be disposed of appropriately along with any unused rubber crumb.
    8.1.2  Alternatively the process can be sampled in a specially 
constructed sealed bomb which can then be transported to the laboratory. 
The bomb is then cooled to ambient temperature by applying a stream of 
running water. The bomb can then be opened and the crumb separated from 
the water and the vials filled as described in section 8.1.1 of this 
method. The bomb may be stored up to 8 hours prior to transferring the 
crumb into vials.
    8.2  The sealed headspace vials may be run immediately or may be 
stored up to 72 hours prior to running. It is possible that even longer 
storage times may be acceptable, but this must be verified for the 
particular type of sample being analyzed (see section 9.2.3 of this 
method). The main concern here is that some types of rubber eventually 
may flow, thus compacting the crumb so that the surface area is reduced. 
This may have some effect on the headspace equilibration.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    9.1  The laboratory is required to operate a formal quality control 
program. This consists of an initial demonstration of the capability of 
the method as well as ongoing analysis of standards, blanks and spiked 
samples to demonstrate continued performance.
    9.1.1  When the method is first set up a calibration is run 
(described in section 10 of this method) and an initial demonstration of 
method capability is performed (described in section 9.2 of this 
method). Also recovery efficiency for each type of sample must be 
determined (see section 9.4 of this method).
    9.1.2  It is permissible to modify this method in order to improve 
separations or make other improvements, provided that all performance 
specifications are met. Each time a modification to the method is made 
it is necessary to repeat the calibration (section 10 of this method), 
the demonstration of method performance (section 9.2 of this method) and 
the recovery efficiency for each type of sample (section 9.4 of this 
method).
    9.1.3  Ongoing performance should be monitored by running a spiked 
rubber standard. If this test fails to demonstrate that the analysis is 
in control, then corrective action must be taken. This method is 
described in section 9.3 of this method.
    9.1.4  If new types of samples are being analyzed then recovery 
efficiency for each new type of sample must be determined. New type 
includes any change, such as polymer

[[Page 775]]

type, physical form or a significant change in the composition of the 
matrix.
    9.2  Initial demonstration of method capability to establish the 
accuracy and precision of the method. This is to be run following the 
calibration described in section 10 of this method.
    9.2.1  Prepare a series of identical spiked rubber standards as 
described in section 9.3 of this method. A sufficient number to 
determine statistical information on the test should be run. Ten may be 
a suitable number, depending on the quality control methodology used at 
the laboratory running the tests. These are run in the same manner as 
unknown samples (see section 11 of this method).
    9.2.2  Determine mean and standard deviation for the results. Use 
these to determine the capability of the method and to calculate 
suitable control limits for the ongoing performance check which will 
utilize the same standards.
    9.2.3  Prepare several additional spiked rubber standards and run 2 
each day to determine the suitability of storage of the samples for 24, 
48 and 72 hours or longer if longer storage times are desired.
    9.3   A spiked rubber standard should be run on a regular basis to 
verify system performance. This would probably be done daily if samples 
are run daily. This is prepared in the same manner as the calibration 
standards (section 10.1 of this method), except that only one 
concentration of toluene and styrene is prepared. Choose concentrations 
of toluene and styrene that fall in the middle of the range expected in 
the stripper crumb and then do not change these unless there is a major 
change in the composition of the unknowns. If it becomes necessary to 
change the composition of this standard the initial performance 
demonstration must be repeated with the new standard (section 9.2 of 
this method).
    9.3.1  Each day prepare one spiked rubber standard to be run the 
following day. The dry rubber may be prepared in bulk and stored for any 
length of time consistent with the shelf life of the product. The 
addition of water and hydrocarbons must be performed daily and all the 
steps described under section 10.1 of this method must be followed.
    9.3.2  Run the spiked rubber standard prepared the previous day. 
Record the results and plot on an appropriate control chart or other 
means of determining statistical control.
    9.3.3  If the results for the standard indicate that the test is out 
of control then corrective action must be taken. This may include a 
check on procedures, instrument settings, maintenance or recalibration. 
Samples may be stored (see section 8.2 of this method) until compliance 
is demonstrated.
    9.4  Recovery efficiency must be determined once for each sample 
type and whenever modifications are made to the method.
    9.4.1  For each sample type collect 12 samples from the process 
(section 8.1 of this method). This should be done when the process is 
operating in a normal manner and residual hydrocarbon levels are in the 
normal range. Half the vials and caps should be tared, labeled 
``spiked'' and numbered 1 through 6. The other vials are labeled 
``unspiked'' and need not be tared but are also numbered 1 through 6. 
Immediately on sampling, the vials should be capped to prevent loss of 
volatiles. Allow all the samples to cool completely to ambient 
temperature. Reweigh each of the vials labeled ``spiked'' to determine 
the weight of wet crumb inside.
    9.4.2  The dry weight of rubber present in the wet crumb is 
estimated by multiplying the weight of wet crumb by the fraction of 
nonvolatiles typical for the sample. If this is not known, an additional 
quantity of crumb may be sampled, weighed, dried in an oven and 
reweighed to determine the fraction of volatiles and nonvolatiles prior 
to starting this procedure.
    9.4.3  To the vials labeled ``spiked'' add an amount of a mixture of 
toluene and styrene that is between 40 and 60 % of the amount expected 
in the crumb. This is done by removing the cap, adding the mixture by 
syringe, touching the tip of the needle to the sample in order to remove 
the drop and then immediately recapping the vials. The mixture is not 
added through the septum, because a punctured septum may leak and vent 
vapors as the vial is heated. The weights of toluene and styrene added 
may be calculated from the volumes of the mixture added, its composition 
and density, or may be determined by the weight of the vials and caps 
prior to and after addition. The exact dry weight of rubber present and 
the concentration of residual toluene and styrene are not known at this 
time so an exact calculation of the concentration of hydrocarbons is not 
possible until the test is completed.
    9.4.4  Place all the vials onto a shaker or tumbler for 24 
<plus-minus> 2 hours. This is essential in order for the hydrocarbons to 
be evenly distributed and completely absorbed into the rubber. If this 
is not followed the toluene and styrene will be mostly at the surface of 
the rubber and high results will be obtained.
    9.4.5  Remove the vials from the shaker and tap them so that all the 
crumb settles to the bottom of the vials. Allow them to stand for 1 hour 
prior to analysis to allow any liquid to drain fully to the bottom.
    9.4.6  Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. 
Record the concentrations of toluene and styrene reported for each pair 
of spiked and unspiked samples with the same vial number.
    9.4.7  Open each of the vials labeled ``spiked'', remove all the 
rubber crumb and

[[Page 776]]

place it into a tarred drying pan. Place in a 100 deg C oven for two 
hours, cool and reweigh. Subtract the weight of the tare to give the dry 
weight of rubber in each spiked vial. Calculate the concentration of 
toluene and styrene spiked into each vial as percent of dry rubber 
weight. This will be slightly different for each vial since the weights 
of dry rubber will be different.
    9.4.8  For each hydrocarbon calculate the average recovery 
efficiency (R) using the following equations:

    R=R__<greek-S>(P<INF>n</INF>)/6 (average of the 6 individual 
R<INF>n</INF> values)

    Where:
    R<INF>n</INF>=(C<INF>ns</INF>--C<INF>nu)</INF> / S<INF>n</INF>

    Where:
    n=vial number
    Cns=concentration of compound measured in spiked sample number n.
    Cnu=concentration of compound measured in unspiked sample number n.
    Sn=theoretical concentration of compound spiked into sample n 
calculated in step 9.4.7

    9.4.9  A different R value should be obtained for each compound 
(styrene and toluene) and for each sample type.
    9.4.10  A value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.4.11  R is used to correct all reported results for each compound 
by dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type (see section 12.2 of this method.)

                            10.0  Calibration

    10.1  Calibration standards are prepared by dosing known amounts of 
the hydrocarbons of interest into vials containing known amounts of 
rubber and water.
    10.1.1  Cut a sufficient quantity of dry rubber of the same type as 
will be analyzed into pieces about the same size as that of the crumb. 
Place these in a single layer on a piece of aluminum foil or other 
suitable surface and place into a forced air oven at 100 deg. C for four 
hours. This is to remove any residual hydrocarbons that may be present. 
This step may be performed in advance.
    10.1.2  Into each of a series of vials add 3.0 g of the dry rubber.
    10.1.3  Into each vial add 1.0 ml distilled water or an amount that 
is close to the amount that will be present in the unknowns. The exact 
amount of water present does not have much effect on the analysis, but 
it is necessary to have a saturated environment. The water will also aid 
in the uniform distribution of the spiked hydrocarbons over the surface 
of the rubber after the vials are placed on the shaker (in step 10.1.5 
of this method).
    10.1.4  Into each vial add varying amounts of toluene and styrene by 
microliter syringe and cap the vials immediately to prevent loss. The 
tip of the needle should be carefully touched to the rubber in order to 
transfer the last drop to the rubber. Toluene and styrene may first be 
mixed together in suitable proportions and added together if desired. 
The weights of toluene and styrene added may be calculated from the 
volumes of the mixture added, its composition and density, or may be 
determined by the weight of the vials and caps prior to and after 
addition. Concentrations of added hydrocarbons are calculated as percent 
of the dry rubber weight. At least 5 standards should be prepared with 
the amounts of hydrocarbons added being calculated to cover the entire 
range possible in the unknowns. Retain two samples with no added 
hydrocarbons as blanks.
    10.1.5  Place all the vials onto a shaker or tumbler for 24 
<plus-minus> 2 hours. This is essential in order for the hydrocarbons to 
be evenly distributed and completely absorbed into the rubber. If this 
is not followed the toluene and styrene will be mostly at the surface of 
the rubber and high results will be obtained.
    10.1.6  Remove the vials from the shaker and tap them so that all 
the crumb settles to the bottom of the vials. Allow them to stand for 1 
hour prior to analysis to allow any liquid to drain fully to the bottom.
    10.2  Run the standards and blanks in the same manner as described 
for unknowns (section 11 of this method), starting with a blank, then in 
order of increasing hydrocarbon content and ending with the other blank.
    10.3  Verify that the blanks are sufficiently free from toluene and 
styrene or any interfering hydrocarbons.
    10.3.1  It is possible that trace levels may be present even in dry 
product. If levels are high enough that they will interfere with the 
calibration then the drying procedure in section 10.1.1 of this method 
should be reviewed and modified as needed to ensure that suitable 
standards can be prepared.
    10.3.2  It is possible that the final blank is contaminated by the 
previous standard. If this is the case review and modify the sampler 
parameters as needed to eliminate this problem. If necessary it is 
possible to run blank samples between regular samples in order to reduce 
this problem, though it should not be necessary if the sampler is 
properly set up.
    10.4  Enter the amounts of toluene and styrene added to each of the 
samples (as calculated in section 10.1.4 of this method) into the 
calibration table and perform a calibration utilizing the external 
standard method of analysis.
    10.5  At low concentrations the calibration should be close to 
linear. If a wide range of levels are to be determined it may be 
desirable to apply a nonlinear calibration to get the best fit.

[[Page 777]]

                             11.0  Procedure

    11.1  Place the vials in the tray of the headspace sampler. Enter 
the starting and ending positions through the console of the sampler. 
For unknown samples each is run in duplicate to minimize the effect of 
variations in crumb composition. If excessive variation is noted it may 
be desirable to run more than two of each sample.
    11.2  Make sure the correct method is loaded on the Chemstation. 
Turn on the gas flows and light the FID flame.
    11.3  Start the sequence on the Chemstation. Press the START button 
on the headspace unit. The samples will be automatically injected after 
equilibrating for 30 minutes in the oven. As each sample is completed 
the Chemstation will calculate and print out the results as percent 
toluene and styrene in the crumb based on the dry weight of rubber.

                  12.0  Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1  For each set of duplicate samples calculate the average of the 
measured concentration of toluene and styrene. If more than two 
replicates of each sample are run calculate the average over all 
replicates.
    12.2  For each sample correct the measured amounts of toluene and 
styrene using the following equation:

    Corrected Result = C<INF>m</INF>/R

    Where:
    C<INF>m</INF> = Average measured concentration for that compound.
    R = Recovery efficiency for that compound in the same sample type 
(see section 9.4 of this method)

    12.3  Report the recovery efficiency (R) and the corrected results 
of toluene and styrene for each sample.

                        13.0  Method Performance

    13.1  This method can be very sensitive and reproducible. The actual 
performance depends largely on the exact nature of the samples being 
analyzed. Actual performance must be determined by each laboratory for 
each sample type.
    13.2  The main source of variation is the actual variation in the 
composition of non homogeneous crumb in a stripping system and the small 
sample sizes employed here. It therefore is the responsibility of each 
laboratory to determine the optimum number of replicates of each sample 
required to obtain accurate results.

                       14.0  Pollution Prevention

    14.1  Samples should be kept sealed when possible in order to 
prevent evaporation of hydrocarbons.
    14.2  When drying of samples is required it should be done in an 
oven which vents into a suitable device that can trap the hydrocarbons 
released.

   Method 313B--The Determination of Residual Hydrocarbon in Solution 
                Polymers by Capillary Gas Chromatography

                               1.0  Scope

    1.1  This method is applicable to solution polymerized polybutadiene 
(PBD).
    1.2  This method quantitatively determines n-hexane in wet crumb 
polymer at levels from 0.08 to 0.15% by weight.
    1.3  This method may be extended to the determination of other 
hydrocarbons in solution produced polymers with proper experimentation 
and documentation.

                        2.0  Principle of Method

    2.1  A weighed sample of polymer is dissolved in chloroform and the 
cement is coagulated with an isopropyl alcohol solution containing a 
specific amount of alpha-methyl styrene (AMS) as the internal standard. 
The extract of this coagulation is then injected into a gas 
chromatograph and separated into individual components. Quantification 
is achieved by the method of internal standardization.

            8.0  Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    8.1  A sampling device similar to Figure 1 is used to collect a non-
vented crumb rubber sample at a location that is after the stripping 
operation but before the sample is exposed to the atmosphere.
    8.2  The crumb rubber is allowed to cool before opening the sampling 
device and removing the sample.
    8.3  The sampling device is opened and the crumb rubber sample is 
collected in the sampling basket.
    8.4  One pound of crumb rubber sample is placed into a polyethylene 
bag. The bag is labeled with the time, date and sample location.
    8.5  The sample should be delivered to the laboratory for testing 
within one hour of sampling.
    8.6  Laboratory testing will be done within 3 hours of the sampling 
time.
    8.7  No special storage conditions are required unless the storage 
time exceeds 3 hours in which case refrigeration of the samples is 
recommended.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    9.1  For each sample type, 12 samples shall be obtained from the 
process for the recovery study. Half of the vials and caps shall be 
tared, labeled ``spiked'', and numbered 1 through 6. The other vials 
shall be labeled ``unspiked'' and need not be tared, but are also 
numbered 1 through 6.
    9.2  Determine the % moisture content of the crumb sample. After 
determining the % moisture content, the correction factor for

[[Page 779]]

calculating the dry crumb weight can be determined by using the equation 
in section 12.2 of this method.
    9.3  Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. 
Record the concentrations of the n-hexane content of the mixed hexane 
reported for each pair of spiked and unspiked samples.
    9.4  For the recovery study, each sample of crumb shall be dissolved 
in chloroform containing a known amount of mixed hexane solvent.
    9.5  For each hydrocarbon, calculate the recovery efficiency (R) 
using the following equations:

    M<INF>r</INF>=M<INF>s</INF>-M<INF>u</INF>
    R=M<INF>r</INF>/S

    Where:
    M<INF>u</INF>=Measured amount of compound in the unspiked sample
    M<INF>s</INF>=Measured amount of compound in the spiked sample
    M<INF>r</INF>=Measured amount of the spiked compound
    S=Amount of compound added to the spiked sample
    R=Fraction of spiked compound recovered

    9.6  Normally a value of R between 0.70 and 1.30 is acceptable.
    9.7  R is used to correct all reported results for each compound by 
dividing the measured results of each compound by the R for that 
compound for the same sample type.

                            10.0  Calibration

    10.1  Using the AMS STOCK SOLUTION equipped with the automatic 
dispensing pipet (7.5.3 of this method), transfer 25.0 ml of the 
internal standard solution into an uncapped 50-ml serum vial.
    10.2  Using a 2.0 ml volumetric pipet, quantitatively transfer 2.0 
ml of the n-HEXANE STOCK SOLUTION (7.6.2 of this method) into the 50-ml 
serum vial and cap. This solution will be labeled the CALIBRATION 
SOLUTION.
    10.3  Using the conditions prescribed (6.6 of this method), inject 1 
<greek-m>l of the supernate.
    10.4  Obtain the peak areas and calculate the response factor as 
described in the calculations section (12.1 of this method).

  Extractable Matter (MCEM) From Selected Sources at Primary Aluminum 
                          Production Facilities

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications (e.g., 
equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, 
persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of at least 
the following additional test methods: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, and 
Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

                       1.0  Scope and Application.

    1.1  Analytes. Particulate matter (PM). No CAS number assigned. 
Methylene chloride extractable matter (MCEM). No CAS number assigned.
    1.2  Applicability. This method is applicable for the simultaneous 
determination of PM and MCEM when specified in an applicable regulation. 
This method was developed by consensus with the Aluminum Association and 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and has limited precision 
estimates for MCEM; it should have similar precision to Method 5 for PM 
in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A since the procedures are similar for PM.
    1.3  Data quality objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this 
method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                         2.0  Summary of Method.

    Particulate matter and MCEM are withdrawn isokinetically from the 
source. PM is collected on a glass fiber filter maintained at a 
temperature in the range of l20 <plus-minus> 14  deg.C (248 
<plus-minus>25  deg.F) or such other temperature as specified by an 
applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for 
a particular application. The PM mass, which includes any material that 
condenses on the probe and is subsequently removed in an acetone rinse 
or on the filter at or above the filtration temperature, is determined 
gravimetrically after removal of uncombined water. MCEM is then 
determined by adding a methylene chloride rinse of the probe and filter 
holder, extracting the condensable hydrocarbons collected in the 
impinger water, adding an acetone rinse followed by a methylene chloride 
rinse of the sampling train components after the filter and before the 
silica gel impinger, and determining residue gravimetrically after 
evaporating the solvents.

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the EPA.

    6.1  Sample collection. The following items are required for sample 
collection:
    6.1.1  Sampling train. A schematic of the sampling train used in 
this method is shown in Figure 5-1, Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A. Complete construction details are given in APTD-0581 (Reference 2 in 
section 17.0 of this method); commercial models of this train are also 
available. For changes from APTD-0581 and for allowable modifications of 
the train shown in Figure 5-1, Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, see 
the following subsections.


[[Page 781]]


    Note: The operating and maintenance procedures for the sampling 
train are described in APTD-0576 (Reference 3 in section 17.0 of this 
method). Since correct usage is important in obtaining valid results, 
all users should read APTD-0576 and adopt the operating and maintenance 
procedures outlined in it, unless otherwise specified herein. The use of 
grease for sealing sampling train components is not recommended because 
many greases are soluble in methylene chloride. The sampling train 
consists of the following components:

    6.1.1.1  Probe nozzle. Glass or glass lined with sharp, tapered 
leading edge. The angle of taper shall be <ls-thn-eq>30 deg., and the 
taper shall be on the outside to preserve a constant internal diameter. 
The probe nozzle shall be of the button-hook or elbow design, unless 
otherwise specified by the Administrator. Other materials of 
construction may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. 
A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling should be 
available. Typical nozzle sizes range from 0.32 to 1.27 cm (\1/8\ to \1/
2\ in.) inside diameter (ID) in increments of 0.16 cm (\1/16\ in.). 
Larger nozzle sizes are also available if higher volume sampling trains 
are used. Each nozzle shall be calibrated according to the procedures 
outlined in section 10.0 of this method.
    6.1.1.2  Probe liner. Borosilicate or quartz glass tubing with a 
heating system capable of maintaining a probe gas temperature at the 
exit end during sampling of 120<plus-minus>14 deg.C 
(248<plus-minus>25 deg.F), or such other temperature as specified by an 
applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for 
a particular application. Because the actual temperature at the outlet 
of the probe is not usually monitored during sampling, probes 
constructed according to APTD-0581 and using the calibration curves of 
APTD-0576 (or calibrated according to the procedure outlined in APTD-
0576) will be considered acceptable. Either borosilicate or quartz glass 
probe liners may be used for stack temperatures up to about 480 deg.C 
(900 deg.F); quartz liners shall be used for temperatures between 480 
and 900 deg.C (900 and 1,650 deg.F). Both types of liners may be used at 
higher temperatures than specified for short periods of time, subject to 
the approval of the Administrator. The softening temperature for 
borosilicate glass is 820 deg.C (1,500 deg.F) and for quartz glass it is 
1,500 deg.C (2,700 deg.F).
    6.1.1.3  Pitot tube. Type S, as described in section 6.1 of Method 
2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other device approved by the 
Administrator. The pitot tube shall be attached to the probe (as shown 
in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to allow constant 
monitoring of the stack gas velocity. The impact (high pressure) opening 
plane of the pitot tube shall be even with or above the nozzle entry 
plane (see Method 2, Figure 2-6b, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) during 
sampling. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall have a known coefficient, 
determined as outlined in section 10.0 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    6.1.1.4  Differential pressure gauge. Inclined manometer or 
equivalent device (two), as described in section 6.2 of Method 2, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A. One manometer shall be used for velocity head (Dp) 
readings, and the other, for orifice differential pressure readings.
    6.1.1.5  Filter holder. Borosilicate glass, with a glass frit filter 
support and a silicone rubber gasket. The holder design shall provide a 
positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter. The 
holder shall be attached immediately at the outlet of the probe (or 
cyclone, if used).
    6.1.1.6  Filter heating system. Any heating system capable of 
maintaining a temperature around the filter holder of 
120<plus-minus>14 deg.C (248<plus-minus>25 deg.F) during sampling, or 
such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the 
standards or approved by the Administrator for a particular application. 
Alternatively, the tester may opt to operate the equipment at a 
temperature lower than that specified. A temperature gauge capable of 
measuring temperature to within 3 deg.C (5.4 deg.F) shall be installed 
so that the temperature around the filter holder can be regulated and 
monitored during sampling. Heating systems other than the one shown in 
APTD-0581 may be used.
    6.1.1.7  Temperature sensor. A temperature sensor capable of 
measuring temperature to within <plus-minus>3 deg.C (5.4 deg.F) shall be 
installed so that the sensing tip of the temperature sensor is in direct 
contact with the sample gas, and the temperature around the filter 
holder can be regulated and monitored during sampling.
    6.1.1.8  Condenser. The following system shall be used to determine 
the stack gas moisture content: four glass impingers connected in series 
with leak-free ground glass fittings. The first, third, and fourth 
impingers shall be of the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing 
the tip with a 1.3 cm (1/2 in.) ID glass tube extending to about 1.3 cm 
(1/2 in.) from the bottom of the flask. The second impinger shall be of 
the Greenburg-Smith design with the standard tip. The first and second 
impingers shall contain known quantities of water (section 8.3.1 of this 
method), the third shall be empty, and the fourth shall contain a known 
weight of silica gel or equivalent desiccant. A temperature sensor 
capable of measuring temperature to within 1 deg.C (2 deg.F) shall be 
placed at the outlet of the fourth impinger for monitoring.
    6.1.1.9  Metering system. Vacuum gauge, leak-free pump, temperature 
sensors capable of measuring temperature to within 3 deg.C (5.4 deg.F), 
dry gas meter (DGM) capable of measuring volume to within 2 percent, and

[[Page 782]]

related equipment, as shown in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. Other metering systems capable of maintaining sampling rates 
within 10 percent of isokinetic and of determining sample volumes to 
within 2 percent may be used, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator. When the metering system is used in conjunction with a 
pitot tube, the system shall allow periodic checks of isokinetic rates.
    6.1.1.10  Sampling trains using metering systems designed for higher 
flow rates than that described in APTD-0581 or APTD-0576 may be used 
provided that the specifications of this method are met.
    6.1.2  Barometer. Mercury, aneroid, or other barometer capable of 
measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm (0.1 in.) Hg.

    Note: The barometric reading may be obtained from a nearby National 
Weather Service station. In this case, the station value (which is the 
absolute barometric pressure) shall be requested and an adjustment for 
elevation differences between the weather station and sampling point 
shall be made at a rate of minus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 m (100 ft) 
elevation increase or plus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 m (100 ft) 
elevation decrease.

    6.1.3  Gas density determination equipment. Temperature sensor and 
pressure gauge, as described in sections 6.3 and 6.4 of Method 2, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A, and gas analyzer, if necessary, as described in 
Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The temperature sensor shall, 
preferably, be permanently attached to the pitot tube or sampling probe 
in a fixed configuration, such that the tip of the sensor extends beyond 
the leading edge of the probe sheath and does not touch any metal. 
Alternatively, the sensor may be attached just prior to use in the 
field. Note, however, that if the temperature sensor is attached in the 
field, the sensor must be placed in an interference-free arrangement 
with respect to the Type S pitot tube openings (see Method 2, Figure 2-
4, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). As a second alternative, if a difference 
of not more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is to be 
introduced, the temperature sensor need not be attached to the probe or 
pitot tube. (This alternative is subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.)
    6.2  Sample recovery. The following items are required for sample 
recovery:
    6.2.1  Probe-liner and probe-nozzle brushes. Nylon or 
Teflon<SUP></SUP> bristle brushes with stainless steel wire handles. 
The probe brush shall have extensions (at least as long as the probe) 
constructed of stainless steel, nylon, Teflon<SUP></SUP>, or similarly 
inert material. The brushes shall be properly sized and shaped to brush 
out the probe liner and nozzle.
    6.2.2  Wash bottles. Glass wash bottles are recommended. 
Polyethylene or tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) wash bottles may be used, but 
they may introduce a positive bias due to contamination from the bottle. 
It is recommended that acetone not be stored in polyethylene or TFE 
bottles for longer than a month.
    6.2.3  Glass sample storage containers. Chemically resistant, 
borosilicate glass bottles, for acetone and methylene chloride washes 
and impinger water, 500 ml or 1,000 ml. Screw-cap liners shall either be 
rubber-backed Teflon<SUP></SUP> or shall be constructed so as to be 
leak-free and resistant to chemical attack by acetone or methylene 
chloride. (Narrow-mouth glass bottles have been found to be less prone 
to leakage.) Alternatively, polyethylene bottles may be used.
    6.2.4  Petri dishes. For filter samples, glass, unless otherwise 
specified by the Administrator.
    6.2.5  Graduated cylinder and/or balance. To measure condensed 
water, acetone wash and methylene chloride wash used during field 
recovery of the samples, to within 1 ml or 1 g. Graduated cylinders 
shall have subdivisions no greater than 2 ml. Most laboratory balances 
are capable of weighing to the nearest 0.5 g or less. Any such balance 
is suitable for use here and in section 6.3.4 of this method.
    6.2.6  Plastic storage containers. Air-tight containers to store 
silica gel.
    6.2.7  Funnel and rubber policeman. To aid in transfer of silica gel 
to container; not necessary if silica gel is weighed in the field.
    6.2.8  Funnel. Glass or polyethylene, to aid in sample recovery.
    6.3  Sample analysis. The following equipment is required for sample 
analysis:
    6.3.1  Glass or Teflon<SUP></SUP> weighing dishes.
    6.3.2  Desiccator. It is recommended that fresh desiccant be used to 
minimize the chance for positive bias due to absorption of organic 
material during drying.
    6.3.3  Analytical balance. To measure to within 0.l mg.
    6.3.4  Balance. To measure to within 0.5 g.
    6.3.5   Beakers. 250 ml.
    6.3.6  Hygrometer. To measure the relative humidity of the 
laboratory environment.
    6.3.7  Temperature sensor. To measure the temperature of the 
laboratory environment.
    6.3.8  Buchner fritted funnel. 30 ml size, fine (50 micron)-porosity 
fritted glass.
    6.3.9  Pressure filtration apparatus.
    6.3.10  Aluminum dish. Flat bottom, smooth sides, and flanged top, 
18 mm deep and with an inside diameter of approximately 60 mm.

                      7.0  Reagents and Standards.

    7.l  Sample collection. The following reagents are required for 
sample collection:
    7.1.1  Filters. Glass fiber filters, without organic binder, 
exhibiting at least 99.95 percent efficiency (0.05 percent penetration) 
on

[[Page 783]]

0.3 micron dioctyl phthalate smoke particles. The filter efficiency test 
shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM Method D 2986-95A 
(incorporated by reference in Sec. 63.841 of this part). Test data from 
the supplier's quality control program are sufficient for this purpose. 
In sources containing S0<INF>2</INF> or S0<INF>3</INF>, the filter 
material must be of a type that is unreactive to S0<INF>2</INF> or 
S0<INF>3</INF>. Reference 10 in section 17.0 of this method may be used 
to select the appropriate filter.
    7.1.2  Silica gel. Indicating type, 6 to l6 mesh. If previously 
used, dry at l75 deg.C (350 deg.F) for 2 hours. New silica gel may be 
used as received. Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent 
or better) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
    7.1.3  Water. When analysis of the material caught in the impingers 
is required, deionized distilled water shall be used. Run blanks prior 
to field use to eliminate a high blank on test samples.
    7.1.4  Crushed ice.
    7.1.5  Stopcock grease. Acetone-insoluble, heat-stable silicone 
grease. This is not necessary if screw-on connectors with Teflon'' 
sleeves, or similar, are used. Alternatively, other types of stopcock 
grease may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. 
[Caution: Many stopcock greases are methylene chloride-soluble. Use 
sparingly and carefully remove prior to recovery to prevent 
contamination of the MCEM analysis.]
    7.2  Sample recovery. The following reagents are required for sample 
recovery:
    7.2.1  Acetone. Acetone with blank values  1 ppm, by weight residue, 
is required. Acetone blanks may be run prior to field use, and only 
acetone with low blank values may be used. In no case shall a blank 
value of greater than 1E-06 of the weight of acetone used be subtracted 
from the sample weight.

    Note: This is more restrictive than Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. At least one vendor (Supelco Incorporated located in 
Bellefonte, Pennsylvania) lists 1 mg/l as residue for its Environmental 
Analysis Solvents.

    7.2.2  Methylene chloride. Methylene chloride with a blank value 1.5 
ppm, by weight, residue. Methylene chloride blanks may be run prior to 
field use, and only methylene chloride with low blank values may be 
used. In no case shall a blank value of greater than 1.6E-06 of the 
weight of methylene chloride used be subtracted from the sample weight.

    Note: A least one vendor quotes 1 mg/l for Environmental Analysis 
Solvents-grade methylene chloride.

    7.3  Sample analysis. The following reagents are required for sample 
analysis:
    7.3.l  Acetone. Same as in section 7.2.1 of this method.
    7.3.2  Desiccant. Anhydrous calcium sulfate, indicating type. 
Alternatively, other types of desiccants may be used, subject to the 
approval of the Administrator.
    7.3.3  Methylene chloride. Same as in section 7.2.2 of this method.

      8.0  Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport.

    Note: The complexity of this method is such that, in order to obtain 
reliable results, testers should be trained and experienced with the 
test procedures.

    8.11  Pretest preparation. It is suggested that sampling equipment 
be maintained according to the procedures described in APTD-0576.
    8.1.1  Weigh several 200 g to 300 g portions of silica gel in 
airtight containers to the nearest 0.5 g. Record on each container the 
total weight of the silica gel plus container. As an alternative, the 
silica gel need not be preweighed but may be weighed directly in its 
impinger or sampling holder just prior to train assembly.
    8.1.2  A batch of glass fiber filters, no more than 50 at a time, 
should placed in a soxhlet extraction apparatus and extracted using 
methylene chloride for at least 16 hours. After extraction, check 
filters visually against light for irregularities, flaws, or pinhole 
leaks. Label the shipping containers (glass or plastic petri dishes), 
and keep the filters in these containers at all times except during 
sampling and weighing.
    8.1.3  Desiccate the filters at 20 <plus-minus>5.6 deg.C (68 
<plus-minus>10 deg.F) and ambient pressure for at least 24 hours and 
weigh at intervals of at least 6 hours to a constant weight, i.e., 0.5 
mg change from previous weighing; record results to the nearest 0.1 mg. 
During each weighing the filter must not be exposed to the laboratory 
atmosphere for longer than 2 minutes and a relative humidity above 50 
percent. Alternatively (unless otherwise specified by the 
Administrator), the filters may be oven-dried at 104 deg.C (220 deg.F) 
for 2 to 3 hours, desiccated for 2 hours, and weighed. Procedures other 
than those described, which account for relative humidity effects, may 
be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
    8.2  Preliminary determinations.
    8.2.1  Select the sampling site and the minimum number of sampling 
points according to Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A or as specified 
by the Administrator. Determine the stack pressure, temperature, and the 
range of velocity heads using Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; it 
is recommended that a leak check of the pitot lines (see section 8.1 of 
Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) be performed. Determine the 
moisture content using Approximation Method 4 (section 1.2 of Method 4, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A) or its alternatives to make isokinetic 
sampling rate settings. Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight,

[[Page 784]]

as described in section 8.6 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; if 
integrated Method 3 sampling is used for molecular weight determination, 
the integrated bag sample shall be taken simultaneously with, and for 
the same total length of time as, the particulate sample run.
    8.2.2  Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads 
such that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to 
maintain isokinetic sampling rates. During the run, do not change the 
nozzle size. Ensure that the proper differential pressure gauge is 
chosen for the range of velocity heads encountered (see section 8.2 of 
Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A).
    8.2.3  Select a suitable probe liner and probe length such that all 
traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, consider sampling from 
opposite sides of the stack to reduce the required probe length.
    8.2.4  Select a total sampling time greater than or equal to the 
minimum total sampling time specified in the test procedures for the 
specific industry such that: (1) The sampling time per point is not less 
than 2 minutes (or some greater time interval as specified by the 
Administrator); and (2) the sample volume taken (corrected to standard 
conditions) will exceed the required minimum total gas sample volume. 
The latter is based on an approximate average sampling rate.
    8.2.5  The sampling time at each point shall be the same. It is 
recommended that the number of minutes sampled at each point be an 
integer or an integer plus one-half minute, in order to eliminate 
timekeeping errors.
    8.2.6  In some circumstances (e.g., batch cycles), it may be 
necessary to sample for shorter times at the traverse points and to 
obtain smaller gas sample volumes. In these cases, the Administrator's 
approval must first be obtained.
    8.3  Preparation of sampling train.
    8.3.1  During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep 
all openings where contamination can occur covered until just prior to 
assembly or until sampling is about to begin. Place l00 ml of water in 
each of the first two impingers, leave the third impinger empty, and 
transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of preweighed silica gel from its 
container to the fourth impinger. More silica gel may be used, but care 
should be taken to ensure that it is not entrained and carried out from 
the impinger during sampling. Place the container in a clean place for 
later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of the 
silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and 
recorded.
    8.3.2  Using a tweezer or clean disposable surgical gloves, place a 
labeled (identified) and weighed filter in the filter holder. Be sure 
that the filter is properly centered and the gasket properly placed so 
as to prevent the sample gas stream from circumventing the filter. Check 
the filter for tears after assembly is completed.
    8.3.3  When glass liners are used, install the selected nozzle using 
a Viton A 0-ring when stack temperatures are less than 260 deg.C 
(500 deg.F) and an asbestos string gasket when temperatures are higher. 
See APTD-0576 for details. Mark the probe with heat-resistant tape or by 
some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct 
for each sampling point.
    8.3.4  Set up the train as in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A, using (if necessary) a very light coat of silicone 
grease on all ground glass joints, greasing only the outer portion (see 
APTD-0576) to avoid possibility of contamination by the silicone grease. 
Subject to the approval of the Administrator, a glass cyclone may be 
used between the probe and filter holder when the total particulate 
catch is expected to exceed 100 mg or when water droplets are present in 
the stack gas.
    8.3.5  Place crushed ice around the impingers.
    8.4  Leak-check procedures.
    8.4.1  Leak check of metering system shown in Figure 5-1 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. That portion of the sampling train from 
the pump to the orifice meter should be leak-checked prior to initial 
use and after each shipment. Leakage after the pump will result in less 
volume being recorded than is actually sampled. The following procedure 
is suggested (see Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A): 
Close the main valve on the meter box. Insert a one-hole rubber stopper 
with rubber tubing attached into the orifice exhaust pipe. Disconnect 
and vent the low side of the orifice manometer. Close off the low side 
orifice tap. Pressurize the system to 13 to 18 cm (5 to 7 in.) water 
column by blowing into the rubber tubing. Pinch off the tubing, and 
observe the manometer for 1 minute. A loss of pressure on the manometer 
indicates a leak in the meter box; leaks, if present, must be corrected.
    8.4.2  Pretest leak check. A pretest leak-check is recommended but 
not required. If the pretest leak-check is conducted, the following 
procedure should be used.
    8.4.2.1  After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and 
set the filter and probe heating systems to the desired operating 
temperatures. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. If a Viton A 
0-ring or other leak-free connection is used in assembling the probe 
nozzle to the probe liner, leak-check the train at the sampling site by 
plugging the nozzle and pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum.

    Note: A lower vacuum may be used, provided that it is not exceeded 
during the test.


[[Page 785]]


    8.4.2.2  If an asbestos string is used, do not connect the probe to 
the train during the leak check. Instead, leak-check the train by first 
plugging the inlet to the filter holder (cyclone, if applicable) and 
pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. (See NOTE in section 8.4.2.1 of 
this method). Then connect the probe to the train and perform the leak 
check at approximately 25 mm (1 in.) Hg vacuum; alternatively, the probe 
may be leak-checked with the rest of the sampling train, in one step, at 
380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. Leakage rates in excess of 4 percent of the 
average sampling rate or 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm), whichever is less, 
are unacceptable.
    8.4.2.3  The following leak check instructions for the sampling 
train described in APTD-0576 and APTD-058l may be helpful. Start the 
pump with the bypass valve fully open and the coarse adjust valve 
completely closed. Partially open the coarse adjust valve and slowly 
close the bypass valve until the desired vacuum is reached. Do not 
reverse the direction of the bypass valve, as this will cause water to 
back up into the filter holder. If the desired vacuum is exceeded, 
either leak-check at this higher vacuum or end the leak check as shown 
below and start over.
    8.4.2.4  When the leak check is completed, first slowly remove the 
plug from the inlet to the probe, filter holder, or cyclone (if 
applicable) and immediately turn off the vacuum pump. This prevents the 
water in the impingers from being forced backward into the filter holder 
and the silica gel from being entrained backward into the third 
impinger.
    8.4.3  Leak checks during sample run. If, during the sampling run, a 
component (e.g., filter assembly or impinger) change becomes necessary, 
a leak check shall be conducted immediately before the change is made. 
The leak check shall be done according to the procedure outlined in 
section 8.4.2 of this method, except that it shall be done at a vacuum 
equal to or greater than the maximum value recorded up to that point in 
the test. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.00057 
m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever 
is less), the results are acceptable, and no correction will need to be 
applied to the total volume of dry gas metered; if, however, a higher 
leakage rate is obtained, either record the leakage rate and plan to 
correct the sample volume as shown in section 12.3 of this method or 
void the sample run.

    Note: Immediately after component changes, leak checks are optional; 
if such leak checks are done, the procedure outlined in section 8.4.2 of 
this method should be used.

    8.4.4  Post-test leak check. A leak check is mandatory at the 
conclusion of each sampling run. The leak check shall be performed in 
accordance with the procedures outlined in section 8.4.2 of this method, 
except that it shall be conducted at a vacuum equal to or greater than 
the maximum value reached during the sampling run. If the leakage rate 
is found to be no greater than 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent 
of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the results are 
acceptable, and no correction need be applied to the total volume of dry 
gas metered. If, however, a higher leakage rate is obtained, either 
record the leakage rate and correct the sample volume, as shown in 
section 12.4 of this method, or void the sampling run.
    8.5  Sampling train operation. During the sampling run, maintain an 
isokinetic sampling rate (within l0 percent of true isokinetic unless 
otherwise specified by the Administrator) and a temperature around the 
filter of 120 14 deg.C (248 25 deg.F), or such other temperature as 
specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the 
Administrator.
    8.5.1  For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such 
as the one shown in Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 
Be sure to record the initial reading. Record the DGM readings at the 
beginning and end of each sampling time increment, when changes in flow 
rates are made, before and after each leak-check, and when sampling is 
halted. Take other readings indicated by Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A at least once at each sample point during each time 
increment and additional readings when significant changes (20 percent 
variation in velocity head readings) necessitate additional adjustments 
in flow rate. Level and zero the manometer. Because the manometer level 
and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature changes, make 
periodic checks during the traverse.
    8.5.2  Clean the portholes prior to the test run to minimize the 
chance of sampling deposited material. To begin sampling, remove the 
nozzle cap and verify that the filter and probe heating systems are up 
to temperature and that the pitot tube and probe are properly 
positioned. Position the nozzle at the first traverse point with the tip 
pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start the pump and 
adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. Nomographs are available, 
which aid in the rapid adjustment of the isokinetic sampling rate 
without excessive computations. These nomographs are designed for use 
when the Type S pitot tube coefficient (C<INF>p</INF>) is 0.85  0.02 
and the stack gas equivalent density (dry molecular weight) is 29 
<plus-minus> 4. APTD-0576 details the procedure for using the 
nomographs. If C<INF>p</INF> and M<INF>d</INF> are outside the above-
stated ranges, do not use the nomographs unless appropriate steps (see 
Reference 7 in section 17.0 of this method) are taken to compensate for 
the deviations.
    8.5.3  When the stack is under significant negative pressure (height 
of impinger stem), close the coarse adjust valve before inserting

[[Page 786]]

the probe into the stack to prevent water from backing into the filter 
holder. If necessary, the pump may be turned on with the coarse adjust 
valve closed.
    8.5.4  When the probe is in position, block off the openings around 
the probe and porthole to prevent unrepresentative dilution of the gas 
stream.
    8.5.5  Traverse the stack cross-section, as required by Method 1, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A or as specified by the Administrator, being 
careful not to bump the probe nozzle into the stack walls when sampling 
near the walls or when removing or inserting the probe through the 
portholes; this minimizes the chance of extracting deposited material.
    8.5.6  During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the 
temperature around the filter holder at the proper level; add more ice 
and, if necessary, salt to maintain a temperature of less than 20 deg.C 
(68 deg.F) at the condenser/silica gel outlet. Also, periodically check 
the level and zero of the manometer.
    8.5.7  If the pressure drop across the filter becomes too high, 
making isokinetic sampling difficult to maintain, the filter may be 
replaced in the midst of the sample run. It is recommended that another 
complete filter assembly be used rather than attempting to change the 
filter itself. Before a new filter assembly is installed, conduct a leak 
check (see section 8.4.3 of this method). The total PM weight shall 
include the summation of the filter assembly catches.
    8.5.8  A single train shall be used for the entire sample run, 
except in cases where simultaneous sampling is required in two or more 
separate ducts or at two or more different locations within the same 
duct, or in cases where equipment failure necessitates a change of 
trains. In all other situations, the use of two or more trains will be 
subject to the approval of the Administrator.

    Note: When two or more trains are used, separate analyses of the 
front-half and (if applicable) impinger catches from each train shall be 
performed, unless identical nozzle sizes were used in all trains, in 
which case the front-half catches from the individual trains may be 
combined (as may the impinger catches) and one analysis of the front-
half catch and one analysis of the impinger catch may be performed.

    8.5.9  At the end of the sample run, turn off the coarse adjust 
valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, 
record the final DGM reading, and then conduct a post-test leak check, 
as outlined in section 8.4.4 of this method. Also leak-check the pitot 
lines as described in section 8.1 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A. The lines must pass this leak check in order to validate the velocity 
head data.
    8.6  Calculation of percent isokinetic. Calculate percent isokinetic 
(see Calculations, section 12.12 of this method) to determine whether a 
run was valid or another test run should be made. If there was 
difficulty in maintaining isokinetic rates because of source conditions, 
consult the Administrator for possible variance on the isokinetic rates.
    8.7 Sample recovery.
    8.7.1  Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is 
removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the 
probe to cool.
    8.7.2  When the probe can be safely handled, wipe off all external 
PM near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a cap over it to prevent 
losing or gaining PM. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the 
sampling train is cooling down. This would create a vacuum in the filter 
holder, thus drawing water from the impingers into the filter holder.
    8.7.3  Before moving the sample train to the cleanup site, remove 
the probe from the sample train, wipe off the silicone grease, and cap 
the open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that 
might be present. Wipe off the silicone grease from the filter inlet 
where the probe was fastened and cap it. Remove the umbilical cord from 
the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is used 
between the first impinger or condenser and the filter holder, 
disconnect the line at the filter holder and let any condensed water or 
liquid drain into the impingers or condenser. After wiping off the 
silicone grease, cap off the filter holder outlet and impinger inlet. 
Ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps may be used to close 
these openings.
    8.7.4  Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to the 
cleanup area. This area should be clean and protected from the wind so 
that the chances of contaminating or losing the sample will be 
minimized.
    8.7.5  Save a portion of the acetone and methylene chloride used for 
cleanup as blanks. Take 200 ml of each solvent directly from the wash 
bottle being used and place it in glass sample containers labeled 
``acetone blank'' and ``methylene chloride blank,'' respectively.
    8.7.6  Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and note 
any abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows:
    8.7.6.1  Container No. 1. Carefully remove the filter from the 
filter holder, and place it in its identified petri dish container. Use 
a pair of tweezers and/or clean disposable surgical gloves to handle the 
filter. If it is necessary to fold the filter, do so such that the PM 
cake is inside the fold. Using a dry nylon bristle brush and/or a sharp-
edged blade, carefully transfer to the petri dish any PM and/or filter 
fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket. Seal the container.
    8.7.6.2  Container No. 2. Taking care to see that dust on the 
outside of the probe or other

[[Page 787]]

exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover 
PM or any condensate from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, 
and front half of the filter holder by washing these components with 
acetone and placing the wash in a glass container. Perform the acetone 
rinse as follows:
    8.7.6.2.1  Carefully remove the probe nozzle and clean the inside 
surface by rinsing with acetone from a wash bottle and brushing with a 
nylon bristle brush. Brush until the acetone rinse shows no visible 
particles, after which make a final rinse of the inside surface with 
acetone.
    8.7.6.2.2  Brush and rinse the inside parts of the Swagelok fitting 
with acetone in a similar way until no visible particles remain.
    8.7.6.2.3  Rinse the probe liner with acetone by tilting and 
rotating the probe while squirting acetone into its upper end so that 
all inside surfaces are wetted with acetone. Let the acetone drain from 
the lower end into the sample container. A funnel (glass or 
polyethylene) may be used to aid in transferring liquid washes to the 
container. Follow the acetone rinse with a probe brush. Hold the probe 
in an inclined position, squirt acetone into the upper end as the probe 
brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe, hold a 
sample container under the lower end of the probe, and catch any acetone 
and PM that is brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe 
three times or more until no visible PM is carried out with the acetone 
or until none remains in the probe liner on visual inspection. With 
stainless steel or other metal probes, run the brush through in the 
above-described manner at least six times, since metal probes have small 
crevices in which PM can be entrapped. Rinse the brush with acetone and 
quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the 
brushing, make a final acetone rinse of the probe as described above.
    8.7.6.2.4  It is recommended that two people clean the probe to 
minimize sample losses. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and 
protected from contamination.
    8.7.6.2.5  After ensuring that all joints have been wiped clean of 
silicone grease, clean the inside of the front half of the filter holder 
by rubbing the surfaces with a nylon bristle brush and rinsing with 
acetone. Rinse each surface three times or more if needed to remove 
visible particulate. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder. 
Carefully rinse out the glass cyclone also (if applicable).
    8.7.6.2.6  After rinsing the nozzle, probe, and front half of the 
filter holder with acetone, repeat the entire procedure with methylene 
chloride and save in a separate No. 2M container.
    8.7.6.2.7  After acetone and methylene chloride washings and PM have 
been collected in the proper sample containers, tighten the lid on the 
sample containers so that acetone and methylene chloride will not leak 
out when it is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid 
level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label each 
container to identify clearly its contents.
    8.7.6.3  Container No. 3. Note the color of the indicating silica 
gel to determine whether it has been completely spent, and make a 
notation of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fourth 
impinger to its original container and seal the container. A funnel may 
make it easier to pour the silica gel without spilling. A rubber 
policeman may be used as an aid in removing the silica gel from the 
impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small amount of dust 
particles that may adhere to the impinger wall and are difficult to 
remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture 
calculations, do not use any water or other liquids to transfer the 
silica gel. If a balance is available in the field, follow the procedure 
for Container No. 3 in section 11.2.3 of this method.
    8.7.6.4  Impinger water. Treat the impingers as follows:
    8.7.6.4.1  Make a notation of any color or film in the liquid catch. 
Measure the liquid that is in the first three impingers to within 1 ml 
by using a graduated cylinder or by weighing it to within 0.5 g by using 
a balance (if one is available). Record the volume or weight of liquid 
present. This information is required to calculate the moisture content 
of the effluent gas.
    8.7.6.4.2  Following the determination of the volume of liquid 
present, rinse the back half of the train with water, add it to the 
impinger catch, and store it in a container labeled 3W (water).
    8.7.6.4.3  Following the water rinse, rinse the back half of the 
train with acetone to remove the excess water to enhance subsequent 
organic recovery with methylene chloride and quantitatively recover to a 
container labeled 3S (solvent) followed by at least three sequential 
rinsings with aliquots of methylene chloride. Quantitatively recover to 
the same container labeled 3S. Record separately the amount of both 
acetone and methylene chloride used to the nearest 1 ml or 0.5g.

    Note: Because the subsequent analytical finish is gravimetric, it is 
okay to recover both solvents to the same container. This would not be 
recommended if other analytical finishes were required.

    8.8  Sample transport. Whenever possible, containers should be 
shipped in such a way that they remain upright at all times.

    9.2  Volume metering system checks. The following quality control 
procedures are suggested to check the volume metering system calibration 
values at the field test site prior to sample collection. These 
procedures are optional.
    9.2.1  Meter orifice check. Using the calibration data obtained 
during the calibration procedure described in section 10.3 of this 
method, determine the <triangle>H<INF>a</INF> for the metering system 
orifice. The <triangle>H<INF>a</INF> is the orifice pressure 
differential in units of in. H<INF>2</INF>0 that correlates to 0.75 cfm 
of air at 528 deg.R and 29.92 in. Hg. The <triangle>H<INF>a</INF> is 
calculated as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.008

Where

0.0319 = (0.0567 in. Hg/ deg.R)(0.75 cfm)<SUP>2</SUP>;
<triangle>H = Average pressure differential across the orifice meter, 
          in. H<INF>2</INF>0;
T<INF>m</INF> = Absolute average DGM temperature,  deg.R;
<greek-THC> = Total sampling time, min;
P<INF>bar</INF> = Barometric pressure, in. Hg;
Y = DGM calibration factor, dimensionless;
V<INF>m</INF> = Volume of gas sample as measured by DGM, dcf.

    9.2.1.1  Before beginning the field test (a set of three runs 
usually constitutes a field test), operate the metering system (i.e., 
pump, volume meter, and orifice) at the <triangle>H<INF>a</INF> pressure 
differential for 10 minutes. Record the volume collected, the DGM 
temperature, and the barometric pressure. Calculate a DGM calibration 
check value, Y<INF>c</INF>, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.009

Where

Y<INF>c</INF> = DGM calibration check value, dimensionless;
10 = Run time, min.

    9.2.1.2  Compare the Y<INF>c</INF> value with the dry gas meter 
calibration factor Y to determine that: 0.97 Y  Y<INF>c</INF>  1.03Y. If 
the Y<INF>c</INF> value is not within this range, the volume metering 
system should be investigated before beginning the test.
    9.2.2  Calibrated critical orifice. A calibrated critical orifice, 
calibrated against a wet test meter or spirometer and designed to be 
inserted at the inlet of the sampling meter box, may be used as a 
quality control check by following the procedure of section 16.2 of this 
method.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization.

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.

    10.1  Probe nozzle. Probe nozzles shall be calibrated before their 
initial use in the field. Using a micrometer, measure the ID of the 
nozzle to the nearest 0.025 mm (0.001 in.). Make three separate 
measurements using different diameters each time, and obtain the average 
of the measurements. The difference between the high and low numbers 
shall not exceed 0.1 mm (0.004 in.). When nozzles become nicked, dented, 
or corroded, they shall be reshaped, sharpened, and recalibrated before 
use. Each nozzle shall be permanently and uniquely identified.
    10.2  Pitot tube assembly. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be 
calibrated according to the procedure outlined in section 10.1 of Method 
2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    10.3  Metering system.
    10.3.1  Calibration prior to use. Before its initial use in the 
field, the metering system shall be calibrated as follows: Connect the 
metering system inlet to the outlet of a wet test meter that is accurate 
to within 1 percent. Refer to Figure 5-5 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. The wet test meter should have a capacity of 30 liters/
revolution (1 ft<SUP>3</SUP>/rev). A spirometer of 400 liters (14 
ft<SUP>3</SUP>) or more capacity, or equivalent, may be used for this 
calibration, although a wet test meter is usually more practical. The 
wet test meter should be periodically calibrated with a spirometer or a 
liquid displacement meter to ensure the accuracy of the wet test meter. 
Spirometers or wet test meters of other sizes may be used, provided that 
the specified accuracies of the procedure are maintained. Run the 
metering system pump for about 15 minutes with the orifice manometer 
indicating a median reading, as expected in field use, to allow the pump 
to warm up and to

[[Page 789]]

permit the interior surface of the wet test meter to be thoroughly 
wetted. Then, at each of a minimum of three orifice manometer settings, 
pass an exact quantity of gas through the wet test meter and note the 
gas volume indicated by the DGM. Also note the barometric pressure and 
the temperatures of the wet test meter, the inlet of the DGM, and the 
outlet of the DGM. Select the highest and lowest orifice settings to 
bracket the expected field operating range of the orifice. Use a minimum 
volume of 0.15 m<SUP>3</SUP> (5 cf) at all orifice settings. Record all 
the data on a form similar to Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, and calculate Y (the DGM calibration factor) and 
<triangle>H<INF>a</INF> (the orifice calibration factor) at each orifice 
setting, as shown on Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 
Allowable tolerances for individual Y and <triangle>H<INF>a</INF> values 
are given in Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Use the 
average of the Y values in the calculations in section 12 of this 
method.
    10.3.1.1  Before calibrating the metering system, it is suggested 
that a leak check be conducted. For metering systems having diaphragm 
pumps, the normal leak check procedure will not detect leakages within 
the pump. For these cases the following leak check procedure is 
suggested: make a 10-minute calibration run at 0.00057 m<SUP>3</SUP>/min 
(0.02 cfm); at the end of the run, take the difference of the measured 
wet test meter and DGM volumes; divide the difference by 10 to get the 
leak rate. The leak rate should not exceed 0.00057 m<SUP>3</SUP>/min 
(0.02 cfm).
    10.3.2  Calibration after use. After each field use, the calibration 
of the metering system shall be checked by performing three calibration 
runs at a single, intermediate orifice setting (based on the previous 
field test) with the vacuum set at the maximum value reached during the 
test series. To adjust the vacuum, insert a valve between the wet test 
meter and the inlet of the metering system. Calculate the average value 
of the DGM calibration factor. If the value has changed by more than 5 
percent, recalibrate the meter over the full range of orifice settings, 
as previously detailed.

    Note: Alternative procedures, e.g., rechecking the orifice meter 
coefficient, may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.

    10.3.3  Acceptable variation in calibration. If the DGM coefficient 
values obtained before and after a test series differ by more than 5 
percent, either the test series shall be voided or calculations for the 
test series shall be performed using whichever meter coefficient value 
(i.e., before or after) gives the lower value of total sample volume.
    10.4  Probe heater calibration. Use a heat source to generate air 
heated to selected temperatures that approximate those expected to occur 
in the sources to be sampled. Pass this air through the probe at a 
typical sample flow rate while measuring the probe inlet and outlet 
temperatures at various probe heater settings. For each air temperature 
generated, construct a graph of probe heating system setting versus 
probe outlet temperature. The procedure outlined in APTD-0576 can also 
be used. Probes constructed according to APTD-0581 need not be 
calibrated if the calibration curves in APTD-0576 are used. Also, probes 
with outlet temperature monitoring capabilities do not require 
calibration.

    Note: The probe heating system shall be calibrated before its 
initial use in the field.

    10.5  Temperature sensors. Use the procedure in section 10.3 of 
Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to calibrate in-stack temperature 
sensors. Dial thermometers, such as are used for the DGM and condenser 
outlet, shall be calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers.
    10.6  Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer.

                       11.0  Analytical Procedure.

    11.1  Record the data required on a sheet such as the one shown in 
Figure 315-1 of this method.
    11.2  Handle each sample container as follows:
    11.2.1  Container No. 1.
    11.2.1.1  PM analysis. Leave the contents in the shipping container 
or transfer the filter and any loose PM from the sample container to a 
tared glass weighing dish. Desiccate for 24 hours in a desiccator 
containing anhydrous calcium sulfate. Weigh to a constant weight and 
report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg. For purposes of this section, 
the term ``constant weight'' means a difference of no more than 0.5 mg 
or 1 percent of total weight less tare weight, whichever is greater, 
between two consecutive weighings, with no less than 6 hours of 
desiccation time between weighings (overnight desiccation is a common 
practice). If a third weighing is required and it agrees within 
<plus-minus>0.5 mg, then the results of the second weighing should be 
used. For quality assurance purposes, record and report each individual 
weighing; if more than three weighings are required, note this in the 
results for the subsequent MCEM results.
    11.2.1.2  MCEM analysis. Transfer the filter and contents 
quantitatively into a beaker. Add 100 ml of methylene chloride and cover 
with aluminum foil. Sonicate for 3 minutes then allow to stand for 20 
minutes. Set up the filtration apparatus. Decant the solution into a 
clean Buchner fritted funnel. Immediately pressure filter the solution 
through the tube into another clean, dry beaker. Continue decanting and 
pressure filtration until all the solvent is transferred.

[[Page 790]]

Rinse the beaker and filter with 10 to 20 ml methylene chloride, decant 
into the Buchner fritted funnel and pressure filter. Place the beaker on 
a low-temperature hot plate (maximum 40 deg.C) and slowly evaporate 
almost to dryness. Transfer the remaining last few milliliters of 
solution quantitatively from the beaker (using at least three aliquots 
of methylene chloride rinse) to a tared clean dry aluminum dish and 
evaporate to complete dryness. Remove from heat once solvent is 
evaporated. Reweigh the dish after a 30-minute equilibrium in the 
balance room and determine the weight to the nearest 0.1 mg. Conduct a 
methylene chloride blank run in an identical fashion.
    11.2.2  Container No. 2.
    11.2.2.1  PM analysis. Note the level of liquid in the container, 
and confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during 
transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void 
the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, 
to correct the final results. Measure the liquid in this container 
either volumetrically to <plus-minus>1 ml or gravimetrically to 
1<plus-minus>0.5 g. Transfer the contents to a tared 250 ml beaker and 
evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. Desiccate for 
24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the 
nearest 0.1 mg.
    11.2.2.2  MCEM analysis. Add 25 ml methylene chloride to the beaker 
and cover with aluminum foil. Sonicate for 3 minutes then allow to stand 
for 20 minutes; combine with contents of Container No. 2M and pressure 
filter and evaporate as described for Container 1 in section 11.2.1.2 of 
this method.

                         Notes for MCEM Analysis

    1. Light finger pressure only is necessary on 24/40 adaptor. A 
Chemplast adapter #15055-240 has been found satisfactory.
    2. Avoid aluminum dishes made with fluted sides, as these may 
promote solvent ``creep,'' resulting in possible sample loss.
    3. If multiple samples are being run, rinse the Buchner fritted 
funnel twice between samples with 5 ml solvent using pressure 
filtration. After the second rinse, continue the flow of air until the 
glass frit is completely dry. Clean the Buchner fritted funnels 
thoroughly after filtering five or six samples.

    11.2.3  Container No. 3. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel 
plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. This step may be 
conducted in the field.
    11.2.4  Container 3W (impinger water).
    11.2.4.1  MCEM analysis. Transfer the solution into a 1,000 ml 
separatory funnel quantitatively with methylene chloride washes. Add 
enough solvent to total approximately 50 ml, if necessary. Shake the 
funnel for 1 minute, allow the phases to separate, and drain the solvent 
layer into a 250 ml beaker. Repeat the extraction twice. Evaporate with 
low heat (less than 40 deg.C) until near dryness. Transfer the remaining 
few milliliters of solvent quantitatively with small solvent washes into 
a clean, dry, tared aluminum dish and evaporate to dryness. Remove from 
heat once solvent is evaporated. Reweigh the dish after a 30-minute 
equilibration in the balance room and determine the weight to the 
nearest 0.1 mg.

    11.2.5  Container 3S (solvent).
    11.2.5.1  MCEM analysis. Transfer the mixed solvent to 250 ml 
beaker(s). Evaporate and weigh following the procedures detailed for 
container 3W in section 11.2.4 of this method.
    11.2.6  Blank containers. Measure the distilled water, acetone, or 
methylene chloride in each container either volumetrically or 
gravimetrically. Transfer the ``solvent'' to a tared 250 ml beaker, and 
evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. (Conduct a 
solvent blank on the distilled deionized water blank in an identical 
fashion to that described in section 11.2.4.1 of this method.) Desiccate 
for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the 
nearest 0.l mg.

    Note: The contents of Containers No. 2, 3W, and 3M as well as the 
blank containers may be evaporated at temperatures higher than ambient. 
If evaporation is done at an elevated temperature, the temperature must 
be below the boiling point of the solvent; also, to prevent ``bumping,'' 
the evaporation process must be closely supervised, and the contents of 
the beaker must be swirled occasionally to maintain an even temperature. 
Use extreme care, as acetone and methylene chloride are highly flammable 
and have a low flash point.

                  12.0  Data Analysis and Calculations.

calculations of the moisture content of the stack gas shall be made, one 
from the impinger analysis (Equation 315-3), and a second from the 
assumption of saturated conditions. The lower of the two values of 
B<INF>ws</INF> shall be considered correct. The procedure for 
determining the moisture content based upon assumption of saturated 
conditions is given in section 4.0 of Method 4, 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A. For the purposes of this method, the average stack gas temperature 
from Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A may be used to 
make this determination, provided that the accuracy of the in-stack 
temperature sensor is <plus-minus>1 deg.C (2 deg.F).

    16.1  Dry gas meter as a calibration standard. A DGM may be used as 
a calibration standard for volume measurements in place of the wet test 
meter specified in section 16.1 of this method, provided that it is 
calibrated initially and recalibrated periodically as follows:
    16.1.1 Standard dry gas meter calibration.
    16.1.1.1. The DGM to be calibrated and used as a secondary reference 
meter should be of high quality and have an appropriately sized 
capacity, e.g., 3 liters/rev (0.1 ft \3\/rev). A spirometer (400 liters 
or more capacity), or equivalent, may be used for this calibration, 
although a wet test meter is usually more practical. The wet test meter 
should have a capacity of 30 liters/rev (1 ft \3\/rev) and be capable of 
measuring volume to within 1.0 percent; wet test meters should be 
checked against a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter to ensure 
the accuracy of the wet test meter. Spirometers or wet test meters of 
other sizes may be used, provided that the specified accuracies of the 
procedure are maintained.
    16.1.1.2  Set up the components as shown in Figure 5-7 of Method 5, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A spirometer, or equivalent, may be used in 
place of the wet test meter in the system. Run the pump for at least 5 
minutes at a flow rate of about 10 liters/min (0.35 cfm) to condition 
the interior surface of the wet test meter. The pressure drop indicated 
by the manometer at the inlet side of the DGM should be minimized (no 
greater than 100 mm H<INF>2</INF>O [4 in. H<INF>2</INF>O] at a flow rate 
of 30 liters/min [1 cfm]). This can be accomplished by using large-
diameter tubing connections and straight pipe fittings.
    16.1.1.3  Collect the data as shown in the example data sheet (see 
Figure 5-8 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). Make triplicate 
runs at each of the flow rates and at no less than five different flow 
rates. The range of flow rates should be between 10 and 34 liters/min 
(0.35 and 1.2 cfm) or over the expected operating range.
    16.1.1.4  Calculate flow rate, Q, for each run using the wet test 
meter volume, V<INF>w</INF>, and the run time, q. Calculate the DGM 
coefficient, Y<INF>ds</INF>, for each run. These calculations are as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.017

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.018

Where

K<INF>1</INF> = 0.3858 for international system of units (SI); 17.64 for 
          English units;
P<INF>bar</INF> = Barometric pressure, mm Hg (in Hg);
V<INF>w</INF> = Wet test meter volume, liter (ft\3\);
t<INF>w</INF> = Average wet test meter temperature,  deg.C ( deg.F);

[[Page 794]]

t<INF>std</INF> = 273 deg.C for SI units; 460'F for English units;
<greek-THC> = Run time, min;
t<INF>ds</INF> = Average dry gas meter temperature,  deg.C ( deg.F);
V<INF>ds</INF> = Dry gas meter volume, liter (ft\3\);
<greek-D>p = Dry gas meter inlet differential pressure, mm 
          H<INF>2</INF>O (in H<INF>2</INF>O).

    16.1.1.5  Compare the three Y<INF>ds</INF> values at each of the 
flow rates and determine the maximum and minimum values. The difference 
between the maximum and minimum values at each flow rate should be no 
greater than 0.030. Extra sets of triplicate runs may be made in order 
to complete this requirement. In addition, the meter coefficients should 
be between 0.95 and 1.05. If these specifications cannot be met in three 
sets of successive triplicate runs, the meter is not suitable as a 
calibration standard and should not be used as such. If these 
specifications are met, average the three Y<INF>ds</INF> values at each 
flow rate resulting in five average meter coefficients, Y<INF>ds</INF>.
    16.1.1.6  Prepare a curve of meter coefficient, Y<INF>ds</INF>, 
versus flow rate, Q, for the DGM. This curve shall be used as a 
reference when the meter is used to calibrate other DGMs and to 
determine whether recalibration is required.
    16.1.2  Standard dry gas meter recalibration.
    16.1.2.1  Recalibrate the standard DGM against a wet test meter or 
spirometer annually or after every 200 hours of operation, whichever 
comes first. This requirement is valid provided the standard DGM is kept 
in a laboratory and, if transported, cared for as any other laboratory 
instrument. Abuse to the standard meter may cause a change in the 
calibration and will require more frequent recalibrations.
    16.1.2.2  As an alternative to full recalibration, a two-point 
calibration check may be made. Follow the same procedure and equipment 
arrangement as for a full recalibration, but run the meter at only two 
flow rates (suggested rates are 14 and 28 liters/min [0.5 and 1.0 cfm]). 
Calculate the meter coefficients for these two points, and compare the 
values with the meter calibration curve. If the two coefficients are 
within 1.5 percent of the calibration curve values at the same flow 
rates, the meter need not be recalibrated until the next date for a 
recalibration check.
    6.2  Critical orifices as calibration standards. Critical orifices 
may be used as calibration standards in place of the wet test meter 
specified in section 10.3 of this method, provided that they are 
selected, calibrated, and used as follows:
    16.2.1  Selection of critical orifices.
    16.2.1.1  The procedure that follows describes the use of hypodermic 
needles or stainless steel needle tubing that has been found suitable 
for use as critical orifices. Other materials and critical orifice 
designs may be used provided the orifices act as true critical orifices; 
i.e., a critical vacuum can be obtained, as described in section 
7.2.2.2.3 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Select five critical 
orifices that are appropriately sized to cover the range of flow rates 
between 10 and 34 liters/min or the expected operating range. Two of the 
critical orifices should bracket the expected operating range. A minimum 
of three critical orifices will be needed to calibrate a Method 5 DGM; 
the other two critical orifices can serve as spares and provide better 
selection for bracketing the range of operating flow rates. The needle 
sizes and tubing lengths shown in Table 315-1 give the approximate flow 
rates indicated in the table.
    16.2.1.2  These needles can be adapted to a Method 5 type sampling 
train as follows: Insert a serum bottle stopper, 13 x 20 mm sleeve type, 
into a 0.5 in Swagelok quick connect. Insert the needle into the stopper 
as shown in Figure 5-9 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    16.2.2  Critical orifice calibration. The procedure described in 
this section uses the Method 5 meter box configuration with a DGM as 
described in section 6.1.1.9 of this method to calibrate the critical 
orifices. Other schemes may be used, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator.
    16.2.2.1  Calibration of meter box. The critical orifices must be 
calibrated in the same configuration as they will be used; i.e., there 
should be no connections to the inlet of the orifice.
    16.2.2.1.1  Before calibrating the meter box, leak-check the system 
as follows: Fully open the coarse adjust valve and completely close the 
bypass valve. Plug the inlet. Then turn on the pump and determine 
whether there is any leakage. The leakage rate shall be zero; i.e., no 
detectable movement of the DGM dial shall be seen for 1 minute.
    16.2.2.1.2  Check also for leakages in that portion of the sampling 
train between the pump and the orifice meter. See section 5.6 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A for the procedure; make any corrections, 
if necessary. If leakage is detected, check for cracked gaskets, loose 
fittings, worn 0-rings, etc. and make the necessary repairs.
    16.2.2.1.3  After determining that the meter box is leakless, 
calibrate the meter box according to the procedure given in section 5.3 
of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Make sure that the wet test 
meter meets the requirements stated in section 7.1.1.1 of Method 5, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A. Check the water level in the wet test meter. 
Record the DGM calibration factor, Y.
    16.2.2.2  Calibration of critical orifices. Set up the apparatus as 
shown in Figure 5-10 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    16.2.2.2.1  Allow a warm-up time of 15 minutes. This step is 
important to equilibrate

[[Page 795]]

the temperature conditions through the DGM.
    16.2.2.2.2  Leak-check the system as in section 7.2.2.1.1 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The leakage rate shall be zero.
    16.2.2.2.3  Before calibrating the critical orifice, determine its 
suitability and the appropriate operating vacuum as follows: turn on the 
pump, fully open the coarse adjust valve, and adjust the bypass valve to 
give a vacuum reading corresponding to about half of atmospheric 
pressure. Observe the meter box orifice manometer reading, DH. Slowly 
increase the vacuum reading until a stable reading is obtained on the 
meter box orifice manometer. Record the critical vacuum for each 
orifice. Orifices that do not reach a critical value shall not be used.
    16.2.2.2.4  Obtain the barometric pressure using a barometer as 
described in section 6.1.2 of this method. Record the barometric 
pressure, P<INF>bar</INF>, in mm Hg (in. Hg).
    16.2.2.2.5  Conduct duplicate runs at a vacuum of 25 to 50 mm Hg (1 
to 2 in. Hg) above the critical vacuum. The runs shall be at least 5 
minutes each. The DGM volume readings shall be in increments of complete 
revolutions of the DGM. As a guideline, the times should not differ by 
more than 3.0 seconds (this includes allowance for changes in the DGM 
temperatures) to achieve <plus-minus>0.5 percent in K'. Record the 
information listed in Figure 5-11 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A.
    16.2.2.2.6 Calculate K' using Equation 315-11.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.019
    
where

K' = Critical orifice coefficient, [m\3\)( deg.K)<SUP>1/2</SUP>]/[(mm 
          Hg)(min)] '61' [(ft\3\)( deg.R)<SUP>1/2</SUP>)]/[(in. 
          Hg)(min)]'61'
T<INF>amb</INF> = Absolute ambient temperature,  deg.K ( deg.R).

    16.2.2.2.7  Average the K' values. The individual K' values should 
not differ by more than <plus-minus>0.5 percent from the average.
    16.2.3  Using the critical orifices as calibration standards.
    16.2.3.1  Record the barometric pressure.
    16.2.3.2  Calibrate the metering system according to the procedure 
outlined in sections 7.2.2.2.1 to 7.2.2.2.5 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A. Record the information listed in Figure 5-12 of Method 5, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A.
    16.2.3.3  Calculate the standard volumes of air passed through the 
DGM and the critical orifices, and calculate the DGM calibration factor, 
Y, using the equations below:

V<INF>m(std)</INF> = K<INF>1</INF> V<INF>m</INF> [P<INF>bar</INF> + 
          (<triangle>H/13.6)]/T<INF>m</INF> Eq. 315-12
V<INF>cr(std)</INF> = K' (P<INF>bar</INF> <greek-THC>)/
          T<INF>amb</INF><SUP>1/2</SUP> Eq. 315-13
Y = V<INF>cr(std)</INF>/V<INF>m(std)</INF> Eq. 315-14
where

V<INF>cr(std)</INF> = Volume of gas sample passed through the critical 
          orifice, corrected to standard conditions, dscm (dscf).
K' = 0.3858  deg.K/mm Hg for metric units
    = 17.64  deg.R/in Hg for English units.

    16.2.3.4  Average the DGM calibration values for each of the flow 
rates. The calibration factor, Y, at each of the flow rates should not 
differ by more than <plus-minus>2 percent from the average.
    16.2.3.5  To determine the need for recalibrating the critical 
orifices, compare the DGM Y factors obtained from two adjacent orifices 
each time a DGM is calibrated; for example, when checking orifice 13/
2.5, use orifices 12/10.2 and 13/5.1. If any critical orifice yields a 
DGM Y factor differing by more than 2 percent from the others, 
recalibrate the critical orifice according to section 7.2.2.2 of Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

   Method 316--Sampling and Analysis for Formaldehyde Emissions From 
  Stationary Sources in the Mineral Wool and Wool Fiberglass Industries

                            1.0  Introduction

    This method is applicable to the determination of formaldehyde, CAS 
Registry number 50-00-0, from stationary sources in the mineral wool and 
wool fiber glass industries. High purity water is used to collect the 
formaldehyde. The formaldehyde concentrations in the stack samples are 
determined using the modified pararosaniline method. Formaldehyde can be 
detected as low as 8.8  x  10<SUP>10</SUP> lbs/cu ft (11.3 ppbv) or as 
high as 1.8  x  10<SUP>3</SUP> lbs/cu ft (23,000,000 ppbv), at standard 
conditions over a 1 hour sampling period, sampling approximately 30 cu 
ft.

                         2.0  Summary of Method

    Gaseous and particulate pollutants are withdrawn isokinetically from 
an emission source and are collected in high purity water. Formaldehyde 
present in the emissions is highly soluble in high purity water. The 
high purity water containing formaldehyde is then analyzed using the 
modified pararosaniline method. Formaldehyde in the sample reacts with 
acidic pararosaniline, and the sodium sulfite, forming a purple 
chromophore. The intensity of the purple color, measured 
spectrophotometrically, provides an accurate and precise measure of the 
formaldehyde concentration in the sample.

                           4.0  Interferences

    Sulfite and cyanide in solution interfere with the pararosaniline 
method. A procedure to overcome the interference by each compound has 
been described by Miksch, et al.

                      6.0  Apparatus and Materials

    6.1  A schematic of the sampling train is shown in Figure 1. This 
sampling train configuration is adapted from EPA Method 5, 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A, procedures.


[[Page 798]]

    The sampling train consists of the following components: probe 
nozzle, probe liner, pitot tube, differential pressure gauge, impingers, 
metering system, barometer, and gas density determination equipment.
    6.1.1  Probe Nozzle:  Quartz, glass, or stainless steel with sharp, 
tapered (30 deg. angle) leading edge. The taper shall be on the outside 
to preserve a constant inner diameter. The nozzle shall be buttonhook or 
elbow design. A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling 
should be available in increments of 0.15 cm (\1/16\ in), e.g., 0.32 to 
1.27 cm (\1/8\ to \1/2\ in), or larger if higher volume sampling trains 
are used. Each nozzle shall be calibrated according to the procedure 
outlined in Section 10.1.
    6.1.2  Probe Liner: Borosilicate glass or quartz shall be used for 
the probe liner. The probe shall be maintained at a temperature of 
120 deg.C <plus-minus> 14 deg.C (248 deg.F <plus-minus> 25 deg.F).
    6.1.3  Pitot Tube: The pitot tube shall be Type S, as described in 
Section 2.1 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or any other 
appropriate device. The pitot tube shall be attached to the probe to 
allow constant monitoring of the stack gas velocity. The impact (high 
pressure) opening plane of the pitot tube shall be even with or above 
the nozzle entry plane (see Figure 2-6b, EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A) during sampling. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall have a 
known coefficient, determined as outlined in Section 4 of EPA Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    6.1.4  Differential Pressure Gauge: The differential pressure gauge 
shall be an inclined manometer or equivalent device as described in 
Section 2.2 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. One manometer 
shall be used for velocity-head reading and the other for orifice 
differential pressure readings.
    6.1.5  Impingers: The sampling train requires a minimum of four 
impingers, connected as shown in Figure 1, with ground glass (or 
equivalent) vacuum-tight fittings. For the first, third, and fourth 
impingers, use the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing the tip 
with a 1.3 cm inside diameters (\1/2\ in) glass tube extending to 1.3 cm 
(\1/2\

[[Page 799]]

in) from the bottom of the flask. For the second impinger, use a 
Greenburg-Smith impinger with the standard tip. Place a thermometer 
capable of measuring temperature to within 1 deg.C (2 deg.F) at the 
outlet of the fourth impinger for monitoring purposes.
    6.1.6  Metering System: The necessary components are a vacuum gauge, 
leak-free pump, thermometers capable of measuring temperatures within 
3 deg.C (5.4 deg.F), dry-gas meter capable of measuring volume to within 
1 percent, and related equipment as shown in Figure 1. At a minimum, the 
pump should be capable of 4 cfm free flow, and the dry gas meter should 
have a recording capacity of 0-999.9 cu ft with a resolution of 0.005 cu 
ft. Other metering systems may be used which are capable of maintaining 
sample volumes to within 2 percent. The metering system may be used in 
conjunction with a pitot tube to enable checks of isokinetic sampling 
rates.
    6.1.7  Barometer: The barometer may be mercury, aneroid, or other 
barometer capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm Hg 
(0.1 in Hg). In many cases, the barometric reading may be obtained from 
a nearby National Weather Service Station, in which case the station 
value (which is the absolute barometric pressure) is requested and an 
adjustment for elevation differences between the weather station and 
sampling point is applied at a rate of minus 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg) per 
30 m (100 ft) elevation increase (rate is plus 2.5 mm Hg per 30 m (100 
ft) of elevation decrease).
    6.1.8  Gas Density Determination Equipment: Temperature sensor and 
pressure gauge (as described in Sections 2.3 and 2.3 of EPA Method 2, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A), and gas analyzer, if necessary (as described 
in EPA Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). The temperature sensor 
ideally should be permanently attached to the pitot tube or sampling 
probe in a fixed configuration such that the top of the sensor extends 
beyond the leading edge of the probe sheath and does not touch any 
metal. Alternatively, the sensor may be attached just prior to use in 
the field. Note, however, that if the temperature sensor is attached in 
the field, the sensor must be placed in an interference-free arrangement 
with respect to the Type S pitot openings (see Figure 2-7, EPA Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A). As a second alternative, if a difference of 
no more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is to be 
introduced, the temperature gauge need not be attached to the probe or 
pitot tube.

                          6.2  Sample Recovery

    6.2.1  Probe Liner: Probe nozzle and brushes; bristle brushes with 
stainless steel wire handles are required. The probe brush shall have 
extensions of stainless steel, Teflon <SUP>TM</SUP>, or inert material 
at least as long as the probe. The brushes shall be properly sized and 
shaped to brush out the probe liner, the probe nozzle, and the 
impingers.
    6.2.2  Wash Bottles: One wash bottle is required. Polyethylene, 
Teflon <SUP>TM</SUP>, or glass wash bottles may be used for sample 
recovery.
    6.2.3  Graduated Cylinder and/or Balance: A graduated cylinder or 
balance is required to measure condensed water to the nearest 1 ml or 1 
g. Graduated cylinders shall have division not >2 ml. Laboratory 
balances capable of weighing to <plus-minus> 0.5 g are required.
    6.2.4  Polyethylene Storage Containers: 500 ml wide-mouth 
polyethylene bottles are required to store impinger water samples.
    6.2.5  Rubber Policeman and Funnel: A rubber policeman and funnel 
are required to aid the transfer of material into and out of containers 
in the field.

                          6.3  Sample Analysis

    6.3.1  Spectrophotometer--B&L 70, 710, 2000, etc., or equivalent; 1 
cm pathlength cuvette holder.
    6.3.2  Disposable polystyrene cuvettes, pathlengh 1 cm, volume of 
about 4.5 ml.
    6.3.3  Pipettors--Fixed-volume Oxford pipet (250 <greek-m>l; 500 
<greek-m>l; 1000 <greek-m>l); adjustable volume Oxford or equivalent 
pipettor 1-5 ml model, set to 2.50 ml.
    6.3.4  Pipet tips for pipettors above.
    6.3.5  Parafilm, 2 deg. wide; cut into about 1'' squares.

                              7.0  Reagents

    7.1  High purity water: All references to water in this method refer 
to high purity water (ASTM Type I water or equivalent). The water purity 
will dictate the lower limits of formaldehyde quantification.
    7.2  Silica Gel: Silica gel shall be indicting type, 6-16 mesh. If 
the silica gel has been used previously, dry at 175 deg.C (350 deg.F) 
for 2 hours before using. New silica gel may be used as received. 
Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent or better) may be 
used.
    7.3  Crushed Ice: Quantities ranging from 10-50 lbs may be necessary 
during a sampling run, depending upon ambient temperature. Samples which 
have been taken must be stored and shipped cold; sufficient ice for this 
purpose must be allowed.
    7.4  Quaternary ammonium compound stock solution: Prepare a stock 
solution of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (98 percent minimum assay, 
reagent grade) by dissolving 1.0 gram in 1000 ml water. This solution 
contains nominally 1000 <greek-m>g/ml quaternary ammonium compound, and 
is used as a biocide for some sources which are prone to microbial 
contamination.
    7.5  Pararosaniline: Weigh 0.16 grams pararosaniline (free base; 
assay of 95 percent or greater, C.I. 42500; Sigma P7632 has been

[[Page 800]]

found to be acceptable) into a 100 ml flask. Exercise care, since 
pararosaniline is a dye and will stain. Using a wash bottle with high-
purity water, rinse the walls of the flask. Add no more than 25 ml 
water. Then, carefully add 20 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to 
the flask. The flask will become warm after the addition of acid. Add a 
magnetic stir bar to the flask, cap, and place on a magnetic stirrer for 
approximately 4 hours. Then, add additional water so the total volume is 
100 ml. This solution is stable for several months when stored tightly 
capped at room temperature.
    7.6  Sodium sulfite: Weigh 0.10 grams anhydrous sodium sulfite into 
a 100 ml flask. Dilute to the mark with high purity water. Invert 15-20 
times to mix and dissolve the sodium sulfite. This solution must be 
prepared fresh every day.
    7.7  Formaldehyde standard solution: Pipet exactly 2.70 ml of 37 
percent formaldehyde solution into a 1000 ml volumetric flask which 
contains about 500 ml of high-purity water. Dilute to the mark with 
high-purity water. This solution contains nominally 1000 <greek-m>g/ml 
of formaldehyde, and is used to prepare the working formaldehyde 
standards. The exact formaldehyde concentration may be determined if 
needed by suitable modification of the sodium sulfite method (Reference: 
J.F. Walker, Formaldehyde (Third Edition), 1964.). The 1000 <greek-m>g/
ml formaldehyde stock solution is stable for at least a year if kept 
tightly closed, with the neck of the flask sealed with Parafilm. Store 
at room temperature.
    7.8  Working formaldehyde standards: Pipet exactly 10.0 ml of the 
1000 <greek-m>g/ml formaldehyde stock solution into a 100 ml volumetric 
flask which is about half full of high-purity water. Dilute to the mark 
with high-purity water, and invert 15-20 times to mix thoroughly. This 
solution contains nominally 100 <greek-m>g/ml formaldehyde. Prepare the 
working standards from this 100 <greek-m>g/ml standard solution and 
using the Oxford pipets:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Volumetric
                                                 <greek-m>L     flask
                                                   or 100       volume
        Working standard, <greek-m>/mL          <greek-m>g/   (dilute to
                                                mL solution   mark with
                                                                water)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.250.........................................          250          100
0.500.........................................          500          100
1.00..........................................         1000          100
2.00..........................................         2000          100
3.00..........................................         1500           50
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 100 <greek-m>g/ml stock solution is stable for 4 weeks if kept 
refrigerated between analyses. The working standards (0.25-3.00 
<greek-m>g/ml) should be prepared fresh every day, consistent with good 
laboratory practice for trace analysis. If the laboratory water is not 
of sufficient purity, it may be necessary to prepare the working 
standards every day. The laboratory must establish that the working 
standards are stable--DO NOT assume that your working standards are 
stable for more than a day unless you have verified this by actual 
testing for several series of working standards.

                         8.0  Sample Collection

    8.1  Because of the complexity of this method, field personnel 
should be trained in and experienced with the test procedures in order 
to obtain reliable results.

                       8.2  Laboratory Preparation

    8.2.1  All the components shall be maintained and calibrated 
according to the procedure described in APTD-0576, unless otherwise 
specified.
    8.2.2  Weigh several 200 to 300 g portions of silica gel in airtight 
containers to the nearest 0.5 g. Record on each container the total 
weight of the silica gel plus containers. As an alternative to 
preweighing the silica gel, it may instead be weighed directly in the 
impinger or sampling holder just prior to train assembly.

                  8.3  Preliminary Field Determinations

    8.3.1  Select the sampling site and the minimum number of sampling 
points according to EPA Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other 
relevant criteria. Determine the stack pressure, temperature, and range 
of velocity heads using EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A 
leak-check of the pitot lines according to Section 3.1 of EPA Method 2, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, must be performed. Determine the stack gas 
moisture content using EPA Approximation Method 4,40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, or its alternatives to establish estimates of isokinetic 
sampling rate settings. Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight, as 
described in EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Section 3.6. If 
integrated EPA Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, sampling is used 
for molecular weight determination, the integrated bag sample shall be 
taken simultaneously with, and for the same total length of time as, the 
sample run.
    8.3.2  Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads so 
that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain 
isokinetic sampling rates below 28 l/min (1.0 cfm). During the run do 
not change the nozzle. Ensure that the proper differential pressure 
gauge is chosen for the range of velocity heads encountered (see Section 
2.2 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A).
    8.3.3  Select a suitable probe liner and probe length so that all 
traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, to reduce the length 
of the probe, consider sampling from opposite sides of the stack.
    8.3.4  A minimum of 30 cu ft of sample volume is suggested for 
emission sources with

[[Page 801]]

stack concentrations not greater than 23,000,000 ppbv. Additional sample 
volume shall be collected as necessitated by the capacity of the water 
reagent and analytical detection limit constraint. Reduced sample volume 
may be collected as long as the final concentration of formaldehyde in 
the stack sample is greater than 10 (ten) times the detection limit.
    8.3.5  Determine the total length of sampling time needed to obtain 
the identified minimum volume by comparing the anticipated average 
sampling rate with the volume requirement. Allocate the same time to all 
traverse points defined by EPA Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. To 
avoid timekeeping errors, the length of time sampled at each traverse 
point should be an integer or an integer plus 0.5 min.
    8.3.6  In some circumstances (e.g., batch cycles) it may be 
necessary to sample for shorter times at the traverse points and to 
obtain smaller gas-volume samples. In these cases, careful documentation 
must be maintained in order to allow accurate calculations of 
concentrations.

                  8.4  Preparation of Collection Train

    8.4.1  During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep 
all openings where contamination can occur covered with 
Teflon<SUP>TM</SUP> film or aluminum foil until just prior to assembly 
or until sampling is about to begin.
    8.4.2  Place 100 ml of water in each of the first two impingers, and 
leave the third impinger empty. If additional capacity is required for 
high expected concentrations of formaldehyde in the stack gas, 200 ml of 
water per impinger may be used or additional impingers may be used for 
sampling. Transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of pre-weighed silica gel 
from its container to the fourth impinger. Care should be taken to 
ensure that the silica gel is not entrained and carried out from the 
impinger during sampling. Place the silica gel container in a clean 
place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of 
the silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and 
recorded.
    8.4.3  With a glass or quartz liner, install the selected nozzle 
using a Viton-A O-ring when stack temperatures are 260 deg.C (500 deg.F) 
and a woven glass-fiber gasket when temperatures are higher. See APTD-
0576 for details. Other connection systems utilizing either 316 
stainless steel or Teflon<SUP>TM</SUP> ferrules may be used. Mark the 
probe with heat-resistant tape or by some other method to denote the 
proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.
    8.4.4  Assemble the train as shown in Figure 1. During assembly, a 
very light coating of silicone grease may be used on ground-glass joints 
of the impingers, but the silicone grease should be limited to the outer 
portion (see APTD-0576) of the ground-glass joints to minimize silicone 
grease contamination. If necessary, Teflon<SUP>TM</SUP> tape may be used 
to seal leaks. Connect all temperature sensors to an appropriate 
potentiometer/display unit. Check all temperature sensors at ambient 
temperatures.
    8.4.5  Place crushed ice all around the impingers.
    8.4.6  Turn on and set the probe heating system at the desired 
operating temperature. Allow time for the temperature to stabilize.

                       8.5  Leak-Check Procedures

    8.5.1  Pre-test Leak-check: Recommended, but not required. If the 
tester elects to conduct the pre-test leak-check, the following 
procedure shall be used.
    8.5.1.1  After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and 
set probe heating system at the desired operating temperature. Allow 
time for the temperature to stabilize. If a Viton-a O-ring or other 
leak-free connection is used in assembling the probe nozzle to the probe 
liner, leak-check the train at the sampling site by plugging the nozzle 
and pulling a 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum.

    Note: A lower vacuum may be used, provided that the lower vacuum is 
not exceeded during the test.

    If a woven glass fiber gasket is used, do not connect the probe to 
the train during the leak-check. Instead, leak-check the train by first 
attaching a carbon-filled leak-check impinger to the inlet and then 
plugging the inlet and pulling a 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum. (A lower 
vacuum may be used if this lower vacuum is not exceeded during the 
test.) Next connect the probe to the train and leak-check at about 25 mm 
Hg (1 in Hg) vacuum. Alternatively, leak-check the probe with the rest 
of the sampling train in one step at 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum. 
Leakage rates in excess of (a) 4 percent of the average sampling rate or 
(b) 0.00057 m<SUP>3</SUP>/min (0.02 cfm), whichever is less, are 
unacceptable.
    8.5.1.2  The following leak-check instructions for the sampling 
train described in APTD-0576 and APTD-0581 may be helpful. Start the 
pump with the fine-adjust valve fully open and coarse-valve completely 
closed. Partially open the coarse-adjust valve and slowly close the 
fine-adjust valve until the desired vacuum is reached. Do not reverse 
direction of the fine-adjust valve, as liquid will back up into the 
train. If the desired vacuum is exceeded, either perform the leak-check 
at this higher vacuum or end the leak-check, as described below, and 
start over.
    8.5.1.3  When the leak-check is completed, first slowly remove the 
plug from the inlet to the probe. When the vacuum drops to 127 mm (5 in) 
Hg or less, immediately close the coarse-adjust valve. Switch off the 
pumping system and reopen the fine-adjust valve. Do

[[Page 802]]

not reopen the fine-adjust valve until the coarse-adjust valve has been 
closed to prevent the liquid in the impingers from being forced backward 
in the sampling line and silica gel from being entrained backward into 
the third impinger.
    8.5.2  Leak-checks During Sampling Run:
    8.5.2.1  If, during the sampling run, a component change (e.g., 
impinger) becomes necessary, a leak-check shall be conducted immediately 
after the interruption of sampling and before the change is made. The 
leak-check shall be done according to the procedure described in Section 
10.3.3, except that it shall be done at a vacuum greater than or equal 
to the maximum value recorded up to that point in the test. If the 
leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.0057 m<SUP>3</SUP>/min 
(0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is 
less), the results are acceptable. If a higher leakage rate is obtained, 
the tester must void the sampling run.

    Note: Any correction of the sample volume by calculation reduces the 
integrity of the pollutant concentration data generated and must be 
avoided.

    8.5.2.2  Immediately after component changes, leak-checks are 
optional. If performed, the procedure described in section 8.5.1.1 shall 
be used.
    8.5.3  Post-test Leak-check:
    8.5.3.1  A leak-check is mandatory at the conclusion of each 
sampling run. The leak-check shall be done with the same procedures as 
the pre-test leak-check, except that the post-test leak-check shall be 
conducted at a vacuum greater than or equal to the maximum value reached 
during the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater 
than 0.00057 m<SUP>3</SUP>/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average 
sampling rate (whichever is less), the results are acceptable. If, 
however, a higher leakage rate is obtained, the tester shall record the 
leakage rate and void the sampling run.

                      8.6  Sampling Train Operation

    8.6.1  During the sampling run, maintain an isokinetic sampling rate 
to within 10 percent of true isokinetic, below 28 l/min (1.0 cfm). 
Maintain a temperature around the probe of 120 deg.C <plus-minus> 
14 deg.C (248 deg. <plus-minus> 25 deg.F).
    8.6.2  For each run, record the data on a data sheet such as the one 
shown in Figure 2. Be sure to record the initial dry-gas meter reading. 
Record the dry-gas meter readings at the beginning and end of each 
sampling time increment, when changes in flow rates are made, before and 
after each leak-check, and when sampling is halted. Take other readings 
required by Figure 2 at least once at each sample point during each time 
increment and additional readings when significant adjustments (20 
percent variation in velocity head readings) necessitate additional 
adjustments in flow rate. Level and zero the manometer. Because the 
manometer level and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature 
changes, make periodic checks during the traverse.

    8.6.3  Clean the stack access ports prior to the test run to 
eliminate the chance of sampling deposited material. To begin sampling, 
remove the nozzle cap, verify that the probe heating system are at the 
specified temperature, and verify that the pitot tube and probe are 
properly positioned. Position the nozzle at the first traverse point, 
with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start 
the pump and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. Nomographs, which 
aid in the rapid adjustment of the isokinetic sampling rate without 
excessive computations, are available. These nomographs are designed for 
use when the Type S pitot tube coefficient is 0.84 <plus-minus> 0.02 and 
the stack gas equivalent density (dry molecular weight) is equal to 29 
<plus-minus> 4. APTD-0576 details the procedure for using the 
nomographs. If the stack gas molecular weight and the pitot tube 
coefficient are outside the above ranges, do not use the nomographs 
unless appropriate steps are taken to compensate for the deviations.
    8.6.4  When the stack is under significant negative pressure 
(equivalent to the height of the impinger stem), take care to close the 
coarse-adjust valve before inserting the probe into the stack in order 
to prevent liquid from backing up through the train. If necessary, a low 
vacuum on the train may have to be started prior to entering the stack.
    8.6.5  When the probe is in position, block off the openings around 
the probe and stack access port to prevent unrepresentative dilution of 
the gas stream.
    8.6.6  Traverse the stack cross section, as required by EPA Method 
1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, being careful not to bump the probe 
nozzle into the stack walls when sampling near the walls or when 
removing or inserting the probe through the access port, in order to 
minimize the chance of extracting deposited material.
    8.6.7  During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the 
temperature around the probe at the proper levels. Add more ice and, if 
necessary, salt, to maintain a temperature of 20 deg.C (68 deg.F) at the 
silica gel outlet.
    8.6.8  A single train shall be used for the entire sampling run, 
except in cases where simultaneous sampling is required in two or more 
separate ducts or at two or more different locations within the same 
duct, or in cases where equipment failure necessitates a change of 
trains. An additional train or trains may also be used for sampling when 
the capacity of a single train is exceeded.
    8.6.9  When two or more trains are used, separate analyses of 
components from each train shall be performed. If multiple trains have 
been used because the capacity of a single train would be exceeded, 
first impingers from each train may be combined, and second impingers 
from each train may be combined.
    8.6.10  At the end of the sampling run, turn off the coarse-adjust 
valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, 
record the final dry gas meter reading, and conduct a post-test leak-
check. Also, check the pitot lines as described in EPA Method 2, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A. The lines must pass this leak-check in order to 
validate the velocity-head data.
    8.6.11  Calculate percent isokineticity (see Method 2) to determine 
whether the run was valid or another test should be made.

                  8.7  Sample Preservation and Handling

    8.7.1  Samples from most sources applicable to this method have 
acceptable holding times using normal handling practices (shipping 
samples iced, storing in refrigerator at 2 deg.C until analysis). 
However, forming section stacks and other sources using waste water 
sprays may be subject to microbial contamination. For these sources, a 
biocide (quaternary ammonium compound solution) may be added to 
collected samples to improve sample stability and method ruggedness.
    8.7.2  Sample holding time: Samples should be analyzed within 14 
days of collection. Samples must be refrigerated/kept cold for the 
entire period preceding analysis. After the samples have been brought to 
room temperature for analysis, any analyses needed should be performed 
on the same day. Repeated cycles of warming the samples to room 
temperature/refrigerating/rewarming, then analyzing again, etc., have 
not been investigated in depth to evaluate if analyte levels remain 
stable for all sources.
    8.7.3  Additional studies will be performed to evaluate whether 
longer sample holding times are feasible for this method.

                          8.8  Sample Recovery

    8.8.1  Preparation:
    8.8.1.1  Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is 
removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the 
probe to cool. When the probe can be handled safely, wipe off all 
external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a 
cap over the tip to prevent losing or gaining particulate matter. Do not 
cap the probe tightly while the sampling train is cooling because a 
vacuum will be created, drawing liquid from the impingers back through 
the sampling train.
    8.8.1.2  Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, 
remove the probe from the sampling train and cap the open outlet, being 
careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Remove the 
umbilical cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a 
flexible line is used, let any condensed water or liquid drain into the 
impingers. Cap off any open impinger inlets and outlets. Ground glass 
stoppers, Teflon <SUP>TM</SUP> caps, or

[[Page 806]]

caps of other inert materials may be used to seal all openings.
    8.8.1.3  Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to an area that is 
clean and protected from wind so that the chances of contaminating or 
losing the sample are minimized.
    8.8.1.4  Inspect the train before and during disassembly, and note 
any abnormal conditions.
    8.8.1.5  Save a portion of the washing solution (high purity water) 
used for cleanup as a blank.
    8.8.2  Sample Containers:
    8.8.2.1  Container 1: Probe and Impinger Catches. Using a graduated 
cylinder, measure to the nearest ml, and record the volume of the 
solution in the first three impingers. Alternatively, the solution may 
be weighed to the nearest 0.5 g. Include any condensate in the probe in 
this determination. Transfer the combined impinger solution from the 
graduated cylinder into the polyethylene bottle. Taking care that dust 
on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into 
the sample, clean all surfaces to which the sample is exposed (including 
the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, first three impingers, and 
impinger connectors) with water. Use less than 400 ml for the entire 
waste (250 ml would be better, if possible). Add the rinse water to the 
sample container.
    8.8.2.1.1  Carefully remove the probe nozzle and rinse the inside 
surface with water from a wash bottle. Brush with a bristle brush and 
rinse until the rinse shows no visible particles, after which make a 
final rinse of the inside surface. Brush and rinse the inside parts of 
the Swagelok (or equivalent) fitting with water in a similar way.
    8.8.2.1.2  Rinse the probe liner with water. While squirting the 
water into the upper end of the probe, tilt and rotate the probe so that 
all inside surfaces will be wetted with water. Let the water drain from 
the lower end into the sample container. The tester may use a funnel 
(glass or polyethylene) to aid in transferring the liquid washes to the 
container. Follow the rinse with a bristle brush. Hold the probe in an 
inclined position, and squirt water into the upper end as the probe 
brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe. Hold the 
sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any 
water and particulate matter that is brushed from the probe. Run the 
brush through the probe three times or more. Rinse the brush with water 
and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After 
the brushing, make a final rinse of the probe as describe above.

    Note: Two people should clean the probe in order to minimize sample 
losses. Between sampling runs, brushes must be kept clean and free from 
contamination.

    8.8.2.1.3  Rinse the inside surface of each of the first three 
impingers (and connecting tubing) three separate times. Use a small 
portion of water for each rinse, and brush each surface to which the 
sample is exposed with a bristle brush to ensure recovery of fine 
particulate matter. Make a final rinse of each surface and of the brush, 
using water.
    8.8.2.1.4  After all water washing and particulate matter have been 
collected in the sample container, tighten the lid so the sample will 
not leak out when the container is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the 
height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during 
transport. Label the container clearly to identify its contents.
    8.8.2.1.5  If the first two impingers are to be analyzed separately 
to check for breakthrough, separate the contents and rinses of the two 
impingers into individual containers. Care must be taken to avoid 
physical carryover from the first impinger to the second. Any physical 
carryover of collected moisture into the second impinger will invalidate 
a breakthrough assessment.
    8.8.2.2  Container 2: Sample Blank. Prepare a blank by using a 
polyethylene container and adding a volume of water equal to the total 
volume in Container 1. Process the blank in the same manner as Container 
1.
    8.8.2.3  Container 3: Silica Gel. Note the color of the indicating 
silica gel to determine whether it has been completely spent and make a 
notation of its condition. The impinger containing the silica gel may be 
used as a sample transport container with both ends sealed with tightly 
fitting caps or plugs. Ground-glass stoppers or Teflon<SUP>TM</SUP> caps 
maybe used. The silica gel impinger should then be labeled, covered with 
aluminum foil, and packaged on ice for transport to the laboratory. If 
the silica gel is removed from the impinger, the tester may use a funnel 
to pour the silica gel and a rubber policeman to remove the silica gel 
from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small amount of 
dust particles that may adhere to the impinger wall and are difficult to 
remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture 
calculations, do not use water or other liquids to transfer the silica 
gel. If a balance is available in the field, the spent silica gel (or 
silica gel plus impinger) may be weighed to the nearest
0.5 g.
    8.8.2.4  Sample containers should be placed in a cooler, cooled by 
(although not in contact with) ice. Putting sample bottles in Zip-
Lock<SUP>TM</SUP> bags can aid in maintaining the integrity of the 
sample labels. Sample containers should be placed vertically to avoid 
leakage during shipment. Samples should be cooled during shipment so 
they will be received cold at the laboratory. It is critical that 
samples be chilled immediately after recovery. If the source is 
susceptible to microbial contamination from wash water (e.g.

[[Page 807]]

forming section stack), add biocide as directed in section 8.2.5.
    8.8.2.5  A quaternary ammonium compound can be used as a biocide to 
stabilize samples against microbial degradation following collection. 
Using the stock quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) solution; add 2.5 ml 
QAC solution for every 100 ml of recovered sample volume (estimate of 
volume is satisfactory) immediately after collection. The total volume 
of QAC solution must be accurately known and recorded, to correct for 
any dilution caused by the QAC solution addition.
    8.8.3  Sample Preparation for Analysis 8.8.3.1 The sample should be 
refrigerated if the analysis will not be performed on the day of 
sampling. Allow the sample to warm at room temperature for about two 
hours (if it has been refrigerated) prior to analyzing.
    8.8.3.2  Analyze the sample by the pararosaniline method, as 
described in Section 11. If the color-developed sample has an absorbance 
above the highest standard, a suitable dilution in high purity water 
should be prepared and analyzed.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    9.1  Sampling: See EPA Manual 600/4-77-02b for Method 5 quality 
control.
    9.2  Analysis: The quality assurance program required for this 
method includes the analysis of the field and method blanks, and 
procedure validations. The positive identification and quantitation of 
formaldehyde are dependent on the integrity of the samples received and 
the precision and accuracy of the analytical methodology. Quality 
assurance procedures for this method are designed to monitor the 
performance of the analytical methodology and to provide the required 
information to take corrective action if problems are observed in 
laboratory operations or in field sampling activities.
    9.2.1  Field Blanks: Field blanks must be submitted with the samples 
collected at each sampling site. The field blanks include the sample 
bottles containing aliquots of sample recover water, and water reagent. 
At a minimum, one complete sampling train will be assembled in the field 
staging area, taken to the sampling area, and leak-checked at the 
beginning and end of the testing (or for the same total number of times 
as the actual sampling train). The probe of the blank train must be 
heated during the sample test. The train will be recovered as if it were 
an actual test sample. No gaseous sample will be passed through the 
blank sampling train.
    9.2.2  Blank Correction: The field blank formaldehyde concentrations 
will be subtracted from the appropriate sample formaldehyde 
concentrations. Blank formaldehyde concentrations above 0.25 <greek-m>g/
ml should be considered suspect, and subtraction from the sample 
formaldehyde concentrations should be performed in a manner acceptable 
to the Administrator.
    9.2.3  Method Blanks: A method blank must be prepared for each set 
of analytical operations, to evaluate contamination and artifacts that 
can be derived from glassware, reagents, and sample handling in the 
laboratory.

                             10  Calibration

    10.1  Probe Nozzle: Probe nozzles shall be calibrated before their 
initial use in the field. Using a micrometer, measure the inside 
diameter of the nozzle to the nearest 0.025 mm (0.001 in). Make 
measurements at three separate places across the diameter and obtain the 
average of the measurements. The difference between the high and low 
numbers shall not exceed 0.1 mm (0.004 in). When the nozzle becomes 
nicked or corroded, it shall be repaired and calibrated, or replaced 
with a calibrated nozzle before use. Each nozzle must be permanently and 
uniquely identified.
    10.2  Pitot Tube: The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be calibrated 
according to the procedure outlined in Section 4 of EPA Method 2, or 
assigned a nominal coefficient of 0.84 if it is not visibly nicked or 
corroded and if it meets design and intercomponent spacing 
specifications.

                          10.3  Metering System

    10.3.1  Before its initial use in the field, the metering system 
shall be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in APTD-0576. 
Instead of physically adjusting the dry-gas meter dial readings to 
correspond to the wet-test meter readings, calibration factors may be 
used to correct the gas meter dial readings mathematically to the proper 
values. Before calibrating the metering system, it is suggested that a 
leak-check be conducted. For metering systems having diaphragm pumps, 
the normal leak-check procedure will not delete leakages with the pump. 
For these cases, the following leak-check procedure will apply: Make a 
ten-minute calibration run at 0.00057 m<SUP>3</SUP>/min (0.02 cfm). At 
the end of the run, take the difference of the measured wet-test and 
dry-gas meter volumes and divide the difference by 10 to get the leak 
rate. The leak rate should not exceed 0.00057 m<SUP>3</SUP>/min (0.02 
cfm).
    10.3.2  After each field use, check the calibration of the metering 
system by performing three calibration runs at a single intermediate 
orifice setting (based on the previous field test). Set the vacuum at 
the maximum value reached during the test series. To adjust the vacuum, 
insert a valve between the wet-test meter and the inlet of the metering 
system. Calculate the average

[[Page 808]]

value of the calibration factor. If the calibration has changed by more 
than 5 percent, recalibrate the meter over the full range of orifice 
settings, as outlined in APTD-0576.
    10.3.3  Leak-check of metering system: The portion of the sampling 
train from the pump to the orifice meter (see Figure 1) should be leak-
checked prior to initial use and after each shipment. Leakage after the 
pump will result in less volume being recorded than is actually sampled. 
Use the following procedure: Close the main valve on the meter box. 
Insert a one-hole rubber stopper with rubber tubing attached into the 
orifice exhaust pipe. Disconnect and vent the low side of the orifice 
manometer. Close off the low side orifice tap. Pressurize the system to 
13-18 cm (5-7 in) water column by blowing into the rubber tubing. Pinch 
off the tubing and observe the manometer for 1 min. A loss of pressure 
on the manometer indicates a leak in the meter box. Leaks must be 
corrected.

    Note: If the dry-gas meter coefficient values obtained before and 
after a test series differ by >5 percent, either the test series must be 
voided or calculations for test series must be performed using whichever 
meter coefficient value (i.e., before or after) gives the lower value of 
total sample volume.

    10.4  Probe Heater: The probe heating system must be calibrated 
before its initial use in the field according to the procedure outlined 
in APTD-0576. Probes constructed according to APTD-0581 need not be 
calibrated if the calibration curves in APTD-0576 are used.
    10.5  Temperature gauges: Use the procedure in section 4.3 of USEPA 
Method 2 to calibrate in-stack temperature gauges. Dial thermometers 
such as are used for the dry gas meter and condenser outlet, shall be 
calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers.
    10.6  Barometer: Adjust the barometer initially and before each test 
series to agree to within <plus-minus>2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg) of the 
mercury barometer. Alternately, if a National Weather Service Station 
(NWSS) is located at the same altitude above sea level as the test site, 
the barometric pressure reported by the NWSS may be used.
    10.7  Balance: Calibrate the balance before each test series, using 
Class S standard weights. The weights must be within <plus-minus>0.5 
percent of the standards, or the balance must be adjusted to meet these 
limits.

                      11.0  Procedure for Analysis.

    The working formaldehyde standards (0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 
<greek-m>g/ml) are analyzed and a calibration curve is calculated for 
each day's analysis. The standards should be analyzed first to ensure 
that the method is working properly prior to analyzing the samples. In 
addition, a sample of the high-purity water should also be analyzed and 
used as a ``0'' formaldehyde standard.
    The procedure for analysis of samples and standards is identical: 
Using the pipet set to 2.50 ml, pipet 2.50 ml of the solution to be 
analyzed into a polystyrene cuvette. Using the 250 <greek-m>l pipet, 
pipet 250 <greek-m>l of the pararosaniline reagent solution into the 
cuvette. Seal the top of the cuvette with a Parafilm square and shake at 
least 30 seconds to ensure the solution in the cuvette is well-mixed. 
Peel back a corner of the Parafilm so the next reagent can be added. 
Using the 250 <greek-m>l pipet, pipet 250 <greek-m>l of the sodium 
sulfite reagent solution into the cuvette. Reseal the cuvette with the 
Parafilm, and again shake for about 30 seconds to mix the solution in 
the cuvette. Record the time of addition of the sodium sulfite and let 
the color develop at room temperature for 60 minutes. Set the 
spectrophotometer to 570 nm and set to read in Absorbance Units. The 
spectrophotometer should be equipped with a holder for the 1-cm 
pathlength cuvettes. Place cuvette(s) containing high-purity water in 
the spectrophotometer and adjust to read 0.000 AU.
    After the 60 minutes color development period, read the standard and 
samples in the spectrophotometer. Record the absorbance reading for each 
cuvette. The calibration curve is calculated by linear regression, with 
the formaldehyde concentration as the ``x'' coordinate of the pair, and 
the absorbance reading as the ``y'' coordinate. The procedure is very 
reproducible, and typically will yield values similar to these for the 
calibration curve:

Correlation Coefficient: 0.9999
Slope: 0.50
Y-Intercept: 0.090

The formaldehyde concentration of the samples can be found by using the 
trend-line feature of the calculator or computer program used for the 
linear regression. For example, the TI-55 calculators use the ``X'' key 
(this gives the predicted formaldehyde concentration for the value of 
the absorbance you key in for the sample). Multiply the formaldehyde 
concentration from the sample by the dilution factor, if any, for the 
sample to give the formaldehyde concentration of the original, 
undiluted, sample (units will be micrograms/ml).

               11.1  Notes on the Pararosaniline Procedure

    11.1.1  The pararosaniline method is temperature-sensitive. However, 
the small fluctuations typical of a laboratory will not significantly 
affect the results.
    11.1.2  The calibration curve is linear to beyond 4 ``<greek-m>g/
ml'' formaldehyde, however, a

[[Page 809]]

research-grade spectrophotometer is required to reproducibly read the 
high absorbance values. Consult your instrument manual to evaluate the 
capability of the spectrophotometer.
    11.1.3  The quality of the laboratory water used to prepare 
standards and make dilutions is critical. It is important that the 
cautions given in the Reagents section be observed. This procedure 
allows quantitation of formaldehyde at very low levels, and thus it is 
imperative to avoid contamination from other sources of formaldehyde and 
to exercise the degree of care required for trace analyses.
    11.1.4  The analyst should become familiar with the operation of the 
Oxford or equivalent pipettors before using them for an analysis. Follow 
the instructions of the manufacturer; one can pipet water into a tared 
container on any analytical balance to check pipet accuracy and 
precision. This will also establish if the proper technique is being 
used. Always use a new tip for each pipetting operation.
    11.1.5  This procedure follows the recommendations of ASTM Standard 
Guide D 3614, reading all solutions versus water in the reference cell. 
This allows the absorbance of the blank to be tracked on a daily basis. 
Refer to ASTM D 3614 for more information.

                           12.0  Calculations

    Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal figure 
beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures after final 
calculations.

                12.1  Calculations of Total Formaldehyde

    12.1.1  To determine the total formaldehyde in mg, use the following 
equation if biocide was not used:
    Total mg formaldehyde=
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.043
    
Where:
    C<INF>d</INF> = measured conc. formaldehyde, <greek-m>g/ml
V = total volume of stack sample, ml
DF = dilution factor

    12.1.2  To determine the total formaldehyde in mg, use the following 
equation if biocide was used:
    Total mg formaldehyde=
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.044
    
Where:

C<INF>d</INF> = measured conc. formaldehyde, <greek-m>g/ml
V = total volume of stack sample, ml
B = total volume of biocide added to sample, ml
DF = dilution factor

    12.2  Formaldehyde concentration (mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>) in stack gas. 
Determine the formaldehyde concentration (mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>) in the stack 
gas using the following equation: Formaldehyde concentration (mg/
m<SUP>3</SUP>) =
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.045

Where:

K = 35.31 cu ft/m<SUP>3</SUP> for V<INF>m</INF>(std) in English units, 
          or
K = 1.00 m<SUP>3</SUP>/m<SUP>3</SUP> for V<INF>m</INF>(std) in metric 
          units
V<INF>m</INF>(std) = volume of gas sample measured by a dry gas meter, 
          corrected to standard conditions, dscm (dscf)

    12.3  Average dry gas meter temperature and average orifice pressure 
drop are obtained from the data sheet.
    12.4  Dry Gas Volume: Calculate V<INF>m</INF>(std) and adjust for 
leakage, if necessary, using the equation in Section 6.3 of EPA Method 
5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    12.5  Volume of Water Vapor and Moisture Content: Calculated the 
volume of water vapor and moisture content from equations 5-2 and 5-3 of

                           1.2  Applicability

    1.2.1  This method is applicable for the determination of 
formaldehyde, phenol, methanol, carbonyl sulfide (COS) and carbon 
monoxide (CO) concentrations in controlled and uncontrolled emissions 
from manufacturing processes using phenolic resins. The compounds are 
analyzed in the mid-infrared spectral region (about 400 to 4000 cm-1 or 
25 to 2.5 <greek-m>m). Suggested analytical regions are given below 
(Table 1). Slight deviations from these recommended regions may be 
necessary due to variations in moisture content and ammonia 
concentration from source to source.

                                      Table 1.--Example Analytical Regions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<SUP>a</SUP> Suggested analytical regions assume about 15 percent moisture and CO<INF>2</INF>, and that COS and CO have about the same
  absorbance (in the range of 10 to 50 ppm). If CO and COS are hundreds of ppm or higher, then CO<INF>2</INF> and moisture
  interference is reduced. If CO or COS is present at high concentration and the other at low concentration,
  then a shorter cell pathlength may be necessary to measure the high concentration component.

1.2.2  This method does not apply when: (a) Polymerization of 
formaldehyde occurs, (b) moisture condenses in either the sampling 
system or the instrumentation, and (c) when moisture content of the gas 
stream is so high relative to the analyte concentrations that it causes 
severe spectral interference.

                    1.3  Method Range and Sensitivity

    1.3.1  The analytical range is a function of instrumental design and 
composition of the gas stream. Theoretical detection limits depend, in 
part, on (a) the absorption coefficient of the compound in the 
analytical frequency region, (b) the spectral resolution, (c) 
interferometer sampling time, (d) detector sensitivity and response, and 
(e) absorption pathlength.
    1.3.2  Practically, there is no upper limit to the range. The 
practical lower detection limit is usually higher than the theoretical 
value, and depends on (a) moisture content of the flue gas, (b) presence 
of interferants, and (c) losses in the sampling system. In general, a 22 
meter pathlength cell in a suitable sampling system can achieve 
practical detection limits of 1.5 ppm for three compounds (formaldehyde, 
phenol, and methanol) at moisture levels up to 15 percent by volume. 
Sources with uncontrolled emissions of CO and COS may require a 4 meter 
pathlength cell due to high concentration levels. For these two 
compounds, make sure absorbance of highest concentration component is 
1.0.

                      1.4  Data Quality Objectives

1.4.1  In designing or configuring the system, the analyst first sets 
the data quality objectives, i.e., the desired lower detection limit 
(DL<INF>i</INF>) and the desired analytical uncertainty (AU<INF>i</INF>) 
for each compound. The instrumental parameters (factors b, c, d, and e 
in Section 1.3.1) are then chosen to meet these requirements, using 
Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol.
1.4.2  Data quality for each application is determined, in part, by 
measuring the RMS (Root Mean Square) noise level in each analytical 
spectral region (Appendix C of the FTIR Protocol). The RMS noise is 
defined as the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) of the absorbance 
values in an analytical region from the mean absorbance value of the 
region. Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol defines the MAU<INF>im</INF> 
(minimum analyte uncertainty of the i<SUP>th</SUP> analyte in the 
m<SUP>th</SUP> analytical region). The MAU is the minimum analyte 
concentration for which the analytical uncertainty limit 
(AU<INF>i</INF>) can be maintained: if the measured analyte 
concentration is less than MAU<INF>i</INF>, then data quality is 
unacceptable. Table 2 gives some example DL and AU values along with 
calculated areas and MAU values using the protocol procedures.

                         2.0  Summary of Method

                             2.1  Principle

    2.1.1  Molecules are composed of chemically bonded atoms, which are 
in constant motion. The atomic motions result in bond deformations (bond 
stretching and bond-angle bending). The number of fundamental (or 
independent) vibrational motions depends on the number of atoms (N) in 
the molecule. At typical testing temperatures, most molecules are in the 
ground-state vibrational state for most of their fundamental vibrational 
motions. A molecule can undergo a transition from its ground state (for 
a particular vibration) to the first excited state by absorbing a 
quantum of light at a frequency characteristic of the molecule and the 
molecular motion. Molecules also undergo rotational transitions by 
absorbing energies in the far-infrared or microwave spectral regions. 
Rotational transition absorbencies are superimposed on the vibrational 
absorbencies to give a characteristic shape to each rotational-
vibrational absorbance ``band.''
    2.1.2  Most molecules exhibit more than one absorbance band in 
several frequency regions to produce an infrared spectrum (a 
characteristic pattern of bands or a ``fingerprint'') that is unique to 
each molecule. The infrared spectrum of a molecule depends on its 
structure (bond lengths, bond angles, bond strengths, and atomic 
masses). Even small differences in structure can produce significantly 
different spectra.
    2.1.3  Spectral band intensities vary with the concentration of the 
absorbing compound. Within constraints, the relationship between 
absorbance and sample concentration is linear. Sample spectra are 
compared to reference spectra to determine the species and their 
concentrations.

                       2.2  Sampling and Analysis

    2.2.1  Flue gas is continuously extracted from the source, and the 
gas or a portion of the gas is conveyed to the FTIR gas cell, where a 
spectrum of the flue gas is recorded. Absorbance band intensities are 
related to sample concentrations by Beer's Law.
Where:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.046

A<greek-n> = absorbance of the i<SUP>th</SUP> component at the given 
          frequency, <greek-n>.
a = absorption coefficient of the i<SUP>th</SUP> component at the 
          frequency, <greek-n>.
b = path length of the cell.
c = concentration of the i<SUP>th</SUP> compound in the sample at 
          frequency <greek-n>.

    2.2.2  After identifying a compound from the infrared spectrum, its 
concentration is determined by comparing band intensities in the sample 
spectrum to band intensities in ``reference spectra'' of the 
formaldehyde, phenol, methanol, COS and CO. These reference spectra are 
available in a permanent soft copy from the EPA spectral library on the 
EMTIC bulletin board. The source may also prepare reference spectra 
according to Section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol.

    Note: Reference spectra not prepared according to the FTIR Protocol 
are not acceptable for use in this test method. Documentation detailing 
the FTIR Protocol steps used in preparing any non-EPA reference spectra 
shall be included in each test report submitted by the source.

    2.3  Operator Requirements. The analyst must have some knowledge of 
source sampling and of infrared spectral patterns to operate the 
sampling system and to choose a suitable instrument configuration. The 
analyst should also understand FTIR instrument operation well enough to 
choose an instrument configuration consistent with the data quality 
objectives.

                            3.0  Definitions

    See Appendix A of the FTIR Protocol.

                           4.0  Interferences

    4.1  Analytical (or Spectral) Interferences. Water vapor. High 
concentrations of ammonia (hundreds of ppm) may interfere with the 
analysis of low concentrations of methanol (1 to 5 ppm). For CO, carbon 
dioxide and water may be interferants. In cases where COS levels are low 
relative to CO levels, CO and water may be interferants.

[[Page 812]]

    4.2  Sampling System Interferences. Water, if it condenses, and 
ammonia, which reacts with formaldehyde.

                               5.0  Safety

    5.1  Formaldehyde is a suspected carcinogen; therefore, exposure to 
this compound must be limited. Proper monitoring and safety precautions 
must be practiced in any atmosphere with potentially high concentrations 
of CO.
    5.2  This method may involve sampling at locations having high 
positive or negative pressures, high temperatures, elevated heights, 
high concentrations of hazardous or toxic pollutants, or other diverse 
sampling conditions. It is the responsibility of the tester(s) to ensure 
proper safety and health practices, and to determine the applicability 
of regulatory limitations before performing this test method.

                       6.0  Equipment and Supplies

    The equipment and supplies are based on the schematic of a sampling 
train shown in Figure 1. Either the evacuated or purged sampling 
technique may be used with this sampling train. Alternatives may be 
used, provided that the data quality objectives of this method are met.
    6.1  Sampling Probe. Glass, stainless steel, or other appropriate 
material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, 
prevent adsorption of analytes, and to reach gas sampling point.
    6.2  Particulate Filters. A glass wool plug (optional) inserted at 
the probe tip (for large particulate removal) and a filter rated at 1-
micron (e.g., Balston<SUP>TM</SUP>) for fine particulate removal, placed 
immediately after the heated probe.
    6.3  Sampling Line/Heating System. Heated (maintained at 250 
<plus-minus> 25 degrees F) stainless steel, Teflon<SUP>TM</SUP>, or 
other inert material that does not adsorb the analytes, to transport the 
sample to analytical system.
    6.4  Stainless Steel Tubing. Type 316, e.g., \3/8\ in. diameter, and 
appropriate length for heated connections.
    6.5  Gas Regulators. Appropriate for individual gas cylinders.

[[Page 813]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.052

    6.6  Teflon<SUP>TM</SUP> Tubing. Diameter (e.g., \3/8\ in.) and 
length suitable to connect cylinder regulators.
    6.7  Sample Pump. A leak-free pump (e.g., KNF <SUP>TM</SUP>), with 
by-pass valve, capable of pulling sample through entire sampling system 
at a rate of about 10 to 20 L/min. If placed before the analytical 
system, heat the pump and use a pump fabricated from materials non-
reactive to the target pollutants. If the pump is located after the 
instrument, systematically record the sample pressure in the gas cell.
    6.8  Gas Sample Manifold. A heated manifold that diverts part of the 
sample stream to the analyzer, and the rest to the by-pass discharge 
vent or other analytical instrumentation.
    6.9  Rotameter. A calibrated 0 to 20 L/min range rotameter.
    6.10  FTIR Analytical System. Spectrometer and detector, capable of 
measuring formaldehyde, phenol, methanol, COS and CO to the 
predetermined minimum detectable level. The system shall include a 
personal computer with compatible software that provides real-time 
updates of the spectral profile during sample collection and spectral 
collection.
    6.11  FTIR Cell Pump. Required for the evacuated sampling technique, 
capable of evacuating the FTIR cell volume within 2 minutes. The FTIR 
cell pump should allow the operator to obtain at least 8 sample spectra 
in 1 hour.
    6.12  Absolute Pressure Gauge. Heatable and capable of measuring 
pressure from 0 to 1000 mmHg to within <plus-minus>2.5 mmHg (e.g., 
Baratron<SUP>TM</SUP>).
    6.13  Temperature Gauge. Capable of measuring the cell temperature 
to within <plus-minus>2 deg.C.

[[Page 814]]

                       7.0  Reagents and Standards

    7.1  Ethylene (Calibration Transfer Standard). Obtain NIST traceable 
(or Protocol) cylinder gas.
    7.2  Nitrogen. Ultra high purity (UHP) grade.
    7.3  Reference Spectra. Obtain reference spectra for the target 
pollutants at concentrations that bracket (in ppm-meter/K) the emission 
source levels. Also, obtain reference spectra for SF<INF>6</INF> and 
ethylene. Suitable concentrations are 0.0112 to 0.112 (ppm-meter)/K for 
SF<INF>6</INF> and 5.61 (ppm-meter)/K or less for ethylene. The 
reference spectra shall meet the criteria for acceptance outlined in 
Section 2.2.2. The optical density (ppm-meters/K) of the reference 
spectrum must match the optical density of the sample spectrum within 
(less than) 25 percent.

            8.0  Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage

    Sampling should be performed in the following sequence: Collect 
background, collect CTS spectrum, collect samples, collect post-test CTS 
spectrum, verify that two copies of all data were stored on separate 
computer media.
    8.1  Pretest Preparations and Evaluations. Using the procedure in 
Section 4.0 of the FTIR Protocol, determine the optimum sampling system 
configuration for sampling the target pollutants. Table 2 gives some 
example values for AU, DL, and MAU. Based on a study (Reference 1), an 
FTIR system using 1 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> resolution, 22 meter path length, 
and a broad band MCT detector was suitable for meeting the requirements 
in Table 2. Other factors that must be determined are:
    a. Test requirements: AU<INF>i</INF>, CMAX<INF>i</INF>, 
DL<INF>i</INF>, OFU<INF>i</INF>, and t<INF>AN</INF> for each.
    b. Interferants: See Table 1.
    c. Sampling system: L<INF>S</INF>', P<INF>min</INF>, P<INF>S</INF>', 
T<INF>S</INF>', t<INF>SS</INF>, V<INF>SS</INF>; fractional error, MIL.
    d. Analytical regions: 1 through N<INF>m</INF>, FL<INF>m</INF>, 
FC<INF>m</INF>, and FU<INF>m</INF>, plus interferants, FFU<INF>m</INF>, 
FFL<INF>m</INF>, wavenumber range FNU to FNL. See Tables 1 and 2.
    8.1.1  If necessary, sample and acquire an initial spectrum. Then 
determine the proper operational pathlength of the instrument to obtain 
non-saturated absorbances of the target analytes.
    8.1.2  Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 1.
    8.2  Sampling System Leak-check. Leak-check from the probe tip to 
pump outlet as follows: Connect a 0- to 250-mL/min rate meter (rotameter 
or bubble meter) to the outlet of the pump. Close off the inlet to the 
probe, and note the leakage rate. The leakage rate shall be 
<ls-thn-eq>200 mL/min.
    8.3  Analytical System Leak-check.
    8.3.1  For the evacuated sample technique, close the valve to the 
FTIR cell, and evacuate the absorption cell to the minimum absolute 
pressure P<INF>min</INF>. Close the valve to the pump, and determine the 
change in pressure <greek-D>P<INF>v</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.3.2  For both the evacuated sample and purging techniques, 
pressurize the system to about 100 mmHg above atmospheric pressure. 
Isolate the pump and determine the change in pressure 
<greek-D>P<INF>p</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.3.3  Measure the barometric pressure, P<INF>b</INF> in mmHg.
    8.3.4  Determine the percent leak volume %V<INF>L</INF> for the 
signal integration time t<INF>SS</INF> and for <greek-D>P<INF>max</INF>, 
i.e., the larger of <greek-D>P<INF>v</INF> or <greek-D>P<INF>p</INF>, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.047

Where:

50 = 100% divided by the leak-check time of 2 minutes.

    8.3.5  Leak volumes in excess of 4 percent of the sample system 
volume V<INF>SS</INF> are unacceptable.
    8.4  Background Spectrum. Evacuate the gas cell to <ls-thn-eq>5 
mmHg, and fill with dry nitrogen gas to ambient pressure. Verify that no 
significant amounts of absorbing species (for example water vapor and 
CO<INF>2</INF>) are present. Collect a background spectrum, using a 
signal averaging period equal to or greater than the averaging period 
for the sample spectra. Assign a unique file name to the background 
spectrum. Store the spectra of the background interferogram and 
processed single-beam background spectrum on two separate computer media 
(one is used as the back-up). If continuous sampling will be used during 
sample collection, collect the background spectrum with nitrogen gas 
flowing through the cell at the same pressure and temperature as will be 
used during sampling.
    8.5  Pre-Test Calibration Transfer Standard. Evacuate the gas cell 
to <ls-thn-eq>5 mmHg absolute pressure, and fill the FTIR cell to 
atmospheric pressure with the CTS gas. Or, purge the cell with 10 cell 
volumes of CTS gas. Record the spectrum. If continuous sampling will be 
used during sample collection, collect the CTS spectrum with CTS gas 
flowing through the cell at the same pressure and temperature as will be 
used during sampling.

                              8.6  Samples

    8.6.1  Evacuated Samples. Evacuate the absorbance cell to 
<ls-thn-eq>5 mmHg absolute pressure. Fill the cell with flue gas to 
ambient pressure and record the spectrum. Before taking the next sample, 
evacuate the cell until no further evidence of absorption exists. Repeat 
this procedure to collect at least 8 separate spectra (samples) in 1 
hour.
    8.6.2  Purge Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 10 cell volumes of 
flue gas and at least for about 10 minutes. Discontinue the gas

[[Page 815]]

cell purge, isolate the cell, and record the sample spectrum and the 
pressure. Before taking the next sample, purge the cell with 10 cell 
volumes of flue gas.
    8.6.3  Continuous Sampling. Spectra can be collected continuously 
while the FTIR cell is being purged. The sample integration time, 
t<INF>ss</INF>, the sample flow rate through the FTIR gas cell, and the 
total run time must be chosen so that the collected data consist of at 
least 10 spectra with each spectrum being of a separate cell volume of 
flue gas. More spectra can be collected over the run time and the total 
run time (and number of spectra) can be extended as well.

              8.7  Sampling QA, Data Storage and Reporting

    8.7.1  Sample integration times should be sufficient to achieve the 
required signal-to-noise ratios. Obtain an absorbance spectrum by 
filling the cell with nitrogen. Measure the RMSD in each analytical 
region in this absorbance spectrum. Verify that the number of scans is 
sufficient to achieve the target MAU (Table 2).
    8.7.2  Identify all sample spectra with unique file names.
    8.7.3  Store on two separate computer media a copy of sample 
interferograms and processed spectra. The data shall be available to the 
Administrator on request for the length of time specified in the 
applicable regulation.
    8.7.4  For each sample spectrum, document the sampling conditions, 
the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the 
spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, 
temperature, pressure, resolution, integration time), and the spectral 
file name. Keep a hard copy of these data sheets.
    8.8  Signal Transmittance. While sampling, monitor the signal 
transmittance through the instrumental system. If signal transmittance 
(relative to the background) drops below 95 percent in any spectral 
region where the sample does not absorb infrared energy, obtain a new 
background spectrum.
    8.9  Post-run CTS. After each sampling run, record another CTS 
spectrum.

                           8.10  Post-test QA

    8.10.1  Inspect the sample spectra immediately after the run to 
verify that the gas matrix composition was close to the expected 
(assumed) gas matrix.
    8.10.2  Verify that the sampling and instrumental parameters were 
appropriate for the conditions encountered. For example, if the moisture 
is much greater than anticipated, it will be necessary to use a shorter 
path length or dilute the sample.
    8.10.3  Compare the pre and post-run CTS spectra. They shall agree 
to within -5 percent. See FTIR Protocol, Appendix E.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    Follow the quality assurance procedures in the method, including the 
analysis of pre and post-run calibration transfer standards (Sections 
8.5 and 8.9) and the post-test quality assurance procedures in Section 
8.10.

                  10.0  Calibration and Standardization

    10.1  Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The S/N shall be sufficient to 
meet the MAU in each analytical region.
    10.2  Absorbance Pathlength. Verify the absorbance path length by 
comparing CTS spectra to reference spectra of the calibration gas(es). 
See FTIR Protocol, Appendix E.
    10.3  Instrument Resolution. Measure the line width of appropriate 
CTS band(s) and compare to reference CTS spectra to verify instrumental 
resolution.

    a. Data analysis is performed using appropriate reference spectra 
whose concentrations can be verified using CTS spectra. Various 
analytical programs are available to relate sample absorbance to a 
concentration standard. Calculated concentrations should be verified by 
analyzing spectral baselines after mathematically subtracting scaled 
reference spectra from the sample spectra. A

the FTIR Protocol (Sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices).
    b. Correct the calculated concentrations in sample spectra for 
differences in absorption pathlength between the reference and sample 
spectra by:

L<INF>r</INF> = The pathlength associated with the reference spectra.
L<INF>s</INF> = The pathlength associated with the sample spectra.
T<INF>s</INF> = The absolute temperature (K) of the sample gas.
T<INF>r</INF> = The absolute gas temperature (K) at which reference 
          spectra were recorded.

 Method 319--Determination of Filtration Efficiency for Paint Overspray 
                                Arrestors

                       1.0  Scope and Application.

    1.1  This method applies to the determination of the initial, 
particle size dependent, filtration efficiency for paint arrestors over 
the particle diameter range from 0.3 to 10 <greek-m>m. The method 
applies to single and multiple stage paint arrestors or paint arrestor 
media. The method is applicable to efficiency determinations from 0 to 
99 percent. Two test aerosols are used--one liquid phase and one solid 
phase. Oleic acid, a low-volatility liquid (CAS Number 112-80-1), is 
used to simulate the behavior of wet paint overspray. The solid-phase 
aerosol is potassium chloride salt (KCl, CAS Number 7447-40-7) and is 
used to simulate the behavior of a dry overspray. The method is limited 
to determination of the initial, clean filtration efficiency of the 
arrestor. Changes in efficiency (either increase or decrease) due to the 
accumulation of paint overspray on and within the arrestor are not 
evaluated.
    1.2  Efficiency is defined as 1--Penetration (e.g., 70 percent 
efficiency is equal to 0.30 penetration). Penetration is based on the 
ratio of the downstream particle concentration to the upstream 
concentration. It is often more useful, from a mathematical or 
statistical point of view, to discuss the upstream and downstream counts 
in terms of penetration rather than the derived efficiency value. Thus, 
this document uses both penetration and efficiency as appropriate.
    1.3  For a paint arrestor system or subsystem which has been tested 
by this method, adding additional filtration devices to the system or 
subsystem shall be assumed to result in an efficiency of at least that 
of the original system without the requirement for additional testing. 
(For example, if the final stage of a three-stage paint arrestor system 
has been tested by itself, then the addition of the other two stages 
shall be assumed to maintain, as a minimum, the filtration efficiency 
provided by the final stage alone. Thus, in this example, if the final 
stage has been shown to meet the filtration requirements of Table 1 of 
Sec. 63.745 of subpart GG, then the final stage in combination with any 
additional paint arrestor stages also passes the filtration 
requirements.)

                         2.0  Summary of Method.

    2.1  This method applies to the determination of the fractional 
(i.e., particle-size dependent) aerosol penetration of several types of 
paint arrestors. Fractional penetration is

[[Page 817]]

computed from aerosol concentrations measured upstream and downstream of 
an arrestor installed in a laboratory test rig. The aerosol 
concentrations upstream and downstream of the arrestors are measured 
with an aerosol analyzer that simultaneously counts and sizes the 
particles in the aerosol stream. The aerosol analyzer covers the 
particle diameter size range from 0.3 to 10 <greek-m>m in a minimum of 
12 contiguous sizing channels. Each sizing channel covers a narrow range 
of particle diameters. For example, Channel 1 may cover from 0.3 to 0.4 
<greek-m>m, Channel 2 from 0.4 to 0.5 <greek-m>m, * * * By taking the 
ratio of the downstream to upstream counts on a channel by channel 
basis, the penetration is computed for each of the sizing channels.
    2.2  The upstream and downstream aerosol measurements are made while 
injecting the test aerosol into the air stream upstream of the arrestor 
(ambient aerosol is removed with HEPA filters on the inlet of the test 
rig). This test aerosol spans the particle size range from 0.3 to 10 
<greek-m>m and provides sufficient upstream concentration in each of the 
optical particle counter (OPC) sizing channels to allow accurate 
calculation of penetration, down to penetrations of approximately 0.01 
(i.e., 1 percent penetration; 99 percent efficiency). Results are 
presented as a graph and a data table showing the aerodynamic particle 
diameter and the corresponding fractional efficiency.

                            3.0  Definitions.

    Aerodynamic Diameter--diameter of a unit density sphere having the 
same aerodynamic properties as the particle in question.
    Efficiency is defined as equal to 1--Penetration.
    Optical Particle Counter (OPC)--an instrument that counts particles 
by size using light scattering. An OPC gives particle diameters based on 
size, index of refraction, and shape.
    Penetration--the fraction of the aerosol that penetrates the filter 
at a given particle diameter. Penetration equals the downstream 
concentration divided by the upstream concentration.

                           4.0  Interferences.

    4.1  The influence of the known interferences (particle losses) are 
negated by correction of the data using blanks.

                              5.0  Safety.

    5.1  There are no specific safety precautions for this method above 
those of good laboratory practice. This standard does not purport to 
address all of the safety problems, if any, associated with its use. It 
is the responsibility of the user of this method to establish 
appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability 
of regulatory limitations prior to use.

                      6.0  Equipment and Supplies.

    6.1  Test Facility. A schematic diagram of a test duct used in the 
development of the method is shown in Figure 319-1.


[[Page 818]]


[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.008


    6.1.1  The test section, paint spray section, and attached 
transitions are constructed of stainless and galvanized steel. The 
upstream and downstream ducting is 20 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC). The upstream transition provides a 7 deg. angle of expansion to 
provide a uniform air flow distribution to the paint arrestors. Aerosol 
concentration is

[[Page 819]]

measured upstream and downstream of the test section to obtain the 
challenge and penetrating aerosol concentrations, respectively. Because 
the downstream ducting runs back under the test section, the challenge 
and penetrating aerosol taps are located physically near each other, 
thereby facilitating aerosol sampling and reducing sample-line length. 
The inlet nozzles of the upstream and downstream aerosol probes are 
designed to yield isokinetic sampling conditions.
    6.1.2  The configuration and dimensions of the test duct can deviate 
from those of Figure 319-1 provided that the following key elements are 
maintained: the test duct must meet the criteria specified in Table 319-
1; the inlet air is HEPA filtered; the blower is on the upstream side of 
the duct thereby creating a positive pressure in the duct relative to 
the surrounding room; the challenge air has a temperature between 
50 deg. and 100 deg.F and a relative humidity of less than 65 percent; 
the angle of the upstream transition (if used) to the paint arrestor 
must not exceed 7 deg.; the angle of the downstream transition (if used) 
from the paint arrestor must not exceed 30 deg.; the test duct must 
provide a means for mixing the challenge aerosol with the upstream flow 
(in lieu of any mixing device, a duct length of 15 duct diameters 
fulfills this requirement); the test duct must provide a means for 
mixing any penetrating aerosol with the downstream flow (in lieu of any 
mixing device, a duct length of 15 duct diameters fulfills this 
requirement); the test section must provide a secure and leak-free 
mounting for single and multiple stage arrestors; and the test duct may 
utilize a 180 deg. bend in the downstream duct.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.2  Aerosol Generator. The aerosol generator is used to produce a 
stable aerosol covering the particle size range from 0.3 to 10 
<greek-m>m diameter. The generator used in the development of this 
method consists of an air atomizing nozzle positioned at the top of a 
0.30-m (12-in.) diameter, 1.3-m (51-in.) tall, acrylic, transparent, 
spray tower. This tower allows larger sized particles, which would 
otherwise foul the test duct and sample lines, to fall out of the 
aerosol. It also adds drying air to ensure that the KCl droplets dry to 
solid salt particles. After generation, the aerosol passes through an 
aerosol neutralizer (Kr85 radioactive source) to neutralize any 
electrostatic charge on the aerosol (electrostatic charge is an 
unavoidable consequence of most aerosol generation methods). To improve 
the mixing of the aerosol with the air stream, the aerosol is injected 
counter to the airflow. Generators of other designs may be used, but 
they must produce a stable aerosol concentration over the 0.3 to 10 
<greek-m>m diameter size range; provide a means of ensuring the complete 
drying of the KCl aerosol; and utilize a charge neutralizer to 
neutralize any electrostatic charge on the aerosol. The resultant 
challenge aerosol must meet the minimum count per channel and maximum 
concentration criteria of Table 319-1.
    6.3  Installation of Paint Arrestor. The paint arrestor is to be 
installed in the test duct in a manner that precludes air bypassing the 
arrestor. Since arrestor media are often sold unmounted, a mounting 
frame may be used to provide back support for the media in addition to 
sealing it into the duct. The mounting frame for 20 in. x 20 in. 
arrestors will have minimum open internal dimensions of 18 in. square. 
Mounting frames for 24 in. x 24 in. arrestors will have minimum open 
internal dimensions of 22 in. square. The open internal dimensions of 
the mounting frame shall not be less than 75 percent of the approach 
duct dimensions.

[[Page 820]]

    6.4  Optical Particle Counter. The upstream and downstream aerosol 
concentrations are measured with a high-resolution optical particle 
counter (OPC). To ensure comparability of test results, the OPC shall 
utilize an optical design based on wide-angle light scattering and 
provided a minimum of 12 contiguous particle sizing channels from 0.3 to 
10<greek-m>m diameter (based on response to PSL) where, for each 
channel, the ratio of the diameter corresponding to the upper channel 
bound to the lower channel bound must not exceed 1.5.
    6.5  Aerosol Sampling System. The upstream and downstream sample 
lines must be made of rigid electrically-grounded metallic tubing having 
a smooth inside surface, and they must be rigidly secured to prevent 
movement during testing. The upstream and downstream sample lines are to 
be nominally identical in geometry. The use of a short length (100 mm 
maximum) of straight flexible tubing to make the final connection to the 
OPC is acceptable. The inlet nozzles of the upstream and downstream 
probes must be sharp-edged and of appropriate entrance diameter to 
maintain isokinetic sampling within 20 percent of the air velocity.
    6.5.1  The sampling system may be designed to acquire the upstream 
and downstream samples using (a) sequential upstream-downstream sampling 
with a single OPC, (b) simultaneous upstream and downstream sampling 
with two OPC's, or (c) sequential upstream-downstream sampling with two 
OPC's.
    6.5.2  When two particle counters are used to acquire the upstream 
and downstream counts, they must be closely matched in flowrate and 
optical design.
    6.6  Airflow Monitor. The volumetric airflow through the system 
shall be measured with a calibrated orifice plate, flow nozzle, or 
laminar flow element. The measurement device must have an accuracy of 5 
percent or better.
    7.0  Reagents and Standards.
    7.1  The liquid test aerosol is reagent grade, 98 percent pure, 
oleic acid (Table 319-2). The solid test aerosol is KCl aerosolized from 
a solution of KCl in water. In addition to the test aerosol, a 
calibration aerosol of monodisperse polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres is 
used to verify the calibration of the OPC.

           8.0  Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage.

    8.1  In this test, all sampling occurs in real-time, thus no samples 
are collected that require preservation or storage during the test. The 
paint arrestors are shipped and stored to avoid structural damage or 
soiling. Each arrestor may be shipped in its original box from the 
manufacturer or similar cardboard box. Arrestors are stored at the test 
site in a location that keeps them clean and dry. Each arrestor is 
clearly labeled for tracking purposes.

                          9.0  Quality Control.

    9.1  Table 319-1 lists the QC control limits.
    9.2  The standard deviation (<greek-s>) of the penetration (P) for a 
given test at each of the 15 OPC sizing channels is computed from the 
coefficient of variation (CV, the standard deviation divided by the 
mean) of the upstream and downstream measurements as:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.009

For a properly operating system, the standard deviation of the 
penetration is  0.10 at particle diameters from 0.3 to 3 <greek-m>m and 
less than 0.30 at diameters > 3 <greek-m>m.
    9.3  Data Quality Objectives (DQO).
    9.3.1  Fractional Penetration. From the triplicate tests of each 
paint arrestor model, the standard deviation for the penetration 
measurements at each particle size (i.e., for each sizing channel of the 
OPC) is computed as:

[[Page 821]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.010

where P<INF>i</INF> represents an individual penetration measurement, 
and P the average of the 3 (n = 3) individual measurements.
    9.3.2  Bias of the fractional penetration values is determined from 
triplicate no-filter and HEPA filter tests. These tests determine the 
measurement bias at 100 percent penetration and 0 percent penetration, 
respectively.
    9.3.3  PSL-Equivalent Light Scattering Diameter. The precision and 
bias of the OPC sizing determination are based on sampling a known 
diameter of PSL and noting whether the particle counts peak in the 
correct channel of the OPC. This is a pass/fail measurement with no 
calculations involved.
    9.3.4  Airflow. The precision of the measurement must be within 5 
percent of the set point.

                 10.0  Calibration and Standardization.

    10.1  Optical Particle Counter. The OPC must have an up-to-date 
factory calibration. Check the OPC zero at the beginning and end of each 
test by sampling HEPA-filtered air. Verify the sizing accuracy on a 
daily basis (for days when tests are performed) with 1-size PSL spheres.
    10.2  Airflow Measurement. Airflow measurement devices must have an 
accuracy of 5 percent or better. Manometers used in conjunction with the 
orifice plate must be inspected prior to use for proper level, zero, and 
mechanical integrity. Tubing connections to the manometer must be free 
from kinks and have secure connections.
    10.3  Pressure Drop. Measure pressure drop across the paint arrestor 
with an inclined manometer readable to within 0.01 in. H<INF>2</INF>O. 
Prior to use, the level and zero of the manometer, and all tubing 
connections, must be inspected and adjusted as needed.

                            11.0  Procedure.

    11.1  Filtration Efficiency. For both the oleic acid and KCl 
challenges, this procedure is performed in triplicate using a new 
arrestor for each test.

needed.
    11.1.2  Clean Efficiency Test.
    11.1.2.1  Record the date and time upon beginning this section.
    11.1.2.2  Optical Particle Counter.
    11.1.2.2.1  General: Operate the OPC per the manufacturer's 
instructions allowing a minimum of 20 minutes warm up before making any 
measurements.
    11.1.2.2.2  Overload: The OPC will yield inaccurate data if the 
aerosol concentration it is attempting to measure exceeds its operating 
limit. To ensure reliable measurements, the maximum aerosol 
concentration will not exceed 10 percent of the manufacturer's claimed 
upper concentration limit corresponding to a 10 percent count error. If 
this value is exceeded, reduce the aerosol concentration until the 
acceptable conditions are met.
    11.1.2.2.3  Zero Count: Connect a HEPA capsule to the inlet of the 
OPC and obtain printouts for three samples (each a minimum of 1-minute 
each). Record maximum cumulative zero count. If the count rate exceeds 
50 counts per minute, the OPC requires servicing before continuing.
    11.1.2.2.4  PSL Check of OPC Calibration: Confirm the calibration of 
the OPC by sampling a known size PSL aerosol. Aerosolize the PSL using 
an appropriate nebulizer. Record whether the peak count is observed in 
the proper channel. If the peak is not seen in the appropriate channel, 
have the OPC recalibrated.
    11.1.2.3  Test Conditions:
    11.1.2.3.1  Airflow: The test airflow corresponds to a nominal face 
velocity of 120 FPM through the arrestor. For arrestors having nominal 
20 in. x 20 in. face dimensions, this measurement corresponds to an 
airflow of 333 cfm. For arrestors having nominal face dimensions of 24 
in. x 24 in., this measurement corresponds to an airflow of 480 cfm.
    11.1.2.3.2  Temperature and Relative Humidity: The temperature and 
relative humidity of the challenge air stream will be measured to within 
an accuracy of +/-2 deg.F and +/-10 percent RH. To protect the probe 
from fouling, it may be removed during periods of aerosol generation.
    11.1.2.3.3  Barometric Pressure: Use a mercury barometer. Record the 
atmospheric pressure.
    11.1.2.4  Upstream and Downstream Background Counts.
    11.1.2.4.1  With the arrestor installed in the test duct and the 
airflow set at the proper value, turn on the data acquisition computer 
and bring up the data acquisition program.
    11.1.2.4.2  Set the OPC settings for the appropriate test sample 
duration with output for both printer and computer data collection.
    11.1.2.4.3  Obtain one set of upstream-downstream background 
measurements.
    11.1.2.4.4  After obtaining the upstream-downstream measurements, 
stop data acquisition.
    11.1.2.5  Efficiency Measurements:
    11.1.2.5.1  Record the arrestor pressure drop.
    11.1.2.5.2  Turn on the Aerosol Generator. Begin aerosol generation 
and record the operating parameters.
    11.1.2.5.3  Monitor the particle counts. Allow a minimum of 5 
minutes for the generator to stabilize.
    11.1.2.5.4  Confirm that the total particle count does not exceed 
the predetermined upper limit. Adjust generator as needed.
    11.1.2.5.5  Confirm that a minimum of 50 particle counts are 
measured in the upstream sample in each of the OPC channels per sample. 
(A minimum of 50 counts per channel per sample will yield the required 
minimum 500 counts per channel total for the 10 upstream samples as 
specified in Table 319-1.) Adjust generator or sample time as needed.
    11.1.2.5.6  If you are unable to obtain a stable concentration 
within the concentration limit and with the 50 count minimum per 
channel, adjust the aerosol generator.
    11.1.2.5.7  When the counts are stable, perform repeated upstream-
downstream sampling until 10 upstream-downstream measurements are 
obtained.
    11.1.2.5.8  After collection of the 10 upstream-downstream samples, 
stop data acquisition and allow 2 more minutes for final purging of 
generator.
    11.1.2.5.9  Obtain one additional set of upstream-downstream 
background samples.
    11.1.2.5.10  After obtaining the upstream-downstream background 
samples, stop data acquisition.
    11.1.2.5.11  Record the arrestor pressure drop.
    11.1.2.5.12  Turn off blower.
    11.1.2.5.13  Remove the paint arrestor assembly from the test duct. 
Note any signs of physical deterioration.
    11.1.2.5.14  Remove the arrestor from the frame and place the 
arrestor in an appropriate storage bag.
    11.2  Control Test: 100 Percent Penetration Test. A 100 percent 
penetration test must be performed immediately before each individual 
paint arrestor test using the same challenge aerosol substance (i.e., 
oleic acid or KCl) as to be used in the arrestor test. These tests are 
performed with no arrestor installed in the test housing. This test is a 
relatively stringent test of the adequacy of the overall duct, sampling, 
measurement, and aerosol generation system. The test is performed as a 
normal penetration test except the paint arrestor is not used. A perfect 
system would yield a measured penetration of 1 at all particle sizes. 
Deviations from 1

[[Page 823]]

can occur due to particle losses in the duct, differences in the degree 
of aerosol uniformity (i.e., mixing) at the upstream and downstream 
probes, and differences in particle transport efficiency in the upstream 
and downstream sampling lines.
    11.3  Control Test: 0 Percent Penetration. One 0 percent penetration 
test must be performed at least monthly during testing. The test is 
performed by using a HEPA filter rather than a paint arrestor. This test 
assesses the adequacy of the instrument response time and sample line 
lag.

                  12.0  Data Analysis and Calculations.

    12.1  Analysis. The analytical procedures for the fractional 
penetration and flow velocity measurements are described in Section 11. 
Note that the primary measurements, those of the upstream and downstream 
aerosol concentrations, are performed with the OPC which acquires the 
sample and analyzes it in real time. Because all the test data are 
collected in real time, there are no analytical procedures performed 
subsequent to the actual test, only data analysis.
    12.2  Calculations.
    12.2.1  Penetration.

   Test Method 320--Measurement of Vapor Phase Organic and Inorganic 
 Emissions by Extractive Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy

                           1.0  Introduction.

    Persons unfamiliar with basic elements of FTIR spectroscopy should 
not attempt to use this method. This method describes sampling and 
analytical procedures for extractive emission measurements using Fourier 
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Detailed analytical procedures 
for interpreting infrared spectra are described in the ``Protocol for 
the Use of Extractive Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry in 
Analyses of Gaseous Emissions from Stationary Sources,'' hereafter 
referred to as the ``Protocol.'' Definitions not given in this method 
are given in appendix A of the Protocol. References to specific sections 
in the Protocol are made throughout this Method. For additional 
information refer to references 1 and 2, and other EPA reports, which 
describe the use of FTIR spectrometry in specific field measurement 
applications and validation tests. The sampling procedure described here 
is extractive. Flue gas is extracted through a heated gas transport and 
handling system. For some sources, sample conditioning systems may be 
applicable. Some examples are given in this method.

    Note: sample conditioning systems may be used providing the method 
validation requirements in Sections 9.2 and 13.0 of this method are met.

                      1.1  Scope and Applicability.

    1.1.1  Analytes. Analytes include hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) 
for which EPA reference spectra have been developed. Other compounds can 
also be measured with this method if reference spectra are prepared 
according to section 4.6 of the protocol.
    1.1.2  Applicability. This method applies to the analysis of vapor 
phase organic or inorganic compounds which absorb energy in the mid-
infrared spectral region, about 400 to 4000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (25 to 2.5 
<greek-m>m). This method is used to determine compound-specific 
concentrations in a multi-component vapor phase sample, which is 
contained in a closed-path gas cell. Spectra of samples are collected 
using double beam infrared absorption spectroscopy. A computer program 
is used to analyze spectra and report compound concentrations.
    1.2  Method Range and Sensitivity. Analytical range and sensitivity 
depend on the frequency-dependent analyte absorptivity, instrument 
configuration, data collection parameters, and gas stream composition. 
Instrument factors include: (a) spectral resolution, (b) interferometer 
signal averaging time, (c) detector sensitivity and response, and (d) 
absorption path length.
    1.2.1  For any optical configuration the analytical range is between 
the absorbance values of about .01 (infrared transmittance relative to 
the background = 0.98) and 1.0
(T = 0.1). (For absorbance > 1.0 the relation between absorbance and 
concentration may not be linear.)
    1.2.2  The concentrations associated with this absorbance range 
depend primarily on the cell path length and the sample temperature. An 
analyte absorbance greater than 1.0, can be lowered by decreasing the 
optical path length. Analyte absorbance increases with a longer path 
length. Analyte detection also depends on the presence of other species 
exhibiting absorbance in the same analytical

[[Page 825]]

region. Additionally, the estimated lower absorbance (A) limit
(A = 0.01) depends on the root mean square deviation (RMSD) noise in the 
analytical region.
    1.2.3  The concentration range of this method is determined by the 
choice of optical configuration.
    1.2.3.1  The absorbance for a given concentration can be decreased 
by decreasing the path length or by diluting the sample. There is no 
practical upper limit to the measurement range.
    1.2.3.2  The analyte absorbance for a given concentration may be 
increased by increasing the cell path length or (to some extent) using a 
higher resolution. Both modifications also cause a corresponding 
increased absorbance for all compounds in the sample, and a decrease in 
the signal throughput. For this reason the practical lower detection 
range (quantitation limit) usually depends on sample characteristics 
such as moisture content of the gas, the presence of other interferants, 
and losses in the sampling system.
    1.3  Sensitivity. The limit of sensitivity for an optical 
configuration and integration time is determined using appendix D of the 
Protocol: Minimum Analyte Uncertainty, (MAU). The MAU depends on the 
RMSD noise in an analytical region, and on the absorptivity of the 
analyte in the same region.
    1.4  Data Quality. Data quality shall be determined by executing 
Protocol pre-test procedures in appendices B to H of the protocol and 
post-test procedures in appendices I and J of the protocol.
    1.4.1  Measurement objectives shall be established by the choice of 
detection limit (DL<INF>i</INF>) and analytical uncertainty 
(AU<INF>i</INF>) for each analyte.
    1.4.2  An instrumental configuration shall be selected. An estimate 
of gas composition shall be made based on previous test data, data from 
a similar source or information gathered in a pre-test site survey. 
Spectral interferants shall be identified using the selected 
DL<INF>i</INF> and AU<INF>i</INF> and band areas from reference spectra 
and interferant spectra. The baseline noise of the system shall be 
measured in each analytical region to determine the MAU of the 
instrument configuration for each analyte and interferant 
(MIU<INF>i</INF>).
    1.4.3  Data quality for the application shall be determined, in 
part, by measuring the RMS (root mean square) noise level in each 
analytical spectral region (appendix C of the Protocol). The RMS noise 
is defined as the RMSD of the absorbance values in an analytical region 
from the mean absorbance value in the region.
    1.4.4  The MAU is the minimum analyte concentration for which the 
AU<INF>i</INF> can be maintained; if the measured analyte concentration 
is less than MAU<INF>i</INF> then data quality are unacceptable.

                         2.0  Summary of Method

    2.1  Principle. References 4 through 7 provide background material 
on infrared spectroscopy and quantitative analysis. A summary is given 
in this section.
    2.1.1  Infrared absorption spectroscopy is performed by directing an 
infrared beam through a sample to a detector. The frequency-dependent 
infrared absorbance of the sample is measured by comparing this detector 
signal (single beam spectrum) to a signal obtained without a sample in 
the beam path (background).
    2.1.2  Most molecules absorb infrared radiation and the absorbance 
occurs in a characteristic and reproducible pattern. The infrared 
spectrum measures fundamental molecular properties and a compound can be 
identified from its infrared spectrum alone.
    2.1.3  Within constraints, there is a linear relationship between 
infrared absorption and compound concentration. If this frequency 
dependent relationship (absorptivity) is known (measured), it can be 
used to determine compound concentration in a sample mixture.
    2.1.4  Absorptivity is measured by preparing, in the laboratory, 
standard samples of compounds at known concentrations and measuring the 
FTIR ``reference spectra'' of these standard samples. These ``reference 
spectra'' are then used in sample analysis: (1) Compounds are detected 
by matching sample absorbance bands with bands in reference spectra, and 
(2) concentrations are measured by comparing sample band intensities 
with reference band intensities.
    2.1.5  This method is self-validating provided that the results meet 
the performance requirement of the QA spike in sections 8.6.2 and 9.0 of 
this method, and results from a previous method validation study support 
the use of this method in the application.
    2.2  Sampling and Analysis. In extractive sampling a probe assembly 
and pump are used to extract gas from the exhaust of the affected source 
and transport the sample to the FTIR gas cell. Typically, the sampling 
apparatus is similar to that used for single-component continuous 
emission monitor (CEM) measurements.
    2.2.1  The digitized infrared spectrum of the sample in the FTIR gas 
cell is measured and stored on a computer. Absorbance band intensities 
in the spectrum are related to sample concentrations by what is commonly 
referred to as Beer's Law.

Where:

A<INF>i</INF> = absorbance at a given frequency of the ith sample 
          component.
a<INF>i</INF> = absorption coefficient (absorptivity) of the ith sample 
          component.
b = path length of the cell.

[[Page 826]]

c<INF>i</INF> = concentration of the ith sample component.

    2.2.2  Analyte spiking is used for quality assurance (QA). In this 
procedure (section 8.6.2 of this method) an analyte is spiked into the 
gas stream at the back end of the sample probe. Analyte concentrations 
in the spiked samples are compared to analyte concentrations in unspiked 
samples. Since the concentration of the spike is known, this procedure 
can be used to determine if the sampling system is removing the spiked 
analyte(s) from the sample stream.
    2.3  Reference Spectra Availability. Reference spectra of over 100 
HAPs are available in the EPA FTIR spectral library on the EMTIC 
(Emission Measurement Technical Information Center) computer bulletin 
board service and at internet address http://info.arnold.af.mil/epa/
welcome.htm. Reference spectra for HAPs, or other analytes, may also be 
prepared according to section 4.6 of the Protocol.
    2.4  Operator Requirements. The FTIR analyst shall be trained in 
setting up the instrumentation, verifying the instrument is functioning 
properly, and performing routine maintenance. The analyst must evaluate 
the initial sample spectra to determine if the sample matrix is 
consistent with pre-test assumptions and if the instrument configuration 
is suitable. The analyst must be able to modify the instrument 
configuration, if necessary.
    2.4.1  The spectral analysis shall be supervised by someone familiar 
with EPA FTIR Protocol procedures.
    2.4.2  A technician trained in instrumental test methods is 
qualified to install and operate the sampling system. This includes 
installing the probe and heated line assembly, operating the analyte 
spike system, and performing moisture and flow measurements.

                            3.0  Definitions

    See appendix A of the Protocol for definitions relating to infrared 
spectroscopy. Additional definitions are given in sections 3.1 through 
3.29.
    3.1  Analyte. A compound that this method is used to measure. The 
term ``target analyte'' is also used. This method is multi-component and 
a number of analytes can be targeted for a test.
    3.2  Reference Spectrum. Infrared spectrum of an analyte prepared 
under controlled, documented, and reproducible laboratory conditions 
according to procedures in section 4.6 of the Protocol. A library of 
reference spectra is used to measure analytes in gas samples.
    3.3  Standard Spectrum. A spectrum that has been prepared from a 
reference spectrum through a (documented) mathematical operation. A 
common example is de-resolving of reference spectra to lower-resolution 
standard spectra (Protocol, appendix K to the addendum of this method). 
Standard spectra, prepared by approved, and documented, procedures can 
be used as reference spectra for analysis.
    3.4  Concentration. In this method concentration is expressed as a 
molar concentration, in ppm-meters, or in (ppm-meters)/K, where K is the 
absolute temperature (Kelvin). The latter units allow the direct 
comparison of concentrations from systems using different optical 
configurations or sampling temperatures.
    3.5  Interferant. A compound in the sample matrix whose infrared 
spectrum overlaps with part of an analyte spectrum. The most accurate 
analyte measurements are achieved when reference spectra of interferants 
are used in the quantitative analysis with the analyte reference 
spectra. The presence of an interferant can increase the analytical 
uncertainty in the measured analyte concentration.
    3.6  Gas Cell. A gas containment cell that can be evacuated. It is 
equipped with the optical components to pass the infrared beam through 
the sample to the detector. Important cell features include: path length 
(or range if variable), temperature range, materials of construction, 
and total gas volume.
    3.7  Sampling System. Equipment used to extract the sample from the 
test location and transport the sample gas to the FTIR analyzer. This 
includes sample conditioning systems.
    3.8  Sample Analysis. The process of interpreting the infrared 
spectra to obtain sample analyte concentrations. This process is usually 
automated using a software routine employing a classical least squares 
(cls), partial least squares (pls), or K- or P-matrix method.
    3.9  One hundred percent line. A double beam transmittance spectrum 
obtained by combining two background single beam spectra. Ideally, this 
line is equal to 100 percent transmittance (or zero absorbance) at every 
frequency in the spectrum. Practically, a zero absorbance line is used 
to measure the baseline noise in the spectrum.
    3.10  Background Deviation. A deviation from 100 percent 
transmittance in any region of the 100 percent line. Deviations greater 
than <plus-minus>5 percent in an analytical region are unacceptable 
(absorbance of 0.021 to -0.022). Such deviations indicate a change in 
the instrument throughput relative to the background single beam.
    3.11  Batch Sampling. A procedure where spectra of discreet, static 
samples are collected. The gas cell is filled with sample and the cell 
is isolated. The spectrum is collected. Finally, the cell is evacuated 
to prepare for the next sample.
    3.12  Continuous Sampling. A procedure where spectra are collected 
while sample gas

[[Page 827]]

is flowing through the cell at a measured rate.
    3.13  Sampling resolution. The spectral resolution used to collect 
sample spectra.
    3.14  Truncation. Limiting the number of interferogram data points 
by deleting points farthest from the center burst (zero path difference, 
ZPD).
    3.15  Zero filling. The addition of points to the interferogram. The 
position of each added point is interpolated from neighboring real data 
points. Zero filling adds no information to the interferogram, but 
affects line shapes in the absorbance spectrum (and possibly analytical 
results).
    3.16  Reference CTS. Calibration Transfer Standard spectra that were 
collected with reference spectra.
    3.17  CTS Standard. CTS spectrum produced by applying a de-
resolution procedure to a reference CTS.
    3.18  Test CTS. CTS spectra collected at the sampling resolution 
using the same optical configuration as for sample spectra. Test spectra 
help verify the resolution, temperature and path length of the FTIR 
system.
    3.19  RMSD. Root Mean Square Difference, defined in EPA FTIR 
Protocol, appendix A.
    3.20  Sensitivity. The noise-limited compound-dependent detection 
limit for the FTIR system configuration. This is estimated by the MAU. 
It depends on the RMSD in an analytical region of a zero absorbance 
line.
    3.21  Quantitation Limit. The lower limit of detection for the FTIR 
system configuration in the sample spectra. This is estimated by 
mathematically subtracting scaled reference spectra of analytes and 
interferences from sample spectra, then measuring the RMSD in an 
analytical region of the subtracted spectrum. Since the noise in 
subtracted sample spectra may be much greater than in a zero absorbance 
spectrum, the quantitation limit is generally much higher than the 
sensitivity. Removing spectral interferences from the sample or 
improving the spectral subtraction can lower the quantitation limit 
toward (but not below) the sensitivity.
    3.22  Independent Sample. A unique volume of sample gas; there is no 
mixing of gas between two consecutive independent samples. In continuous 
sampling two independent samples are separated by at least 5 cell 
volumes. The interval between independent measurements depends on the 
cell volume and the sample flow rate (through the cell).
    3.23  Measurement. A single spectrum of flue gas contained in the 
FTIR cell.
    3.24  Run. A run consists of a series of measurements. At a minimum 
a run includes 8 independent measurements spaced over 1 hour.
    3.25  Validation. Validation of FTIR measurements is described in 
sections 13.0 through 13.4 of this method. Validation is used to verify 
the test procedures for measuring specific analytes at a source. 
Validation provides proof that the method works under certain test 
conditions.
    3.26  Validation Run. A validation run consists of at least 24 
measurements of independent samples. Half of the samples are spiked and 
half are not spiked. The length of the run is determined by the interval 
between independent samples.
    3.27  ning. Screening is used when there is little or no available 
information about a source. The purpose of screening is to determine 
what analytes are emitted and to obtain information about important 
sample characteristics such as moisture, temperature, and interferences. 
Screening results are semi-quantitative (estimated concentrations) or 
qualitative (identification only). Various optical and sampling 
configurations may be used. Sample conditioning systems may be evaluated 
for their effectiveness in removing interferences. It is unnecessary to 
perform a complete run under any set of sampling conditions. Spiking is 
not necessary, but spiking can be a useful screening tool for evaluating 
the sampling system, especially if a reactive or soluble analyte is used 
for the spike.
    3.28  Emissions Test. An FTIR emissions test is performed according 
specific sampling and analytical procedures. These procedures, for the 
target analytes and the source, are based on previous screening and 
validation results. Emission results are quantitative. A QA spike 
(sections 8.6.2 and 9.2 of this method) is performed under each set of 
sampling conditions using a representative analyte. Flow, gas 
temperature and diluent data are recorded concurrently with the FTIR 
measurements to provide mass emission rates for detected compounds.
    3.29  Surrogate. A surrogate is a compound that is used in a QA 
spike procedure (section 8.6.2 of this method) to represent other 
compounds. The chemical and physical properties of a surrogate shall be 
similar to the compounds it is chosen to represent. Under given sampling 
conditions, usually a single sampling factor is of primary concern for 
measuring the target analytes: for example, the surrogate spike results 
can be representative for analytes that are more reactive, more soluble, 
have a lower absorptivity, or have a lower vapor pressure than the 
surrogate itself.

                           4.0  Interferences

    Interferences are divided into two classifications: analytical and 
sampling.
    4.1  Analytical Interferences. An analytical interference is a 
spectral feature that complicates (in extreme cases may prevent) the 
analysis of an analyte. Analytical interferences are classified as 
background or spectral interference.
    4.1.1  Background Interference. This results from a change in 
throughput relative to the

[[Page 828]]

single beam background. It is corrected by collecting a new background 
and proceeding with the test. In severe instances the cause must be 
identified and corrected. Potential causes include: (1) Deposits on 
reflective surfaces or transmitting windows, (2) changes in detector 
sensitivity, (3) a change in the infrared source output, or (4) failure 
in the instrument electronics. In routine sampling throughput may 
degrade over several hours. Periodically a new background must be 
collected, but no other corrective action will be required.
    4.1.2  Spectral Interference. This results from the presence of 
interfering compound(s) (interferant) in the sample. Interferant 
spectral features overlap analyte spectral features. Any compound with 
an infrared spectrum, including analytes, can potentially be an 
interferant. The Protocol measures absorbance band overlap in each 
analytical region to determine if potential interferants shall be 
classified as known interferants (FTIR Protocol, section 4.9 and 
appendix B). Water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF> are common spectral 
interferants. Both of these compounds have strong infrared spectra and 
are present in many sample matrices at high concentrations relative to 
analytes. The extent of interference depends on the (1) interferant 
concentration, (2) analyte concentration, and (3) the degree of band 
overlap. Choosing an alternate analytical region can minimize or avoid 
the spectral interference. For example, CO<INF>2</INF> interferes with 
the analysis of the 670 cm<INF>-1</INF> benzene band. However, benzene 
can also be measured near 3000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (with less sensitivity).
    4.2  Sampling System Interferences. These prevent analytes from 
reaching the instrument. The analyte spike procedure is designed to 
measure sampling system interference, if any.
    4.2.1  Temperature. A temperature that is too low causes 
condensation of analytes or water vapor. The materials of the sampling 
system and the FTIR gas cell usually set the upper limit of temperature.
    4.2.2  Reactive Species. Anything that reacts with analytes. Some 
analytes, like formaldehyde, polymerize at lower temperatures.
    4.2.3  Materials. Poor choice of material for probe, or sampling 
line may remove some analytes. For example, HF reacts with glass 
components.
    4.2.4  Moisture. In addition to being a spectral interferant, 
condensed moisture removes soluble compounds.

                               5.0  Safety

    The hazards of performing this method are those associated with any 
stack sampling method and the same precautions shall be followed. Many 
HAPs are suspected carcinogens or present other serious health risks. 
Exposure to these compounds should be avoided in all circumstances. For 
instructions on the safe handling of any particular compound, refer to 
its material safety data sheet. When using analyte standards, always 
ensure that gases are properly vented and that the gas handling system 
is leak free. (Always perform a leak check with the system under maximum 
vacuum and, again, with the system at greater than ambient pressure.) 
Refer to section 8.2 of this method for leak check procedures. This 
method does not address all of the potential safety risks associated 
with its use. Anyone performing this method must follow safety and 
health practices consistent with applicable legal requirements and with 
prudent practice for each application.

                       6.0  Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.

    The equipment and supplies are based on the schematic of a sampling 
system shown in Figure 1. Either the batch or continuous sampling 
procedures may be used with this sampling system. Alternative sampling 
configurations may also be used, provided that the data quality 
objectives are met as determined in the post-analysis evaluation. Other 
equipment or supplies may be necessary, depending on the design of the 
sampling system or the specific target analytes.
    6.1  Sampling Probe. Glass, stainless steel, or other appropriate 
material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, 
prevent adsorption of analytes, and to transport analytes to the 
infrared gas cell. Special materials or configurations may be required 
in some applications. For instance, high stack sample temperatures may 
require special steel or cooling the probe. For very high moisture 
sources it may be desirable to use a dilution probe.
    6.2  Particulate Filters. A glass wool plug (optional) inserted at 
the probe tip (for large particulate removal) and a filter (required) 
rated for 99 percent removal efficiency at 1-micron (e.g., Balston'') 
connected at the outlet of the heated probe.
    6.3  Sampling Line/Heating System. Heated (sufficient to prevent 
condensation) stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethane, or other material 
inert to the analytes.
    6.4  Gas Distribution Manifold. A heated manifold allowing the 
operator to control flows of gas standards and samples directly to the 
FTIR system or through sample conditioning systems. Usually includes 
heated flow meter, heated valve for selecting and sending sample to the 
analyzer, and a by-pass vent. This is typically constructed of stainless 
steel tubing and fittings, and high-temperature valves.
    6.5  Stainless Steel Tubing. Type 316, appropriate diameter (e.g., 
3/8 in.) and length for

[[Page 829]]

heated connections. Higher grade stainless may be desirable in some 
applications.
    6.6  Calibration/Analyte Spike Assembly. A three way valve assembly 
(or equivalent) to introduce analyte or surrogate spikes into the 
sampling system at the outlet of the probe upstream of the out-of-stack 
particulate filter and the FTIR analytical system.
    6.7  Mass Flow Meter (MFM). These are used for measuring analyte 
spike flow. The MFM shall be calibrated in the range of 0 to 5 L/min and 
be accurate to <plus-minus> 2 percent (or better) of the flow meter 
span.
    6.8  Gas Regulators. Appropriate for individual gas standards.
    6.9  Polytetrafluoroethane Tubing. Diameter (e.g., \3/8\ in.) and 
length suitable to connect cylinder regulators to gas standard manifold.
    6.10  Sample Pump. A leak-free pump (e.g., KNF<SUP>TM</SUP>), with 
by-pass valve, capable of producing a sample flow rate of at least 10 L/
min through 100 ft of sample line. If the pump is positioned upstream of 
the distribution manifold and FTIR system, use a heated pump that is 
constructed from materials non-reactive to the analytes. If the pump is 
located downstream of the FTIR system, the gas cell sample pressure will 
be lower than ambient pressure and it must be recorded at regular 
intervals.
    6.11  Gas Sample Manifold. Secondary manifold to control sample flow 
at the inlet to the FTIR manifold. This is optional, but includes a by-
pass vent and heated rotameter.
    6.12  Rotameter. A 0 to 20 L/min rotameter. This meter need not be 
calibrated.
    6.13  FTIR Analytical System. Spectrometer and detector, capable of 
measuring the analytes to the chosen detection limit. The system shall 
include a personal computer with compatible software allowing automated 
collection of spectra.
    6.14  FTIR Cell Pump. Required for the batch sampling technique, 
capable of evacuating the FTIR cell volume within 2 minutes. The pumping 
speed shall allow the operator to obtain 8 sample spectra in 1 hour.
    6.15  Absolute Pressure Gauge. Capable of measuring pressure from 0 
to 1000 mmHg to within<plus-minus> 2.5 mmHg (e.g., 
Baratron<SUP>TM</SUP>).
    6.16  Temperature Gauge. Capable of measuring the cell temperature 
to within <plus-minus> 2 deg.C.
    6.17  Sample Conditioning. One option is a condenser system, which 
is used for moisture removal. This can be helpful in the measurement of 
some analytes. Other sample conditioning procedures may be devised for 
the removal of moisture or other interfering species.
    6.17.1  The analyte spike procedure of section 9.2 of this method, 
the QA spike procedure of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the 
validation procedure of section 13 of this method demonstrate whether 
the sample conditioning affects analyte concentrations. Alternatively, 
measurements can be made with two parallel FTIR systems; one measuring 
conditioned sample, the other measuring unconditioned sample.
    6.17.2  Another option is sample dilution. The dilution factor 
measurement must be documented and accounted for in the reported 
concentrations. An alternative to dilution is to lower the sensitivity 
of the FTIR system by decreasing the cell path length, or to use a 
short-path cell in conjunction with a long path cell to measure more 
than one concentration range.

                       7.0  Reagents and Standards

    7.1  Analyte(s) and Tracer Gas. Obtain a certified gas cylinder 
mixture containing all of the analyte(s) at concentrations 
within<plus-minus> 2 percent of the emission source levels (expressed in 
ppm-meter/K). If practical, the analyte standard cylinder shall also 
contain the tracer gas at a concentration which gives a measurable 
absorbance at a dilution factor of at least 10:1. Two ppm SF<INF>6</INF> 
is sufficient for a path length of 22 meters at 250  deg.F.
    7.2  Calibration Transfer Standard(s). Select the calibration 
transfer standards (CTS) according to section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol. 
Obtain a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable 
gravimetric standard of the CTS (<plus-minus> 2 percent).
    7.3  Reference Spectra. Obtain reference spectra for each analyte, 
interferant, surrogate, CTS, and tracer. If EPA reference spectra are 
not available, use reference spectra prepared according to procedures in 
section 4.6 of the EPA FTIR Protocol.

                  8.0  Sampling and Analysis Procedure

    Three types of testing can be performed: (1) Screening, (2) 
emissions test, and (3) validation. Each is defined in section 3 of this 
method. Determine the purpose(s) of the FTIR test. Test requirements 
include: (a) AU<INF>i</INF>, DL<INF>i</INF>, overall fractional 
uncertainty, OFU<INF>i</INF>, maximum expected concentration 
(CMAX<INF>i</INF>), and t<INF>AN</INF> for each, (b) potential 
interferants, (c) sampling system factors, e.g., minimum absolute cell 
pressure, (P<INF>min</INF>), FTIR cell volume (V<INF>SS</INF>), 
estimated sample absorption pathlength, L<INF>S</INF>', estimated sample 
pressure, P<INF>S</INF>', T<INF>S</INF>', signal integration time 
(t<INF>SS</INF>), minimum instrumental linewidth, MIL, fractional error, 
and (d) analytical regions, e.g., m = 1 to M, lower wavenumber position, 
FLm, center wavenumber position, FC<INF>m</INF>, and upper wavenumber 
position, FU<INF>m</INF>, plus interferants, upper wavenumber position 
of the CTS absorption band, FFU<INF>m</INF>, lower wavenumber position 
of the CTS absorption band, FFL<INF>m</INF>, wavenumber range FNU to 
FNL. If necessary, sample and acquire an initial spectrum. From analysis 
of this preliminary spectrum determine a suitable operational path 
length. Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 1 or use an 
appropriate alternative configuration. Sections 8.1 through 8.11 of this 
method provide guidance on pre-

[[Page 830]]

test calculations in the EPA protocol, sampling and analytical 
procedures, and post-test protocol calculations.
    8.1  Pretest Preparations and Evaluations. Using the procedure in 
section 4.0 of the FTIR Protocol, determine the optimum sampling system 
configuration for measuring the target analytes. Use available 
information to make reasonable assumptions about moisture content and 
other interferences.
    8.1.1  Analytes. Select the required detection limit 
(DL<INF>i</INF>) and the maximum permissible analytical uncertainty 
(AU<INF>i</INF>) for each analyte (labeled from 1 to i). Estimate, if 
possible, the maximum expected concentration for each analyte, 
CMAX<INF>i</INF>. The expected measurement range is fixed by 
DL<INF>i</INF> and CMAX<INF>i</INF> for each analyte (i).
    8.1.2  Potential Interferants. List the potential interferants. This 
usually includes water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF>, but may also include 
some analytes and other compounds.
    8.1.3.  Optical Configuration. Choose an optical configuration that 
can measure all of the analytes within the absorbance range of .01 to 
1.0 (this may require more than one path length). Use Protocol sections 
4.3 to 4.8 for guidance in choosing a configuration and measuring CTS.
    8.1.4  Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainty (FRU<INF>i</INF>). The 
FRU is determined for each analyte by comparing CTS spectra taken before 
and after the reference spectra were measured. The EPA para-xylene 
reference spectra were collected on 10/31/91 and 11/01/91 with 
corresponding CTS spectra ``cts1031a,'' and ``cts1101b.'' The CTS 
spectra are used to estimate the reproducibility (FRU) in the system 
that was used to collect the references. The FRU must be AU. Appendix E 
of the protocol is used to calculate the FRU from CTS spectra. Figure 2 
plots results for 0.25 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> CTS spectra in EPA reference 
library: S<INF>3</INF> (cts1101b-cts1031a), and S<INF>4</INF> 
[(cts1101b+cts1031a)/2]. The RMSD (SRMS) is calculated in the subtracted 
baseline, S<INF>3</INF>, in the corresponding CTS region from 850 to 
1065 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The area (BAV) is calculated in the same region of 
the averaged CTS spectrum, S<INF>4</INF>.
    8.1.5  Known Interferants. Use appendix B of the EPA FTIR Protocol.
    8.1.6  Calculate the Minimum Analyte Uncertainty, MAU (section 1.3 
of this method discusses MAU and protocol appendix D gives the MAU 
procedure). The MAU for each analyte, i, and each analytical region, m, 
depends on the RMS noise.
    8.1.7  Analytical Program. See FTIR Protocol, section 4.10. Prepare 
computer program based on the chosen analytical technique. Use as input 
reference spectra of all target analytes and expected interferants. 
Reference spectra of additional compounds shall also be included in the 
program if their presence (even if transient) in the samples is 
considered possible. The program output shall be in ppm (or ppb) and 
shall be corrected for differences between the reference path length, 
L<INF>R</INF>, temperature, T<INF>R</INF>, and pressure, P<INF>R</INF>, 
and the conditions used for collecting the sample spectra. If sampling 
is performed at ambient pressure, then any pressure correction is 
usually small relative to corrections for path length and temperature, 
and may be neglected.

                             8.2  Leak-Check

    8.2.1  Sampling System. A typical FTIR extractive sampling train is 
shown in Figure 1. Leak check from the probe tip to pump outlet as 
follows: Connect a 0-to 250-mL/min rate meter (rotameter or bubble 
meter) to the outlet of the pump. Close off the inlet to the probe, and 
record the leak rate. The leak rate shall be <ls-thn-eq>200 mL/min.
    8.2.2  Analytical System Leak check. Leak check the FTIR cell under 
vacuum and under pressure (greater than ambient). Leak check connecting 
tubing and inlet manifold under pressure.
    8.2.2.1  For the evacuated sample technique, close the valve to the 
FTIR cell, and evacuate the absorption cell to the minimum absolute 
pressure P<INF>min</INF>. Close the valve to the pump, and determine the 
change in pressure <triangle>P<INF>v</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.2.2.2  For both the evacuated sample and purging techniques, 
pressurize the system to about 100 mmHg above atmospheric pressure. 
Isolate the pump and determine the change in pressure 
<triangle>P<INF>p</INF> after 2 minutes.
    8.2.2.3  Measure the barometric pressure, P<INF>b</INF> in mmHg.
    8.2.2.4  Determine the percent leak volume %V<INF>L</INF> for the 
signal integration time t<INF>SS</INF> and for 
<triangle>P<INF>max</INF>, i.e., the larger of <triangle>P<INF>v</INF> 
or <triangle>P<INF>p</INF>, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.004

where 50 = 100% divided by the leak-check time of 2 minutes. 8.2.2.5 
Leak volumes in excess of 4 percent of the FTIR system volume 
V<INF>SS</INF> are unacceptable.
    8.3  Detector Linearity. Once an optical configuration is chosen, 
use one of the procedures of sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.3 to verify that 
the detector response is linear. If the detector response is not linear, 
decrease the aperture, or attenuate the infrared beam. After a change in 
the instrument configuration perform a linearity check until it is 
demonstrated that the detector response is linear.
    8.3.1  Vary the power incident on the detector by modifying the 
aperture setting. Measure the background and CTS at three instrument 
aperture settings: (1) at the aperture setting to be used in the 
testing, (2) at one half this aperture and (3) at twice the proposed 
testing aperture. Compare the

[[Page 831]]

three CTS spectra. CTS band areas shall agree to within the uncertainty 
of the cylinder standard and the RMSD noise in the system. If test 
aperture is the maximum aperture, collect CTS spectrum at maximum 
aperture, then close the aperture to reduce the IR throughput by half. 
Collect a second background and CTS at the smaller aperture setting and 
compare the spectra again.
    8.3.2  Use neutral density filters to attenuate the infrared beam. 
Set up the FTIR system as it will be used in the test measurements. 
Collect a CTS spectrum. Use a neutral density filter to attenuate the 
infrared beam (either immediately after the source or the 
interferometer) to approximately \1/2\ its original intensity. Collect a 
second CTS spectrum. Use another filter to attenuate the infrared beam 
to approximately \1/4\ its original intensity. Collect a third 
background and CTS spectrum. Compare the CTS spectra. CTS band areas 
shall agree to within the uncertainty of the cylinder standard and the 
RMSD noise in the system.
    8.3.3  Observe the single beam instrument response in a frequency 
region where the detector response is known to be zero. Verify that the 
detector response is ``flat'' and equal to zero in these regions.
    8.4  Data Storage Requirements. All field test spectra shall be 
stored on a computer disk and a second backup copy must stored on a 
separate disk. The stored information includes sample interferograms, 
processed absorbance spectra, background interferograms, CTS sample 
interferograms and CTS absorbance spectra. Additionally, documentation 
of all sample conditions, instrument settings, and test records must be 
recorded on hard copy or on computer medium. Table 1 gives a sample 
presentation of documentation.
    8.5  Background Spectrum. Evacuate the gas cell to <ls-thn-eq>5 
mmHg, and fill with dry nitrogen gas to ambient pressure (or purge the 
cell with 10 volumes of dry nitrogen). Verify that no significant 
amounts of absorbing species (for example water vapor and 
CO<INF>2</INF>) are present. Collect a background spectrum, using a 
signal averaging period equal to or greater than the averaging period 
for the sample spectra. Assign a unique file name to the background 
spectrum. Store two copies of the background interferogram and processed 
single-beam spectrum on separate computer disks (one copy is the back-
up).
    8.5.1  Interference Spectra. If possible, collect spectra of known 
and suspected major interferences using the same optical system that 
will be used in the field measurements. This can be done on-site or 
earlier. A number of gases, e.g. CO<INF>2</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, CO, 
NH<INF>3</INF>, are readily available from cylinder gas suppliers.
    8.5.2  Water vapor spectra can be prepared by the following 
procedure. Fill a sample tube with distilled water. Evacuate above the 
sample and remove dissolved gasses by alternately freezing and thawing 
the water while evacuating. Allow water vapor into the FTIR cell, then 
dilute to atmospheric pressure with nitrogen or dry air. If quantitative 
water spectra are required, follow the reference spectrum procedure for 
neat samples (protocol, section 4.6). Often, interference spectra need 
not be quantitative, but for best results the absorbance must be 
comparable to the interference absorbance in the sample spectra.

                       8.6  Pre-Test Calibrations

    8.6.1  Calibration Transfer Standard. Evacuate the gas cell to 
<ls-thn-eq> 5 mmHg absolute pressure, and fill the FTIR cell to 
atmospheric pressure with the CTS gas. Alternatively, purge the cell 
with 10 cell volumes of CTS gas. (If purge is used, verify that the CTS 
concentration in the cell is stable by collecting two spectra 2 minutes 
apart as the CTS gas continues to flow. If the absorbance in the second 
spectrum is no greater than in the first, within the uncertainty of the 
gas standard, then this can be used as the CTS spectrum.) Record the 
spectrum.
    8.6.2  QA Spike. This procedure assumes that the method has been 
validated for at least some of the target analytes at the source. For 
emissions testing perform a QA spike. Use a certified standard, if 
possible, of an analyte, which has been validated at the source. One 
analyte standard can serve as a QA surrogate for other analytes which 
are less reactive or less soluble than the standard. Perform the spike 
procedure of section 9.2 of this method. Record spectra of at least 
three independent (section 3.22 of this method) spiked samples. 
Calculate the spiked component of the analyte concentration. If the 
average spiked concentration is within 0.7 to 1.3 times the expected 
concentration, then proceed with the testing. If applicable, apply the 
correction factor from the Method 301 of this appendix validation test 
(not the result from the QA spike).
    8.7  Sampling. If analyte concentrations vary rapidly with time, 
continuous sampling is preferable using the smallest cell volume, 
fastest sampling rate and fastest spectra collection rate possible. 
Continuous sampling requires the least operator intervention even 
without an automated sampling system. For continuous monitoring at one 
location over long periods, Continuous sampling is preferred. Batch 
sampling and continuous static sampling are used for screening and 
performing test runs of finite duration. Either technique is preferred 
for sampling several locations in a matter of days. Batch sampling gives 
reasonably good time resolution and ensures that each spectrum measures 
a discreet (and unique) sample volume. Continuous static (and 
continuous) sampling provide a very stable background over long periods. 
Like batch sampling, continuous static

[[Page 832]]

sampling also ensures that each spectrum measures a unique sample 
volume. It is essential that the leak check procedure under vacuum 
(section 8.2 of this method) is passed if the batch sampling procedure 
is used. It is essential that the leak check procedure under positive 
pressure is passed if the continuous static or continuous sampling 
procedures are used. The sampling techniques are described in sections 
8.7.1 through 8.7.2 of this method.
    8.7.1  Batch Sampling. Evacuate the absorbance cell to <ls-thn-eq>5 
mmHg absolute pressure. Fill the cell with exhaust gas to ambient 
pressure, isolate the cell, and record the spectrum. Before taking the 
next sample, evacuate the cell until no spectral evidence of sample 
absorption remains. Repeat this procedure to collect eight spectra of 
separate samples in 1 hour.
    8.7.2  Continuous Static Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 10 cell 
volumes of sample gas. Isolate the cell, collect the spectrum of the 
static sample and record the pressure. Before measuring the next sample, 
purge the cell with 10 more cell volumes of sample gas.

                     8.8  Sampling QA and Reporting

    8.8.1  Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the 
required signal-to-noise ratio. Obtain an absorbance spectrum by filling 
the cell with N2. Measure the RMSD in each analytical region in this 
absorbance spectrum. Verify that the number of scans used is sufficient 
to achieve the target MAU.
    8.8.2  Assign a unique file name to each spectrum.
    8.8.3  Store two copies of sample interferograms and processed 
spectra on separate computer disks.
    8.8.4  For each sample spectrum, document the sampling conditions, 
the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the 
spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, 
temperature, pressure, resolution, signal integration time), and the 
spectral file name. Keep a hard copy of these data sheets.
    8.9  Signal Transmittance. While sampling, monitor the signal 
transmittance. If signal transmittance (relative to the background) 
changes by 5 percent or more (absorbance = -.02 to .02) in any 
analytical spectral region, obtain a new background spectrum.
    8.10  Post-test CTS. After the sampling run, record another CTS 
spectrum.
    8.11  Post-test QA
    8.11.1  Inspect the sample spectra immediately after the run to 
verify that the gas matrix composition was close to the expected 
(assumed) gas matrix.
    8.11.2  Verify that the sampling and instrumental parameters were 
appropriate for the conditions encountered. For example, if the moisture 
is much greater than anticipated, it may be necessary to use a shorter 
path length or dilute the sample.
    8.11.3  Compare the pre- and post-test CTS spectra. The peak 
absorbance in pre- and post-test CTS must be <plus-minus>5 percent of 
the mean value. See appendix E of the FTIR Protocol.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    Use analyte spiking (sections 8.6.2, 9.2 and 13.0 of this method) to 
verify that the sampling system can transport the analytes from the 
probe to the FTIR system.
    9.1  Spike Materials. Use a certified standard (accurate to 
<plus-minus>2 percent) of the target analyte, if one can be obtained. If 
a certified standard cannot be obtained, follow the procedures in 
section 4.6.2.2 of the FTIR Protocol.
    9.2  Spiking Procedure. QA spiking (section 8.6.2 of this method) is 
a calibration procedure used before testing. QA spiking involves 
following the spike procedure of sections 9.2.1 through 9.2.3 of this 
method to obtain at least three spiked samples. The analyte 
concentrations in the spiked samples shall be compared to the expected 
spike concentration to verify that the sampling/analytical system is 
working properly. Usually, when QA spiking is used, the method has 
already been validated at a similar source for the analyte in question. 
The QA spike demonstrates that the validated sampling/analytical 
conditions are being duplicated. If the QA spike fails then the 
sampling/analytical system shall be repaired before testing proceeds. 
The method validation procedure (section 13.0 of this method) involves a 
more extensive use of the analyte spike procedure of sections 9.2.1 
through 9.2.3 of this method. Spectra of at least 12 independent spiked 
and 12 independent unspiked samples are recorded. The concentration 
results are analyzed statistically to determine if there is a systematic 
bias in the method for measuring a particular analyte. If there is a 
systematic bias, within the limits allowed by Method 301 of this 
appendix, then a correction factor shall be applied to the analytical 
results. If the systematic bias is greater than the allowed limits, this 
method is not valid and cannot be used.
    9.2.1  Introduce the spike/tracer gas at a constant flow rate of 
<ls-thn-eq>10 percent of the total sample flow, when possible.
    Note: Use the rotameter at the end of the sampling train to estimate 
the required spike/tracer gas flow rate.

    Use a flow device, e.g., mass flow meter (<SUP><greek-i></SUP> 2 
percent), to monitor the spike flow rate. Record the spike flow rate 
every 10 minutes.
    9.2.2  Determine the response time (RT) of the system by 
continuously collecting spectra of the spiked effluent until the 
spectrum of the spiked component is constant for 5 minutes. The RT is 
the interval from the

[[Page 833]]

first measurement until the spike becomes constant. Wait for twice the 
duration of the RT, then collect spectra of two independent spiked gas 
samples. Duplicate analyses of the spiked concentration shall be within 
5 percent of the mean of the two measurements.
    9.2.3  Calculate the dilution ratio using the tracer gas as follows: 
where:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.005

Where:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.006

DF=Dilution factor of the spike gas; this value shall be <gr-thn-eq>10.
SF<INF>6(dir)</INF>=SF<INF>6</INF> (or tracer gas) concentration 
          measured directly in undiluted spike gas.
SF<INF>6(spk)</INF>=Diluted SF<INF>6</INF> (or tracer gas) concentration 
          measured in a spiked sample.
Spike<SUP>dir</SUP>=Concentration of the analyte in the spike standard 
          measured by filling the FTIR cell directly.
CS=Expected concentration of the spiked samples.
Unspike=Native concentration of analytes in unspiked samples.

                  10.0  Calibration and Standardization

    10.1  Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The RMSD in the noise must be 
less than one tenth of the minimum analyte peak absorbance in each 
analytical region. For example if the minimum peak absorbance is 0.01 at 
the required DL, then RMSD measured over the entire analytical region 
must be <ls-thn-eq>0.001.
    10.2  Absorbance Path length. Verify the absorbance path length by 
comparing reference CTS spectra to test CTS spectra. See appendix E of 
the FTIR Protocol.
    10.3  Instrument Resolution. Measure the line width of appropriate 
test CTS band(s) to verify instrument resolution. Alternatively, compare 
CTS spectra to a reference CTS spectrum, if available, measured at the 
nominal resolution.
    10.4  Apodization Function.In transforming the sample interferograms 
to absorbance spectra use the same apodization function that was used in 
transforming the reference spectra.
    10.5  FTIR Cell Volume. Evacuate the cell to <ls-thn-eq>5 mmHg. 
Measure the initial absolute temperature (T<INF>i</INF>) and absolute 
pressure (P<INF>i</INF>). Connect a wet test meter (or a calibrated dry 
gas meter), and slowly draw room air into the cell. Measure the meter 
volume (V<INF>m</INF>), meter absolute temperature (T<INF>m</INF>), and 
meter absolute pressure (P<INF>m</INF>); and the cell final absolute 
temperature (T<INF>f</INF>) and absolute pressure (P<INF>f</INF>). 
Calculate the FTIR cell volume VSS, including that of the connecting 
tubing, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.007

                  11.0  Data Analysis and Calculations

    Analyte concentrations shall be measured using reference spectra 
from the EPA FTIR spectral library. When EPA library spectra are not 
available, the procedures in section 4.6 of the Protocol shall be 
followed to prepare reference spectra of all the target analytes.
    11.1  Spectral De-resolution. Reference spectra can be converted to 
lower resolution standard spectra (section 3.3 of this method) by 
truncating the original reference sample and background interferograms. 
Appendix K of the FTIR Protocol gives specific deresolution procedures. 
Deresolved spectra shall be transformed using the same apodization 
function and level of zero filling as the sample spectra. Additionally, 
pre-test FTIR protocol calculations (e.g., FRU, MAU, FCU) shall be 
performed using the de-resolved standard spectra.
    11.2  Data Analysis. Various analytical programs are available for 
relating sample absorbance to a concentration standard. Calculated 
concentrations shall be verified by analyzing residual baselines after 
mathematically subtracting scaled reference spectra from the sample 
spectra. A full description of the data analysis and calculations is 
contained in the FTIR Protocol (sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices). 
Correct the calculated concentrations in the sample spectra for 
differences in absorption path length and temperature between the 
reference and sample spectra using equation 6,

C<INF>calc</INF>=Concentration, initial calculation (output of the 
          analytical program designed for the compound).

                        12.0  Method Performance

    12.1  Spectral Quality. Refer to the FTIR Protocol appendices for 
analytical requirements, evaluation of data quality, and analysis of 
uncertainty.
    12.2  Sampling QA/QC. The analyte spike procedure of section 9 of 
this method, the QA spike of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the 
validation procedure of section 13 of this method are used to evaluate 
the performance of the sampling system and to quantify sampling system 
effects, if any, on the measured concentrations. This method is self-
validating provided that the results meet the performance requirement of 
the QA spike in sections 9.0 and 8.6.2 of this method and results from a 
previous method validation study support the use of this method in the 
application. Several factors can contribute to uncertainty in the 
measurement of spiked samples. Factors which can be controlled to 
provide better accuracy in the spiking procedure are listed in sections 
12.2.1 through 12.2.4 of this method.
    12.2.1  Flow meter. An accurate mass flow meter is accurate to 
<plus-minus>1 percent of its span. If a flow of 1 L/min is monitored 
with such a MFM, which is calibrated in the range of 0-5 L/min, the flow 
measurement has an uncertainty of 5 percent. This may be improved by re-
calibrating the meter at the specific flow rate to be used.
    12.2.2  Calibration gas. Usually the calibration standard is 
certified to within <plus-minus> 2 percent. With reactive analytes, such 
as HCl, the certified accuracy in a commercially available standard may 
be no better than <plus-minus> 5 percent.
    12.2.3  Temperature. Temperature measurements of the cell shall be 
quite accurate. If practical, it is preferable to measure sample 
temperature directly, by inserting a thermocouple into the cell chamber 
instead of monitoring the cell outer wall temperature.
    12.2.4  Pressure. Accuracy depends on the accuracy of the barometer, 
but fluctuations in pressure throughout a day may be as much as 2.5 
percent due to weather variations.

                    13.0  Method Validation Procedure

    This validation procedure, which is based on EPA Method 301 (40 CFR 
part 63, appendix (A), may be used to validate this method for the 
analytes in a gas matrix. Validation at one source may also apply to 
another type of source, if it can be shown that the exhaust gas 
characteristics are similar at both sources.
    13.1  Section 5.3 of Method 301 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), the 
Analyte Spike procedure, is used with these modifications. The 
statistical analysis of the results follows section 6.3 of EPA Method 
301. Section 3 of this method defines terms that are not defined in 
Method 301.
    13.1.1  The analyte spike is performed dynamically. This means the 
spike flow is continuous and constant as spiked samples are measured.
    13.1.2  The spike gas is introduced at the back of the sample probe.
    13.1.3  Spiked effluent is carried through all sampling components 
downstream of the probe.
    13.1.4  A single FTIR system (or more) may be used to collect and 
analyze spectra (not quadruplicate integrated sampling trains).
    13.1.5  All of the validation measurements are performed 
sequentially in a single ``run'' (section 3.26 of this method).
    13.1.6  The measurements analyzed statistically are each independent 
(section 3.22 of this method).
    13.1.7  A validation data set can consist of more than 12 spiked and 
12 unspiked measurements.
    13.2  Batch Sampling. The procedure in sections 13.2.1 through 
13.2.2 may be used for stable processes. If process emissions are highly 
variable, the procedure in section 13.2.3 shall be used.
    13.2.1  With a single FTIR instrument and sampling system, begin by 
collecting spectra of two unspiked samples. Introduce the spike flow 
into the sampling system and allow 10 cell volumes to purge the sampling 
system and FTIR cell. Collect spectra of two spiked samples. Turn off 
the spike and allow 10 cell volumes of unspiked sample to purge the FTIR 
cell. Repeat this procedure until the 24 (or more) samples are 
collected.
    13.2.2  In batch sampling, collect spectra of 24 distinct samples. 
(Each distinct sample consists of filling the cell to ambient pressure 
after the cell has been evacuated.)
    13.2.3  Alternatively, a separate probe assembly, line, and sample 
pump can be used for spiked sample. Verify and document that sampling 
conditions are the same in both the spiked and the unspiked sampling 
systems. This can be done by wrapping both sample lines in the same 
heated bundle. Keep the same flow rate in both sample lines. Measure 
samples in sequence in pairs. After two spiked samples are measured, 
evacuate the FTIR cell, and turn the manifold valve so that spiked 
sample flows to the FTIR cell. Allow the connecting line from the 
manifold to the FTIR cell to purge thoroughly (the

[[Page 835]]

time depends on the line length and flow rate). Collect a pair of spiked 
samples. Repeat the procedure until at least 24 measurements are 
completed.
    13.3  Simultaneous Measurements With Two FTIR Systems. If unspiked 
effluent concentrations of the target analyte(s) vary significantly with 
time, it may be desirable to perform synchronized measurements of spiked 
and unspiked sample. Use two FTIR systems, each with its own cell and 
sampling system to perform simultaneous spiked and unspiked 
measurements. The optical configurations shall be similar, if possible. 
The sampling configurations shall be the same. One sampling system and 
FTIR analyzer shall be used to measure spiked effluent. The other 
sampling system and FTIR analyzer shall be used to measure unspiked flue 
gas. Both systems shall use the same sampling procedure (i.e., batch or 
continuous).
    13.3.1  If batch sampling is used, synchronize the cell evacuation, 
cell filling, and collection of spectra. Fill both cells at the same 
rate (in cell volumes per unit time).
    13.3.2  If continuous sampling is used, adjust the sample flow 
through each gas cell so that the same number of cell volumes pass 
through each cell in a given time (i.e. TC<INF>1</INF> = 
TC<INF>2</INF>).
    13.4  Statistical Treatment. The statistical procedure of EPA Method 
301 of this appendix, section 6.3 is used to evaluate the bias and 
precision. For FTIR testing a validation ``run'' is defined as spectra 
of 24 independent samples, 12 of which are spiked with the analyte(s) 
and 12 of which are not spiked.
    13.4.1  Bias. Determine the bias (defined by EPA Method 301 of this 
appendix, section 6.3.2) using equation 7:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.009

Where:

B = Bias at spike level.
S<INF>m</INF> = Mean concentration of the analyte spiked samples.
CS = Expected concentration of the spiked samples.

    13.4.2  Correction Factor. Use section 6.3.2.2 of Method 301 of this 
appendix to evaluate the statistical significance of the bias. If it is 
determined that the bias is significant, then use section 6.3.3 of 
Method 301 to calculate a correction factor (CF). Analytical results of 
the test method are multiplied by the correction factor, if 0.7 
<ls-thn-eq> CF <ls-thn-eq> 1.3. If is determined that the bias is 
significant and CF > <plus-minus> 30 percent, then the test method is 
considered to ``not valid.''
    13.4.3  If measurements do not pass validation, evaluate the 
sampling system, instrument configuration, and analytical system to 
determine if improper set-up or a malfunction was the cause. If so, 
repair the system and repeat the validation.

                       14.0  Pollution Prevention.

    The extracted sample gas is vented outside the enclosure containing 
the FTIR system and gas manifold after the analysis. In typical method 
applications the vented sample volume is a small fraction of the source 
volumetric flow and its composition is identical to that emitted from 
the source. When analyte spiking is used, spiked pollutants are vented 
with the extracted sample gas. Approximately 1.6  x  10-\4\ to 3.2  x  
10-\4\ lbs of a single HAP may be vented to the atmosphere in a typical 
validation run of 3 hours. (This assumes a molar mass of 50 to 100 g, 
spike rate of 1.0 L/min, and a standard concentration of 100 ppm). 
Minimize emissions by keeping the spike flow off when not in use.

                         15.0  Waste Management.

    Small volumes of laboratory gas standards can be vented through a 
laboratory hood. Neat samples must be packed and disposed according to 
applicable regulations. Surplus materials may be returned to supplier 
for disposal.

Addendum to Test Method 320--Protocol for the Use of Extractive Fourier 
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry for the Analyses of Gaseous 
                    Emissions from Stationary Sources

                            1.0  Introduction

    The purpose of this addendum is to set general guidelines for the 
use of modern FTIR spectroscopic methods for the analysis of gas samples 
extracted from the effluent of stationary emission sources. This 
addendum outlines techniques for developing and evaluating such methods 
and sets basic requirements for reporting and quality assurance 
procedures.

                            1.1  Nomenclature

    1.1.1  Appendix A to this addendum lists definitions of the symbols 
and terms used in this Protocol, many of which have been taken directly 
from American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) publication E 
131-90a, entitled ``Terminology Relating to Molecular Spectroscopy.''
    1.1.2  Except in the case of background spectra or where otherwise 
noted, the term ``spectrum'' refers to a double-beam spectrum in units 
of absorbance vs. wavenumber (cm<SUP>-1</SUP>).
    1.1.3  The term ``Study'' in this addendum refers to a publication 
that has been subjected to EPA- or peer-review.

               2.0  Applicability and Analytical Principle

    2.1  Applicability. This Protocol applies to the determination of 
compound-specific concentrations in single- and multiple-component gas 
phase samples using double-beam absorption spectroscopy in the mid-
infrared band. It does not specifically address other FTIR applications, 
such as single-beam spectroscopy, analysis of open-path (non-enclosed) 
samples, and continuous measurement techniques. If multiple 
spectrometers, absorption cells, or instrumental linewidths are used in 
such analyses, each distinct operational configuration of the system 
must be evaluated separately according to this Protocol.

                        2.2  Analytical Principle

    2.2.1  In the mid-infrared band, most molecules exhibit 
characteristic gas phase absorption spectra that may be recorded by FTIR 
systems. Such systems consist of a source of mid-infrared radiation, an 
interferometer, an enclosed sample cell of known absorption pathlength, 
an infrared detector, optical elements for the transfer of infrared 
radiation between components, and gas flow control and measurement 
components. Adjunct and integral computer systems are used for 
controlling the instrument, processing the signal, and for performing 
both Fourier transforms and quantitative analyses of spectral data.
    2.2.2  The absorption spectra of pure gases and of mixtures of gases 
are described by a linear absorbance theory referred to as Beer's Law. 
Using this law, modern FTIR systems use computerized analytical programs 
to quantify compounds by comparing the absorption spectra of known 
(reference) gas samples to the absorption spectrum of the sample gas. 
Some standard mathematical techniques used for comparisons are classical 
least squares, inverse least squares, cross-correlation, factor 
analysis, and partial least squares. Reference A describes several of 
these techniques, as well as additional techniques, such as 
differentiation methods, linear baseline corrections, and non-linear 
absorbance corrections.

            3.0  General Principles of Protocol Requirements

    The characteristics that distinguish FTIR systems from gas analyzers 
used in instrumental gas analysis methods (e.g., Methods 6C and 7E of 
appendix A to part 60 of this chapter) are: (1) Computers are necessary 
to obtain and analyze data; (2) chemical concentrations can be 
quantified using previously recorded infrared reference spectra; and (3) 
analytical assumptions and results, including possible effects of 
interfering compounds, can be evaluated after the quantitative analysis. 
The following general principles and requirements of this Protocol are 
based on these characteristics.
    3.1  Verifiability and Reproducibility of Results. Store all data 
and document data analysis techniques sufficient to allow an independent 
agent to reproduce the analytical results from the raw interferometric 
data.
    3.2  Transfer of Reference Spectra. To determine whether reference 
spectra recorded under one set of conditions (e.g., optical bench, 
instrumental linewidth, absorption pathlength, detector performance, 
pressure, and temperature) can be used to analyze sample spectra taken 
under a different set of conditions, quantitatively compare 
``calibration transfer standards'' (CTS) and reference spectra as 
described in this Protocol.
    Note:  The CTS may, but need not, include analytes of interest). To 
effect this, record the absorption spectra of the CTS (a) immediately 
before and immediately after recording reference spectra and (b) 
immediately after recording sample spectra.
    3.3  Evaluation of FTIR Analyses. The applicability, accuracy, and 
precision of FTIR measurements are influenced by a number of 
interrelated factors, which may be divided into two classes:
    3.3.1  Sample-Independent Factors. Examples are system configuration 
and performance (e.g., detector sensitivity and infrared source output), 
quality and applicability of reference absorption spectra, and type of

[[Page 839]]

mathematical analyses of the spectra. These factors define the 
fundamental limitations of FTIR measurements for a given system 
configuration. These limitations may be estimated from evaluations of 
the system before samples are available. For example, the detection 
limit for the absorbing compound under a given set of conditions may be 
estimated from the system noise level and the strength of a particular 
absorption band. Similarly, the accuracy of measurements may be 
estimated from the analysis of the reference spectra.
    3.3.2  Sample-Dependent Factors. Examples are spectral interferants 
(e.g., water vapor and CO<INF>2</INF>) or the overlap of spectral 
features of different compounds and contamination deposits on reflective 
surfaces or transmitting windows. To maximize the effectiveness of the 
mathematical techniques used in spectral analysis, identification of 
interferants (a standard initial step) and analysis of samples (includes 
effect of other analytical errors) are necessary. Thus, the Protocol 
requires post-analysis calculation of measurement concentration 
uncertainties for the detection of these potential sources of 
measurement error.

               4.0  Pre-Test Preparations and Evaluations

    Before testing, demonstrate the suitability of FTIR spectrometry for 
the desired application according to the procedures of this section.
    4.1  Identify Test Requirements. Identify and record the test 
requirements described in sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 of this addendum. 
These values set the desired or required goals of the proposed analysis; 
the description of methods for determining whether these goals are 
actually met during the analysis comprises the majority of this 
Protocol.
    4.1.1  Analytes (specific chemical species) of interest. Label the 
analytes from i = 1 to I.
    4.1.2  Analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>). The 
AU<INF>i</INF> is the maximum permissible fractional uncertainty of 
analysis for the i<SUP>th</SUP> analyte concentration, expressed as a 
fraction of the analyte concentration in the sample.
    4.1.3  Required detection limit for each analyte (DL<INF>i</INF>, 
ppm). The detection limit is the lowest concentration of an analyte for 
which its overall fractional uncertainty (OFU<INF>i</INF>) is required 
to be less than its analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>).
    4.1.4  Maximum expected concentration of each analyte 
(CMAX<INF>i</INF>, ppm).
    4.2  Identify Potential Interferants. Considering the chemistry of 
the process or results of previous studies, identify potential 
interferants, i.e., the major effluent constituents and any relatively 
minor effluent constituents that possess either strong absorption 
characteristics or strong structural similarities to any analyte of 
interest. Label them 1 through N<INF>j</INF>, where the subscript ``j'' 
pertains to potential interferants. Estimate the concentrations of these 
compounds in the effluent (CPOT<INF>j</INF>, ppm).
    4.3  Select and Evaluate the Sampling System. Considering the 
source, e.g., temperature and pressure profiles, moisture content, 
analyte characteristics, and particulate concentration), select the 
equipment for extracting gas samples. Recommended are a particulate 
filter, heating system to maintain sample temperature above the dew 
point for all sample constituents at all points within the sampling 
system (including the filter), and sample conditioning system (e.g., 
coolers, water-permeable membranes that remove water or other compounds 
from the sample, and dilution devices) to remove spectral interferants 
or to protect the sampling and analytical components. Determine the 
minimum absolute sample system pressure (P<INF>min</INF>, mmHg) and the 
infrared absorption cell volume (V<INF>SS</INF>, liter). Select the 
techniques and/or equipment for the measurement of sample pressures and 
temperatures.
    4.4  Select Spectroscopic System. Select a spectroscopic 
configuration for the application. Approximate the absorption pathlength 
(L<INF>S</INF>', meter), sample pressure (P<INF>S</INF>', kPa), absolute 
sample temperature T<INF>S</INF>', and signal integration period 
(t<INF>SS</INF>, seconds) for the analysis. Specify the nominal minimum 
instrumental linewidth (MIL) of the system. Verify that the fractional 
error at the approximate values P<INF>S</INF>' and T<INF>S</INF>' is 
less than one half the smallest value AU<INF>i</INF> (see section 4.1.2 
of this addendum).
    4.5  Select Calibration Transfer Standards (CTS's). Select CTS's 
that meet the criteria listed in sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 of 
this addendum.
    Note: It may be necessary to choose preliminary analytical regions 
(see section 4.7 of this addendum), identify the minimum analyte 
linewidths, or estimate the system noise level (see section 4.12 of this 
addendum) before selecting the CTS. More than one compound may be needed 
to meet the criteria; if so, obtain separate cylinders for each 
compound.
    4.5.1  The central wavenumber position of each analytical region 
shall lie within 25 percent of the wavenumber position of at least one 
CTS absorption band.
    4.5.2  The absorption bands in section 4.5.1 of this addendum shall 
exhibit peak absorbances greater than ten times the value 
RMS<INF>EST</INF> (see section 4.12 of this addendum) but less than 1.5 
absorbance units.
    4.5.3  At least one absorption CTS band within the operating range 
of the FTIR instrument shall have an instrument-independent linewidth no 
greater than the narrowest analyte absorption band. Perform and document 
measurements or cite Studies to determine analyte and CTS compound 
linewidths.

[[Page 840]]

    4.5.4  For each analytical region, specify the upper and lower 
wavenumber positions (FFU<INF>m</INF> and FFL<INF>m</INF>, respectively) 
that bracket the CTS absorption band or bands for the associated 
analytical region. Specify the wavenumber range, FNU to FNL, containing 
the absorption band that meets the criterion of section 4.5.3 of this 
addendum.
    4.5.5  Associate, whenever possible, a single set of CTS gas 
cylinders with a set of reference spectra. Replacement CTS gas cylinders 
shall contain the same compounds at concentrations within 5 percent of 
that of the original CTS cylinders; the entire absorption spectra (not 
individual spectral segments) of the replacement gas shall be scaled by 
a factor between 0.95 and 1.05 to match the original CTS spectra.

                     4.6  Prepare Reference Spectra

    Note: Reference spectra are available in a permanent soft copy from 
the EPA spectral library on the EMTIC (Emission Measurement Technical 
Information Center) computer bulletin board; they may be used if 
applicable.
    4.6.1  Select the reference absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>) of 
the cell.
    4.6.2  Obtain or prepare a set of chemical standards for each 
analyte, potential and known spectral interferants, and CTS. Select the 
concentrations of the chemical standards to correspond to the top of the 
desired range.
    4.6.2.1  Commercially-Prepared Chemical Standards. Chemical 
standards for many compounds may be obtained from independent sources, 
such as a specialty gas manufacturer, chemical company, or commercial 
laboratory. These standards (accurate to within <plus-minus>2 percent) 
shall be prepared according to EPA Traceability Protocol (see Reference 
D) or shall be traceable to NIST standards. Obtain from the supplier an 
estimate of the stability of the analyte concentration. Obtain and 
follow all of the supplier's recommendations for recertifying the 
analyte concentration.
    4.6.2.2  Self-Prepared Chemical Standards. Chemical standards may be 
prepared by diluting certified commercially prepared chemical gases or 
pure analytes with ultra-pure carrier (UPC) grade nitrogen according to 
the barometric and volumetric techniques generally described in 
Reference A, section A4.6.
    4.6.3  Record a set of the absorption spectra of the CTS {R1{time} , 
then a set of the reference spectra at two or more concentrations in 
duplicate over the desired range (the top of the range must be less than 
10 times that of the bottom), followed by a second set of CTS spectra 
{R2{time} . (If self-prepared standards are used, see section 4.6.5 of 
this addendum before disposing of any of the standards.) The maximum 
accepted standard concentration-pathlength product (ASCPP) for each 
compound shall be higher than the maximum estimated concentration-
pathlength products for both analytes and known interferants in the 
effluent gas. For each analyte, the minimum ASCPP shall be no greater 
than ten times the concentration-pathlength product of that analyte at 
its required detection limit.
    4.6.4  Permanently store the background and interferograms in 
digitized form. Document details of the mathematical process for 
generating the spectra from these interferograms. Record the sample 
pressure (P<INF>R</INF>), sample temperature (T<INF>R</INF>), reference 
absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>), and interferogram signal 
integration period (t<INF>SR</INF>). Signal integration periods for the 
background interferograms shall be <gr-thn-eq>t<INF>SR</INF>. Values of 
P<INF>R</INF>, L<INF>R</INF>, and t<INF>SR</INF> shall not deviate by 
more than <plus-minus>1 percent from the time of recording [R1] to that 
of recording [R2].
    4.6.5  If self-prepared chemical standards are employed and spectra 
of only two concentrations are recorded for one or more compounds, 
verify the accuracy of the dilution technique by analyzing the prepared 
standards for those compounds with a secondary (non-FTIR) technique in 
accordance with sections 4.6.5.1 through 4.6.5.4 of this addendum.
    4.6.5.1  Record the response of the secondary technique to each of 
the four standards prepared.
    4.6.5.2  Perform a linear regression of the response values 
(dependant variable) versus the accepted standard concentration (ASC) 
values (independent variable), with the regression constrained to pass 
through the zero-response, zero ASC point.
    4.6.5.3  Calculate the average fractional difference between the 
actual response values and the regression-predicted values (those 
calculated from the regression line using the four ASC values as the 
independent variable).
    4.6.5.4  If the average fractional difference value calculated in 
section 4.6.5.3 of this addendum is larger for any compound than the 
corresponding AU<INF>i</INF>, the dilution technique is not sufficiently 
accurate and the reference spectra prepared are not valid for the 
analysis.
    4.7  Select Analytical Regions. Using the general considerations in 
section 7 of Reference A and the spectral characteristics of the 
analytes and interferants, select the analytical regions for the 
application. Label them m = 1 to M. Specify the lower, center and upper 
wavenumber positions of each analytical region (FL<INF>m</INF>, 
FC<INF>m</INF>, and FU<INF>m</INF>, respectively). Specify the analytes 
and interferants which exhibit absorption in each region.
    4.8  Determine Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainties. Using 
appendix E of this addendum, calculate the fractional reproducibility 
uncertainty for each analyte (FRU<INF>i</INF>) from a comparison of [R1] 
and [R2]. If FRU<INF>i</INF> > AU<INF>i</INF> for any analyte, the 
reference spectra generated

[[Page 841]]

in accordance with section 4.6 of this addendum are not valid for the 
application.
    4.9  Identify Known Interferants. Using appendix B of this addendum, 
determine which potential interferants affect the analyte concentration 
determinations. Relabel these potential interferant as ``known'' 
interferants, and designate these compounds from k = 1 to K. Appendix B 
to this addendum also provides criteria for determining whether the 
selected analytical regions are suitable.

             4.10  Prepare Computerized Analytical Programs

    4.10.1  Choose or devise mathematical techniques (e.g, classical 
least squares, inverse least squares, cross-correlation, and factor 
analysis) based on equation 4 of Reference A that are appropriate for 
analyzing spectral data by comparison with reference spectra.
    4.10.2  Following the general recommendations of Reference A, 
prepare a computer program or set of programs that analyzes all of the 
analytes and known interferants, based on the selected analytical 
regions (section 4.7 of this addendum) and the prepared reference 
spectra (section 4.6 of this addendum). Specify the baseline correction 
technique (e.g., determining the slope and intercept of a linear 
baseline contribution in each analytical region) for each analytical 
region, including all relevant wavenumber positions.
    4.10.3  Use programs that provide as output [at the reference 
absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>), reference gas temperature 
(T<INF>R</INF>), and reference gas pressure (P<INF>R</INF>)] the analyte 
concentrations, the known interferant concentrations, and the baseline 
slope and intercept values. If the sample absorption pathlength 
(L<INF>S</INF>), sample gas temperature (T<INF>S</INF>), or sample gas 
pressure (P<INF>S</INF>) during the actual sample analyses differ from 
L<INF>R</INF>, T<INF>R</INF>, and P<INF>R</INF>, use a program or set of 
programs that applies multiplicative corrections to the derived 
concentrations to account for these variations, and that provides as 
output both the corrected and uncorrected values. Include in the report 
of the analysis (see section 7.0 of this addendum) the details of any 
transformations applied to the original reference spectra (e.g., 
differentiation), in such a fashion that all analytical results may be 
verified by an independent agent from the reference spectra and data 
spectra alone.
    4.11  Determine the Fractional Calibration Uncertainty. Calculate 
the fractional calibration uncertainty for each analyte (FCUi) according 
to appendix F of this addendum, and compare these values to the 
fractional uncertainty limits (AU<INF>i</INF>; see section 4.1.2 of this 
addendum). If FCU<INF>i</INF> >AU<INF>i</INF>, either the reference 
spectra or analytical programs for that analyte are unsuitable.
    4.12  Verify System Configuration Suitability. Using appendix C of 
this addendum, measure or obtain estimates of the noise level 
(RMS<INF>EST</INF>, absorbance) of the FTIR system. Alternatively, 
construct the complete spectrometer system and determine the values 
RMS<INF>Sm</INF> using appendix G of this addendum. Estimate the minimum 
measurement uncertainty for each analyte (MAU<INF>i</INF>, ppm) and 
known interferant (MIU<INF>k</INF>, ppm) using appendix D of this 
addendum. Verify that (a) MAU<INF>i</INF>  
(AU<INF>i</INF>)(DL<INF>i</INF>), FRUi  AU<INF>i</INF>, and FCUi  
AU<INF>i</INF> for each analyte and that (b) the CTS chosen meets the 
requirements listed in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.5 of this addendum.

                  5.0  Sampling and Analysis Procedure

    5.1  Analysis System Assembly and Leak-Test. Assemble the analysis 
system. Allow sufficient time for all system components to reach the 
desired temperature. Then, determine the leak-rate (L<INF>R</INF>) and 
leak volume (V<INF>L</INF>), where V<INF>L</INF>=L<INF>R</INF> 
t<INF>SS</INF>. Leak volumes shall be <ls-thn-eq>4 percent of 
V<INF>SS</INF>.
    5.2  Verify Instrumental Performance. Measure the noise level of the 
system in each analytical region using the procedure of appendix G of 
this addendum. If any noise level is higher than that estimated for the 
system in section 4.12 of this addendum, repeat the calculations of 
appendix D of this addendum and verify that the requirements of section 
4.12 of this addendum are met; if they are not, adjust or repair the 
instrument and repeat this section.

             5.3  Determine the Sample Absorption Pathlength

    Record a background spectrum. Then, fill the absorption cell with 
CTS at the pressure P<INF>R</INF> and record a set of CTS spectra [R3]. 
Store the background and unscaled CTS single beam interferograms and 
spectra. Using appendix H of this addendum, calculate the sample 
absorption pathlength (L<INF>S</INF>) for each analytical region. The 
values L<INF>S</INF> shall not differ from the approximated sample 
pathlength L<INF>S</INF>' (see section 4.4 of this addendum) by more 
than 5 percent.
    5.4  Record Sample Spectrum. Connect the sample line to the source. 
Either evacuate the absorption cell to an absolute pressure below 5 mmHg 
before extracting a sample from the effluent stream into the absorption 
cell, or pump at least ten cell volumes of sample through the cell 
before obtaining a sample. Record the sample pressure P<INF>S</INF>. 
Generate the absorbance spectrum of the sample. Store the background and 
sample single beam interferograms, and document the process by which the 
absorbance spectra are generated from these data. (If necessary, apply 
the spectral transformations developed in section 5.6.2 of this 
addendum). The resulting sample spectrum is referred to below as 
S<INF>S</INF>.

    Note: Multiple sample spectra may be recorded according to the 
procedures of section

[[Page 842]]

5.4 of this addendum before performing sections 5.5 and 5.6 of this 
addendum.

    5.5  Quantify Analyte Concentrations. Calculate the unscaled analyte 
concentrations RUA<INF>i</INF> and unscaled interferant concentrations 
RUI<INF>K</INF> using the programs developed in section 4 of this 
addendum. To correct for pathlength and pressure variations between the 
reference and sample spectra, calculate the scaling factor, 
R<INF>LPS</INF> using equation A.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.012

Calculate the final analyte and interferant concentrations 
RSA<INF>i</INF> and RSI<INF>k</INF> using equations A.2 and A.3,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.013

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.014

    5.6  Determine Fractional Analysis Uncertainty. Fill the absorption 
cell with CTS at the pressure P<INF>S</INF>. Record a set of CTS spectra 
[R4]. Store the background and CTS single beam interferograms. Using 
appendix H of this addendum, calculate the fractional analysis 
uncertainty (FAU) for each analytical region. If the FAU indicated for 
any analytical region is greater than the required accuracy requirements 
determined in sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 of this addendum, then 
comparisons to previously recorded reference spectra are invalid in that 
analytical region, and the analyst shall perform one or both of the 
procedures of sections 5.6.1 through 5.6.2 of this addendum.
    5.6.1  Perform instrumental checks and adjust the instrument to 
restore its performance to acceptable levels. If adjustments are made, 
repeat sections 5.3, 5.4 (except for the recording of a sample 
spectrum), and 5.5 of this addendum to demonstrate that acceptable 
uncertainties are obtained in all analytical regions.
    5.6.2  Apply appropriate mathematical transformations (e.g., 
frequency shifting, zero-filling, apodization, smoothing) to the spectra 
(or to the interferograms upon which the spectra are based) generated 
during the performance of the procedures of section 5.3 of this 
addendum. Document these transformations and their reproducibility. Do 
not apply multiplicative scaling of the spectra, or any set of 
transformations that is mathematically equivalent to multiplicative 
scaling. Different transformations may be applied to different 
analytical regions. Frequency shifts shall be less than one-half the 
minimum instrumental linewidth, and must be applied to all spectral data 
points in an analytical region. The mathematical transformations may be 
retained for the analysis if they are also applied to the appropriate 
analytical regions of all sample spectra recorded, and if all original 
sample spectra are digitally stored. Repeat sections 5.3, 5.4 (except 
the recording of a sample spectrum), and 5.5 of this addendum to 
demonstrate that these transformations lead to acceptable calculated 
concentration uncertainties in all analytical regions.

                     6.0  Post-Analysis Evaluations

    Estimate the overall accuracy of the analyses performed in 
accordance with sections 5.1 through 5.6 of this addendum using the 
procedures of sections 6.1 through 6.3 of this addendum.
    6.1  Qualitatively Confirm the Assumed Matrix. Examine each 
analytical region of the sample spectrum for spectral evidence of 
unexpected or unidentified interferants. If found, identify the 
interfering compounds (see Reference C for guidance) and add them to the 
list of known interferants. Repeat the procedures of section 4 of this 
addendum to include the interferants in the uncertainty calculations and 
analysis procedures. Verify that the MAU and FCU values do not increase 
beyond acceptable levels for the application requirements. Re-calculate 
the analyte concentrations (section 5.5 of this addendum) in the 
affected analytical regions.
    6.2  Quantitatively Evaluate Fractional Model Uncertainty (FMU). 
Perform the procedures of either section 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 of this 
addendum:
    6.2.1  Using appendix I of this addendum, determine the fractional 
model error (FMU) for each analyte.
    6.2.2  Provide statistically determined uncertainties FMU for each 
analyte which are equivalent to two standard deviations at the 95 
percent confidence level. Such determinations, if employed, must be 
based on mathematical examinations of the pertinent sample spectra (not 
the reference spectra alone). Include in the report of the analysis (see 
section 7.0 of this addendum) a complete description of the 
determination of the concentration uncertainties.
    6.3  Estimate Overall Concentration Uncertainty (OCU). Using 
appendix J of this addendum, determine the overall concentration 
uncertainty (OCU) for each analyte. If the OCU is larger than the 
required accuracy for any analyte, repeat sections 4 and 6 of this 
addendum.

                       7.0  Reporting Requirements

[Documentation pertaining to virtually all the procedures of sections 4, 
5, and 6 will be required. Software copies of reference spectra and 
sample spectra will be retained for some minimum time following the 
actual testing.]

 Appendix A to Addendum to Method 320--Definitions of Terms and Symbols

    A.1  Definitions of Terms. All terms used in this method that are 
not defined below have the meaning given to them in the CAA and in 
subpart A of this part.
    Absorption band means a contiguous wavenumber region of a spectrum 
(equivalently, a contiguous set of absorbance spectrum data points) in 
which the absorbance passes through a maximum or a series of maxima.
    Absorption pathlength means the distance in a spectrophotometer, 
measured in the direction of propagation of the beam of radiant energy, 
between the surface of the specimen on which the radiant energy is 
incident and the surface of the specimen from which it is emergent.
    Analytical region means a contiguous wavenumber region 
(equivalently, a contiguous set of absorbance spectrum data points) used 
in the quantitative analysis for one or more analytes.

    Note: The quantitative result for a single analyte may be based on 
data from more than one analytical region.

    Apodization means modification of the ILS function by multiplying 
the interferogram by a weighing function whose magnitude varies with 
retardation.
    Background spectrum means the single beam spectrum obtained with all 
system components without sample present.
    Baseline means any line drawn on an absorption spectrum to establish 
a reference point that represents a function of the radiant power 
incident on a sample at a given wavelength.
    Beers's law means the direct proportionality of the absorbance of a 
compound in a homogeneous sample to its concentration.
    Calibration transfer standard (CTS) gas means a gas standard of a 
compound used to achieve and/or demonstrate suitable quantitative 
agreement between sample spectra and the reference spectra; see section 
4.5.1 of this addendum.
    Compound means a substance possessing a distinct, unique molecular 
structure.
    Concentration (c) means the quantity of a compound contained in a 
unit quantity of sample. The unit ``ppm'' (number, or mole, basis) is 
recommended.
    Concentration-pathlength product means the mathematical product of 
concentration of the species and absorption pathlength. For reference 
spectra, this is a known quantity; for sample spectra, it is the 
quantity directly determined from Beer's law. The units ``centimeters-
ppm'' or ``meters-ppm'' are recommended.
    Derivative absorption spectrum means a plot of rate of change of 
absorbance or of any function of absorbance with respect to wavelength 
or any function of wavelength.
    Double beam spectrum means a transmission or absorbance spectrum 
derived by dividing the sample single beam spectrum by the background 
spectrum.

    Note: The term ``double-beam'' is used elsewhere to denote a 
spectrum in which the sample and background interferograms are collected 
simultaneously along physically distinct absorption paths. Here, the 
term denotes a spectrum in which the sample and background 
interferograms are collected at different times along the same 
absorption path.

    Fast Fourier transform (FFT) means a method of speeding up the 
computation of a discrete FT by factoring the data into sparse matrices 
containing mostly zeros.
    Flyback means interferometer motion during which no data are 
recorded.
    Fourier transform (FT) means the mathematical process for converting 
an amplitude-time spectrum to an amplitude-frequency spectrum, or vice 
versa.
    Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer means an analytical 
system that employs a source of mid-infrared radiation, an 
interferometer, an enclosed sample cell of known absorption pathlength, 
an infrared detector, optical elements that transfer infrared radiation 
between components, and a computer system. The time-domain detector 
response (interferogram) is processed by a Fourier transform to yield a 
representation of the detector response vs. infrared frequency.

    Note: When FTIR spectrometers are interfaced with other instruments, 
a slash should be used to denote the interface; e.g., GC/FTIR; HPCL/
FTIR, and the use of FTIR should be explicit; i.e., FTIR not IR.

    Frequency, v means the number of cycles per unit time.
    Infrared means the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum 
containing wavelengths from approximately 0.78 to 800 microns.
    Interferogram, I(<greek-s>) means record of the modulated component 
of the interference

[[Page 844]]

signal measured as a function of retardation by the detector.
    Interferometer means device that divides a beam of radiant energy 
into two or more paths, generates an optical path difference between the 
beams, and recombines them in order to produce repetitive interference 
maxima and minima as the optical retardation is varied.
    Linewidth means the full width at half maximum of an absorption band 
in units of wavenumbers (cm<SUP>-1</SUP>).
    Mid-infrared means the region of the electromagnetic spectrum from 
approximately 400 to 5000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.
    Reference spectra means absorption spectra of gases with known 
chemical compositions, recorded at a known absorption pathlength, which 
are used in the quantitative analysis of gas samples.
    Retardation, <greek-s> means optical path difference between two 
beams in an interferometer; also known as ``optical path difference'' or 
``optical retardation.''
    Scan means digital representation of the detector output obtained 
during one complete motion of the interferometer's moving assembly or 
assemblies.
    Scaling means application of a multiplicative factor to the 
absorbance values in a spectrum.
    Single beam spectrum means Fourier-transformed interferogram, 
representing the detector response vs. wavenumber.

    Note: The term ``single-beam'' is used elsewhere to denote any 
spectrum in which the sample and background interferograms are recorded 
on the same physical absorption path; such usage differentiates such 
spectra from those generated using interferograms recorded along two 
physically distinct absorption paths (see ``double-beam spectrum'' 
above). Here, the term applies (for example) to the two spectra used 
directly in the calculation of transmission and absorbance spectra of a 
sample.

    Standard reference material means a reference material, the 
composition or properties of which are certified by a recognized 
standardizing agency or group.

    Note: The equivalent ISO term is ``certified reference material.''

    Transmittance, T means the ratio of radiant power transmitted by the 
sample to the radiant power incident on the sample. Estimated in FTIR 
spectroscopy by forming the ratio of the single-beam sample and 
background spectra.
    Wavenumber, v means the number of waves per unit length.

    Note: The usual unit of wavenumber is the reciprocal centimeter, 
cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The wavenumber is the reciprocal of the wavelength, 
<greek-l>, when <greek-l> is expressed in centimeters.

    Zero-filling means the addition of zero-valued points to the end of 
a measured interferogram.

    Note: Performing the FT of a zero-filled interferogram results in 
correctly interpolated points in the computed spectrum.

    A.2  Definitions of Mathematical Symbols. The symbols used in 
equations in this protocol are defined as follows:
    (1) A, absorbance = the logarithm to the base 10 of the reciprocal 
of the transmittance (T).

 Appendix B to Addendum to Method 320--Identifying Spectral Interferants

                              B.1  General

    B.1.1  Assume a fixed absorption pathlength equal to the value 
L<INF>S</INF>'.
    B.1.2  Use band area calculations to compare the relative absorption 
strengths of the analytes and potential interferants. In the 
m<SUP>th</SUP> analytical region (FL<INF>m</INF> to FU<INF>m</INF>), use 
either rectangular or trapezoidal approximations to determine the band 
areas described below (see Reference A, sections A.3.1 through A.3.3). 
Document any baseline corrections applied to the spectra.
    B.1.3  Use the average total absorbance of the analytes and 
potential interferants in each analytical region to determine whether 
the analytical region is suitable for analyte concentration 
determinations.

    Note: The average absorbance in an analytical region is the band 
area divided by the width of the analytical region in wavenumbers. The 
average total absorbance in an analytical region is the sum of the 
average absorbances of all analytes and potential interferants.

                            B.2  Calculations

    B.2.1  Prepare spectral representations of each analyte at the 
concentration CL<INF>i</INF> = (DL<INF>i</INF>)(AU<INF>i</INF>), where 
DL<INF>i</INF> is the required detection limit and AU<INF>i</INF> is the 
maximum permissible analytical uncertainty. For the m<SUP>th</SUP> 
analytical region, calculate the band area (AAI<INF>im</INF>) and 
average absorbance (AAV<INF>im</INF>) from these scaled analyte spectra.
    B.2.2  Prepare spectral representations of each potential 
interferant at its expected concentration (CPOT<INF>j</INF>). For the 
m<SUP>th</SUP> analytical region, calculate the band area 
(IAI<INF>jm</INF>) and average absorbance (IAV<INF>jm</INF>) from these 
scaled potential interferant spectra.
    B.2.3  Repeat the calculation for each analytical region, and record 
the band area results in matrix form as indicated in Figure B.1.
    B.2.4  If the band area of any potential interferant in an 
analytical region is greater than the one-half the band area of any 
analyte (i.e., IAI<INF>jm</INF> > 0.5 AAI<INF>im</INF> for any pair ij 
and any m), classify the potential interferant as a known interferant. 
Label the known interferants k = 1 to K. Record the results in matrix 
form as indicated in Figure B.2.
    B.2.5  Calculate the average total absorbance (AVT<INF>m</INF>) for 
each analytical region and record the values in the last row of the 
matrix described in Figure B.2. Any analytical region where 
AVT<INF>m</INF> > 2.0 is unsuitable.

      Appendix C to Addendum to Method 320--Estimating Noise Levels

                              C.1  General

    C.1.1  The root-mean-square (RMS) noise level is the standard 
measure of noise in this addendum. The RMS noise level of a contiguous 
segment of a spectrum is defined as the RMS difference (RMSD) between 
the absorbance values which form the segment and the mean value of that 
segment (see appendix A of this addendum).
    C.1.2  The RMS noise value in double-beam absorbance spectra is 
assumed to be inversely proportional to: (a) the square root of the 
signal integration period of the sample single beam spectra from which 
it is formed, and (b) the total infrared power transmitted through the 
interferometer and absorption cell.
    C.1.3  Practically, the assumption of C.1.2 allows the RMS noise 
level of a complete system to be estimated from the quantities described 
in sections C.1.3.1 through C.1.3.4:
    C.1.3.1  RMS<INF>MAN</INF>, the noise level of the system (in 
absorbance units), without the absorption cell and transfer optics, 
under those conditions necessary to yield the specified minimum 
instrumental linewidth, e.g., Jacquinot stop size.
    C.1.3.2  t<INF>MAN</INF>, the manufacturer's signal integration time 
used to determine RMS<INF>MAN</INF>.
    C.1.3.3  t<INF>SS</INF>, the signal integration time for the 
analyses.
    C.1.3.4  TP, the manufacturer's estimate of the fraction of the 
total infrared power transmitted by the absorption cell and transfer 
optics from the interferometer to the detector.

                            C.2  Calculations

    C.2.1  Obtain the values of RMS<INF>MAN</INF>, t<INF>MAN</INF>, and 
TP from the manufacturers of the equipment, or determine the noise level 
by direct measurements with the completely constructed system proposed 
in section 4 of this addendum.
    C.2.2  Calculate the noise value of the system (RMS<INF>EST</INF>) 
using equation C.1.

 Appendix D to Addendum to Method 320--Estimating Minimum Concentration 
                 Measurement Uncertainties (MAU and MIU)

                              D.1  General

    Estimate the minimum concentration measurement uncertainties for the 
i<SUP>th</SUP> analyte (MAU<INF>i</INF>) and j<SUP>th</SUP> interferant 
(MIU<INF>j</INF>) based on the spectral data in the m<SUP>th</SUP> 
analytical region by comparing the analyte band area in the analytical 
region (AAI<INF>im</INF>) and estimating or measuring the noise level of 
the system (RMS<INF>EST</INF> or RMS<INF>SM</INF>).

    Note: For a single analytical region, the MAU or MIU value is the 
concentration of the analyte or interferant for which the band area is 
equal to the product of the analytical region width (in wavenumbers) and 
the noise level of the system (in absorbance units). If data from more 
than one analytical region are used in the determination of an analyte 
concentration, the MAU or MIU is the mean of the separate MAU or MIU 
values calculated for each analytical region.

                            D.2  Calculations

    D.2.1  For each analytical region, set 
RMS = RMS<INF>SM</INF> if measured (appendix G of this addendum), or set 
RMS = RMS<INF>EST</INF> 
if estimated (appendix C of this addendum).
    D.2.2  For each analyte associated with the analytical region, 
calculate MAU<INF>im</INF> using equation D.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.020

    D.2.3  If only the m<SUP>th</SUP> analytical region is used to 
calculate the concentration of the i<SUP>th</SUP> analyte, set 
MAU<INF>i</INF> = MAU<INF>im</INF>.
    D.2.4  If more than one analytical region is used to calculate the 
concentration of the i<SUP>th</SUP> analyte, set MAU<INF>i</INF> equal 
to the weighted mean of the appropriate MAU<INF>im</INF> values 
calculated above; the weight for each term in the mean is equal to the 
fraction of the total wavenumber range used for the calculation

represented by each analytical region. Mathematically, if the set of 
analytical regions employed is [m'], then the MAU for each analytical 
region is given by equation D.2.

where the weight W<INF>ik</INF> is defined for each term in the sum as

    D.2.5  Repeat sections D.2.1 through D.2.4 of this appendix to 
calculate the analogous values MIU<INF>j</INF> for the interferants j = 
1 to J. Replace the value (AU<INF>i</INF>) (DL<INF>i</INF>) in equation 
D.1 with CPOT<INF>j</INF>/20; replace the value AAI<INF>im</INF> in 
equation D.1 with IAI<INF>jm</INF>.

                   Reproducibility Uncertainties (FRU)

                              E.1  General

    To estimate the reproducibility of the spectroscopic results of the 
system, compare the CTS spectra recorded before and after preparing the 
reference spectra. Compare the difference between the spectra to their 
average band area. Perform the calculation for each analytical region on 
the portions of the CTS spectra associated with that analytical region.

                            E.2  Calculations

    E.2.1  The CTS spectra {R1{time}  consist of N spectra, denoted by 
S<INF>1i</INF>, i=1, N. Similarly, the CTS spectra {R2{time}  consist of 
N spectra, denoted by S<INF>2i</INF>, i=1, N. Each S<INF>ki</INF> is the 
spectrum of a single compound, where i denotes the compound and k 
denotes the set {Rk{time}  of which S<INF>ki</INF> is a member. Form the 
spectra S<INF>3</INF> according to S<INF>3i</INF> = 
S<INF>2i</INF>-S<INF>1i</INF> for each i. Form the spectra S<INF>4</INF> 
according to S<INF>4i</INF> = [S<INF>2i</INF>+S<INF>1i</INF>]/2 for each 
i.
    E.2.2  Each analytical region m is associated with a portion of the 
CTS spectra S<INF>2i</INF> and S<INF>1i</INF>, for a particular i, with 
lower and upper wavenumber limits FFL<INF>m</INF> and FFU<INF>m</INF>, 
respectively.
    E.2.3  For each m and the associated i, calculate the band area of 
S<INF>4i</INF> in the wavenumber range FFU<INF>m</INF> to 
FFL<INF>m</INF>. Follow the guidelines of section B.1.2 of this addendum 
for this band area calculation. Denote the result by BAV<INF>m</INF>.
    E.2.4  For each m and the associated i, calculate the RMSD of 
S<INF>3i</INF> between the absorbance values and their mean in the 
wavenumber range FFU<INF>m</INF> to FFL<INF>m</INF>. Denote the result 
by SRMS<INF>m</INF>.
    E.2.5  For each analytical region m, calculate FM<INF>m</INF> using 
equation E.1,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.023

    E.2.6  If only the m<SUP>th</SUP> analytical region is used to 
calculate the concentration of the i<SUP>th</SUP> analyte, set 
FRU<INF>i</INF> = FM<INF>m</INF>.
    E.2.7  If a number p<INF>i</INF> of analytical regions are used to 
calculate the concentration of the i<SUP>th</SUP> analyte, set 
FRU<INF>i</INF> equal to the weighted mean of the appropriate 
FM<INF>m</INF> values calculated according to section E.2.5. 
Mathematically, if the set of analytical regions employed is {m'{time} , 
then FRU<INF>i</INF> is given by equation E.2,

where the W<INF>ik</INF> are calculated as described in appendix D of 
this addendum.

Appendix F of Addendum to Method 320--Determining Fractional Calibration 
                           Uncertainties (FCU)

                              F.1  General

    F.1.1  The concentrations yielded by the computerized analytical 
program applied to each single-compound reference spectrum are defined 
as the indicated standard concentrations (ISC's). The ISC values for a 
single compound spectrum should ideally equal the accepted standard 
concentration (ASC) for one analyte or interferant, and should ideally 
be zero for all other compounds. Variations from these results are 
caused by errors in the ASC values, variations from the Beer's law (or 
modified Beer's law) model

[[Page 850]]

used to determine the concentrations, and noise in the spectra. When the 
first two effects dominate, the systematic nature of the errors is often 
apparent and the analyst shall take steps to correct them.
    F.1.2  When the calibration error appears non-systematic, apply the 
procedures of sections F.2.1 through F.2.3 of this appendix to estimate 
the fractional calibration uncertainty (FCU) for each compound. The FCU 
is defined as the mean fractional error between the ASC and the ISC for 
all reference spectra with non-zero ASC for that compound. The FCU for 
each compound shall be less than the required fractional uncertainty 
specified in section 4.1 of this addendum.
    F.1.3  The computerized analytical programs shall also be required 
to yield acceptably low concentrations for compounds with ISC = 0 when 
applied to the reference spectra. The ISC of each reference spectrum for 
each analyte or interferant shall not exceed that compound's minimum 
measurement uncertainty (MAU or MIU).

                            F.2  Calculations

    F.2.1  Apply each analytical program to each reference spectrum. 
Prepare a similar table to that in Figure F.1 to present the ISC and ASC 
values for each analyte and interferant in each reference spectrum. 
Maintain the order of reference file names and compounds employed in 
preparing Figure F.1.
    F.2.2  For all reference spectra in Figure F.1, verify that the 
absolute values of the ISC's are less than the compound's MAU (for 
analytes) or MIU (for interferants).
    F.2.3  For each analyte reference spectrum, calculate the quantity 
(ASC-ISC)/ASC. For each analyte, calculate the mean of these values (the 
FCU<INF>i</INF> for the i<SUP>th</SUP> analyte) over all reference 
spectra. Prepare a similar table to that in Figure F.2 to present the 
FCU<INF>i</INF> and analytical uncertainty limit (AU<INF>i</INF>) for 
each analyte.

      Appendix G to Addendum to Method 320--Measuring Noise Levels

                              G.1  General

    The root-mean-square (RMS) noise level is the standard measure of 
noise. The RMS noise level of a contiguous segment of a spectrum is the 
RMSD between the absorbance values that form the segment and the mean 
value of the segment (see appendix A of this addendum).

                            G.2  Calculations

    G.2.1  Evacuate the absorption cell or fill it with UPC grade 
nitrogen at approximately one atmosphere total pressure.
    G.2.2  Record two single beam spectra of signal integration period 
t<INF>SS</INF>.
    G.2.3  Form the double beam absorption spectrum from these two 
single beam spectra, and calculate the noise level RMS<INF>Sm</INF> in 
the M analytical regions.

  Appendix H of Addendum to Method 320--Determining Sample Absorption 
 Pathlength (L<INF>S</INF>) and Fractional Analytical Uncertainty (FAU)

                              H.1  General

    Reference spectra recorded at absorption pathlength (L<INF>R</INF>), 
gas pressure (P<INF>R</INF>), and gas absolute temperature 
(T<INF>R</INF>) may be used to determine analyte concentrations in 
samples whose spectra are recorded at conditions different from that of 
the reference spectra, i.e., at absorption pathlength (L<INF>S</INF>), 
absolute temperature (T<INF>S</INF>), and pressure (P<INF>S</INF>). This 
appendix describes the calculations for estimating the fractional 
uncertainty (FAU) of this practice. It also describes the calculations 
for determining the sample absorption pathlength from comparison of CTS 
spectra, and for preparing spectra for further instrumental and 
procedural checks.
    H.1.1  Before sampling, determine the sample absorption pathlength 
using least squares analysis. Determine the ratio L<INF>S</INF>/
L<INF>R</INF> by comparing the spectral sets {R1{time}  and {R3{time} , 
which are recorded using the same CTS at L<INF>S</INF> and 
L<INF>R</INF>, and T<INF>S</INF> and T<INF>R</INF>, but both at 
P<INF>R</INF>.
    H.1.2  Determine the fractional analysis uncertainty (FAU) for each 
analyte by comparing a scaled CTS spectral set, recorded at 
L<INF>S</INF>, T<INF>S</INF>, and P<INF>S</INF>, to the CTS reference 
spectra of the same gas, recorded at L<INF>R</INF>, T<INF>R</INF>, and 
P<INF>R</INF>. Perform the quantitative comparison after recording the 
sample spectra, based on band areas of the spectra in the CTS absorbance 
band associated with each analyte.

dimensional array A<INF>S</INF> from the absorbance values in the 
spectral set {R3{time} ; the members of the array are A<INF>Si</INF>, i

   Appendix I to Addendum to Method 320--Determining Fractional Model 
                           Uncertainties (FMU)

                              I.1  General

    To prepare analytical programs for FTIR analyses, the sample 
constituents must first be assumed. The calculations in this appendix, 
based upon a simulation of the sample spectrum, shall be used to verify 
the appropriateness of these assumptions. The simulated spectra consist 
of the sum of single compound reference spectra scaled to represent 
their contributions to the sample absorbance spectrum; scaling factors 
are based on the indicated standard concentrations (ISC) and measured 
(sample) analyte and interferant concentrations, the sample and 
reference absorption pathlengths, and the sample and reference gas 
pressures. No band-shape correction for differences in the temperature 
of the sample and reference spectra gases is made; such errors are 
included in the FMU estimate. The actual and simulated sample spectra 
are quantitatively compared to determine the fractional model 
uncertainty; this comparison uses the reference

spectra band areas and residuals in the difference spectrum formed from 
the actual and simulated sample spectra.

    I.2.3  For each analytical region, determine by visual inspection 
which of the spectra SAC<INF>i</INF> and SIC<INF>k</INF> exhibit 
absorbance bands within the analytical region. Subtract each spectrum 
SAC<INF>i</INF> and SIC<INF>k</INF> exhibiting absorbance from the 
sample spectrum S<INF>S</INF> to form the spectrum SUB<INF>S</INF>. To 
save analysis time and to avoid the introduction of unwanted noise into 
the subtracted spectrum, it is recommended that the calculation be made 
(1) only for those spectral data points within the analytical regions, 
and (2) for each analytical region separately using the original 
spectrum S<INF>S</INF>.
    I.2.4  For each analytical region m, calculate the RMSD of

Appendix J of Addendum to Method 320--Determining Overall Concentration 
                           Uncertainties (OCU)

    The calculations in this addendum estimate the measurement 
uncertainties for various FTIR measurements. The lowest possible overall 
concentration uncertainty (OCU) for an analyte is its MAU value, which 
is an estimate of the absolute concentration uncertainty when spectral 
noise dominates the measurement error. However, if the product of the 
largest fractional concentration uncertainty (FRU, FCU, FAU, or FMU) and 
the measured concentration of an analyte exceeds the MAU for the 
analyte, then the OCU is this product. In mathematical terms, set 
OFU<INF>i</INF> = MAX{FRU<INF>i</INF>, FCU<INF>i</INF>, FAU<INF>i</INF>, 
FMU<INF>i</INF>} and OCU<INF>i</INF> = 
MAX{RSA<INF>i</INF>*OFU<INF>i</INF>, MAU<INF>i</INF>}.

 Test Method 321--Measurement of Gaseous Hydrogen Chloride Emissions At 
 Portland Cement Kilns by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy

                            1.0  Introduction

    This method should be performed by those persons familiar with the 
operation of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) instrumentation in the 
application to source sampling. This document describes the sampling 
procedures for use in the application of FTIR spectrometry for the 
determination of vapor phase hydrogen chloride (HCl) concentrations both 
before and after particulate matter control devices installed at 
portland cement kilns. A procedure for analyte spiking is included for 
quality assurance. This method is considered to be self validating 
provided that the requirements listed in section 9 of this method are 
followed. The analytical procedures for interpreting infrared spectra 
from emission measurements are described in the ``Protocol For The Use 
of Extractive

[[Page 853]]

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry in Analyses of Gaseous 
Emissions From Stationary Industrial Sources'', included as an addendum 
to proposed Method 320 of this appendix (hereafter referred to as the 
``FTIR Protocol)''. References 1 and 2 describe the use of FTIR 
spectrometry in field measurements. Sample transport presents the 
principal difficulty in directly measuring HCl emissions. This identical 
problem must be overcome by any extractive measurement method. HCl is 
reactive and water soluble. The sampling system must be adequately 
designed to prevent sample condensation in the system.

                       1.1  Scope and Application

    This method is specifically designed for the application of FTIR 
Spectrometry in extractive measurements of gaseous HCl concentrations in 
portland cement kiln emissions.

                           1.2  Applicability

    This method applies to the measurement of HCl [CAS No. 7647-01-0]. 
This method can be applied to the determination of HCl concentrations 
both before and after particulate matter control devices installed at 
portland cement manufacturing facilities. This method applies to either 
continuous flow through measurement (with isolated sample analysis) or 
grab sampling (batch analysis). HCl is measured using the mid-infrared 
spectral region for analysis (about 400 to 4000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> or 25 to 
2.5 <greek-m>m). Table 1 lists the suggested analytical region for 
quantification of HCl taking the interference from water vapor into 
consideration.

                    1.3  Method Range and Sensitivity

    1.3.1  The analytical range is determined by the instrumental design 
and the composition of the gas stream. For practical purposes there is 
no upper limit to the range because the pathlength may be reduced or the 
sample may be diluted. The lower detection range depends on (1) the 
absorption coefficient of the compound in the analytical frequency 
region, (2) the spectral resolution, (3) the interferometer sampling 
time, (4) the detector sensitivity and response, and (5) the absorption 
pathlength.
    1.3.2  The practical lower quantification range is usually higher 
than the instrument sensitivity allows and is dependent upon (1) the 
presence of interfering species in the exhaust gas including 
H<INF>2</INF>O, CO<INF>2</INF>, and SO<INF>2</INF>, (2) analyte losses 
in the sampling system, (3) the optical alignment of the gas cell and 
transfer optics, and (4) the quality of the reflective surfaces in the 
cell (cell throughput). Under typical test conditions (moisture content 
of up to 30% and CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations from 1 to 15 percent), a 
22 meter path length cell with a suitable sampling system may achieve a 
lower quantification range of from 1 to 5 ppm for HCl.

                      1.4  Data Quality Objectives

    1.4.1  In designing or configuring the analytical system, data 
quality is determined by measuring of the root mean square deviation 
(RMSD) of the absorbance values within a chosen spectral (analytical) 
region. The RMSD provides an indication of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/
N) of the spectral baseline. Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol (the 
addendum to Method 320 of this appendix) presents a discussion of the 
relationship between the RMSD, lower detection limit, DL<INF>i</INF>, 
and analytical uncertainty, AU<INF>i</INF>. It is important to consider 
the target analyte quantification limit when performing testing with 
FTIR instrumentation, and to optimize the system to achieve the desired 
detection limit.
    1.4.2  Data quality is determined by measuring the root mean square 
(RMS) noise level in each analytical spectral region (appendix C of the 
FTIR Protocol). The RMS noise is defined as the root mean square 
deviation (RMSD) of the absorbance values in an analytical region from 
the mean absorbance value in the same region. Appendix D of the FTIR 
Protocol defines the minimum analyte uncertainty (MAU), and how the RMSD 
is used to calculate the MAU. The MAU<INF>im</INF> is the minimum 
concentration of the ith analyte in the mth analytical region for which 
the analytical uncertainty limit can be maintained. Table 2 presents 
example values of AU and MAU using the analytical region presented in 
Table 1.

                         2.0  Summary of Method

                             2.1  Principle

    See Method 320 of this appendix. HCl can also undergo rotation 
transitions by absorbing energy in the far-infrared spectral region. The 
rotational transitions are superimposed on the vibrational fundamental 
to give a series of lines centered at the fundamental vibrational 
frequency, 2885 cm-\1\. The frequencies of absorbance and the pattern of 
rotational/vibrational lines are unique to HCl. When this distinct 
pattern is observed in an infrared spectrum of an unknown sample, it 
unequivocally identifies HCl as a component of the mixture. The infrared 
spectrum of HCl is very distinctive and cannot be confused with the 
spectrum of any other compound. See Reference 6.
    2.2  Sampling and Analysis. See Method 320 of this appendix.
    2.3  Operator Requirements. The analyst must have knowledge of 
spectral patterns to choose an appropriate absorption path length or 
determine if sample dilution is necessary. The analyst should also 
understand FTIR instrument operation well enough to choose instrument 
settings that are consistent with the objectives of the analysis.

                            3.0  Definitions

    See appendix A of the FTIR Protocol.

                           4.0  Interferences

    This method will not measure HCl under conditions: (1) where the 
sample gas stream can condense in the sampling system or the 
instrumentation, or (2) where a high moisture content sample relative to 
the analyte concentrations imparts spectral interference due to the 
water vapor absorbance bands. For measuring HCl the first (sampling) 
consideration is more critical. Spectral interference from water vapor 
is not a significant problem except at very high moisture levels and low 
HCl concentrations.
    4.1  Analytical Interferences. See Method 320 of this appendix.
    4.1.1  Background Interferences. See Method 320 of this appendix.
    4.1.2  Spectral interferences. Water vapor can present spectral 
interference for FTIR gas analysis of HCl. Therefore, the water vapor in 
the spectra of kiln gas samples must be accounted for. This means 
preparing at least one spectrum of a water vapor sample where the 
moisture concentration is close to that in the kiln gas.
    4.2  Sampling System Interferences. The principal sampling system 
interferant for measuring HCl is water vapor. Steps must be taken to 
ensure that no condensation forms anywhere in the probe assembly, sample 
lines, or analytical instrumentation. Cold spots anywhere in the 
sampling system must be avoided. The extent of sampling system bias in 
the FTIR analysis of HCl depends on concentrations of potential 
interferants, moisture content of the gas stream, temperature of the gas 
stream, temperature of sampling system components, sample flow rate, and 
reactivity of HCl with other species in the gas stream (e.g., ammonia). 
For measuring HCl in a wet gas stream the temperatures of the gas 
stream, sampling components, and the sample flow rate are of primary 
importance. Analyte spiking with HCl is performed to demonstrate the 
integrity of the sampling system for transporting HCl vapor in the flue 
gas to the FTIR instrument. See section 9 of this method for a complete 
description of analyte spiking.

                               5.0  Safety

    5.1  Hydrogen chloride vapor is corrosive and can cause irritation 
or severe damage to respiratory system, eyes and skin. Exposure to this 
compound should be avoided.
    5.2  This method may involve sampling at locations having high 
positive or negative pressures, or high concentrations of hazardous or 
toxic pollutants, and can not address all safety problems encountered 
under these diverse sampling conditions. It is the responsibility of the 
tester(s) to ensure proper safety and health practices, and to determine 
the applicability of regulatory limitations before performing this test 
method. Leak-check procedures are outlined in section 8.2 of Method 320 
of this appendix.

                       6.0  Equipment and Supplies

    Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not 
constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.

(interferometer, transfer optics, gas cell and detector) having the 
capability of measuring HCl to the predetermined minimum detectable 
level required (see section 4.1.3 of the FTIR Protocol). The system must 
also include an accurate means to control and/or measure the temperature 
of the FTIR gas analysis cell, and a personal computer with compatible 
software that provides real-time updates of the spectral profile during 
sample and spectral collection.

[[Page 855]]

spike flow rate, having the appropriate calibrated range and a stated 
accuracy of <plus-minus>2 percent of the absolute measurement value. 
This device must be calibrated with the major component of the 
calibration/spike gas (e.g., nitrogen) using an NIST traceable bubble 
meter or equivalent. Single point calibration checks should be performed 
daily in the field. When spiking HCl, the mass flow meter/controller 
should be thoroughly purged before and after introduction of the gas to 
prevent corrosion of the interior parts.

    6.8  Sampling Probe. Glass, stainless steel or other appropriate 
material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, 
prevent adsorption of analytes and capable of reaching gas sampling 
point.
    6.9  Sampling Line. Heated 180  deg.C (360  deg.F) and fabricated of 
either stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethane or other material that 
prevents adsorption of HCl and transports effluent to analytical 
instrumentation. The extractive sample line must have the capability to 
transport sample gas to the analytical components as well as direct 
heated calibration spike gas to the calibration assembly located at the 
sample probe. It is important to minimize the length of heated sample 
line.
    6.10  Particulate Filters. A sintered stainless steel filter rated 
at 20 microns or greater may be placed at the inlet of the probe (for 
removal of large particulate matter). A heated filter (Balston or 
equivalent) rated at 1 micron is necessary for primary particulate 
matter removal, and shall be placed immediately after the heated probe. 
The filter/filter holder temperature should be maintained at 180  deg.C 
(360  deg.F).

assembly (or equivalent) to introduce surrogate spikes into the sampling 
system at the outlet of the probe before the primary particulate filter.
    6.12  Sample Extraction Pump. A leak-free heated head pump (KNF 
Neuberger or equivalent) capable of extracting sample effluent through 
entire sampling system at a rate which prevents analyte losses and 
minimizes analyzer response time. The pump should have a heated by-pass 
and may be placed either before the FTIR instrument or after. If the 
sample pump is located upstream of the FTIR instrument, it must be 
fabricated from materials non-reactive to HCl. The sampling system and 
FTIR measurement system shall allow the operator to obtain at least six 
sample spectra during a one-hour period.

calibration or analyte spike) via a heated traced sample line;
    6.14.3  Delivery of sample gas (kiln gas, spiked kiln gas, or system 
calibrations) to the analytical instrumentation;
    6.14.4  Delivery (optional) of a humidified nitrogen sample stream.
    6.15  Flow Measurement Device. Type S Pitot tube (or equivalent) and 
Magnahelic set for measurement of volumetric flow rate.

                       7.0  Reagents and Standards

    HCl can be purchased in a standard compressed gas cylinder. The most 
stable HCl cylinder mixture available has a concentration certified at 
<plus-minus>5 percent. Such a cylinder is suitable for performing 
analyte spiking because it will provide reproducible samples. The 
stability of the cylinder can be monitored over time by periodically 
performing direct FTIR analysis of cylinder samples. It is recommended 
that a 10-50 ppm cylinder of HCl be prepared having from 2-5 ppm SF6 as 
a tracer compound. (See sections 7.1 through 7.3 of Method 320 of this 
appendix for a complete description of the use of existing HCl reference 
spectra. See section 9.1 of Method 320 of this appendix for a complete 
discussion of standard concentration selection.)

            8.0  Sample Collection, Preservation and Storage

    See also Method 320 of this appendix.
    8.1  Pretest. A screening test is ideal for obtaining proper data 
that can be used for preparing analytical program files. Information 
from literature surveys and source personnel is also acceptable. 
Information about the sampling location and gas stream composition is 
required to determine the optimum sampling system configuration for 
measuring HCl. Determine the percent moisture of the kiln gas by Method 
4 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter or by performing a wet bulb/
dry bulb measurement. Perform a preliminary traverse of the sample duct 
or stack and select the sampling point(s). Acquire an initial spectrum 
and determine the optimum operational pathlength of the instrument.

    8.2  Leak-Check. See Method 320 of this appendix, section 8.2 for 
direction on performing leak-checks.
    8.3  Background Spectrum. See Method 320 of this appendix, section 
8.5 for direction in background spectral acquisition.
    8.4  Pre-Test Calibration Transfer Standard (Direct Instrument 
Calibration). See Method 320 of this appendix, section 8.3 for direction 
in CTS spectral acquisition.
    8.5  Pre-Test System Calibration. See Method 320 of this appendix, 
sections 8.6.1 through 8.6.2 for direction in performing system 
calibration.

                              8.6  Sampling

    8.6.1  Extractive System. An extractive system maintained at 180 
deg.C (360  deg.F) or higher which is capable of directing a total flow 
of at least 12 L/min to the sample cell is required (References 1 and 
2). Insert the probe into the duct or stack at a point representing the 
average volumetric flow rate and 25 percent of the cross sectional area. 
Co-locate an appropriate flow monitoring device with the sample probe so 
that the flow rate is recorded at specified time intervals during 
emission testing (e.g., differential pressure measurements taken every 
10 minutes during each run).
    8.6.2  Batch Samples. Evacuate the absorbance cell to 5 Torr (or 
less) absolute pressure before taking first sample. Fill the cell with 
kiln gas to ambient pressure and record the infrared spectrum, then 
evacuate the cell until there is no further evidence of infrared 
absorption. Repeat this procedure, collecting a total of six separate 
sample spectra within a 1-hour period.
    8.6.3  Continuous Flow Through Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 
kiln gas for a time period sufficient to equilibrate the entire sampling 
system and FTIR gas cell. The time required is a function of the 
mechanical response time of the system (determined by performing the 
system calibration with the CTS gas or equivalent), and by the chemical 
reactivity of the target analytes. If the effluent target analyte 
concentration is not variable, observation of the spectral up-date of 
the flowing gas sample should be performed until equilibration of the 
sample is achieved. Isolate the gas cell from the sample flow by 
directing the purge flow to vent. Record the spectrum and pressure of 
the sample gas. After spectral acquisition, allow the sample gas to 
purge the cell with at least three volumes of kiln gas. The time 
required to adequately purge the cell with the required volume of gas is 
a function of (1) cell volume, (2) flow rate through the cell, and (3) 
cell design. It is important that the gas introduction and vent for the 
FTIR cell provides a complete purge through the cell.
    8.6.4  Continuous Sampling. In some cases it is possible to collect 
spectra continuously while the FTIR cell is purged with sample gas. The 
sample integration time, t<INF>ss</INF>, the sample flow rate through 
the gas cell, and the sample integration time must be chosen so that the 
collected data consist of at least 10 spectra with each spectrum being 
of a separate cell volume of flue gas. Sampling in this manner may only 
be performed if the native source analyte concentrations do not affect 
the test results.

                        8.7  Sample Conditioning

    8.7.1  High Moisture Sampling. Kiln gas emitted from wet process 
cement kilns may contain 3- to 40 percent moisture. Zinc selenide 
windows or the equivalent should be used when attempting to analyze hot/
wet kiln gas under these conditions to prevent dissolution of water 
soluble window materials (e.g., KBr).
    8.7.2  Sample Dilution. The sample may be diluted using an in-stack 
dilution probe, or an external dilution device provided that the sample 
is not diluted below the instrument's quantification range. As an 
alternative to using a dilution probe, nitrogen may be dynamically 
spiked into the effluent stream in the same manner as analyte spiking. A 
constant dilution rate shall be maintained throughout the measurement 
process. It is critical to measure and verify the exact dilution ratio 
when using a dilution probe or the nitrogen spiking approach. 
Calibrating the system with a calibration gas containing an appropriate 
tracer compound will allow determination of the dilution ratio for most 
measurement systems. The tester shall specify the procedures used to 
determine the dilution ratio, and include these calibration results in 
the report.
    8.8  Sampling QA, Data Storage and Reporting. See the FTIR Protocol. 
Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the required 
signal-to-noise ratio, and all sample spectra should have unique file 
names. Two copies of sample interferograms and processed spectra will be 
stored on separate computer media. For each sample spectrum the analyst 
must document the sampling conditions, the sampling time (while the cell 
was being filled), the time the spectrum was recorded, the instrumental 
conditions (path length, temperature, pressure, resolution, integration 
time), and the spectral file name. A hard copy of these data must be 
maintained until the test results are accepted.
    8.9  Signal Transmittance. Monitor the signal transmittance through 
the instrumental system. If signal transmittance (relative to the 
background) drops below 95 percent in any spectral region where the 
sample does not absorb infrared energy, then a new background spectrum 
must be obtained.

[[Page 857]]

    8.10  Post-test CTS. After the sampling run completion, record the 
CTS spectrum. Analysis of the spectral band area used for quantification 
from pre- and post-test CTS spectra should agree to within <plus-minus>5 
percent or corrective action must be taken.
    8.11  Post-test QA. The sample spectra shall be inspected 
immediately after the run to verify that the gas matrix composition was 
close to the assumed gas matrix, (this is necessary to account for the 
concentrations of the interferants for use in the analytical analysis 
programs), and to confirm that the sampling and instrumental parameters 
were appropriate for the conditions encountered.

                          9.0  Quality Control

    Use analyte spiking to verify the effectiveness of the sampling 
system for the target compounds in the actual kiln gas matrix. QA 
spiking shall be performed before and after each sample run. QA spiking 
shall be performed after the pre- and post-test CTS direct and system 
calibrations. The system biases calculated from the pre- and post-test 
dynamic analyte spiking shall be within <plus-minus>30 percent for the 
spiked surrogate analytes for the measurements to be considered valid. 
See sections 9.3.1 through 9.3.2 for the requisite calculations. 
Measurement of the undiluted spike (direct-to-cell measurement) involves 
sending dry, spike gas to the FTIR cell, filling the cell to 1 
atmosphere and obtaining the spectrum of this sample. The direct-to-cell 
measurement should be performed before each analyte spike so that the 
recovery of the dynamically spiked analytes may be calculated. Analyte 
spiking is only effective for assessing the integrity of the sampling 
system when the concentration of HCl in the source does not vary 
substantially. Any attempt to quantify an analyte recovery in a variable 
concentration matrix will result in errors in the expected concentration 
of the spiked sample. If the kiln gas target analyte concentrations vary 
by more than <plus-minus>5 percent (or 5 ppm, whichever is greater) in 
the time required to acquire a sample spectrum, it may be necessary to: 
(1) Use a dual sample probe approach, (2) use two independent FTIR 
measurement systems, (3) use alternate QA/QC procedures, or (4) postpone 
testing until stable emission concentrations are achieved. (See section 
9.2.3 of this method). It is recommended that a laboratory evaluation be 
performed before attempting to employ this method under actual field 
conditions. The laboratory evaluation shall include (1) performance of 
all applicable calculations in section 4 of the FTIR Protocol; (2) 
simulated analyte spiking experiments in dry (ambient) and humidified 
sample matrices using HCl; and (3) performance of bias (recovery) 
calculations from analyte spiking experiments. It is not necessary to 
perform a laboratory evaluation before every field test. The purpose of 
the laboratory study is to demonstrate that the actual instrument and 
sampling system configuration used in field testing meets the 
requirements set forth in this method.
    9.1  Spike Materials. Perform analyte spiking with an HCl standard 
to demonstrate the integrity of the sampling system.
    9.1.1  An HCl standard of approximately 50 ppm in a balance of ultra 
pure nitrogen is recommended. The SF<INF>6</INF> (tracer) concentration 
shall be 2 to 5 ppm depending upon the measurement pathlength. The spike 
ratio (spike flow/total flow) shall be no greater than 1:10, and an 
ideal spike concentration should approximate the native effluent 
concentration.
    9.1.2  The ideal spike concentration may not be achieved because the 
target concentration cannot be accurately predicted prior to the field 
test, and limited calibration standards will be available during 
testing. Therefore, practical constraints must be applied that allow the 
tester to spike at an anticipated concentration. For these tests, the 
analyte concentration contributed by the HCl standard spike should be 1 
to 5 ppm or should more closely approximate the native concentration if 
it is greater.

                          9.2  Spike Procedure

     9.2.1  A spiking/sampling apparatus is shown in Figure 2. Introduce 
the spike/tracer gas mixture at a constant flow (<plus-minus>2 percent) 
rate at approximately 10 percent of the total sample flow. (For example, 
introduce the surrogate spike at 1 L/min  20 cc/min, into a total sample 
flow rate of 10 L/min). The spike must be pre-heated before introduction 
into the sample matrix to prevent a localized condensation of the gas 
stream at the spike introduction point. A heated sample transport 
line(s) containing multiple transport tubes within the heated bundle may 
be used to spike gas up through the sampling system to the spike 
introduction point. Use a calibrated flow device (e.g., mass flow meter/
controller), to monitor the spike flow as indicated by a calibrated flow 
meter or controller, or alternately, the SF<INF>6</INF> tracer ratio may 
be calculated from the direct measurement and the diluted measurement. 
It is often desirable to use the tracer approach in calculating the 
spike/total flow ratio because of the difficulty in accurately measuring 
hot/wet total flow. The tracer technique has been successfully used in 
past validation efforts (Reference 1).
    9.2.2  Perform a direct-to-cell measurement of the dry, undiluted 
spike gas. Introduce the spike directly to the FTIR cell, bypassing the 
sampling system. Fill cell to 1 atmosphere and collect the spectrum of 
this sample. Ensure that the spike gas has equilibrated to the 
temperature of the measurement cell before acquisition of the spectra. 
Inspect the spectrum and verify that the gas

[[Page 858]]

is dry and contains negligible CO<INF>2</INF>. Repeat the process to 
obtain a second direct-to-cell measurement. Analysis of spectral band 
areas for HCl from these duplicate measurements should agree to within 
<plus-minus>5 percent of the mean.
    9.2.3  Analyte Spiking. Determine whether the kiln gas contains 
native concentrations of HCl by examination of preliminary spectra. 
Determine whether the concentration varies significantly with time by 
observing a continuously up-dated spectrum of sample gas in the flow-
through sampling mode. If the concentration varies by more than 
<plus-minus>5 percent during the period of time required to acquire a 
spectra, then an alternate approach should be used. One alternate 
approach uses two sampling lines to convey sample to the gas 
distribution manifold. One of the sample lines is used to continuously 
extract unspiked kiln gas from the source. The other sample line serves 
as the analyte spike line. One FTIR system can be used in this 
arrangement. Spiked or unspiked sample gas may be directed to the FTIR 
system from the gas distribution manifold, with the need to purge only 
the components between the manifold and the FTIR system. This approach 
minimizes the time required to acquire an equilibrated sample of spiked 
or unspiked kiln gas. If the source varies by more than <plus-minus>5 
percent (or 5 ppm, whichever is greater) in the time it takes to switch 
from the unspiked sample line to the spiked sample line, then analyte 
spiking may not be a feasible means to determine the effectiveness of 
the sampling system for the HCl in the sample matrix. A second 
alternative is to use two completely independent FTIR measurement 
systems. One system would measure unspiked samples while the other 
system would measure the spiked samples. As a last option, (where no 
other alternatives can be used) a humidified nitrogen stream may be 
generated in the field which approximates the moisture content of the 
kiln gas. Analyte spiking into this humidified stream can be employed to 
assure that the sampling system is adequate for transporting the HCl to 
the FTIR instrumentation.
    9.2.3.1  Adjust the spike flow rate to approximately 10 percent of 
the total flow by metering spike gas through a calibrated mass flowmeter 
or controller. Allow spike flow to equilibrate within the sampling 
system before analyzing the first spiked kiln gas samples. A minimum of 
two consecutive spikes are required. Analysis of the spectral band area 
used for quantification should agree to within <plus-minus>5 percent or 
corrective action must be taken.
    9.2.3.2  After QA spiking is completed, the sampling system 
components shall be purged with nitrogen or dry air to eliminate traces 
of the HCl compound from the sampling system components. Acquire a 
sample spectra of the nitrogen purge to verify the absence of the 
calibration mixture.
    9.2.3.3  Analyte spiking procedures must be carefully executed to 
ensure that meaningful measurements are achieved. The requirements of 
sections 9.2.3.3.1 through 9.2.3.3.4 shall be met.
    9.2.3.3.1  The spike must be in the vapor phase, dry, and heated to 
(or above) the kiln gas temperature before it is introduced to the kiln 
gas stream.
    9.2.3.3.2  The spike flow rate must be constant and accurately 
measured.
    9.2.3.3.3  The total flow must also be measured continuously and 
reliably or the dilution ratio must otherwise be verified before and 
after a run by introducing a spike of a non-reactive, stable compound 
(i.e., tracer).
    9.2.3.3.4  The tracer must be inert to the sampling system 
components, not contained in the effluent gas, and readily detected by 
the analytical instrumentation. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<INF>6</INF>) has 
been used successfully (References 1 and 2) for this purpose.

                            9.3  Calculations

    9.3.1  Recovery. Calculate the percent recovery of the spiked 
analytes using equations 1 and 2.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.033

S<INF>m</INF> = Mean concentration of the analyte spiked effluent 
          samples (observed).
          [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.034
          
C<INF>e</INF> = Expected concentration of the spiked samples 
          (theoretical).
D<INF>f</INF> = dilution Factor (Total flow/Spike flow). total flow = 
          spike flow plus effluent flow.
C<INF>s</INF> = cylinder concentration of spike gas.
S<INF>u</INF> = native concentration of analytes in unspiked samples.

The spike dilution factor may be confirmed by measuring the total flow 
and the spike flow directly. Alternately, the spike dilution can be 
verified by comparing the concentration of the tracer compound in the 
spiked samples (diluted) to the tracer concentration in the direct 
(undiluted) measurement of the spike gas.
If SF<INF>6</INF> is the tracer gas, then

[SF<INF>6</INF>]<INF>spike</INF> = the diluted SF<INF>6</INF> 
          concentration measured in a spiked sample.
[SF<INF>6</INF>]<INF>direct</INF> = the SF<INF>6</INF> concentration 
          measured directly.

    9.3.2  Bias. The bias may be determined by the difference between 
the observed spike value and the expected response (i.e., the equivalent 
concentration of the spiked material plus the analyte concentration 
adjusted

[[Page 859]]

for spike dilution). Bias is defined by section 6.3.1 of EPA Method 301 
of this appendix (Reference 8) as,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.036

Where:
B = Bias at spike level.
S<INF>m</INF> = Mean concentration of the analyte spiked samples.
C<INF>e</INF> = Expected concentration of the analyte in spiked samples.

Acceptable recoveries for analyte spiking are <plus-minus>30 percent. 
Application of correction factors to the data based upon bias and 
recovery calculations is subject to the approval of the Administrator.

                  10.0  Calibration and Standardization

    10.1  Calibration transfer standards (CTS). The EPA Traceability 
Protocol gases or NIST traceable standards, with a minimum accuracy of 
<plus-minus>2 percent shall be used. For other requirements of the CTS, 
see the FTIR Protocol section 4.5.
    10.2  Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The S/N shall be less than the 
minimum acceptable measurement uncertainty in the analytical regions to 
be used for measuring HCl.
    10.3  Absorbance Pathlength. Verify the absorbance path length by 
comparing CTS spectra to reference spectra of the calibration gas(es).
    10.4  Instrument Resolution. Measure the line width of appropriate 
CTS band(s) to verify instrumental resolution.
    10.5  Apodization Function. Choose the appropriate apodization 
function. Determine any appropriate mathematical transformations that 
are required to correct instrumental errors by measuring the CTS. Any 
mathematical transformations must be documented and reproducible. 
Reference 9 provides additional information about FTIR instrumentation.

                       11.0  Analytical Procedure

    A full description of the analytical procedures is given in sections 
4.6-4.11, sections 5, 6, and 7, and the appendices of the FTIR Protocol. 
Additional description of quantitative spectral analysis is provided in 
References 10 and 11.

                  12.0  Data Analysis and Calculations

    Data analysis is performed using appropriate reference spectra whose 
concentrations can be verified using CTS spectra. Various analytical 
programs (References 10 and 11) are available to relate sample 
absorbance to a concentration standard. Calculated concentrations should 
be verified by analyzing spectral baselines after mathematically 
subtracting scaled reference spectra from the sample spectra. A full 
description of the data analysis and calculations may be found in the 
FTIR Protocol (sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices).
    12.1  Calculated concentrations in sample spectra are corrected for 
differences in absorption pathlength between the reference and sample 
spectra by
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.037

Where:

C<INF>corr</INF> = The pathlength corrected concentration.
C<INF>calc</INF> = The initial calculated concentration (output of the 
          multicomponent analysis program designed for the compound).
L<INF>r</INF> = The pathlength associated with the reference spectra.
L<INF>s</INF> = The pathlength associated with the sample spectra.
T<INF>s</INF> = The absolute temperature (K) of the sample gas.
T<INF>r</INF> = The absolute temperature (K) at which reference spectra 
          were recorded.

    12.2  The temperature correction in equation 5 is a volumetric 
correction. It does not account for temperature dependence of 
rotational-vibrational relative line intensities. Whenever possible, the 
reference spectra used in the analysis should be collected at a 
temperature near the temperature of the FTIR cell used in the test to 
minimize the calculated error in the measurement (FTIR Protocol, 
appendix D). Additionally, the analytical region chosen for the analysis 
should be sufficiently broad to minimize errors caused by small 
differences in relative line intensities between reference spectra and 
the sample spectra.

                        13.0  Method Performance

    A description of the method performance may be found in the FTIR 
Protocol. This method is self validating provided the results meet the 
performance specification of the QA spike in sections 9.0 through 9.3 of 
this method.

                       14.0  Pollution Prevention

    This is a gas phase measurement. Gas is extracted from the source, 
analyzed by the instrumentation, and discharged through the instrument 
vent.

    Appendix C to Part 63--Determination of the Fraction Biodegraded 
            (F<INF>bio</INF>) in a Biological Treatment Unit

                               I. Purpose

    The purpose of this appendix is to define the procedures for an 
owner or operator to use to calculate the site specific fraction of 
organic compounds biodegraded (F<INF>bio</INF>) in a biological 
treatment unit. If an acceptable level of organic compounds is destroyed 
rather than emitted to the air or remaining in the effluent, the 
biological treatment unit may be used to comply with the applicable 
treatment requirements without the unit being covered and vented through 
a closed vent system to an air pollution control device.
    The determination of F<INF>bio</INF> shall be made on a system as it 
would exist under the rule. The owner or operator should anticipate 
changes that would occur to the wastewater flow and concentration of 
organics, to be treated by the biological treatment unit, as a result of 
enclosing the collection and treatment system as required by the rule.
    The forms presented in this appendix are designed to be applied to 
thoroughly mixed treatment units. A thoroughly mixed treatment unit is a 
unit that is designed and operated to approach or achieve uniform 
biomass distribution and organic compound concentration throughout the 
aeration unit by quickly dispersing the recycled biomass and the 
wastewater entering the unit. Systems that are not thoroughly mixed 
treatment units should be subdivided into a series of zones that have 
uniform characteristics within each zone. The number of zones required 
to characterize a biological treatment system will depend on the design 
and operation of the treatment system. Each zone should then be modeled 
as a separate unit. The amount of air emissions and biodegradation from 
the modeling of these separate zones can then be added to reflect the 
entire system.

                             II. Definitions

    Biological treatment unit = wastewater treatment unit designed and 
operated to promote the growth of bacteria to destroy organic materials 
in wastewater.

f<INF>bio</INF> = The fraction of individual applicable organic 
          compounds in the wastewater biodegraded in a biological 
          treatment unit.
F<INF>bio</INF> = The fraction of total applicable organic compounds in 
          the wastewater biodegraded in a biological treatment unit.
Fe = The fraction of applicable organic compounds emitted from the 
          wastewater to the atmosphere.
K1 = First order biodegradation rate constant, L/g MLVSS-hr
KL = liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient, m/s
M = compound specific mass flow weighted average of organic compounds in 
          the wastewater, Mg/Yr

          III. Procedures for Determination of f<INF>bio</INF>

    The first step in the analysis to determine if a biological 
treatment unit may be used without being covered and vented through a 
closed-vent system to an air pollution control device, is to determine 
the compound-specific f<INF>bio</INF>. The following four procedures may 
be used to determine f<INF>bio</INF>:
    (1) EPA Test Method 304A or 304B (appendix A, part 63)--Method for 
the Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds,
    (2) Performance data with and without biodegradation,
    (3) Inlet and outlet concentration measurements,
    (4) Batch Tests.
    All procedures must be executed so that the resulting 
F<INF>bio</INF> is based on the collection system and waste management 
units being

[[Page 864]]

in compliance with the regulation. If the collection system and waste 
management units meet the suppression requirements at the time of the 
test, any of the four procedures may be chosen. If the collection system 
and waste management units are not in compliance at the time of the 
performance test, then only Method 304A, 304B, or the Batch Test shall 
be chosen. If Method 304A, 304B, or the Batch Test is used, any 
anticipated changes to the influent of the full-scale biological 
treatment unit that will occur after the facility has enclosed the 
collection system must be represented in the influent feed to the 
benchtop bioreactor unit, or test unit.
    Select one or more appropriate procedures from the four listed above 
based on the availability of site specific data. If the facility does 
not have site-specific data on the removal efficiency of its biological 
treatment unit, then Procedure 1 or Procedure 4 may be used. Procedure 1 
allows the use of a bench top bioreactor to determine the first-order 
biodegradation rate constant. An owner or operator may elect to assume 
the first order biodegradation rate constant is zero for any regulated 
compound(s) present in the wastewater. Procedure 4 explains two types of 
batch tests which may be used to estimate the first order biodegradation 
rate constant. An owner or operator may elect to assume the first order 
biodegradation rate constant is zero for any regulated compound(s) 
present in the wastewater. Procedure 3 would be used if the facility 
has, or measures to determine, data on the inlet and outlet individual 
organic compound concentration for the biological treatment unit. 
Procedure 3 may only be used on a thoroughly mixed treatment unit. 
Procedure 2 is used if a facility has or obtains performance data on a 
biotreatment unit prior to and after addition of the microbial mass. An 
example where Procedure 2 could be used, is an activated sludge unit 
where measurements have been taken on inlet and exit concentration of 
organic compounds in the wastewater prior to seeding with the microbial 
mass and start-up of the unit. The flow chart in figure 1 outlines the 
steps to use for each of the procedures.

                  A. Method 304A or 304B (Procedure 1)

    If the first procedure is selected, follow the instructions in 
appendix A of part 63 Method 304A ``Method for the Determination of 
Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds (Vented Option)'' or Method 
304B ``Method for the Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic 
Compounds (Scrubber Option).'' Method 304A or 304B provides instruction 
on setting up and operating a self-contained benchtop bioreactor system 
which is operated under conditions representative of the target full-
scale system. Method 304A uses a benchtop bioreactor system with a vent, 
and uses modeling to estimate any air emissions. Method 304B uses a 
benchtop bioreactor system which is equipped with a scrubber and is not 
vented.
    There are some restrictions on which method a source may use. If the 
facility is measuring the rate of biodegradation of compounds that may 
tend to react or hydrolyze in the scrubber of Method 304B, this method 
shall not be used and Method 304A is the required method. If a Henry's 
law value is not available to use with Form V, then Method 304A shall 
not be used and Method 304B is the required method. When using either 
method, the feed flow to the benchtop bioreactor shall be representative 
of the flow and concentration of the wastewater that will be treated by 
the full-scale biological treatment unit after the collection and 
treatment system has been enclosed as required under the applicable 
subpart.
    The conditions under which the full-scale biological treatment unit 
is run establish the operating parameters of Method 304A or 304B. If the 
biological treatment unit is operated under abnormal operating 
conditions (conditions outside the range of critical parameters examined 
and confirmed in the laboratory), the EPA believes this will adversely 
affect the biodegradation rate and is an unacceptable treatment option. 
The facility would be making multiple runs of the test method to 
simulate the operating range for its biological treatment unit. For wide 
ranges of variation in operating parameters, the facility shall 
demonstrate the biological treatment unit is achieving an acceptable 
level of control, as required by the regulation, across the ranges and 
not only at the endpoints.
    If Method 304A is used, complete Form V initially. Form V is used to 
calculate K1 from the Method 304A results. Form V uses the Henry's law 
constant to estimate the fraction lost from the benchtop reactor vent. 
The owner or operator shall use the Henry's law values in Table I. Form 
V also gives direction for calculating an equivalent KL. Note on Form V 
if the calculated number for line 11 is greater than the calculated 
value for line 13, this procedure shall not be used to demonstrate the 
compound is biodegradable. If line 11 is greater than line 13, this is 
an indication the fraction emitted from the vent is greater than the 
fraction biodegraded. The equivalent KL determined on Form V is used in 
Form II (line 6). Estimation of the Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> must be done 
following the steps in Form III. Form III uses the previously calculated 
values of K1 and KL (equivalent KL), and site-specific parameters of the 
full-scale bioreactor as input to the calculations. Forms II, III, and V 
must be completed for each organic compound in the wastewater to 
determine Fe and f<INF>bio.</INF>
    If Method 304B is used, perform the method and use the measurements 
to determine K1, which is the first-order biodegradation rate

[[Page 865]]

constant. Form I lists the sequence of steps in the procedure for 
calculating K1 from the Method 304B results. Once K1 is determined, KL 
must be calculated by use of mass transfer equations. Form II outlines 
the procedure to follow for use of mass transfer equations to determine 
KL. A computer program which incorporates these mass transfer equations 
may be used. Water7 is a program that incorporates these mass transfer 
equations and may be used to determine KL. Refer to Form II-A to 
determine KL, if Water7 or the most recent update to this model is used. 
In addition, the Bay Area Sewage Toxics Emission (BASTE) model version 
3.0 or equivalent upgrade and the TOXCHEM (Environment Canada's 
Wastewater Technology Centre and Environmega, Ltd.) model version 1.10 
or equivalent upgrade may also be used to determine KL for the 
biological treatment unit with several stipulations. The programs must 
be altered to output a KL value which is based on the site-specific 
parameters of the unit modeled, and the Henry's law values listed in 
Table I must be substituted for the existing Henry's law values in the 
programs. Input values used in the model and corresponding output values 
shall become documentation of the f<INF>bio</INF> determination. The 
owner or operator should be aware these programs do not allow modeling 
of certain units. To model these units, the owner or operator shall use 
one of the other appropriate procedures as outlined in this appendix. 
The owner or operator shall not use a default value for KL. The KL value 
determined by use of these models shall be based on the site-specific 
parameters of the specific unit. This KL value shall be inserted in Form 
II (line 6). Estimation of the Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> must be done 
following the steps in Form III. Form III uses the previously calculated 
values of K1 and KL, and site-specific parameters of the full-scale 
bioreactor as input to the calculations. Forms I, II, and III must be 
completed for each organic compound in the wastewater to determine Fe 
and f<INF>bio.</INF>

    B. Performance Data With and Without Biodegradation (Procedure 2)

    Procedure 2 uses site-specific performance data that represents or 
characterizes operation of the unit both with and without 
biodegradation. As previously mentioned, proper determination of 
f<INF>bio</INF> must be made on a system as it would exist under the 
rule. Using Form IV, calculate KL and K1. After KL and K1 are 
determined, Form III is used to calculate Fe and f<INF>bio</INF> for 
each organic compound present in the wastewater.

      C. Inlet and Outlet Concentration Measurements (Procedure 3)

    Procedure 3 uses measured inlet and outlet organic compound 
concentrations for the unit. This procedure may only be used on a 
thoroughly mixed treatment unit. Again, proper determination of 
f<INF>bio</INF> must be made on a system as it would exist under the 
rule. The first step in using this procedure is to calculate KL using 
Form II. A computer model may be used. If the Water7 model or the most 
recent update to this model is used, then use Form II-A to calculate KL. 
After KL is determined using field data, complete Form VI to calculate 
K1. The TOXCHEM or BASTE model may also be used to calculate KL for the 
biological treatment unit, with the stipulations listed in procedure 
304B. After KL and K1 are determined, Form III is used to calculate Fe 
and f<INF>bio</INF> for each organic compound.

                      D. Batch Tests (Procedure 4)

    Two types of batch tests which may be used to determine kinetic 
parameters are: (1) The aerated reactor test and (2) the sealed reactor 
test. The aerated reactor test is also known as the BOX test (batch test 
with oxygen addition). The sealed reactor test is also known as the 
serum bottle test. These batch tests should be conducted only by persons 
familiar with procedures for determining biodegradation kinetics. 
Detailed discussions of batch procedures for determining biodegradation 
kinetic parameters can be found in references 1-4.
    For both batch test approaches, a biomass sample from the activated 
sludge unit of interest is collected, aerated, and stored for no more 
than 4 hours prior to testing. To collect sufficient data when 
biodegradation is rapid, it may be necessary to dilute the biomass 
sample. If the sample is to be diluted, the biomass sample shall be 
diluted using treated effluent from the activated sludge unit of 
interest to a concentration such that the biodegradation test will last 
long enough to make at least six concentration measurements. It is 
recommended that the tests not be terminated until the compound 
concentration falls below the limit of quantitation (LOQ). Measurements 
that are below the LOQ should not be used in the data analysis. Biomass 
concentrations shall be determined using standard methods for 
measurement of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) (reference 
5).
    The change in concentration of a test compound may be monitored by 
either measuring the concentration in the liquid or in the reactor 
headspace. The analytical technique chosen for the test should be as 
sensitive as possible. For the batch test procedures described in this 
section, equilibrium conditions must exist between the liquid and gas 
phases of the experiments because the data analysis procedures are based 
on this premise. To use the headspace sampling approach, the reactor 
headspace must be in equilibrium with the liquid so that the headspace 
concentrations can be correlated

[[Page 866]]

with the liquid concentrations. Before the biodegradation testing is 
conducted, the equilibrium assumption must be verified. A discussion of 
the equilibrium assumption verification is given below in sections D.1 
and D.2 since different approaches are required for the two types of 
batch tests.
    To determine biodegradation kinetic parameters in a batch test, it 
is important to choose an appropriate initial substrate (compound(s) of 
interest) concentration for the test. The outcome of the batch 
experiment may be influenced by the initial substrate (S<INF>O</INF>) to 
biomass (X<INF>O</INF>) ratio (see references 3, 4, and 6). This ratio 
is typically measured in chemical oxygen demand (COD) units. When the 
S<INF>O</INF>/X<INF>O</INF> ratio is low, cell multiplication and growth 
in the batch test is negligible and the kinetics measured by the test 
are representative of the kinetics in the activated sludge unit of 
interest. The S<INF>O</INF>/X<INF>O</INF> ratio for a batch test is 
determined with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.034

Where:

S<INF>O</INF>/X<INF>O</INF>=initial substrate to biomass ratio on a COD 
          basis
S<INF>i</INF>=initial substrate concentration in COD units (g COD/L)
X=biomass concentration in the batch test (g MLVSS/L)
1.42 = Conversion factor to convert to COD units

    For the batch tests described in this section, the S<INF>O</INF>/
X<INF>O</INF> ratio (on a COD basis) must be initially less than 0.5.
    1. Aerated Reactor Test. An aerated draft tube reactor may be used 
for the biokinetics testing (as an example see Figure 2 of appendix C). 
Other aerated reactor configurations may also be used. Air is bubbled 
through a porous frit at a rate sufficient to aerate and keep the 
reactor uniformly mixed. Aeration rates typically vary from 50 to 200 
ml/min for a 1 liter system. A mass flow rate controller is used to 
carefully control the air flow rate because it is important to have an 
accurate measure of this rate. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration 
in the system must not fall below 2 mg/liter so that the biodegradation 
observed will not be DO-limited. Once the air flow rate is established, 
the test mixture (or compound) of interest is then injected into the 
reactor and the concentration of the compound(s) is monitored over time. 
Concentrations may be monitored in the liquid or in the headspace. A 
minimum of six samples shall be taken over the period of the test. 
However, it is necessary to collect samples until the compound 
concentration falls below the LOQ. If liquid samples are collected, they 
must be small enough such that the liquid volume in the batch reactor 
does not change by more than 10%.
    Before conducting experiments with biomass, it is necessary to 
verify the equilibrium assumption. The equilibrium assumption can be 
verified by conducting a stripping experiment using the effluent (no 
biomass) from the activated sludge unit of interest. Effluent is 
filtered with a 0.45 um or smaller filter and placed in the draft tube 
reactor. Air is sparged into the system and the compound concentration 
in the liquid or headspace is monitored over time. This test with no 
biomass may provide an estimate of the Henry's law constant. If the 
system is at equilibrium, the Henry's law constant may be estimated with 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.035

Where:

C=cencentration at time, t (min)
C<INF>O</INF>=concentration at t=0
G=volumetric gas flow rate (ml/min)
V=liquid volume in the batch reactor (ml)
K<INF>eq</INF>=Henry's law constant (mg/L-gas)/(mg/L-liquid)
t=time (min)

    A plot of--ln(C/C<INF>o</INF>) as a function of t will have a slope 
equal to GK<INF>eq</INF>/V. The equilibrium assumption can be verified 
by comparing the experimentally determined K<INF>eq</INF> for the system 
to literature values of the Henry's Law constant (including those listed 
in this appendix). If K<INF>eq</INF> does not match the Henry's law 
constant, K<INF>eq</INF> shall be determined from analysis of the 
headspace and liquid concentration in a batch system.
    The concentration of a compound decreases in the bioreactor due to 
both biodegradation and stripping. Biodegradation processes are 
typically described with a Monod model. This model and a stripping 
expression are combined to give a mass balance for the aerated draft 
tube reactor ):

[[Page 867]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.036

Where:

s=test compound concentration, mg/liter
G=volumetric gas flow rate, liters/hr
K<INF>eq</INF>=Henry's Law constant measured in the system, (mg/liter 
          gas)/(mg/liter liquid)
V=volume of liquid in the reactor, liters
X=biomass concentration (g MLVSS/liter)
Q<INF>m</INF>=maximum rate of substrate removal, mg/g MLVSS/hr
K<INF>S</INF>=Monod biorate constant at half the maximum rate, mg/liter

    Equation App.C-3 has the analytical solution:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.037
    
Where:

A=GK<INF>eq</INF> K<INF>S</INF>+ Q<INF>m</INF> VX
B=GK<INF>eq</INF>
S<INF>O</INF>=test compound concentration at t=0

    This equation is used along with the substrate concentration versus 
time data to determine the best fit parameters (Q<INF>m</INF> and 
K<INF>S</INF>) to describe the biodegradation process in the aerated 
reactor. If the aerated reactor test is used, the following procedure is 
used to analyze the data. Evaluate K<INF>eq</INF> for the compound of 
interest with Form XI. The concentration in the vented headspace or 
liquid is measured as a function of time and the data is entered on Form 
XI. A plot is made from the data and attached to the Form XI. 
K<INF>eq</INF> is calculated on Form XI and the results are contrasted 
with the expected value of Henry's law obtained from Form IX. If the 
comparison is satisfactory, the stripping constant is calculated from 
K<INF>eq</INF>, completing Form XI. The values of K<INF>eq</INF> may 
differ because the theoretical value of K<INF>eq</INF> may not be 
applicable to the system of interest. If the comparison of the 
calculated K<INF>eq</INF> from the form and the expected value of 
Henry's law is unsatisfactory, Form X can alternatively be used to 
validate K<INF>eq</INF>. If the aerated reactor is demonstrated to not 
be at equilibrium, either modify the reactor design and/or operation, or 
use another type of batch test.
    The compound-specific biorate constants are then measured using Form 
XII. The stripping constant that was determined from Form XI and a 
headspace correction factor of 1 are entered on Form XII. The aerated 
reactor biotest may then be run, measuring concentrations of each 
compound of interest as a function of time. If headspace concentrations 
are measured instead of liquid concentrations, then the corresponding 
liquid concentrations are calculated from the headspace measurements 
using the K<INF>eq</INF> determined on Form XI and entered on Form XII.
    The concentration data on Form XII may contain scatter that can 
adversely influence the data interpretation. It is possible to curve fit 
the concentration data and enter the concentrations on the fitted curve 
instead of the actual data. If curve fitting is used, the curve-fitting 
procedure must be based upon the Equation App. C-4. When curve fitting 
is used, it is necessary to attach a plot of the actual data and the 
fitted curve to Form XII.
    If the stripping rate constant is relatively large when compared to 
the biorate at low concentrations, it may be difficult to obtain 
accurate evaluations of the first-order biorate constant. In these 
cases, either reducing the stripping rate constant by lowering the 
aeration rate, or increasing the biomass concentrations should be 
considered.
    The final result of the batch testing is the measurement of a 
biorate that can be used to estimate the fraction biodegraded, 
f<INF>bio</INF>. The number transferred to Form III is obtained from 
Form XII, line 9.
    2. Sealed Reactor Test. This test uses a closed system to prevent 
losses of the test compound by volatilization. This test may be 
conducted using a serum bottle or a sealed draft tube reactor (for an 
example see Figure 3 of appendix C). Since no air is supplied, it is 
necessary to ensure that sufficient oxygen is present in the system. The 
DO concentration in the system must not fall below 2 mg/liter so that 
the biodegradation observed will not be DO-limited. As an alternative, 
oxygen may be supplied by electrolysis as needed to maintain the DO 
concentration above 2 mg/liter. The reactor contents must be uniformly 
mixed, by stirring

[[Page 868]]

or agitation using a shaker or similar apparatus. The test mixture (or 
compound) of interest is injected into the reactor and the concentration 
is monitored over time. A minimum of six samples shall be taken over the 
period of the test. However, it is necessary to monitor the 
concentration until it falls below the LOQ.
    The equilibrium assumption must be verified for the batch reactor 
system. In this case, K<INF>eq</INF> may be determined by simultaneously 
measuring gas and liquid phase concentrations at different times within 
a given experiment. A constant ratio of gas/liquid concentrations 
indicates that equilibrium conditions are present and K<INF>eq</INF> is 
not a function of concentration. This ratio is then taken as the 
K<INF>eq</INF> for the specific compound in the test. It is not 
necessary to measure K<INF>eq</INF> for each experiment. If the ratio is 
not constant, the equilibrium assumption is not valid and it is 
necessary to (1) increase mixing energy for the system and retest for 
the equilibrium assumption, or (2) use a different type of test (for 
example, a collapsible volume reactor).
    The concentration of a compound decreases in the bioreactor due to 
biodegradation according to Equation App. C-5:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.038

Where:

s=test compound concentration (mg/liters)
V<INF>l</INF>=the average liquid volume in the reactor (liters)
V<INF>g</INF>=the average gas volume in the reactor (liters)
Q<INF>m</INF>=maximum rate of substrate removal (mg/g ML VSS/hr)
K<INF>eq</INF>=Henry's Law constant determined for the test, (mg/liter 
          gas)/(mg/liter liquid)
K<INF>s</INF>=Monod biorate constant at one-half the maximum rate (mg/
          liter)
t=time (hours)
X=biomass concentration (g ML VSS/liter )
s<INF>o</INF>=test compound concentration at time t=0

    Equation App. C-5 can be solved analytically to give:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.039
    
    This equation is used along with the substrate concentration versus 
time data to determine the best fit parameters (Q<INF>m</INF> and 
K<INF>s</INF>) to describe the biodegradation process in the sealed 
reactor.
    If the sealed reactor test is used, Form X is used to determine the 
headspace correction factor. The disappearance of a compound in the 
sealed reactor test is slowed because a fraction of the compound is not 
available for biodegradation because it is present in the headspace. If 
the compound is almost entirely in the liquid phase, the headspace 
correction factor is approximately one. If the headspace correction 
factor is substantially less than one, improved mass transfer or reduced 
headspace may improve the accuracy of the sealed reactor test. A 
preliminary sealed reactor test must be conducted to test the 
equilibrium assumption. As the compound of interest is degraded, 
simultaneous headspace and liquid samples should be collected and Form X 
should be used to evaluate K<INF>eq</INF>. The ratio of headspace to 
liquid concentrations must be constant in order to confirm that 
equilibrium conditions exist. If equilibrium conditions are not present, 
additional mixing or an alternate reactor configuration may be required.
    The compound-specific biorate constants are then calculated using 
Form XII. For the sealed reactor test, a stripping rate constant of zero 
and the headspace correction factor that was determined from Form X are 
entered on Form XII. The sealed reactor test may then be run, measuring 
the concentrations of each compound of interest as a function of time. 
If headspace concentrations are measured instead of liquid 
concentrations, then the corresponding liquid concentrations are 
calculated from the headspace measurements using K<INF>eq</INF> from 
Form X and entered on Form XII.
    The concentration data on Form XII may contain scatter that can 
adversely influence the data interpretation. It is possible to

[[Page 869]]

curve fit the concentration data and enter the concentrations on the 
fitted curve instead of the actual data. If curve fitting is used, the 
curve-fitting procedure must be based upon Equation App. C-6. When curve 
fitting is used, it is necessary to attach a plot of the actual data and 
the fitted curve to Form XII.
    If a sealed collapsible reactor is used that has no headspace, the 
headspace correction factor will equal 1, but the stripping rate 
constant may not equal 0 due to diffusion losses through the reactor 
wall. The ratio of the rate of loss of compound to the concentration of 
the compound in the reactor (units of per hour) must be evaluated. This 
loss ratio has the same units as the stripping rate constant and may be 
entered as the stripping rate constant on line 1 of Form XII.
    If the loss due to diffusion through the walls of the collapsible 
reactor is relatively large when compared to the biorate at low 
concentrations, it may be difficult to obtain accurate evaluations of 
the first-order biorate constant. In these cases, either replacing the 
materials used to construct the reactor with materials of low 
permeability or increasing the biomass concentration should be 
considered.
    The final result of the batch testing is the measurement of a 
biorate that can be used to estimate the fraction biodegraded, 
f<INF>bio</INF>. The number transferred to Form III is obtained from 
Form XII, line 9.
    The number on Form XII line 9 will equal the Monod first-order 
biorate constant if the full-scale system is operated in the first-order 
range. If the full-scale system is operated at concentrations above that 
of the Monod first-order range, the value of the number on line 9 will 
be somewhat lower than the Monod first-order biorate constant. With 
supporting biorate data, the Monod model used in Form XII may be used to 
estimate the effective biorate constant K1 for use in Form III.
    If a reactor with headspace is used, analysis of the data using 
equation App. C-6 is valid only if V<INF>l</INF> and V<INF>g</INF> do 
not change more than 10% (i.e., they can be approximated as constant for 
the duration of the test). Since biodegradation is occurring only in the 
liquid, as the liquid concentration decreases it is necessary for mass 
to transfer from the gas to the liquid phase. This may require vigorous 
mixing and/or reducing the volume in the headspace of the reactor.
    If there is no headspace (e.g., a collapsible reactor), equation 
App. C-6 is independent of V<INF>1</INF> and there are no restrictions 
on the liquid volume. If a membrane or bag is used as the collapsible-
volume reactor, it may be important to monitor for diffusion losses in 
the system. To determine if there are losses, the bag should be used 
without biomass and spiked with the compound(s) of interest. The 
concentration of the compound(s) in the reactor should be monitored over 
time. The data are analyzed as described above for the sealed reactor 
test.
    3. Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC). A QA/QC plan outlining 
the procedures used to determine the biodegradation rate constants shall 
be prepared and a copy maintained at the source. The plan should 
include, but may not be limited to:
    1. A description of the apparatus used (e.g., size, volume, method 
of supplying air or oxygen, mixing, and sampling procedures) including a 
simplified schematic drawing.
    2. A description of how biomass was sampled from the activated 
sludge unit.
    3. A description of how biomass was held prior to testing (age, 
etc.).
    4. A description of what conditions (DO, gas-liquid equilibrium, 
temperature, etc.) are important, what the target values are, how the 
factors were controlled, and how well they were controlled.
    5. A description of how the experiment was conducted, including 
preparation of solutions, dilution procedures, sampling procedures, 
monitoring of conditions, etc.
    6. A description of the analytical instrumentation used, how the 
instruments were calibrated, and a summary of the precision for that 
equipment.
    7. A description of the analytical procedures used. If appropriate, 
reference to an ASTM, EPA or other procedure may be used. Otherwise, 
describe how the procedure is done, what is done to measure precision, 
accuracy, recovery, etc., as appropriate.
    8. A description of how data are captured, recorded, and stored.
    9. A description of the equations used and their solutions, 
including a reference to any software used for calculations and/or 
curve-fitting.

                      IV. Calculation of F<INF>bio

    </INF>At this point, the individual f<INF>bios</INF> determined by 
the previously explained procedures must be summed to obtain the total 
F<INF>bio</INF>. To determine the F<INF>bio</INF> multiply each compound 
specific f<INF>bio</INF> by the compound-specific average mass flow rate 
of the organic compound in the wastewater stream (see regulation for 
instruction on calculation of average mass flow rate). Sum these 
products and divide by the total wastewater stream average mass flow 
rate of organic compounds.

[[Page 870]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.040

M=compound specific average mass flow rate of the organic compounds in 
          the wastewater (Mg/Yr)
n=number of organic compounds in the wastewater

    The F<INF>bio</INF> is then used in the applicable compliance 
equations in the regulation to determine if biodegradation may be used 
to comply with the treatment standard without covering and venting to an 
air pollution control device.

 Appendix D to Part 63--Alternative Validation Procedure for EPA Waste 
                         and Wastewater Methods

                            1. Applicability

    This procedure is to be applied exclusively to Environmental 
Protection Agency methods developed by the Office of Water and the 
Office of Solid Waste. Alternative methods developed by any other group 
or agency shall be validated according to the procedures in Sections 5.1 
and 5.3 of Test Method 301, 40 CFR Part 63, Appendix A. For the purposes 
of this appendix, ``waste'' means waste and wastewater.

                              2. Procedure

    This procedure shall be applied once for each waste matrix. Waste 
matrix in the context of this procedure refers to the target compound 
mixture in the waste as well as the formulation of the medium in which 
the target compounds are suspended. The owner or operator shall prepare 
a sampling plan. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling 
procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample 
collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity. The sample plan 
shall include procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the 
relevant compounds regulated in the applicable subpart. An example of an 
acceptable sampling plan would be one that incorporates similar sampling 
and sample handling requirements to those of Method 25D of 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A.

                       2.1. Sampling and Analysis

    2.1.1. For each waste matrix, collect twice the number of samples 
required by the applicable regulation. Designate and label half the 
sample vials the ``spiked'' sample set, and the other half the 
``unspiked'' sample set. Immediately before or immediately after 
sampling (immediately after in the context of this procedure means after 
placing the sample into the sample vial, but before the sample is 
capped, cooled, and shipped to the laboratory for analysis), inject, 
either individually or as a solution, all the target compounds into each 
spiked sample.
    2.1.2. The mass of each spiked compound shall be 40 to 60 percent of 
the mass expected to be present in the waste matrix. If the 
concentration of the target compounds in the waste are not known, the 
mass of each spiked compound shall be 40 to 60 percent of the limit 
allowed in the applicable regulation. Analyze both sets of samples 
(spiked and unspiked) with the chosen method.

                             3. Calculations

    For each pair of spiked and unspiked samples, determine the fraction 
of spiked compound recovered (R) using the following equations.

where:
m<INF>r</INF> = mass spiked compound measured (<greek-m> g).
m<INF>s</INF> = total mass of compound measured in spiked sample 
(<greek-m> g).
m<INF>u</INF> = total mass of compound measured in unspiked sample 
(<greek-m> g).
where:
S = theoretical mass of compound spiked into spiked sample (<greek-m> 
g).

                         3.1.  Method Evaluation

    In order for the chosen method to be acceptable for a compound, 
0.70<ls-thn-eq>R<ls-thn-eq>1.30 (R in this case is an average value of 
all the spiked and unspiked sample set R values). If the average R value 
does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the chosen method is 
not acceptable for that compound, and therefore another method shall be 
evaluated for acceptance (by repeating the procedures outlined above 
with another method).

                        3.2.  Records and Reports

    Report the average R value in the test report and correct all 
reported measurements made with the method with the calculated R value 
for that compound by using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JY96.048

                     3.3.  Optional Correction Step

    If the applicable regulation allows for correction of the mass of 
the compound in the waste by a published f<INF>m</INF> value, multiply 
the reported result calculated above with the appropriate f<INF>m</INF> 
value for that compound.
